Currently sitting on 21,960 out a targeted goal of...well, however big it gets. I'm finding my best method of writing is to have the key areas thought out (Beginning, middle, end, any major plot points) and beyond that just write any scenes I'd find interesting that fit in each section. Like, the 21,960 scenes all are either the intro or fit in before the climax.

It's a little modular, but gives me room in the editing to go "Ok, I think that this particular scene of interaction would probably work best here. So lets do a little tweaking of it's tone and the specifics so it does. Hm. If I put this framing device over here, it will make this point in the climax work better."

Nothing worth posting around here. I just noticed that a lot of people in my generation that I know seem to suffer from this...lostness? Like they're not really sure where they're going or what they want to do?

So I wanted to capture that in a teen coming of age story.

The only real rational parts of the story is that I do deal with how the brain processes information, patterns of behavior, some stuff about drugs, sexuality, relationships...

But it's more an INTJ character being an INTJ character rather than well crafted research on my part to make sure everything they say is accurate. I feel that way it's easy to look at it and go "Ok. I can easily see how the character went A - B - C+D = E, etc." and not have them be an author mouth piece.
