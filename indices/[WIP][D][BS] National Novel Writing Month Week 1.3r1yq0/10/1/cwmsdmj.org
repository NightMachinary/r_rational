No. Keep going. There's a lot of reasons why you should: pick the one you like best:

The vast majority of authors hate their work on re-reading it, if not while writing it. Neil Gaiman famously had this conversation with his publisher:

Neil: Bob, I'm so sorry, I need to drop out of this contract. I'll give you the advance back, but I just can't do it. Everything I'm producing is absolutely awful, and I can't seem to come up with anything decent.

Bob: /laughs/ Neil, every time we work together, we get about six weeks in and then you call me to say everything is awful and you need to give the advance back. And then you finish it, and it sells like hot cakes because everyone else in the world thinks it's great. Now get back to work.

Finishing your project gives you the chance to have it turn into something good. If it doesn't, maybe you can edit it into something good. If you can't, you will have the chance to learn something from the process by figuring out what you did wrong.

There's a saying: you have to write a million bad words before you write any good ones. It sounds trite, but my personal experience backs it up. So, congratulations -- if it ends up being crap, then you've gotten through some of your million bad words. If it turns out to be good, you're beating the curve.
