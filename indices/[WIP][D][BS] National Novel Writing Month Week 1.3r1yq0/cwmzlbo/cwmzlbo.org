Finished Day Three, my total word-count now at 6,067 words. Today's excerpt:

“Uh, Ewin, do you-”

“If you ask me why I don't want to risk my life, Manch, by the gods,” Ewin spit out, not even moving her eyes, “I will drag you down to the Dean's office myself and hand you over along with all the incriminating papers in this room and a personal recommendation that you be ground up and used as bait during the next Potential Protectorship Predator Survival Test, I swear it by my father's grave and my mother's ferociously delicious fulmut stew.”

“...I was going to ask if you knew how long it would take a single redthread to eat completely through an average person's forearm.” /Though honestly, the Dean seemed like he would be pretty okay with what I'm doing here. ‘The Society ranks have been getting too dusty' and all that./

/Also, that Protectorship test thing sounds like something I want to avoid./ Manch made a mental note to never volunteer for anything that sounded remotely like the name of that test, or, preferably, any test with the word ‘predator' in it.

“Oh!” said Ewin, brightening instantly. She tossed aside the paper she'd been reading and straightened up, smiling widely. “That's from the experiments of the late Professor Huami! A complete madman, always did his experiments on himself. Which is what ended up killing him, I suspect.”

“Wait, he amputated his own arm to see how long it would take a redthread to eat through it?” Manch frowned. “Are you trying to sneak one by me?”

Ewin laughed, rocking backward and then slamming her hand down on the table as her chair almost tipped completely over. “What, still worried I'll try to convince you about something like, oh I don't know, the Dean having been a weever before he ran into a spectrid out on the Expanse and it,” she stopped to muffle more laughter, “it took his /exoskeleton/ away!?” She rocked back again, keeping a hand on the table to steady herself, and guffawed, dramatically, loud enough to hurt Manch's ears and ego both.

“I was /six years old!/” he yelled back. “Plenty of weird things have been known to happen to those the spectrids get a hold of but don't suck completely dry! How was I supposed to know this particular thing wasn't possible?”

Ewin was cackling know, drawing it out, surely, no one could possibly find the memory /that/ funny after having brought it up periodically for the past nine straight years.
