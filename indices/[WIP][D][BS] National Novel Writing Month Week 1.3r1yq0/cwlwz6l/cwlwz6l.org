I'm doing a continuation of /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ this year. Because of some editing work on last year's NaNo, I'm basically in catch-up mode if I want to hit my goal of 100K words; Day 1 was spent getting back up to 50K, so I'm basically starting a day behind. I'm a little leery of the fact that I've got three and a half magic systems going, but they're all vital to the plot, so I guess I'm just forging on ahead. On the plus side, I think I have all of my principal characters pretty firmly set in my head.
