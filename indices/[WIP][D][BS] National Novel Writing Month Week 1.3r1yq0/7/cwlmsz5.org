Accidentally commented with my alt account yesterday. Awkward.

Excerpt from Day Two:

His breath caught in his throat as he finally saw what had taken everyone else's away.

The three suton were of moderate size for their race, each clothed in flowing, silk robes over what looked like a small mountain of wrapped cloth. Their hairless heads - including an eerie lack of eyelashes and eyebrows - were perched atop those small mountains, peering calmly around, a distinct lack of interest written across their fleshy features. The long poles they always carried were grasped loosely in wide, soft hands, resting horizontally across the backs of their steeds.

And they were all painted in wide swathes with a nauseating amount of deep, crimson blood.

A few strong smells mixed in the air, most of them a result of the strong spices the suton carried with them. There was riversalt, some strong peppery odor, and a hint of the bitter culo seed.

And the overpowering, metallic scent of a nauseating amount of deep, crimson blood.

It hit Manch instantly as he stepped to the front of the crowd, clogging the air around him, reaching down his nasal passages and stuffing a grimy cloth all the way down and into his throat. “Wait, don-” he tried to cough out.

Rimmer poked his head out right next to Manch as the rest of his sentence choked on the stench of stale life.

“Guh,” said Rimmer.

/What in the twelve hells?/ It wasn't that he'd never seen blood before, because he certainly had - though never quite this much of it, to be sure. He, and the entire city, was intimately familiar with the smell of death, with death itself. It was as much a part of life as anything else, especially life itself. It just wasn't usually this... /They really are dead in the eyes/, Manch thought, looking between the three remaining sutons - he'd put two and two together as soon as he'd seen the blood, and now knew why there were two riderless fulpir. /And dead in the heart/, he finished, completing the quote. The suton weren't doing anything to indicate their awareness as to the fact that they were currently drenched from scalp to saddle in the blood of their recently deceased brethren. /Recently devoured, by the looks of it. What could have killed them that violently? A pit-tree?/

Manch fought to swallow the grimy rag of bloodsoaked air blocking his throat, and took a shaky breath. It had taken him by surprise, that was all. /I can't react like this if I want to make it out there./ He eyed the newly-dyed silk robes. /At least, not if I don't want to end up with my blood recoloring someone else's wardrobe./

As he stared with morbid curiosity at the thick drops of blood falling languidly from the bottom hem of their robes, the suton at the head of the group caught his eye. Or rather, its eyes caught him. They were grey, or maybe just white and filmy without reflecting much light, and they were as empty as a corpse set upon by a swarm of bloodworms. The suton was looking at him, he was sure - it was even looking where his eyes were, technically. It just wasn't actually meeting his eye. It didn't look like it /could/ meet his eye. Where were its pupils? Could its eye even focus on something as specific as Manch's own?

It broke eye contact - or whatever it was that had been - and Manch felt an involuntary shudder pass through him. He ground his teeth with sudden conviction. /If they pass the evaluation and I don't, there's going to be one more fulpir without a rider./
