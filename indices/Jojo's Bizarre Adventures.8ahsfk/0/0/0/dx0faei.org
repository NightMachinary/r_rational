That actually sounds pretty close to /actual/ Dio. He's both very clever and very stupid. In the ending of Stardust Crusaders, he's one of the few villains who ever shows having /learned/ from his previous experiences. He doesn't just go cackling happy that he defeated his enemy, oh, no. He's suspicious. He's careful. He /knows/ that guy is probably still alive and tries to make sure he positively, absolutely, without a doubt kills him. The extents Jotaro has to go to avoid being defeated are ridiculous, realistically he should have just died.

But then of course Dio is also completely unable to get over his own world-taking ambitions and just /lay low/. Or simply not act like a raging psychopath, which is what gets him into all this trouble to begin with. Well, in Stardust Crusaders he also poses a threat to the protagonist's mother life because of reasons out of his own control, but at least "should we kill this good person to save this other good person?" would be a moral dilemma. "Should we kill this murderous, psychopathic vampire with ESP powers who wants to take over the world and is potentially an extinction level threat to save this other good person?" really isn't.
