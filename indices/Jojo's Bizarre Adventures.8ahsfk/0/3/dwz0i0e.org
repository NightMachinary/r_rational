The masquerade's a pretty simple thing to solve. With it, stone masks are cool looking but ultimately common artifacts that are unlikely to ever be activated outside of a freak coincidence. Without it, they become easily activated superweapons everyone knows about. Also, the vampires are a secret for this very reason, as the Hamon clan would be a big organization that researches biology of both vampires and hamon users, as well as hiding the existence of vampires , instead of a couple of monks in a mountain.
