I would actually suggest giving traits like that to other characters to give them more things that define them. Jotaro is based on Clint Eastwood's stoic badass characters, and the times we see him out think his enemies it's by manipulating them. The thing I want improved is the group dynamic.

Joseph was done a grave injustice in SC by almost never outsmarting people, Avdol was supposed to be the new Zeppeli but never had as much rapport with the others, and I still have no idea what Kakyoin's personality was. Polanaraff at least had consistent tragic and comedic moments.
