For the vampires, like I wrote below, the Hamon clan can be given a boost in competency and resources. I think though, all stone masks would have to be destroyed at one point before SDC, otherwise their absence in relation to the plot would raise too many questions.

Also, given the invisibility of stands, as well as their power, they could have been spotted before but given religious context as a explanation ( Demonic possession, witches, saints). I mean, they're literally impossible to explain with science.
