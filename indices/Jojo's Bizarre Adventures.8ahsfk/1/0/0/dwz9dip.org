I don't think any of them need to be changed, just extrapolated upon from their defining traits. The author admits to being forgetful and making up the plot as he goes along, so there are a lot of inconsistencies and character arcs are mostly Fridge Logic. Writing a rational fic would require making the characters more consistent and filling in blanks.

Jonathan is the most consistent as the chivalrous gentleman who learns how to fight evil, Joseph goes from a annoying street swindler to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero][guile hero]] in BT but becomes the new Speedwagon in SC, and Jotaro is supposed to be a delinquent with a heart of gold but all he does is punch evil.
