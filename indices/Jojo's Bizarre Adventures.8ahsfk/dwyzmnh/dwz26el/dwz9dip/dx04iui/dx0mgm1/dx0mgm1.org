They never once explain it in the show. All we know is that he has a lot of money, a lot of Stand users at his command, and that he is training for the fight with the heroes before he does anything else. I think it's fair to assume he was out to take over the world, which was his plan in Phantom Blood.

I think you could rationalize his organization as being a conspiracy infiltrating power centers so Dio can rule the world from the shadows and do as he pleases. His flesh buds can indoctrinate people, we see he has new vampire minions, and he likes terrifying people into submission with his other powers.

That expanding sphere of influence would explain how he found all those Stand users to work for him. The Speedwagon Foundation could have more hamon users who can fight Dio's minions, they were researching the supernatural in BT, and even in SC we see them acting as a spy agency to help the heroes. However, Stands are invisible to most people.
