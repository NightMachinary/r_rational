I think this could work too. All the character motivations and abilities are there, with a plot that follows a clear internal logic. It's all the inconsistencies, weird character decisions, and obsession with one-on-one fights that keeps the story from being rational.

I think the way to go for a fic like this would be to keep all the madcap ideas and hammy characters, but throw out the plot's structure. All the important stuff still happens and leads to the same conclusion, but the way it gets there is different and suits the medium better.

I think a good example of this might be the Aladdin fic The Rules or Wishing. The characters have (mostly) the same personalities and motives, they're just more critical thinkers so the conflict happened in a completely different way. However, I don't see the point in writing a JoJo fic that isn't still over the top and melodramatic.

Phantom Blood can go down pretty much the same way given how it's a more personal conflict. At his strongest Dio is basically a cult leader, but can only be killed by people who know how to fight vampires and only a handful were in the country. Maybe change the climax to be in London so Speedwagon's background is relevant and Jack the Ripper isn't out of place.

Battle Tendency‘s villains don't have a much larger scale, Straizo and the Pillarmen were both traveling the world in order to find what they wanted and weren't afraid of anyone. The pre-volcano climax was the heroes idea since they already had the maguffin, which let them lay a trap for with the Speedwagon Foundation.

Personally, I would change Stardust Crusaders so that they‘re continuously chasing leads on Dio and unraveling the organization he's created instead of just fighting one minion after another on their way to his house. Making Dio a crime lord on the move justifies the trip better and gives the Speedwagon Foundation something useful to do.

I have not yet watched Diamond is Unbreakable.
