On Dio, I think I agree. I'm just worried Dio with less... absurd plans might lose his charm.

Also agree fully on Stroheim, although I'm not sure what rational!Speedwagon looks like.

Honestly, I'm okay with the masks and red stone being handwaved. I just keep coming back to why vampires/pillarmen haven't taken over the world. I mean, one vampire can create like a thousand zombies in a few days, and the Pillarmen are just... better.

As for Stands... as you say, they're just superpowers, BUT:

- They're way too easy to obtain.
- The way stand-users are drawn to each other all but guarantees conspicuous fighting.

I fail to see how they stay hidden.

Still, I agree now--SC and DiU are definitely doable.
