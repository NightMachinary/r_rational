I think rational!Dio can work, he's just a sadistic psychopath who takes pleasure in making people feel pain and powerlessness. It's his plans to kill the heroes that don't make much sense given how smart he's supposed to be.

The biggest hurdle I've had in making a rational headcannon for JoJo are vampires and the Pillarmen. The masks and red stone are never really explained, but if they were the plot wouldn't have that many holes.

My biggest problem I have with Stroheim is that there is no reason for him to be a Nazi once he starts helping the heroes, so I'd say he was rebuilt by the Speedwagon Foundation and all his troops after that were from the SF.

I don't think Stands /need/ to be explained any more than the mutants from X-Men, but what does need explaining is how and why Dio's return gives Stands to Jonathan's descendents.
