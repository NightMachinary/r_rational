  Dio's charm is his hammy, over-the-top evil. I'm not sure how rational!Dio keeps that.
#+end_quote

Rational!Dio is infuriatingly irrational and constantly wrong all the time, but is so /good/ at that one thing he is doing (e.g., social manipulations, goldberg-machine plans, combat, survival), and has a Stand so powerful, he constantly wins /anyway/, staying around to annoy the audience with his bad epistemology, confused beliefs, and warped reasoning. Oh, and he is also totally convinced all of his atrocities are morally justified! I'd read that.

Or something along these lines, anyway. /^{^{^{I've}}} ^{^{^{never}}} ^{^{^{read/watched}}} ^{^{^{JoJo.}}} ^{^{Don't}} ^{^{mind}} ^{^{me.}}/
