Hmm...

- Hamon/ripple could definitely be standardized. You'd need to justify the masquerade.
- Ditto for why vampires/pillarmen haven't taken over the world.
- Dio's charm is his hammy, over-the-top evil. I'm not sure how rational!Dio keeps that.
- IIRC, Jonathan is pretty sane.
- Joseph's schemes would have MASSIVE potential.
- Mecha!Stroheim and the SS need to be dialed back to actual WW2 tech.

Alright, I think these are all doable--minus rational!Dio--so I can see the case for phantom blood and battle tendency.

Now, stands? My gut says no. Maybe you could get a rational!DiU.
