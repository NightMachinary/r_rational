Enders game is totally cool but also something to bring your critical gaze to, but I would strongly recommend this authors other Terry Pratchett fanfics. She's got a couple of straight good omen and discworld fics that really capture Terry Pratchetts voice, and a really good harry potter DEATH crossover.

The other stuff doesn't really have a rational bent, but I am a big fan.
