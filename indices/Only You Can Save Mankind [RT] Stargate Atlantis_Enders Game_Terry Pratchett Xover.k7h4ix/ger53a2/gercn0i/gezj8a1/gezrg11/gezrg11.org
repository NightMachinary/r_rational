I was initially worried. The viewpoint character seemed awful. Then, it revealed that it was /Rodney/ and everything fell into place. I was slightly disappointed that he didn't get too much screentime with Sam, as one of Rodney's funniest traits is that Sam is better than him at everything. But still, this was good stuff.

In defense of Woosley, he is a bureaucrat, and a damn good one. The i's will be dotted, the t's will be crossed, rules will be followed. Whatever you put him in charge of will be made predictable. Some idiot decided to have him investigate the Stargate program, which is just the entirely wrong organization for it. Everyone from the general to the janitor is flying by the seat of their pants. The countdown on the onsite nuke starts every other month, because an invisible and intangible critter made it through the gate and is mind-controlling all the doors to eat people. Then gets called of because someone from engineering stapled a battery from a lost civilization that no one understands to a can open from a /different/ lost civilization that no one understands, and that can match dimensional frequencies so that the P-90s can actually shoot it.
