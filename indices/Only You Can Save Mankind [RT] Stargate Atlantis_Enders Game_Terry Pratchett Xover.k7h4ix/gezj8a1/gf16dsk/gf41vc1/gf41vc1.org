I guess I shouldn't say it would be easy to divest when I haven't watched the supposed source material. It would have been more accurate to say that it didn't seem like a fanfiction in the sense that absolutely nothing required prior knowledge of source material to make sense. Except maybe the replicator/robots thing, which kind of came out of left field.
