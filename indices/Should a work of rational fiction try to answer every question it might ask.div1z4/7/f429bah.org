  When Lost ended in 2010, it left a lot of fans really upset because they felt like their questions hadn't been adequately answered.

Heh, that was hilarious to me. I just knew there were nerds out there trying to piece everything together as though it were some kind of brilliant puzzle, while it was apparent they were just making stuff up all along. Not even a scrap of a plan or an outline was put into those scripts - it was all about expensive razzle dazzle padded out with cheap low cost off-island sequences.

I had a hearty guffaw when the last episode dropped and it was like "it was Jesus all along".

There's a talk on youtube where Abrams talks about his "mystery box" trick that he uses way too much. It was a perfect metaphor for the entire affair - a man standing on a stage behind an empty box with nothing inside of it.

It's exploitative of human psychology, a bit like how gacha games prey on addiction. Because literally anything could be in the box since it's completely arbitrary, it's very much like a slot machine to the viewer.

Prison Break, where the protagonist was always five seconds away from obliteration every single commercial break, is a slightly different sort of cheap repetitive trick to keep the viewer's attention. I don't honestly think enrapturing these base urges of our lizard brains with these kinds of techniques is in-line with rational fiction.
