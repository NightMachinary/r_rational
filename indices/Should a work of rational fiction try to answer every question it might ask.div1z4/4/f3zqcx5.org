What bothers /me/ in a story is when the plot or rules aren't explained well enough for someone to write a fanfic about it. Mainly this is because I like inserting my own (halfway competent) characters into stories along with empowering the bad guys, then shaking the whole thing to see what comes out. Now, that's purely a matter of personal preference, but I think it makes a decent rule of thumb. /Write in such a way that someone else could pick up where you left off/. Not all mysteries need to be solved; some can be gracefully avoided or simply left as part of the background; they exist as a sign that real life isn't always neat and tidy and some things just stay uncertain.

Okay in ratfic:

- A character develops a new power based on foundations laid earlier in the story; (Worm second triggers, training montages, "leveling up", artifact acquisition)
- Superpowers or magic exist; this is taken for granted; their /rules/ are explained but their /origin/ is not; (Shadows of the Limelight; Mistborn)
- Superpowers or magic exist; their rules are not fully explained, but it is clear that /rules exist/ and /no established rules are violated without explanation/; (Lord of the Rings and Star Wars actually do this decently well)
- A villain saves or spares the hero in a way consistent with that villain's character as previously established;
- A noun (name, place, nation, culture, species, artifact, etc.) or a fact tangential to the plot is mentioned in passing, but never elaborated upon. (Worldbuilding! Yay!)

Not Okay in ratfic:

- A character gains a new power in a manner convenient to the plot, but its source is poorly explained;
- Superpowers or magic exist, and are given an explanation which sounds science-y but is actually bogus; (beware of over-explaining)
- Superpowers or magic exist, but their rules are vague or fail to be internally consistent;
- A villain saves or spares the hero in a way inconsistent with that villain's character, motivations, goals, and/or intelligence;
- A noun /whose existence is central to the plot,/ or a fact which sounds like it could massively change things, is introduced but never developed.

Another good rule of thumb, and possibly a more universal one, is: /Being genre-savvy should not allow me to predict your plot/. If I can predict how a conflict will resolve based on the tropes that led up to it, or if I can predict outcomes based on /what would be the most dramatic/, then your story has irrational gaps.

I want to hold up Ra as an example of a ratfic that does a good job of explaining its magic without running into "this is obviously fake science." But I had serious problems parsing how the heck it justified nonsense like Tanako's World, so that kind of falls flat. But that's a rant for another day.
