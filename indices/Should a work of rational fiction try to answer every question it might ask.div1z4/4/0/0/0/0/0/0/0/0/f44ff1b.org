Well I said I didn't want to do this but whatever. I'm not the one misusing the terms, the world is. The definition you were using was invented in the 30's and since then it's been misused to the point where it means something different as well. MacGuffin has been "misused" by script writers, journalists, directors, and the public at large and not that use is no longer "misuse". When you use a word that means a lot of things, don't get annoyed when people don't understand the way you're using it. Language changes, sometimes in ways you consider to be stupid.

Also, I find it funny that you latched on to the point I said was unimportant and not the main point, which is that objects that won't impact the plot have their entire development done instantly. As I said, the development for a diamond is that it's a diamond. Therefore it doesn't matter what the word MacGuffin means as your argument is invalid either way.
