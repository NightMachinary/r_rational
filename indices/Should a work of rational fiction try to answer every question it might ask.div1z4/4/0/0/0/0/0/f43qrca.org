Again, that's what a MacGuffin *is*. Something whose properties are not important except that it is very valuable, possibly because it is powerful. If you care about the nature of that power, it's not a MacGuffin. If you are told the nature of the power, it might still be a MacGuffin, if what it can be used to do is never relevant in the timeline of the story.

Your examples are things that weren't MacGuffins. Not all plot devices are MacGuffins.
