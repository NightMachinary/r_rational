Sure I could have worded it better, but the examples should have made it clear. I meant MacGuffins that people only want because they are valuable and have monetary value. Those types are just a cooler/genre appropriate version of a big diamond. If the MacGuffin can be replaced with a big diamond, there's no need to develop it because it's all the development we need.

If it can't be replaced by a big diamond, it means it has some special properties that make it valuable. To demonstrate these properties, they need to be developed.
