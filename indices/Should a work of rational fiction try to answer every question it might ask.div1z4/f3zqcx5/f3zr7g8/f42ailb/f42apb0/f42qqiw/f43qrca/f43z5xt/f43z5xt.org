Alright, but in that strict definition of MacGuffins I'm fairly sure that most of the things commonly referred to as MacGuffins don't qualify. In fact, I'm pretty sure that doesn't even conflict with the rule we're talking about. If the thing doesn't ever do anything important, then that's all the development that's needed. The development for a diamond is that it's a diamond.

I do have to say that the definition of MacGuffin you're using might be technically correct, in practice it doesn't really apply. I'd say there are more things that are known as MacGuffins that don't fit your definition than the other way around. This is getting way into the weeds though and I don't really feel like getting into an argument about textbook definitions vs actual use.
