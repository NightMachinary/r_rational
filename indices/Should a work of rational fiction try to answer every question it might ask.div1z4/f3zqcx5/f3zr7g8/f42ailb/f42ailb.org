I feel like the only MacGuffins this comes into conflict with are the kinds that are just a valuable thing people want. It's not important to the story what the briefcase in Pulp Fiction is because it's just a valuable thing. Any other MacGuffin I can think of is either developed somewhat or is such a lazy contrivance that it's incompatible with ratfics.

A ratfic needs to be about people pursuing their goals, it the plot is just about stopping random hellmouths or something like that, it's going to be really hard to make it a ratfic. The Motherboxes from the Justice League movie come to mind. They are completely unexplained and undeveloped and are the perfect example of a MacGuffin not following the stated rule. They are also widely criticised for being incredibly lazy and I would be shocked to find them in a supposed ratfic.
