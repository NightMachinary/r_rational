I'd say the necessary standards are:

- Know the rules that your universe works on, and stick to them. But never explicitly tell the readers what these rules are.
- Raise questions. Answer some of them explicitly. Try to leave enough clues that the rest of the questions that you raise have answers that can be deduced, or at least guessed at.
- Include the most important questions in the list of those that get answered /explicitly/.
- Exception: If the entire point of the story is to raise a specific question about the real world, then it is best to provide no answer to that question; failing that, a dozen potential answers with no sign of which is correct. This encourages the reader to find his own answer to the question, or at least to /think/ about it.

This, I think, covers all the necessary points. Most questions that the readers will ask are the ones you raise; those are answered (explicitly or implicitly) (unless the question is the point, in which case the last thing you want is to give the reader an answer). Readers who ask questions beyond that will mostly be questioning the rules of your world; but by sticking to them, you automatically implicitly answer those. The last category of questions that users could ask is the ones that you simply never thought of... and those are impossible for you to directly answer in any case.
