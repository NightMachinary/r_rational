This is not just a valid answer, but the only correct answer. The term I would use to describe this is “the promise the author made to the reader”. E.g when Naruto shouts “I'm gonna be the greatest ninja ever and prove myself to everyone!” he's not just saying that as a character - that's the author telling the reader what kind of story they can expect. If the rest of the story is then about flower arranging, the reader will feel betrayed.

It's the exact same thing with rational fiction. The author has to communicate which mysteries are in scope, and which are out of scope, and then deliver on that promise. Metropolitan man never promised a scientific justification for superman's abilities, and we never got one, but it did promise a rational confrontation between the characters, and it did that very well.

HPMOR violated this rule somewhat by introducing concepts and encouraging the reader to speculate on them, like the mirror of Erised, and then just dropping them. That's the kind of thing that can leave the audience feeling unsatisfied.
