I am definitely enjoying Pyrebound; well done with that.

As for your worm comment, it has been a little while since we had a "Is Worm Ratfic?" discussion. I would argue that it's at least rational-adjacent, and with the amount of new info coming out of Ward it might very well be rational. But that's besides my point. Anyway, one of the reason there are so many Sleeper theories is because WB basically has a reasonably consistent answer for EVERYTHING in his universe. We probably see something like 5-10% of his actual worldbuilding, and not in a "hints around the corner" kind of a way. Sleeper is one of the only mysteries that he has actively withheld (along with "Parian's True Power"), so naturally there are a bazillion theories as people try to figure it out.
