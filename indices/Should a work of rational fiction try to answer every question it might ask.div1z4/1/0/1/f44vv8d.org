What star wars did was they established an expectation of what level of explanation is available, and then went against it by explaining things with a conspiracy theory level of plausibility. They botched things so badly that they shouldn't get to be an example.

Then again "the Kessel run is actually timed in distance" is a more popular explanation than "the scam artist was lying but the guy on the run was too desperate to call him on it" so maybe that's just how the fans like to roll.
