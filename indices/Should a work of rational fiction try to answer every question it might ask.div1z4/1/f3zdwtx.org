Okay, replied earlier but Reddit ate it. Trying again: Also a serial writer. My experience is that I can't always predict what questions my readers will ask, or how they will infer rules from context. There's a certain amount of Shakespeare-in-the-bush going on, which I enjoy. Pyrebound is plainly dependent on the rules being slowly unfolded, so there's an appetite there for things not being all set out at the start; you just can't contradict established rules, or obviously tease a question and never answer it.

I don't think I could ever answer /every/ question readers have, especially not the ones that are secondary to the storyline. Part of building a good world is leaving a lot of stuff peripheral, with little hints of more to discover around the corner. As someone once put it to me, a good author leaves blank space on the map for readers to fill in with their imagination. There's a terrible and tedious finality about having everything nailed down.
