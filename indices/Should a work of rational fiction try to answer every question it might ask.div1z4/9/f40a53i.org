I'd feel that minor questions would be OK to leave hanging in the interests of keeping the story moving and on-track. As long as the author's thought about them and could answer the inevitable questions later (ratfic fans absolutely loving to question every corner of a universe), and the answers wouldn't blow a hole in the plot or the story's society or character backstories.
