I agree with both of you: calling attention to a question and making it a big deal draws in the reader, and then it's kind of a dick move to just /not/ pay off that setup. I think I alluded to this a little bit in the OP post, when I mentioned how Lost made itself about the mysteries but then didn't follow through on all of them.

You're right about HPMOR. There were more of these, weren't there? I seem to recall the Atlantis plot line being abandoned, and Harry's motivation to determine the "root" of magic (maybe this is kinda the same plot line) also dropped off as he got distracted by other things.

There was also most definitely a scene where Professor Quirrell pledged to teach students how to cast the Killing Curse, and that never happened.
