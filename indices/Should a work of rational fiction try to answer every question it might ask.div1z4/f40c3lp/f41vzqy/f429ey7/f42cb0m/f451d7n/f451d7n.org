I think that the drawback of Harry Potter in a rational world is that the Hogwarts of jkrs book one is so hugely unexplored that it takes books and books to uncover and understand it all.

That Big Yud was able to cover decently the mirror of erised and the final dungeon of the sorcerers stone is a great win for him.

Taken as a complete work, i think it did everything it promised: quirrell had a plan, and carried it out. A boyish rat 11year old was able to pull a rabbit out of a hat as the prophecy foretold.

The other unanswered questions weren't promised by the characters who drove the story. It was essentially the masterwork of quirrell narrated by Harry.

Tl;dr the story was focussed on harry being manipulated, and other plot elements outside of that weren't necessarily promised to the reader.
