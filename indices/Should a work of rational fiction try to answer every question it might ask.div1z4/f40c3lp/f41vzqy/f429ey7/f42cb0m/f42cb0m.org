Yup. It's especially dickish when you essentially hold the viewer hostage through sunk cost, constantly telling them "you can't stop now when you're so close!" and then just extending the story season after season without resolution. In fact, I remember the writers of Lost explicitly promising that "the ending is not X", and then of course the ending was X anyway.

You're right that there are better examples from HPMOR, but I'm not sure I would count Atlantis as one of them. That's just something Harry mentioned offhand - it was never really a promise. Quirrel not teaching the Killing Curse was also a pretty minor thing. But it's true that Harry never really tried to figure out the nature of magic, never really formed a Bayesian conspiracy, never had a true rationalist duel with Voldemort, never did anything to bring back Hermione, and generally didn't display the kind of agency that was promised.

Instead, the ending was more like a regular Harry Potter novel: It was very well written in terms of building up tension, and it had stuff like the mirror that gave off a true sense of wonder and magic, but none of it really led anywhere and ultimately the villain mostly defeated himself. And of course there was Dumbledore's hall of prophesy which also had very little to do with the mysteries that had been set up beforehand.

It's realistic, of course, that sometimes problems and solutions come out of nowhere in a way that feels unsatisfactory, but in terms of writing it definitely violates some important rules.
