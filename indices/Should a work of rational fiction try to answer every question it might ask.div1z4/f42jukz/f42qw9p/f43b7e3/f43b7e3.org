He solved death, starvation and pretty much every world problem. i.e fix everything.

For him to discover the laws of magic it'd be X extra effort and story length just to hit 1 checklist that we can be sure he'll do anyway without us needing to watch it happen.. It'd probably just be equations and mathematical formulas anyway like physics, watching the mc do imaginary physics like equations with a team of scientist may be fun, but it would also have detracted from the story being told and message being conveyed.

From the ending you can assume he did do it in some way or another, imho in this case we don't need to be shown it explicitly to be satisfied.
