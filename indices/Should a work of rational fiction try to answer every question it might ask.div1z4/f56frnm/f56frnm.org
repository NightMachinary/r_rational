Late to the discussion but hope this adds something worthwhile. As a reader, I can only take your story seriously if I think it takes itself seriously. Now, not every story has to be taken seriously (e.g. HPMOR seems more interested in having the ideas taken seriously) but I suspect most ratfic authors want their readers to be immersed in their worlds and invested in the fates of their characters. As such, I want to know that you're not just making stuff up as you go along willy-nilly, that you're taking your stuff seriously. To have an answer for all the questions big and small gives me the impression that you have at least considered these questions. Whether those answers are good ones... well that is always subjective.
