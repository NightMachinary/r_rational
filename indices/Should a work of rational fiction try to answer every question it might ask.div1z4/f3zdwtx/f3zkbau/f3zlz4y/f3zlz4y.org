Thanks! Straying a bit farther afield, even as a teenager it struck me that Tolkien was wise to never describe Sauron. He showed his eye, he had Pippin react to the sight of him, but Sauron has no clear form in the books. I always thought that, even if he'd come up with something utterly ghastly, it would still be less impressive than whatever terror we imagined. The giant form in the Peter Jackson movies isn't nearly so ominous to me.
