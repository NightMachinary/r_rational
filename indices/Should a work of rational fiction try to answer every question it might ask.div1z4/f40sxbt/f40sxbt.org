In 1954, JRR Tolkien wrote “As a story, I think it is good that there should be a lot of things unexplained (especially if an explanation actually exists); and I have perhaps from this point of view erred in trying to explain too much, and give too much past history... And even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas, as there always are.”
