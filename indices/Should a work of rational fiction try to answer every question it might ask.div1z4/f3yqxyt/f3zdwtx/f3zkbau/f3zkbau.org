I actually saw your other reply before it got eaten - I'm glad you retyped it so that I have a chance to respond. :)

I think that this is a really good thing to consider. This line especially stuck out to me:

#+begin_quote
  There's a terrible and tedious finality about having everything nailed down.
#+end_quote

It reminds me of when Star Wars explained how The Force works. That's a situation that would have benefitted from having /less/ explanation, and it wasn't even a matter of leaving a question unanswered - it was just fine the way it was before, as a not-even-question.

Good thoughts!
