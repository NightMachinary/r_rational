Two big differences there IMO:

1. The Kessel Run is irrelevant. Han mentions it once in a throwaway comment and it's never brought up again, even to describe what it is more clearly. It was later elaborated on in the EU books, but within the movies we have only Han's boast and a presumable connection to the "spice mines of Kessel" Threepio freaks out about at the start of the first film. The Force, on the other hand, is central to the plot of every single movie in one way or another.
2. The average person, until informed otherwise, would find nothing odd about Han's claim, because parsecs are a somewhat obscure term (much more so than "light years"). It sounds about right, if you don't know astronomy. Whereas anyone with typical public knowledge is going to say something like, "Wait, how are these little germ things so powerful? If we get the Force from them, where do they get it from? This doesn't actually explain anything, it just makes a cool mysterious thing seem lame."
