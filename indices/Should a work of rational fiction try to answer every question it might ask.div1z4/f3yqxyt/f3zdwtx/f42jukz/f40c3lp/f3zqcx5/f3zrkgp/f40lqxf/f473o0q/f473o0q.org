As a counter-point Damon Lindelof went on to create The Leftovers and it is one of my favourite TV shows and it doesn't solve one single mystery and has a satisfying conclusion. Maybe this is because the show is upfront that the mystery won't be solved. In season 2 the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyirVgs1yc][intro]] literaly says so.

I'd say that if you are experienced enough you can put together a satisfying (but not exceptional) (movie) series with empty mystery boxes at the beginning. It doesn't help, though, if the guy making the next movie opens them all and shows that they are empty. As JJ Abrams says in the talk, in mainstream media it is mostly about the characters and as long as you don't annoy the audience too much with inconsistencies and other SOD breaking stuff they will ignore them via the power of SOD and fill in blanks better than you could while you can focus on what is important for the story.

Obviously having a plan is better then having no plan. But the plan is going to be changed anyway. Maybe an actress leaves the project. Another actress is well liked/good and you planned to kill her character and now it would be better for the franchise to not do that, etc.
