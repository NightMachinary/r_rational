It's one thing to ask "Is it possible to answer every question?" and "Should we try to answer every question?"

For the first one it's impossible. It's like with a child asking "Why?" over and over to every explanation. "Why is the sky green in Algalax?" Because of the different gasous contents of the athmosphere." "Why?" "Partly pollution, partly because the planet is made from different major elements compared to Earth."

Already we have to diverge the questioning and talk about the industry of Algalax and it's geology. The writer can only repeat this why game so far, so I propose that you just accept that you're human and write what you like.

If you wrote a book to talk about alien biology and want to handwave how the FTL travel works, feel free! Thousands of other writers have already answered that question, I don't need to read the same rehashed shit for ten pages. (If you have a unique take on FTL though, you do you.)

Regarding "Should we try to answer every question?" I have some personal advice: When you're conflicted between choosing 2 different explanations for a thing, that are both equally valid and interesting - just leave it open-ended!

Remember to leave sufficient clues for the reader though. Trust me, sometimes the reader is smarter than you and you can create some interesting debates this way, if you give both sides sufficient ammunition. You can even show these debates in-universe.

"Algalax has always had a green sky." "Nonsense, we need to make our industry more environmental friendly." Wow, now you have literal green house politics as background worldbuilding AND you can throw some political satire in there.
