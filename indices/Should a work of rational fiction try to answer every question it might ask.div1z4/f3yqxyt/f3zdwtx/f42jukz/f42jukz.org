You should answer every question of plot about what actually happened inside the story, and every mystery the reader was invited to solve; anything else is optional; this is a universal rule and not just a ratfic one.

Be warier than I was about what the reader may think they were invited to solve. HJPEV's brief thoughts about a Source of Magic paying attention to a genetic marker were intended to illustrate why that theory was implausible, and designate the whole problem as hard enough not to have a promised solution; instead many readers thought it was setting up a Why Magic? plotline.
