I'm not sure that was really because of that one scene. I think it was mostly that the central concept of the story was "Harry is raised by scientists and applies his knowledge to the wizarding world". It makes sense for the reader to assume that the plot would then be driven by that central concept. Plot resolutions like Dumbledore's hall of prophesy, or Voldemort's bias towards death which caused him to essentially defeat himself, or Harry leaving Azkaban to Hermione then feel less satisfactory.

If there was one line that was to blame though, I'd say it was this one:

  HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm was. He's read Godel, Escher, Bach and Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases and volume one of The Feynman Lectures on Physics. And despite what everyone who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. *He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.*

Like I said in another post, that's the equivalent line of Naruto going "I am going to become the Hokage!" The moment a main character makes a pronouncement like that, readers treat it as a promise by the author. If you're not going to go that route, it needs to be then undercut by the character having an epiphany later on and deciding to change their goals. But Harry in HPMOR never changes his goal from "discover the laws of magic and fix everything", which makes it feel like the ending did not deliver on the story's original promise.

(The rest of what you said was 100% right, btw)
