My intention with these comment was to make you happier, and improve your satisfaction with the story and reality as is, not to prove or say you're wrong and that you shouldn't feel how you currently do.

The way you feel is fair and your arguments are reasonable. But in this case I don't think you being right, or getting what you wanted would mean a positive, or optimal outcome for the largest percentage of people possible.

Does that mean the stories ending was optimal? No but it was probably close enough, and it's likely the best we'll get.
