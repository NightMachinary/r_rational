It is a fact that it was not satisfactory to some readers - whether or not you think everyone *should* be satisfied doesn't really matter. A resolution can be 100% sensible and logical and rational and still not work on an emotional level. In this sense and in this sense only, the reader is always right.

Or as Neil Gaiman put it:

  “Remember: when people tell you something's wrong or doesn't work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.”
