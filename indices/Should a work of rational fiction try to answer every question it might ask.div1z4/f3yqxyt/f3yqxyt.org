I write a web serial, so I've done some thinking about this stuff. (The Fifth Defiance, if I'm doing blatant self promoting! Like comment subscribe pledge my patr...)

I do think that rat works tend to have less tolerance for Deus Ex Machina, yeah? Like, if light speed ramming works then your space combat should have looked very dif from the start.

But at the same time I don't think that means you need to be constantly justifying your twists against a reader in your mind who is confused. It's more like...write in such a way that you don't confuse that imaginary reader? Like, hrrm, rather than confusing them and then clarifying I think the rat author tries to set the rules down from the start in such a way that the readers don't get confused.

To be sure, if you do need a twist out of left field, then it is probably a good idea to have someone explain what is going on. The readers won't stay invested in a story if the rules are Calvinball (or, I guess, some of them won't.), but if you can tell that you are gonna need some exposition on a beat you can usually slot in some prep work a chapter or two ahead.

So yeah, long story short, tie up your loose ends if they are big enough to bother your model of your readers, but better than that is not creating loose ends if you can avoid it.

P P S, obviously the iron rule of internet fiction, "you probably aren't getting paid, so write what you want" overrides this.
