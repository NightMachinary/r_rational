So. [[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/12/15/scientists-reverse-ageing-mammals-predict-human-trials-within/][This]] happened this week.

I am going to remain pessimistic and assume that 10 years until human trials is wild optimism on the part of the scientists, but even so, that means /most/ (?) of the people on this sub should live to see age-reversal be a thing.

And it might not even take an FAI.
