Ground (Dirt) + CO2 -> Trees -> Paper -> Ground (Dirt)

Ground (Oil) -> Petroleum -> CO2

Encouraging people to bury paper does increase the level of carbon in the ground. However, the bottleneck in the cycle that's causing it to run down isn't the rate at which paper is buried, it's the rate at which trees scrub carbon dioxide. Thus, sequestering carbon back into where we bring out coal and oil won't affect CO2 in the air, unless the global effort to produce mass amounts of potting paper would increase the amount of trees, at which point why not just increase trees normally.
