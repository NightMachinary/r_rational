If paper recycling were to be reduced greatly, and the paper buried, then we would have a constant stream of carbon sequestration. This would definitely also lead to a greater forestry products industry, which, in turn, would mean a larger footprint of harvested rapid-growth trees. Paper is one of the most heavily recycled products. Stop recycling it, and the forestry products industry will take off.

The initial statement that paper sequestration might be 'the answer' to human carbon emissions is probably a bit of wishful thinking near term, but in the long term, as we move more and more to non-carbon-based energy for the power grid, paper carbon sequestration would be more and more effective in offsetting carbon emission.

The best thing about it is that it is a partial solution that doesn't require new technologies, and encourages multiple industries. Additionally, if wood/paper becomes more socially acceptable, there will be fewer plastic bags made, less plastic furniture, etc.
