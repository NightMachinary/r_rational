So I've been combing through a ton of cognitive psychology / behavioral economics for a school research project.

I've found several good papers on trying to make better plans, teaching the proto-skills that CFAR's turned into their own techniques like Murphyjitsu.

Similar to the Rationality 101 writeup, I'll be working on a Planning 101 writeup focusing exclusively on fighting the planning fallacy (which is in-line w/ my research).

Unsure if anyone's interested in just browsing through the actual research papers themselves, but here's a link of my resources, if anyone wants to check out papers related to planning:
