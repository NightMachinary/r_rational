In popular parlance [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin][(link)]]:

#+begin_quote
  The Munchkin is the Tabletop RPG player who plays the game to win at any cost, even if that isn't the point of the game. Perhaps the most ridiculed Player Archetype of all time, this player is rarely interested in the story behind the game. Indeed, his characters are little more than extensions of his own personality or whatever personality would give him the most bonuses.

In how it's often used on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], though, Munchkinning refers to seeing beyond the rules as they are societally constructed to see the rules as they are truly--it's not a purely negative description. A Munchkin finds edge cases or areas where the rules provide unique advantages not previously thought of. "Low Hanging Fruit" that people didn't even know where fruit. But also, a certain sense of /ruthlessness/ when it comes to exploiting these things.

For example, let's say you have a character construction system that lets you take Flaws, and the more Flaws you take, the more bonus points you get to spend elsewhere. So, you take a bunch of Flaws, like maybe you take Poor Vision, and also Color-Blind, but you use the bonus points from those to gain Mage's Eye which gives you perfect vision anyways, and you still have points left over to put elsewhere. Or maybe you age your character up to age 35, when everyone gets +1 to each mental stat and -1 to each physical stat. This seems balanced, except your mental stats are all high--15, 16, 17--and it would cost like, 10 points to increase them. However, your physical stats are all low-- 8, 9, 10-- and it costs 1 point to increase them. So aging to age 35 gives you valuable stats that are hard to buy and frees up points to offset the cost.

At the end of the day, John is playing Tuvo the Elf Ranger, Alan is playing Alaric the Halfing Rogue, Peter is playing Thoromund the Dwarf Fighter, and you're playing Marvolo the Magnificent, the Murky-Eyed Poor Vision Color-Blind mage-sight 61-year-old (he'll turn 62 and get more stat bonuses and maluses after he learns Polymorph) aquatic (for bonus swim checks, of course; this template has no downside so why not take it) human wizard 1 / sorcerer 1 / double-arcane thaumaturge (The rules don't prevent this).... etc

In stories, it often means someone who grabs low-hanging fruit etc in this style.
