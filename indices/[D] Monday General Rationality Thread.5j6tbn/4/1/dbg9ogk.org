I often experience it and it can degenerate into cynicism if I'm reading too much Evo Psych or economics recently. Concentration meditation also causes this kind of dispassionate analyzing that verges on cynicism/depression, which is countered well by compassion/metta meditation. Metta meditation makes me a lot...Softer/warmer and less focused on possible reasons for why people do things.

Being analytical can be helpful for many things, and can prevent people from taking advantage of you by manipulating, but it can make social life a little gray or depressing.

Wish you the best :)
