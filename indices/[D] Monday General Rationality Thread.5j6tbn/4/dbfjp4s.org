My mom (who I will say I do not have a good relationship with) recently told me I am too analytical in my life. This is something I was already aware of: my brain refuses to turn off and is constantly trying to find the underlying patterns or reasoning behind anything. As a brief example, I once hooked up with someone I had feelings for since we were both barely into our teens---and even as we kissed, half of my brain was trying to figure out what this meant for our relationship, whether this was a good course of action, how to proceed past this, et cetera.

I will clarify that I am quite charming and charismatic in day-to-day life, and don't come off as any kind of strawman Vulcan or Sherlock-wannabe. (She also thinks I'm arrogant and prideful, but I think that an accurate appraisal of one's strengths is as important as understanding one's limits and weaknesses. I also don't go around bandying this information wily-nily. But I digress.)

My question to you all is, have you experienced this inability to not analyse? Do you think it's negatively impacted you?
