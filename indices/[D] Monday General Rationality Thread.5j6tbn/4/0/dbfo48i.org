Have confidence in your ability, but make that confidence silent. It makes you look like a braggart or a ponce when you ask for help about your own intelligence. You probably analyze too much, but like hell anyone needs to /know/ that. When in doubt, proceed according to a precommitted social code rather than snap judgement, even if it seems like a good idea at the time. You can update when you have sources and time to think.

It might be a handicap to think to deeply on things - primarily because you might take issue with things that are ordinary or mundane. Avoid paranoia, pretend stress doesn't exist. Remember, your intention with every action is to /cut/, not to think about cutting, or to make preparations for the act of cutting. I think rationality has helped me in this regard, but for you it might be something else.

Most of all, don't worry so much about what other people think that you stoop to asking for help or similar scenarios on the internet. This counts as "bandying this information around willy-nilly". I could have just as easily called you a fag and walked away - or otherwise posted this to [[/r/iamverysmart]] for internet points. Committing your worries to word means that they are real, if not physically, then in the pain that they will bring when others spring on your vulnerability.

These are the rules I follow. I imagine if you've put as much thought into it as I have, you follow them as well.
