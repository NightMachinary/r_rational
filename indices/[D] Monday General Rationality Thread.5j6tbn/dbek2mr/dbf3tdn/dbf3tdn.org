My favorite was switching from one large bin in the kitchen to two smaller ones. When one gets filled, someone takes it out. We have to take out the trash twice as often /but/ we also always have half as much trash in the kitchen. We barely ever fill one up and start on the second one, because as soon as it gets filled up, someone takes it out, replaces the bag and we start using that bin again.

The second one is really for emergency use.
