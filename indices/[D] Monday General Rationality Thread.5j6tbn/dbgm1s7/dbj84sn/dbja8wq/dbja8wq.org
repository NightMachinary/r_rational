It would not lower carbon emissions, but it would sequester carbon in the same place where we're getting most of the extra carbon from right now. Take oil and coal out, put paper in. In fact, you could use played out coal mines as paper dumps, and literally put carbon back where we got it from.

This only really makes sense if we get a significant chunk of our power from non-carbon sources.
