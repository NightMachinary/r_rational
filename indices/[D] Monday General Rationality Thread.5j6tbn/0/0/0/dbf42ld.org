Yep, we've got a fortnightly cleaner, best decision ever. $80 for about three hours. I earn $45/ph (my husband's on $180/ph but as a lecturer most of his work is unpaid, and the hours aren't good...) so it's such an efficient use of time, and we can focus on the tidying rather than wiping our counters down and mopping and sweeping.

A friend's kid would probably be an ever better idea, but with this, every second Wednesday I come home from work and everything's so nice (ooo, speaking of which, that's /tomorrow/!!!!)
