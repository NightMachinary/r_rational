That sounds like an excellent plan (and good virtue signalling there!)

When I had a partner the most rational thing we ever did was agree we could each do the tasks we hated least, which turned out not to be the traditionally gendered tasks, but I didn't mind taking bins out half as much as he did so that was cool.

Nowadays I find the most rational thing is to actually pay a friend's kid to do some cleaning. This means that unlike most cleaners I feel comfortable doing tidying and stuff while he's around and we can chat about science and gaming while we do it.
