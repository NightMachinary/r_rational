My husband is obsessed with SSC's Moloch and he's proudly telling everyone of how we defeated him this week.

Like most households, our rubbish bins often end up overflowing before someone finally gives in and empties them. And it's a standard Moloch thing: we all benefit from having the bin emptied earlier, but nobody wants to be the one to do it because it requires effort and someone else can do it.

The big reason we don't like emptying the bin is because the wheelie bin outside is now kept out the back (so that way I can scoop our dog's poops directly into it), which means you have to go out the back garden, put shoes on, risk stepping in a poop that is recent enough not to have been scooped, etc.

Added to that our recycling bin is pretty small and often full of empty almond milk cartons (<--- gratuitous virtue signalling).

So, we thought of an idea to fix it. The problem was that the wheelie bin is out the back, and we need the wheelie bin out the back because otherwise scooping the dog poops is almost impossible, since I'd have to transport each individual poop through the gate into the wheelie bin, and it's much easier to have the wheelie bin in the back yard and transport it to the front once a week for rubbish collection.

So, we decided to buy a new bin to have out the back, so that way both bins were out the front. We ended up buying a bin that was bigger than our recycling bin and now our old recycling bin is out the back collecting dog poop while we have a much higher volume in our new recycling bin (plus it has a proper lid so the aforementioned dog can't get into it).

I am not sure if it's going to work, we've only had it since Saturday, but my husband is /so proud of himself/ for it, and yesterday when the bin was only about 80% full he went and emptied it and proudly proclaimed he is doing his part in the fight against Moloch.

So, my take-away from this is that if nothing else, at least my husband now feels /good/ about taking the bin out.

Discussion question: where have you folks applied rationality to the general domains of housekeeping?
