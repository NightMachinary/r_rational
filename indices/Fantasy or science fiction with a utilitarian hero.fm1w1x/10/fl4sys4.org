1) Ozymandias in Watchmen, there's strong arguments both for and against his actions. In the very beginning, Rorshach talks about how Truman deploying the A-bomb saved more people than it killed, which sets up Ozymandias's actions. Are three million people worth it to save billions both now and in the future? And will his noble lie even lead to a lasting peace?

2) Deus Ex and Fallout both can be played with a utilitarian worldview that leads to multiple endings. In New Vegas I support the NCR because it leads to the greatest good in both the short term and the long term by establishing a functioning democracy.
