You got out while the getting was good. /Naked Empire/ felt disgusting and horrified me on a moral level; reading it felt like I imagine reading Nazi propaganda would feel like. It felt like Richard was turning into exactly the kind of heartless fanatic that he was warned against becoming in the first book, except that the author was /cheering on/ the transformation. (And the strawman version of the "there is no such thing as objective knowledge" philosophical position that the Bandakarians hold was absurd and felt like the author was insulting my intelligence by describing it. No sane person would believe that, because we can't be completely certain of anything and our senses are fallible, learning anything at all about the world is impossible.)
