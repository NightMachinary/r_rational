It started out so promisingly, too; some of the life lessons and rationality tips in the first two books actually helped me in real life, but I think after his first two books were bestsellers he got Protection from Editors. I also suspect it's not a coincidence that /Naked Empire/ came out not too long after the 9/11 attacks.
