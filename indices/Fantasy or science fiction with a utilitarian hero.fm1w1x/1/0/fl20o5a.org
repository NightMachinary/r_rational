I feel like Practical Guide to Evil ignores the fact that hell literally exists in that universe. Catherine seems to only care about this life.

Also, Metropolitan Man seems like it might be more about a possible failure state. Lex was so concerned about the dangers of Superman that he didn't worry about what else might be out there, and now he'll likely be stuck fighting Brainiac without help from someone with superpowers.
