Not really.

IIRC part of hell was literally invaded and taken over. So Hell isn't some undefeatable force as long as you have the right Story backing you up. Also they've acknowledged that different Heaven and Hells exists, same goes for the Fae. It basically boils down to what you/your people believe. Also apparently the Gnomes are more powerful than Heaven/Hell since their threat of Exterminatus keeps them from developing certain tech.
