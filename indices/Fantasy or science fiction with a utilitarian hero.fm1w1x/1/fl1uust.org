If you are fine with webfiction i can recommend practical guide to evil, its really long though. If you like superman i can recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitian Man]] which focuses on Lex Luthers attempts to kill superman and his motivations for doing so, which are hardcore utilitarian.
