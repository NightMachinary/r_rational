I hope it isn't tacky to self rec. I write The Fifth Defiance. (link: [[https://thefifthdefiance.com/2015/11/02/introduction/]])

It's a story about a world where there is a super person reigning as dictator, and all attempts to straightforwardly rise up against her regime have failed. The protags are collaborators, attempting to work from within the system to bring it down.

The necessity or lack thereof of utilitarian tradeoffs is pretty central to the various dilemmas that they face. I dunno, I think I can at least give myself points for 'doesn't demonize it'.

It's pretty long too, so if you turn out to be able to get some enjoyment out of it, you should probably be good for a few days.
