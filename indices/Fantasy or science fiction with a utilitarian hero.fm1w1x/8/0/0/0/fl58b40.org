I enjoyed the first few books, and read a bunch more on pure inertia. But the frequent just-in-time out of nowhere deus ex moments with the soft and inconsistent magic system and the cyclic way every book ends with the big problem solved and the next book has a new problem lined up out of nowhere just turned me off. I stopped at the book where he brought down an evil socialist nightmare by /working hard/.
