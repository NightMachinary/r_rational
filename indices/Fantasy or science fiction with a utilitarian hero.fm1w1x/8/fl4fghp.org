Well, in /Wizard's First Rule/ by Terry Goodkind, the heroes have a discussion in which they say that their mission to keep the MacGuffin away from the Evil Overlord is more important than any of them, so they agree that if one of them gets captured and held hostage, they won't give up the MacGuffin no matter what.

I found the first two books in the Sword of Truth series to be very good, but it starts taking a serious nosedive in quality starting with the third book, eventually descending into Ayn Rand worshipping madness. The worst part is the disgusting eighth book, /Naked Empire/, which explicitly reverses some of the morality discussed in previous books. In the first book, it's discussed how killing is always a tragedy, because even the life of an enemy has value, and the most dangerous thing in the world is someone utterly convinced of the rightness of their own cause, because they'll be capable of anything. In the eighth book, the moral is that some things really are as simple as black and white, that some things really are just Evil and that there is nothing bad whatsoever about killing people that support Evil. :/
