IMO Emiya Kiritsugu is a horror example of the opposite. He is a strawman utilitarian. The plot goes out of its way to dishonestly stack the odds against his philosophy and make him look wrong and pave the way for his stupid, plot-armoured son to look heroic. Of all the tepid philosophy I've seen in Nasu Kinoko's works, this bit is the worst.

Thanks, though. :)
