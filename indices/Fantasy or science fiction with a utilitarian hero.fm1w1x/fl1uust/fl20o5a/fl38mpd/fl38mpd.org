To be fair though, the Hells we know of aren't really designated afterlifes, at least, none that we've seen. They seem more like dimensional homes for devils and demons rather than any kind of karmic punishment. Whatever the afterlife for Villains is, even Cat hasn't gotten to see it.

Edit: As a matter of fact, considering that Kairos got applause from the Gods Below when he died seems to indicate that the Gods Below might actually have rewards for their best adherents just like Above. Pragmatically speaking, you've got to motivate loyalty somehow.
