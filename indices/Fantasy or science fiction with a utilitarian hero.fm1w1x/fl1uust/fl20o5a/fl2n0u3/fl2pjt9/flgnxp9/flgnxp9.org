There's a major misconception here. The afterlife is not “The Hells.” The Hells are parallel universes filled with raining blood and psychopathic monsters called devils. The afterlife is a complete unknown. There are tons of beliefs about what it is, and people have come back from it with their souls intact, but their memories are always wiped. WoG is that they differ based on beliefs, but we don't actually know if being an awful person sees you punished by the Gods Above or rewarded by the Gods Below.
