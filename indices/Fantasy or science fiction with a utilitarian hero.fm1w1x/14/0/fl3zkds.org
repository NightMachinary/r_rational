My biggest problem with Worm ended up being a practical one. I had a hard time keeping all the names, nicknames and powers straight. I made little cheat sheets for myself to avoid spoilers but it didn't help much. I'd be in situations where the author /clearly/ was doing something clever or subtle and I'd be at a complete loss because I had no clue who or what was implied in the text.

"A slithering glint of gun metal flashed past the window and Taylor had a sinking sensation that an old foe was upon her..."

Meanwhile I'm scrambling to think back 460 chapters to that one fight she had with a metal snake... Or was it a tinker with a tentacle weapon...
