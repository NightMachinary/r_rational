Juniper from Worth The Candle isn't strictly utilitarian, but he has certainly gone pretty far in the whole ends justify the means thing. He has sent innocent people to the hells in the hopes that eventually he'll be powerful enough to destroy them.

The Tau from Warhammer 40k come to mind, but I don't know enough about the lore to say how much they're demonized. Though they must be at least a little, given that they even exist in that universe.
