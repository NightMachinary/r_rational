L.E. Modesitt Jr. has heroes that generally have a utilitarian bent, frequently choosing to use magic or advanced technology to cause large scale destruction in order to make sure that defeated enemies can never pose a threat again. This is taken to an extreme in /The Ethos Effect/ in which the hero observes that a civilization is about to become an Evil Empire and destroys it (using a device that causes what appears to be a massive natural disaster) /before/ it can become a threat to everyone else.
