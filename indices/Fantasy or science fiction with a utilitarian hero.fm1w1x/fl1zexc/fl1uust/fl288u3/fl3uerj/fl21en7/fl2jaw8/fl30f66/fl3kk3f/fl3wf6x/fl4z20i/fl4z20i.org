Yeah, having read book 2 also (and agonizingly waiting for book 3 this year), it doesn't have much magic. I'd describe it as â€˜hard fantasy' --- and the author relates concepts to real historical stuff in a great way; in other words, there's a conscious interest in making things seem very real and grounded. But hey, where else do you get an exciting protagonist who's a freaking accountant (there's more to Baru than that, don't worry lol)
