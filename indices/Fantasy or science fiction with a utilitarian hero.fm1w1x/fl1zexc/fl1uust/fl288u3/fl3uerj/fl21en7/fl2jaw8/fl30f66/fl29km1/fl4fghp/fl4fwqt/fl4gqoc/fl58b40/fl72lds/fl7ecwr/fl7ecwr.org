  Incidentally, the "each book has a new problem that's solved by the end" structure was a deliberate attempt by Goodkind to let each book stand on its own as much as possible. That may or may not have been a good decision.

It think I was more annoyed with how (to my eye) the new problem wasn't foreshadowed, it just popped up fully formed out of nowhere, and often were things that they should have seen signs of in the previous books.

I enjoyed the books, parts very much, just not enough (in the end) to pick up the next book.
