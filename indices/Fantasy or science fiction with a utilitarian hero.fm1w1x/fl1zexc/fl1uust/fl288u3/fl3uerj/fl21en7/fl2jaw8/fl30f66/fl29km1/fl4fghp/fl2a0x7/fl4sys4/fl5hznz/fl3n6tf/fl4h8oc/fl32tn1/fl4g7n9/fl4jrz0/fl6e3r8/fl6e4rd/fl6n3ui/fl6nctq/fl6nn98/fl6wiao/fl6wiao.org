You'll want the story "Madness has its place" in Man-Kzin wars III. We see characters updating thoroughly and then act on it - but we see this only implicated not well explained. I consider Niven a quintessential rational author

. People update on info like no-ones buisness, like in the linked story. Foes often include superhuman intelligent beings that can out-predict you. So the characters start throwing coins to randomize their actions.
