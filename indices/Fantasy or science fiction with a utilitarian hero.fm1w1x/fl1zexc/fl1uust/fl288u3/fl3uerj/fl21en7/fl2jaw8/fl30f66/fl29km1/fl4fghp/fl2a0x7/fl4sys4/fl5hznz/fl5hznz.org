Prisoners of Power by brothers Strugatsky. It's hard to give a pitch without spoiling too much, but the plot boils down to this. Maxim, a posthuman from a communist utopia crash-lands on a post nuclear war planet, and the conditions are not great, not terrible. The protag is Superman lite. No flight or laser eyes, but impervious to radiation and vastly superior to the natives in every metric. From there Max, decidedly not an utilitarian, works to fix the local dystopia. And fails.

Oh, and how come Dune isn't on your list.
