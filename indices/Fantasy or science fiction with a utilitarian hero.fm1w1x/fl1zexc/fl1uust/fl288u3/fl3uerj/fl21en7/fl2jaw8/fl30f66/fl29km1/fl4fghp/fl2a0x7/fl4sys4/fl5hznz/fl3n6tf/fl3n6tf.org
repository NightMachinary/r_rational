The protagonist in *Practical Guide to Evil*, as well as her mentor are both kind of utilitarian "villains".

Catherine is nominally on the side of Evil, but in practice often seems good-er than the heroes on the side of Good.

For utilitarianism, there was recently a plot point revolving around reacting to a highly infectious, deadly disease by either praying to the Gods Above for salvation, vs containment followed by killing people who tried to escape quarantine. Acting on faith vs taking pragmatic but ruthless action.
