  The plot goes out of its way to dishonestly stack the odds against his philosophy and make him look wrong and pave the way for his stupid, plot-armoured son to look heroic.

To be fair it's also pretty clear that Shiro's heroism is na√Øve and he eventually comes to regret his ideals. I think that story does a pretty good job of not picking one philosophy over others, but rather exploring the positives and negatives of several different worldviews without trying to claim one is better than others. You don't get competing worldviews with one coming out on top, you get worldviews struggling against their own internal inconsistencies.
