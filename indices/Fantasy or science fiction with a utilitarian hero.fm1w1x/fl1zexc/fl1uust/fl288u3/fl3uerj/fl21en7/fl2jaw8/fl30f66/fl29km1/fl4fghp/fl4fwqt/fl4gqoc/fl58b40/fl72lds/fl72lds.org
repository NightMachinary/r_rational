I actually enjoyed that one, but I had been exposed to Ayn Rand before, quickly saw where it was going and decided to appreciate it as a member of the Author Tract genre rather than as Robert Jordan-esque epic fantasy. (I didn't enjoy the first book of George RR Martin's /A Song of Ice and Fire/ because I had the wrong expectations; I was expecting a story about Jon Snow and the invasion of the White Walkers, but it's been five books and the invasion has barely even begun. I liked the rest of the books a lot more once I stopped expecting Winter to actually arrive.)

Incidentally, the "each book has a new problem that's solved by the end" structure was a deliberate attempt by Goodkind to let each book stand on its own as much as possible. That may or may not have been a good decision.
