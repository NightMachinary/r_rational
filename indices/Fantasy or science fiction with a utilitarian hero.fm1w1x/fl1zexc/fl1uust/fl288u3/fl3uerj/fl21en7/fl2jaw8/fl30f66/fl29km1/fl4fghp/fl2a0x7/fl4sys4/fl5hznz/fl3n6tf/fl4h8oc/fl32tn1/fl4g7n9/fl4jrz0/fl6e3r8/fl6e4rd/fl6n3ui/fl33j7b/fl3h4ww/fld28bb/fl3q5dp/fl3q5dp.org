That is a very tricky question.

Fundamentally the setting is one of a high fantasy post-apocalyptic medieval/reneaissance earth. Basically, in the future human science was used to erode the natural laws, allowing the human mind to have direct effect on reality i.e. they made magic work. Then the apocalypse happened and society was destroyed.

Basically, the earth is a functioning, mostly feudal, post-apocalyptic grimdark place rife with magic and strange creatures (high magic). It is, in my opinion, one of the better built settings.
