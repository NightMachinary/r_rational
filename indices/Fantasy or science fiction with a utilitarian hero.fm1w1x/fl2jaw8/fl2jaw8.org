Not an answer to your question, but I have to disagree with Reinhardt as a utilitarian hero, especially compared to characters like Oberstein. Reinhardt was no less focused on his image and being seen as a hero than he was on actually unifying the galaxy. See the Westerland incident for a perfect example of what I mean.
