Many (or just some) of the fics in the reddit wiki have utilitarianism as a thing, so check those out if you hadn't already.

A pretty good one not on the list is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun][Isekai Speedrun]], where the world is post-apocalyptic and the characters morally dark. Pretty interesting worldbuilding as well, I think.
