Yep. There's a lot of worldbuilding discussion woven in and around the central plot; Juniper is basically an experienced and creative DM who is dropped into a world that seems to be at least partially based on several of the worlds he made up over the years (which in turn drew heavily on classic DnD manuals).

Except that he's not the first Earth human to have ended up there, and the deeper he goes, the more everything seems to point to the Lost King...

It does keep things relatively fresh by having the game interface elements be only one part of the overall story, and while they start off relatively straightforward (and are actively used as Chekov's Guns a few times), they fade into the background a little as the story proper develops more complexity. It's also one of the few Gamer isekais where the protagonist gains companions which are, in at least one case, notably /smarter/ than him and actively give suggestions about how to explore and munchkin the interface (and push it towards particular goals).

I should add that the character of Amaryllis (the aforementioned companion) is probably even /more/ utilitarian than Juniper. She has a very political background in a fairly red-in-tooth-and-claw noble society, and has absolutely no compunction about killing people in cold blood if that would be the most useful thing to do.
