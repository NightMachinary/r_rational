Baru Cormorant in the Masquerade series. The Masquerade are a colonial expansionist empire that economically and culturally invade Baru's island home, and she decides to work from within to help her family, her people. It has legitimately interesting application of economics in the story too! And has a gut wrenching emotional core.
