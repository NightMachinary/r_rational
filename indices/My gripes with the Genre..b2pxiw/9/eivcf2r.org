Even though I love the concept of rational fiction, I feel like a lot of stories take the rational premise too far (as other posters have already pointed out) and end up with a hyper-rational, almost autistic MC that ends up turning some people away.

It's especially glaring if the character is a 12 yo kid, in which case the behavior seems even more out of place - HPMOR and Origin of Species are good examples.

I read HPMOR ~5 years ago and then finished it once it was completed and while I liked it then, when I tried to reread it recently; I couldn't. Harry just seemed obnoxious and unrealistic.

I'd like to talk about Origin of Species as well. Don't get me wrong, the premise is great, but the execution is lacking imo. And the core problem for me are the protagonists, because I enjoyed reading the interludes alot more than the regular chapters (the Mewtwo one was one of the best chapters I've ever read, so kudos for that).\\
I just cant empathise with 12 yo kids acting like (hyper-rational) adults.

To demonstrate my point, I'd like to mention Game of Champions (one of my all time favorites), a Pokemon fanfic with a similar premise that I know a lot of readers here liked.

It has a lot of the same premises - realistic Pokemon world with a TR conspiracy, Red has some special abilities...

The one key difference however, is in the characters and the tone of writing.\\
First of all, Red is older (16 IIRC) which makes his behavior more believable, but other than that he is also a different person. If TOoS Red is a */scientist/*, GoC Red is a */warrior/*. It might just be me, but I enjoy reading about warriors way more than I do about scientists - as I can be a scientist IRL, but being a warrior isnt very realistic, which makes it more enjoyable to read about.

But being a warrior doesn't make you dumb! You can be a rational character even if you are a warrior!\\
This is a key point IMO; rationality doesnt need to be applied solely to science and problems of a scientific nature; you can use the principles of rationality to solve a warrior's problems as well.

And GoC Blue really does capture the spirit of the Pokemon Red and Blue rival. Always a step ahead, arguably even more talented than the MC and very confident - something that a lot of rational protagonists aren't. In fact, there's a lot of second guessing, hyper-analysis and the worst - overjustification of behavior.\\
Reading about a character apologising profusely for a minor (usually social) misstep, or even worse, trying to explain why he was justified in doing it can become annoying after a while. Juniper from WtC tends to do this last thing a lot.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love WtC - it's the story I'm most excited to see updated atm and Juniper is a much better MC than HPMOR Harry for example, but I feel like he could do without the apologies for social missteps - even though I know that's part of his character.

To get back to the difference between warrior characters and scientist characters, there's a kind of mastery that warrior characters exude. A sense of competence and readiness for a particular challenge that is missing from most rational fiction. But mostly they are just better at invoking emotions in readers.

Humans are emotional creatures. Emotions themselves are supposed to guide our actions in ways that usually benefit us. It's good, even rational to be angry when someone insults you. You can use that anger to see that your next course of action should be to retaliate; whereas rationality can help you find the best way to retaliate.\\
Emotions and rationality can coexist, so sacrifing one in favor of the other is suboptimal, both irl and in stories.
