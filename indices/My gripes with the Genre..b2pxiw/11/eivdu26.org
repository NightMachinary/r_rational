not all characters need growth, but for children it should be mandatory. the thing is, those are not stories about children. they are settings about children. the story itself is a very different thing.

hpmor annoys me, because while it starts good... it then stops being interesting to force the plot in a rush to conclusion. the premise was good, but the author seemed to get bored with it halfway through. the problem is basically pacing. if it were spread out across more in-setting years, it would have worked better.
