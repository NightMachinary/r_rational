Part of it is time pressure; it takes time to write things, and most serial authors are on a schedule, so if you realize after a scene is written that it could have been cut down by 2K words and still make the same point, or that it's not doing enough to advance the plot ... well, you've got a Patreon set up, and you've promised two 5K chapters a week, and if you cut 2K words from the chapter like you probably should, then you have to make that up, which might not be feasible. (Obviously the pressure is less if there's no monetary incentive, but you still get people saying "that's it?" if you put out a short chapter or take a long time.)

Part of it is length pressure. There are a lot of readers who will express strong preference for longer stories. I've heard people say that they won't even start on a story until it's over 100K words. Particularly for readers of web fiction, there are a lot of people who lean on the quantity side of the quantity/quality divide.

And as far as editing things that have already been published goes, most people who have already read it won't read the edits, and it causes confusion in the community because the canon is changing, and it's really only in service to new readers, and you can't really get as good of feedback on whether the changes are actually worthwhile or not.
