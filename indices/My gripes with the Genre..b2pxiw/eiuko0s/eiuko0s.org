IIUC, rational fiction is consistent world building etc,. rationalist fiction is fiction that tries to educate the reader, or as you've said, contains lectures for rationality thinking and such.

I am not very well read in rational/ist fiction in general, as i have just got around to it. (not even MoL) I also share the PREFERENCE towards rational storytelling, as that was my main gripe with normal stories/tropes; inconsistencies.

I will make no recommendations as I see you have already received a bunch.

+Also, I am already the smartest person in the universe and I make 0 logical fallacies, so I dont need the education anyways.+
