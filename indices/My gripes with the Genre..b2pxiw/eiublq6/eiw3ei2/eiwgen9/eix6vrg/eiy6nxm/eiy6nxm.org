The issue isn't that he knew his best friend was into her and then started dating her. He knew it would hurt Arthur and rather than try to talk to him about it before things escalated he decided it would be better to keep it a secret. Sometimes people do things that's hurtful to other people even though that's not your intent and that's part of life, what makes Joon an asshole is continuing to do it and lying about it. That's a betrayal.
