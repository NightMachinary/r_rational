Many points here are valid but i dont think you can steal a crush. Arthur had no special right to Tiff and he should have approached her if he wanted to go out with her. Tiff can make her own choices.

I also dont think you can blame the depressed person for trying to kill themselves. Depression is called a mental illness for a reason and most people who try to kill themselves certainly are not doing it out some type of malice. Often they think their relatives and friends would fare better with out them.
