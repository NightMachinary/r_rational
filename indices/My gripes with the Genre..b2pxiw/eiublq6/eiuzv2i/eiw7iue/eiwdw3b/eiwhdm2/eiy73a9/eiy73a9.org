If you really think about it, is is really better if he's sorry about it? Sure he's been getting better, but let's narrow it down to his character in the first parts of the story. If you hurt people, feel bad about it, and then continue to hurt people...how is that better than not caring about it in the current situation?

A person who is so consumed by their toxic behaviour that they can't stop hurting people despite what they actually want might be more sympathetic, but it doesn't make them less of a "bad person" just because they mope about hurting people.
