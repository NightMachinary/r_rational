That part is kind of important.

Anyway, Joon, as described by himself and the people around him, was a real ass for quite some time and he's ashamed about how he's been treating people for some time. This behaviour then continues and through time and conscious effort he becomes less of an ass. You seem to have this idea in your head that a person is either a complete evil asshole or that they're not a bad person at all, that's not how people work.
