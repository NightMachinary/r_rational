I felt your frustrations when I first started exploring the genre. Both MoR and OoS feel like they are more a way to feel superior and "rational" than actually trying to tell a good story.

For me, a good rational story is interested in the storytelling first and the rationality second.

I would recommend Worth the Candle, A Practical Guide to Evil, and Delphic.
