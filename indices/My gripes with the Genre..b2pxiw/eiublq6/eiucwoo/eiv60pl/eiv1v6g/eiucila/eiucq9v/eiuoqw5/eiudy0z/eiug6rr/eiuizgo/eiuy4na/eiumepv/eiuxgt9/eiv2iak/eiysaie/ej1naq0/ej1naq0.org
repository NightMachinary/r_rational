Sherlock Holmes is not rational. Eliezer Yudkowsky has explicitly called him out as an example of a fake intelligent character. From [[http://web.archive.org/web/20171118180518/http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/]["Rationalist Fiction"]]:

  Now of course there are a great many characters who claim to be using logic. The whole genre of mystery stories with seemingly logical detectives, starting from Sherlock Holmes, would stand in witness of that.

  But when you look at what Sherlock Holmes does - you can't go out and do it at home. Sherlock Holmes is not /really/ operating by any sort of reproducible method. He is operating by magically finding the right clues and carrying out magically correct complicated chains of deduction. Maybe it's just me, but it seems to me that reading Sherlock Holmes does not inspire you to go and do likewise. Holmes is a mutant superhero. And even if you did try to imitate him, it would never work in real life.

The Azkaban arc is different. Harry takes down Auror Bahry with the sort of sucker punch that totally works in real life (look up videos of cops being shot by criminals during traffic stops). He figures out how to hide Bellatrix from the Dementors with the Cloak in the same way Eliezer did while writing the chapter.

  I am vain enough to tell you that I probably didn't use nearly as much sneaky literary artifice to generate Methods of Rationality as you might think. I did not, in fact, have Dumbledore say in Ch. 17 that the Cloak of Invisibility can hide from the gaze of Death in order to set up Azkaban. I wrote that line in Ch. 17 to reference canon; and then, while, I was writing the Azkaban arc, I realized that I had entirely by accident given Harry the resource he would need to hide Black even after Dumbledore's Patronus started tracking Harry's Patronus and Harry had to dispel his Patronus Charm. But I do admit that if I hadn't come up with a clever way for Harry to handle that problem, then Dumbledore would not have been able to track Harry's Patronus.

See? Harry gets the Cloak from Dumbledore when he arrives at Hogwarts, just like in canon, and the Cloak has the power to hide you from the gaze of Death, again just like in canon. Then Eliezer decided that the way Dementors were portrayed in canon fit better as death than depression, so he changed them into that, which Harry discovered in the previous arc. /Then/ Harry needs to hide someone from Dementors, and Harry realizes that he can do so by using the Cloak. It makes perfect sense.

The other noteworthy feat Harry accomplishes in Azakab is his escape. He cuts the wall using partial transfiguration, then rides out on a transfigured rocket. Again, this makes total sense; cutting the wall is completely within the realm of what we have seen partial transfiguration do, and the rocket works because wizards are ignorant of muggle science (just like in canon!) so they have no defense against it.

  My first idea for how Harry would escape Azkaban was that he would cut through the walls using partial Transfiguration, and then escape on an ordinary broomstick. But other wizards could cut through steel walls with ordinary magic, and if it were that easy to escape Azkaban, somebody would have done it before. The Aurors would have broomsticks of their own, I realized. As for riding out on a fast racing broomstick that could outrun the Aurors, as an ordinary thriller novel might try---no, bull, Amelia Bones would think of that, and make sure her own people had sufficiently good broomsticks to block a Firebolt from escaping. Harry has to think of an escape plan containing some element that Amelia Bones would not be expecting, would /not/ have prepared for, even when she's trying to be clever.
