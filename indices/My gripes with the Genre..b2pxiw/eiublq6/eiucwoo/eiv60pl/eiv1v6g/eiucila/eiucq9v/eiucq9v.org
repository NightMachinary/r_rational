"Rational" stories often forget that the base state of a human being is a jumble of emotions that our logical brains very often try to make sense of, but often fail.

"Rational" characters with logical streams of thought even in times of extreme stress, the types that never ever get angry or show emotion etc. are the furthest thing from a "human" being.

Imo there's 3 levels of rationality in stories -

1. Completely irrational, neither world nor characters make sense and there's no consistency.

2. I-am-very-rational type stories, where the protagonists are either semi-human robots or author mouthpieces. Worldbuilding will often be pretty good but might not stand up to /too/ much scrutiny (your example of the 12 year old solving science's greatest mysteries).

3. Actual rational stories, where the protagonists are proper humans with all the irrationality that follows with it, who are not prisoners of the plot, have their own unique "voice" and show a varied range of emotions. These stories often have the protagonist making the best of situations they land in, and not necessarily solving all the world's mysteries/problems. The character's rationality is dictated by the world they live in, not our own (the rational thing to do in a world where guns are the main weapon vs when there's one or more of many different types of magic is completely different).
