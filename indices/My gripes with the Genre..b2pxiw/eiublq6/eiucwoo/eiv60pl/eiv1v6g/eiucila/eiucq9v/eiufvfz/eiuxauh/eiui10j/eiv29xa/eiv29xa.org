The big words, philosophy = intelligence trope is only relevant when what they're saying isn't that intelligent after all and the motivation of the speaker is to use them in order to /appear/ smart, instead of actually being smart. I never got the impression from Harry in HPMOR that his motivation was to /appear/ smart, instead it was to get from where we currently are to the relevant solution as fast as humanly possible, what people think of him be damned. It's what I liked about it so much.
