I think the enjoyment of rationalist fiction is related to how much one appreciates optimization, mental thinking exercises, solvable sherlock holmes-esque puzzles. Intellectual porn, basically. I also like fiction that leads me to think "this should happen" and then have a character agree on the next page "this will happen", like a sort of mental link between the reader and the writer.

Whatever their skill at actually writing prose and their ability to suspend disbelief, so long as the writer keeps those tropes in mind, I'll at least give their story a good read.
