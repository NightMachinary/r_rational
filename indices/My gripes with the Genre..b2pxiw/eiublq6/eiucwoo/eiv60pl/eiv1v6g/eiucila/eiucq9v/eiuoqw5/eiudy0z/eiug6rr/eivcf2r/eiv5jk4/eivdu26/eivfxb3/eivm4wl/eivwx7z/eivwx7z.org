Where does that pressure come from? Or is it just pressure to write new material / not change chapter boundaries?

I agree that pacing is very difficult in a serial but more than a few web serials suffer from excessive fluff even within the individual chapters. One of my favorites (though not rationalist or even adjacent) is The Deathworlders which desperately needs a heavy handed editor who'd cut out half of the fluff and reduce the per-monthly chapter lengths by a third (not because they're too long but because there's too much pointless padding).
