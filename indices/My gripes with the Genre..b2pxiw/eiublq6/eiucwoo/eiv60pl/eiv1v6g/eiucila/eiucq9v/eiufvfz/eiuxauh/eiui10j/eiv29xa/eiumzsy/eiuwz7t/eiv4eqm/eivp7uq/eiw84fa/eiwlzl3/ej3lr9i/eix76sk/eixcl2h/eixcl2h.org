When you say their brains aren't developed enough for rationality, I think it's fair to say that's a claim about their intelligence, but okay, so you're taking about emotional maturity and romantic maturity.

For emotional maturity, Red's definitely got advantages over most 12 year olds, but I model his responses to things a lot off of some of my clients, particularly those in the 11-14 age range with high emotional intelligence and self awareness. None of them have been child soldiers, but most have lost parents or gone through other kinds of trauma, and all are obviously in therapy or have had therapy before, so if I see them capable of something, there's no reason not to make Red capable of it. He definitely has advantages with his intelligence and rationality, though, in articulating how and why he does something, and his psychic training also helps in modifying his own behavior rather than needing therapy as much.

As for sexual maturity, or "genuine romantic love," I'm actually not sure what you're referring to? I have vivid memories of what having a crush at that age was like, and that's mostly what I'm drawing on. He's definitely smarter and wiser than I was at that age, but it's not like he's got advanced knowledge of what being in relationships are like, or experience dealing with heartache, or resolving disputes with someone he has feelings for.
