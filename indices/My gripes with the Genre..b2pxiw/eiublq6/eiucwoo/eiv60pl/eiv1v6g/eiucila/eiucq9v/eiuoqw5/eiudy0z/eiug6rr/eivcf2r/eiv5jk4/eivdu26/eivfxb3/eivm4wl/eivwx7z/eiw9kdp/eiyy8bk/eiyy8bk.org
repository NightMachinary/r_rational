Also, it's just hard to rewrite/edit stories. It can feel demoralizing to do, it doesn't feel as creative as writing something new, etc. I don't think I've seen any webfic/fanfic author actually deliver on going back and doing a full trim of an existing story, either never starting the rewrite, or starting it and letting it languish unfinished 3 chapters in.
