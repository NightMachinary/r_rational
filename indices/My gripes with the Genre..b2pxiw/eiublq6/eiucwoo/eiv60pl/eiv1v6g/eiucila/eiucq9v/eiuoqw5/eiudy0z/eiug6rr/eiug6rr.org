It seems a bit like a double standard. If the protagonists overcame challenges by being super strong physically nobody has a problem with that. Showing off brute force is socially acceptable and even admirable, but showing off intelligence is seen as obnoxious and arrogant.

If a super buff person shows off their strength, nobody interprets that as them saying "hahaha I'm so strong and you're a total wimp!"

Yet if a super smart person shows off their intelligence, people take that as if it's an insult to them personally. That seems awfully prejudiced, no offense.
