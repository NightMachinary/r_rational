Remember the difference between rational and rationalist fiction; this is a sub for both. You're looking for rational, the majority of the sub, not rationalist, which are the stories that can be [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]].

I'd recommend the /[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H1CYBS6/][Cradle]]/ series by Will Wight. It's of the Xianxia genre, which is usually garbage fiction, poorly written (because it's usually translated from Chinese), super irrational, and emotionally dumb and cringy. Cradle, on the other hand, is absolutely amazing, incredibly well written, and has rational world building and characters (in that the world and character are coherent and make decisions that make sense from their perspectives). I love the series so much. It got me into Xianxia, but I can't find anything /nearly/ as good as Cradle.

Will Wight is an amazing author. In addition, the series also had audiobooks made by Travis Baldree, who's an amazing narrator and voice actor. The audiobooks are amazing. You can join us at [[/r/Iteration110Cradle][r/Iteration110Cradle]], which is also the sub for all of Will's other books, which all exist in the same multiverse.

That earlier link is to the first book, Unsouled. Here's the summary.

#+begin_quote
  Sacred artists follow a thousand Paths to power, using their souls to control the forces of the natural world.

  Lindon is Unsouled, forbidden to learn the sacred arts of his clan.

  When faced with a looming fate he cannot ignore, he must rise beyond anything he's ever known...and forge his own Path.

I highly recommend it; it's among the best stories that this sub can recommend. It's just not shown as often because it's a series of six novels (so far), not regularly updating web serials. The magic system is super cool and satisfying too, which also awesome.

--------------

Also, another rec, to satisfy the learning and discover that MoL provides is [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]].

#+begin_quote
  Summary: Morey is summoned to a fantasy world under siege by the forces of darkness, called a Hero by the natives. Unknown to them, they got two 'Heroes' for the price of one. Dumped into a strange and dangerous fantasy world, Cato struggles to find out what happened to him and where he is. And perhaps there are advantages to not being a Hero. And perhaps not all the legends are true...
#+end_quote

Cato does a lot of science and discovery. It's not at all [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]]. Instead, it's very down to earth and close to people. I really like this one too; it's one of the places mentioned in my flair. (Now that I mention that, I should add something from Cradle to that, too...)

I'm not gonna bother recommending anything else, because this thread is full of other good recs. üëç
