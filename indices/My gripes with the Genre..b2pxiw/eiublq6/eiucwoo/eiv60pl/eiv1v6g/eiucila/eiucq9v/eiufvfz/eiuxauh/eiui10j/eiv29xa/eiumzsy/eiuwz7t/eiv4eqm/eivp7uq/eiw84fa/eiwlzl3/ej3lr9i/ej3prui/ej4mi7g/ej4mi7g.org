That's fair enough - I don't disagree that kids in the ~11-15 year old range can be as competent as adults in certain areas. For my own piece, I do think they tend to lack in emotional regulation and long-term, multi-factor conditional planning, but OoS addresses both of those.

Red has been using his latent psychic abilities to compensate, Blue seems unusually but not extraordinarily good at it for his age, and Leaf's biggest blind spot often seems to be her inability to empathize with other people and understand their viewpoint. Blue is following a fairly linear path toward the League Championship, while Red and Leaf both struggle mightily to make decisions about how to balance their time and interests.

Thanks for explicating your thoughts on it. I'm really interested to see how recent events in the fic affect the main characters outlook and emotional states.
