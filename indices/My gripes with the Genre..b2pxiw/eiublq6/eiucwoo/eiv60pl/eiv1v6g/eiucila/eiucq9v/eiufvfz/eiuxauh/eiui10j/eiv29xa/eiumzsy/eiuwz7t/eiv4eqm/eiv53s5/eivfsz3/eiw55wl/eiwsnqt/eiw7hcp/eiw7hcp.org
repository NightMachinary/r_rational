  I see little reason to excuse such stories when the publishing medium inherently allows re-editing / rewriting the start once the author has "found their voice"

How many authors actually do this? The first few chapters of HPMoR and MoL, for instance, are both substantially lower quality than the rest of the story. It's even worse for webcomics, the first few /books/ of OotS, DrMcNinja and Schlock Mercenary are all substantially lower quality than the rest of the work and yet those authors also don't go back and redo their old work.
