I feel like what you're describing is largely a trait of self-insert fanfic. That term doesn't fully describe HPMOR or OOS but let's be honest, self insert is more or less the intent when an author decides to overwrite the original character with a more knowledgeable protagonist (who happens to line up with their own perspective) and then spends the book kind of Mary-Sue'ing it up about how everything goes right for them. You are correct that they do not seem particularly realistic about what an 11 year old is capable of, or how they might grow emotionally over time. On the other hand, who says fiction has to be realistic? Have you ever had a fantasy about what /you'd/ do if you were given magical superpowers or sucked into the DC universe? Self indulgent fiction isn't automatically /bad/ fiction, if it serves some other purpose. I'd argue that HPMOR at least served a number of purposes regardless of literary merit. OOS- eh, I haven't gone as far.

Some things you may like in the rational-adjacent space:

[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]- Frankenstein's monster is now a team of kids. Great characterization and setting, fairly grimdark, little slow in points. Complete.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]]- A girl has her life turned into an erogame, for better or worse. Lots of NSFW scenes, but astonishingly deep plotting and meta-humor makes this just about the only pornfic I would ever recommend as actually rationalist. Incomplete.

[[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][Significant Digits]]- More-or-less the sequel to HPMOR, by a different author but following the events in the first story. Substantially better from a pulp fiction standpoint, still rationalist-adjacent but not hard R anymore. /Does/ do a much better job of examining the character arcs of a lot of the main HPMOR cast. Complete.

[[https://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure]]- Fascinating story with some great world building. I don't know, not actually related to any of the topics covered here, I just rediscovered it as I was trawling through my folders looking for recommendations and maybe you'd enjoy it! Complete.
