It's not a double standard, because Harry in HPMOR isn't really all that brilliant. Sure he's smart, but as OP pointed out, he is super overconfident, and in my opinion rather dunning-krugered in his understanding of science, his ability to do research, and his ability to do warfare. It's just that the author makes what he does work because that's how the author thinks the world works; the protag's failings reflect the author's failings.
