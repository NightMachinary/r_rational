I never claimed they were too intelligent. Just too mature. And not only in the "ready to make sound decisions and take on what the world throws at them" sense of the world.

The thing that gave my SoD the last kick was how the relationship between Red and Leaf was progressing, which had nothing to do with rationality and intelligence.

But beyond that, none of your examples dissuade me. Afaik, most child soldiers are /not/ mature, at least not in the emotional stability sense. And I don't know about their sexual maturity, but their maturity regarding genuine romantic love is probably also not advancing faster than usual.

I mean sure. Maybe all three in your group are early bloomers on top of being child prodigies /and/ people with increased empathic ability and moral understanding higher than ninetysomething percent of Earth humanity, but you must understand how that starts straining my SoB.

Also, the kid you linked is already undergoing puberty. Have your three main characters already started on that path?
