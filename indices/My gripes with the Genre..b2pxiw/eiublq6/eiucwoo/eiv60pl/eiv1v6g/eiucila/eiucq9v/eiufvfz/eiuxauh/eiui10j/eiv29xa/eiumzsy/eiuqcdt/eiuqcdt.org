People keep saying that, and I have no idea where they're getting it from. Yes, it's true that HPMOR was intended to teach stuff from the Sequences, but if it weren't /also/ intended to be a real story, I very much doubt that EY would have gone to nearly the effort he did to plot it out (e.g. all the early foreshadowing of the late-game reveals), or to include all the fun-but-not-particularly-educational bits he included (e.g. practically everything involving Tracey Davis as a character). Being intended as the one doesn't preclude being also intended as the other.
