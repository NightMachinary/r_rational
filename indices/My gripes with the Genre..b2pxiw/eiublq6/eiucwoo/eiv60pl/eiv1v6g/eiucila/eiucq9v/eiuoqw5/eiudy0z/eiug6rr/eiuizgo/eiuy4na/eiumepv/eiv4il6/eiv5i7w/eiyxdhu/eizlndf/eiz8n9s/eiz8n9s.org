This is very much related to why Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, is so controversial. There are a fairly large number of people who work in child development, child psychology, etc who claim that the book is an unrealistic representation of what a child of that age is capable of thinking. But I read it as a six year old and didn't find anything unusual about it. A number of my friends had the same experience.
