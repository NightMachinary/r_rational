Fans hate retcons. And fans are also the people giving the most positive feedback, sometimes even for things that aren't objectively good.

When you edit an as of yet unpublished book no one cares, but in openly available webserials that people love it can cause "Han shot first" type scenarios even over the smallest edit. Look at what happened on [[/r/parahumans]] when Wildbow killed off Browbeat retroactively.

And even I admit to disliking change like that. Not enough to stand in its way, but enough to download the whole story to make sure I still have access to the original when an author mentions the possibility of rewriting stuff in a story I really liked.
