HJPEV is *supposed* to be an overly confident "iamverysmart" obnoxious kid. That's the actual character, and it's a pretty realistic archetype (after all there's a sub to make fun of this kind of kid!)

The character isn't supposed to be a perfect model of rationality, only be *aspiring* to rationality.

There are in-bounds story reasons as to why he is as smart as he is as well. There's also pretty clear world reasons why wizards wouldn't be aware of the scientific method or think in the ways Harry does. That's really WHY EY picked this setting as a medium to explain rational thinking to an unenlightened culture.
