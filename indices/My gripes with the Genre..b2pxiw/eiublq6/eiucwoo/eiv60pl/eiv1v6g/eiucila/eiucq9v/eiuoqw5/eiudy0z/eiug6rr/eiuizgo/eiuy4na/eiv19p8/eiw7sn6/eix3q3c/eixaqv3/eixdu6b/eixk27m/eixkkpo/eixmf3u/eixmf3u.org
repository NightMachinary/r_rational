It's [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rrW7yf42vQYDf8AcH/timeless-physics][the author's pet timeless quantum physics]]. That this image that's in Harry's head (which is emphatically NOT reality, hence the hilarious map and territory error) constitutes a roughly correct representation of physical theory is something that many physicists would contest. It, and your reductionism, are certainly incorrect metaphysics.

EDIT: Besides, to go to physics is wholly inappropriate given the conceptual level that the problem lives at, which is the meaning of what is a discrete object.
