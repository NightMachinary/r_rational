  So my main complaints are about the MCs, they both start the fiction around 11/12 years old and I understand them being smart are part of the novelisation but they spend their entire time spouting logical fallacies and [[/r/iamverysmart]]-esque dialogue.

I can't say anything about /The Origin of Species/, but HJPEV does lose his overconfidence later in the story.

  Any recommendations more like Mother of Learning?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]] (insert complaints about torture and mind rape) is very similar (IMO).
