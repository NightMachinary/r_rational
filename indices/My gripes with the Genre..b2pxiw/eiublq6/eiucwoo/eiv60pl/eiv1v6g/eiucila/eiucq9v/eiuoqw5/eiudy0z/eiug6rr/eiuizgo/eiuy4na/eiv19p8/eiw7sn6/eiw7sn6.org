Yes, some of the things that he does that should fail do fail, but some of the things he does that should fail do not fail. Partial transfiguration worked on /basically/ his first try, through the most hilariously ironic map and territory error.

It's almost as if magic is not even a singular discipline, but many subdisciplines that people spend years and years studying, and is involved in their daily lives, and the author portrays it as simple and shallow not very skill-based and an 11 year old is able to make significant advances over the course of a year starting from zero knowledge. Is math like this? Skateboarding? Poetry? Philosophy?
