To be honest with you, I didn't even consider it. It's the step a lot of fanfiction takes, including the main one I really enjoyed, like Game of Champions. But I grew up loving a lot of fiction that put smart and/or mature kids in serious circumstances, not just modern YA fiction but classics like Tom Sawyer and A Wrinkle in Time and The Outsiders, and of course things like IT and Ender's Game and The Body, and I've just never really felt that thing that a lot of people seem to feel when they read a young character and think "there's no way kids that age are like that."

I think modern society underestimates kids a hell of a lot. I think modern western society in particular sees kids as immature and helpless because that's how our children are raised. And I think so few people really remember what being a kid was like, or don't have a wide enough sample size for kids to understand that there are some who are really, really smart and mature. And of course just like in most fiction that focuses on exceptional characters, fiction starring kids will likely include exceptional kids.

And yes, I just don't think a world that takes Pokemon as seriously as I envision it can wait for kids to be 18 to have them help keep its roads and cities safe. Your idea is a good one, and I wouldn't look askance to any fanfic that put its kids through a lot more years of intensive training before sending them out. But if I'm going to have child soldiers in my fic, why not make them the canonical age, you know?

It also helps that Pokemon is inherently different from so many other worlds when it comes to what *power* is. The characters themselves are basically just normal people, unless they're psychic. Their pokemon are the ones who have all the power. And what does it take to be a good trainer? Knowledge and reflexes.

Sure, adults are stronger and more athletic than kids, but plenty of kids can throw and catch baseballs pretty well. But when it comes to knowledge, I mean shit, I knew all 151 pokemon and their moves and type interactions by the age of 11. Had no problem with the next 100 that were added either. And I'm not a genius like Red or Blue. Kids know *a lot* about the things they care about and obsess over. There's nothing that really stops an exceptional kid from being a powerful trainer except maybe time. If anything it's the most rational world for kids to become so powerful, except maybe those that use some video game or card game as the source of power.
