Oh he was, and it is a common feature of actual Holmes. He was an extremely accomplished boxer and did it for fun..

But his description of the rundown of weaknesses and then the execution is straight out of the Holmes movies and not at all out of Sherlock the show. Sherlock in the show demonstrates a couple times that he can fight pretty well, but he tends to not use violence as much as Holmes in the movie.

I was mainly pointing out how his problems seem to be more related to Downey's Holmes and not Cumberbatch's.
