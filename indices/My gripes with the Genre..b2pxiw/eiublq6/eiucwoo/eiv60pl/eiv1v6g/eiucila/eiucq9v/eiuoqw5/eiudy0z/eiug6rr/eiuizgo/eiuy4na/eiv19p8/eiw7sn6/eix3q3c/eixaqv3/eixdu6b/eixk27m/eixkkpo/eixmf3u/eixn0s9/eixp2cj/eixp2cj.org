Like, ignore my claims about what is specifically wrong with Harry's image and what it implies about the magic there. The point that I think you could agree with here is that he didn't need to do any research, or really any serious thinking at all to win, he just needed to have known some specific bit of esoteric theory that /just happens/ to solve his problem. No methods of rationality, no critical thinking, just power handed to the protagonist for free. This is a key point where he should have failed, demonstrating that book knowledge is not the same thing as having the skill to do research, because Harry doesn't have that. Research is difficult and requires domain specific skill and knowledge, and there is nothing that Harry has done to gain any of that. Instead, Harry wins because he knows Science^{TM} and everyone is humbled by him.

A nice rationalist lesson, which the author has yet to learn, would be if Harry kept trying to apply and refine this pet physics theory and it kept failing, and Hermione starts suggesting to try something else or that maybe the way he sees the world with this theory glued to his face is incorrect and Harry brushes her off. Then after gaining enough familiarity with Harry's theory from the fresh perspective of someone living outside of it and with a clear view of its failures, she makes specific critiques, which Harry resists for a while, until eventually he realizes he was wrong all along. Then Hermione then delivers a lesson about how one should not be wedded to their pet theories and should be able to view them from the outside, that her perspective not believing the theory and seeing the failures gave her an advantage over Harry in understanding the situation, and Harry should be able to capture some of this while testing theory.

Edit: as for this simple realization (which I am also critical of but lets set that aside), one doesn't need to go all the way to atoms to think this way about objects, and the perspective, abstracting out the particulars about atoms, is an obvious first thing to try when confronted with the problem of partial transfiguration. Hence the wizarding community should have figured it out.
