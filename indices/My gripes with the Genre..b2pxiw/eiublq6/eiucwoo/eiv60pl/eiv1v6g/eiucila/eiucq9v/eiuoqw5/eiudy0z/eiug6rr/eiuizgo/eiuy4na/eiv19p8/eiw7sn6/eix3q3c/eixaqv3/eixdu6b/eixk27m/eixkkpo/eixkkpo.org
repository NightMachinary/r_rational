It's not the author's pet theory of physics, it's simply the idea that he broke down the idea of there being discreet things as everything is made up of atoms etc and all our decisions on what makes a discreet object are arbitrary, which is a perfectly valid way to view things. I honestly don't know what theory you're referring to that is supposedly fringe science or whatever.
