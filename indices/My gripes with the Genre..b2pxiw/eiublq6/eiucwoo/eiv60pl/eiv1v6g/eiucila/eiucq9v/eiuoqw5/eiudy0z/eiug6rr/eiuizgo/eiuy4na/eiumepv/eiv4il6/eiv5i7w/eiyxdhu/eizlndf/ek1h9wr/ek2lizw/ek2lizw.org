It's not a matter of belief or opinion, it's a matter of fact, and I know for a /fact/ that I'm */not/* a genius. But I'm smart enough to understand how smart I'm /not/. Most people have no idea how smart they aren't.

I just cut almost 1,400 words out of this comment and moved them over to my word processor. That's over 5 pages. I've been working on it since 4:30. I decided that 5 pages was probably excessive, and that I probably ought to see your reaction to "no, I /don't/ believe myself to be one of those geniuses" before dropping the rest of it on your head.
