Not to toot my own horn too much, but if you've only read Pokemon to chapter 10, you're over 4 years behind on where the story/characters/quality of the story is now.

If you want to give it another try, check out this interlude chapter, which wasn't connected to the main story at the time so doesn't spoil anything.

As for your other example, HPMOR... saying things like this:

> but it feels like the author never got over the 'big words, philosophy = intelligence' stage that lots of teenagers go through.

Makes me confused at what you think /does/ = intelligence? Because it's certainly not big words and namedropping philosophical concepts, but if /that's/ all you got out of HPMOR, then I'd love to know what stories you think actually demonstrate intelligence? This is a serious question by the way, I have no idea what standards you're holding it up to.
