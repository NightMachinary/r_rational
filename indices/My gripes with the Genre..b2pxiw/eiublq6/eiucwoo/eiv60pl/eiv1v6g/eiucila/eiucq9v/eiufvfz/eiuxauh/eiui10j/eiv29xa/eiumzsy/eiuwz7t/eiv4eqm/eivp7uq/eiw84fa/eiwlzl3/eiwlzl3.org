> Twelve year old humans don't have mature enough brains for neither the rationality nor even the specific type of irrationality that your protagonists display.

This is a pretty strong claim. What's your sample size for it? If you're randomly selecting 12 year olds from the entire human population, then yeah you're right, but then I'd probably extend that to average /twenty/ year olds. But if you've never met a gifted 12 year old (and I mean that in the sense beyond "was in gifted classes in school"), then your skepticism is understandable.

The remaining discrepancy is answered in my FAQ:

*Isn't it unrealistic to have Red, Blue and Leaf so intelligent/mature for 11-12 year olds?*

I'm actually of two minds on this. On the one hand, I'm perfectly fine saying that environmental pressures have made humans in the pokemon world a standard deviation more mature and intelligent than they would be in our world... any kids that didn't treat pokemon like the deadly monsters they are would not have survived the dark ages before pokeballs were invented.

On the other hand, I honestly do believe that many kids, even in our world, are [[https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/educ-101-axioms-f1cba0c85794][more adult-like than most people give them credit for.]] I especially believe that almost all kids, when raised in certain circumstances, can grow to be as mature as their environment dictates. There are child soldiers in war torn countries that are forced to fight at the age Red and Blue and Leaf are. Throughout history, boys in particularly military cultures have been trained to fight and kill since pre-adolescence.

Whether these are the healthiest or best ways to raise children is obviously a different question. But when humanity's survival relies on training children to be soldiers, they're sure as hell going to be more mature than the average 21st century western 11 year old.

As for intelligence, Red, Blue and Leaf are all gifted youngsters, even among their peers. Perhaps that doesn't account for ALL their intelligence, but I work with kids, and every once in awhile I'll meet an 11 or 12 year old who's as intelligent and well spoken as their older siblings and parents. They're not typical kids, but to me they're realistic enough... and they're not even [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Wilson][producing nuclear fusion in their garage at the age of 14.]]
