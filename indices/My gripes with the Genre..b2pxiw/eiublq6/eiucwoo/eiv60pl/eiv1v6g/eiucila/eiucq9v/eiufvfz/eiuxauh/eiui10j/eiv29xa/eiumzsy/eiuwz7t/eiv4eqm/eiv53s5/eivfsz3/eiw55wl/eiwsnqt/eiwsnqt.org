"Poor writing" is a strong charge to make on such a subjective issue as reader engagement. I personally found the first chapters of HPMOR rough around the edges, but still riveting. I know others that couldn't get past them until I rewrote them, and then loved them and the rest of the story. Clearly I was able to "improve" the writing for those chapters for those people, but each person's threshold and taste is different, and for others they might have just been adding fluff to a perfectly streamlined intro.

As I said, I think you're perfectly within your rights to decide how to spend your own reading time and use that metric. I just know that if I felt the same way, I would have missed out on a ton of stories that I really love, not just web serials but published book series like The Dresden Files and web comics like Gunnerkrigg Court.

And yes, on a personal note if I had more free time and was just a better writer maybe I could make my first 10 chapters more riveting to more readers. But as a general cost-benefit analysis, working on new chapters seems better than rewriting things from 4+ years ago as long as I'm still getting a decent amount of new readers every month, which I am.
