How people treat me on this site has no impact on my life. I'm here to learn, not feel smart. And I stand by the nice guy assertion. A nice guy isn't a bad person, just a beta using flawed logic to interpret the world. They still are useful to society, arguably the pillar of it. If you are interested in continuing this discussion I will. But if not, no need to waste our time.
