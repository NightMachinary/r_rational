Thanks for the feedback! Yeah, I definitely thought about bringing in Blue or Leaf's perspectives earlier in the story when I first wrote it. The problem was that neither felt like they had anything particularly important to say (thought/perspective wise) until the forest fire.

I definitely could see arguments for having the forest fire occur earlier in the story, rather than waiting until 15. For example there are a couple chapters, like 8-9, that I can probably cut down and combine without losing much from the plot. But I like the world building and character moments they provide, and would have to have a lot more free time to go back and better streamline the story to get to the other characters' perspectives faster, or come up with good reasons to get into their heads earlier.
