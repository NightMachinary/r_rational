I feel the OP here is acting upon a bit of a strawman, the character he describes acts in ways that the characters in the story don't act.

For starters, the characters tend not to do things simply to /appear/ smart, but do things because of genuine motivations. They use those long words because they make sense or, maybe at worst they don't want to dumb something down and there could be an element of arrogance to that sure, but their motivations are genuine and unrelated to wanting to appear smart, making them well safe from iamverysmart territory.
