Of course. I suppose it would still be enjoyable - it would hardly be incomprehensible - but you'd miss a good deal of a good story.

In particular, Flicker both cares for and is cared for by the other characters in the story, who are developed and better understood by reading non-Flicker parts. I don't want to get too spoilery, but there's a significant treatment of the whole "why should a speedster slow down to try to interact with slow-thinking normal humans" plot that is an important background to the whole story.

Feel free to skim other parts if you like, but given how OP speedsters are it really is a story about Flicker with some side characters - it won't cut out much to only read the stuff that relates to Flicker.

Edit: Chapter 2 "Phone Tag": [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/34152071413/flicker-phone-tag]] is a great intro that can stand on itsown if you just want to get a feel for the powerset without committing to reading tens of thousands of words.
