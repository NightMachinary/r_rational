If you're going to read Worm, I'd also strongly suggest listening to the [[https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-worm/][We've Got Worm]] podcast after you finish each arc. I found it incredibly hard to put down the serial and really process all of the details in the story, but the guys on the podcast do an excellent job of recapping each arc, diving into the significant character moments and interactions, and coming at the work from a literary perspective rather than a rationalist one. Too often I think that we in this community get caught up in a kind of obsessive power optimization mindset, and getting to see a story you love from a lens you've never considered is pretty damn awesome.

Hope you enjoy it!
