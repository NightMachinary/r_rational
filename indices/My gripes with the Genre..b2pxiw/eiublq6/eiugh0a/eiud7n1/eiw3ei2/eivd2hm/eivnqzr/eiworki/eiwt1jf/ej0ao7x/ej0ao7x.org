  And at a certain point, we do make allowances for the medium and for readable dialogue. If I'm going to read a Harry Potter story, it shouldn't be to the same extent as HPMOR, but I'd rather that the characters sound like they're 13 or 15 than 11. But I don't feel like the dialogue in WtC is significantly out of place, and we don't actually ever see 9-year-old Juniper dialogue IIRC.

I appreciated that. Also, how one of his earliest players was Ricky, which is the kind of name most kids shed in Middle School.
