  Are there any characterization guidelines to avoiding the Eight Deadly Words?

I'd say it's really subjective, depends on the reader. You'll never get everyone. IMHO the key is none of these things - it has to be someone that's /interesting/. It can be interesting because you feel like they're a nice person and want them to succeed. It can be that they have a peculiar set of belief and you enjoy discovering them. Or they can even be fully villainous, but still be /fun/, because of how extraordinary their villainy is.

For me the least interesting character is one that is mediocre in all aspects. I made the example of Breaking Bad above, because it had this effect on me. Walter White isn't especially stupid, but he's not especially smart either. He keeps fucking up and that sets back his plans, which makes his progression frustrating. But he's also obviously pretty selfish, yet he rationalizes his selfishness and evil with pretty standard excuses. He's not interesting. He's the most annoying kind of real human being, one that's everywhere and that is more often than not a thorn in our side. An egotistical asshole that doesn't even have the decency of embracing fully evil and being honest about it. So, personally, I lost interest in his story. The same can happen for example with a good character who however is too incompetent to achieve anything of significance. One or two mistakes are fine, but if they keep fucking up, you end up losing any belief that they /deserve/ success.
