I think we're are arguing past each other, based on different connotations for the term "bad person". I am clearly putting the bar higher (or lower I guess) to call someone "bad," even when they are performing "bad" actions.

I never said Joon was perfect or pure good, I just don't think it is fair to assign the descriptor "bad person" to him, because he didn't meet my bar for what I believe that moniker connotates.
