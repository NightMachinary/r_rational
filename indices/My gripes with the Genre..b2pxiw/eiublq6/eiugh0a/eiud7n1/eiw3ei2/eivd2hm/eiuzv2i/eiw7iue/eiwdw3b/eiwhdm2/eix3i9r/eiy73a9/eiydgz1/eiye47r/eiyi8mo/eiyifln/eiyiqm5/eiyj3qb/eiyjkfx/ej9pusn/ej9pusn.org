I think the "regular basis" bit refers to not learning. Like, you can hurt others on purpose because you don't care, or you can hurt others by being too daft or stupid or stubborn or insensitive to realise you're hurting them and that maybe if it keeps happening you should change your behavioural patterns. Basically, one's the Joker, the other's Homer Simpson in his worst moments.
