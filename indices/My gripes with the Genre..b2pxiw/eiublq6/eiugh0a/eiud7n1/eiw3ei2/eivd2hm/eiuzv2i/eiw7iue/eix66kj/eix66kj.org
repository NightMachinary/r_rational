Can't satisfy everyone, I really like the characters in WtC and have no interest in reading about what happens to saints (not that I think the characters are even that not nice (some of them are intentionally mean spirited like the house but considering how common they are irl and how rare they are in stories its just another good point for me) but just realistic people).
