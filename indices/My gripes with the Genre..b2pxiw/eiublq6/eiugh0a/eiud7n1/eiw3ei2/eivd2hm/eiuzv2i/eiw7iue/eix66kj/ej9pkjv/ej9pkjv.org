  I really liked the worldbuilding, it is absolutely amazing, and character interactions are really well thought out, yes, it is a literary masterpiece, but I still found that I don't care what happens to these people. (TVTropes warning)

This reminds me that's exactly why I dropped Breaking Bad. Really well-crafted show, it just so happens that the only ending I wished for it was for an asteroid to kill every single character in one fell swoop.
