I don't think I've ever met such a person who literally NEVER unintentionally hurts others. I know plenty of considerate, kind people who do their best though. But even they have bad moments. And none of them have been forced into uniquely horrifying (from a typical person's perspective) situations the way Joon (and most fantasy characters) has been.

Care to name an example from fiction? I'm seriously at a loss. No character in any story posted to this sub meets your criteria, as far as I can tell. Maaaaaybe Hermione in HPMOR and it's derivatives, but even she performs actions with unintended consequences (the anti-bully arch cotains a few examples).
