Agreed. People, including characters in the story like Joon, act like that is a valid justification for Joon's actions, hiding being social justice when it's barely relevant here. No one was claiming that Tiff 'belonged' to Arthur and shouldn't have a choice. No one is blaming Tiff for doing anything wrong.

The problem was that Joon basically betrayed his best friend by going behind his back to secretly ask out his crush despite being aware of Arthur's feelings. He essentially chose having Tiff as a girlfriend over the best friend who had been loyal to him for years. Despite knowing the harm it would do to his friendship with Arthur he still did it because he didnt value Arthur's friendship as much as Tiff. This made explicitly clear by his values screen which shows Tiff above Arthur.

Even worse, he went behind Arthur's back instead of being honest with his best friend. Their relationship made a complete mockery of Arthur's feelings instead of letting him move on. Joons asshole friend was right about that, despite the rude way he said it.

I face palmed when the author then made Arthur into a molester later on. Basically just an excuse to make Arthur less sympathetic by exaggerating the flaws he had on Earth.

Considering that Aerb probably exists to fulfill Joon's fantasies, this is especially suspect. So if it turns out that it really was just to assuage Joons guilt then that would actually be interesting writing.
