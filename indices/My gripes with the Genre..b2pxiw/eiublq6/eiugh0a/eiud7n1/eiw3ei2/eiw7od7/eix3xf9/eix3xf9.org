I don't mean to follow you down the comments here, but I would like to note that I strongly disagree with my impression of your moral evaluations.

Why does it matter what someone thinks on the inside? That shooter in New Zealand seems to have believed he was acting in the public good by attacking 'foreigners.'

The only way to evaluate someone as good or bad is through the way they change the world. The main positive effect Joon had on the 'real' world was his campaigns which drew people together, and he actively desecrated everything connected to that ritual.

I think people's internal states matter as far as evaluating whether they can rehabilitated or improved, but someone's potential for remediation doesn't mean they're good, it means they could be.
