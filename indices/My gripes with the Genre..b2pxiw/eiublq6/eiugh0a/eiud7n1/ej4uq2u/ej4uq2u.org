It's also nice how Worth the Candle takes the effort to give in-story reasons for why things are the way they are - worldbuilding that initially seem exploitable or absurd turn out to not work the way the protagonists think they do. The protagonist does have super special protagonist powers, but there's an actual reason for them and there's quite a bit of existential horror to go around as the cast digs into what they actually entail.
