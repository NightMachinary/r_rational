Author here! A lot of how people talk is based on e-mails, blog posts I wrote for my GeoCities website, or a memoir that I started and never finished in my senior year of high school. Here's a relatively impersonal (and hopefully representative) sample:

  Two years ago, before we were dating, I threw one of my parties. Claire wasn't, at the time, a good friend. She was, however, friends with the people that I invited. Because the general rule was that anyone could invite anyone else, turnout was usually good. We would play strip poker and truth or dare, all of us seeing how far other people would go. If we could have just shed the indecision and self-doubt, it would have been an orgy.

  That sort of thing only happened upstairs. Downstairs was a place to watch movies and play videogames. It also served a dual purpose as the base for our illegal activities. Now that fireworks are legal and we don't have a curfew, those sorts of things seem so mundane. Back then, the thrill of doing something that might get us in trouble was all the incentive we needed.

  Before my dad installed the screens, there were two windows on the second floor that led out onto the roof of the porch. It had little slope, so we would climb out there and flash the traffic that went by on the highway. When that got boring, the people who partied hard would go inside and find more hell to raise, while the more tame people and myself sat out on the roof and talked. Claire was one of them.

  The best memory that I got from there, the most important one from that particular gathering, came on that roof. Claire was sitting next to me, about a foot from the edge. It was four or five in the morning and Joey had just thrown a full can of pop at a passing semi. I moved a bit further away from the house and towards the drop off, when Claire grabbed my arm and told me that it scared her when I went that close. As far as I can remember, that's the first time that she had touched me.

I see this as being obnoxious to read (in several ways) and I would do a lot of editing to it, but in terms of vocabulary I don't think that it's that far off from what's presented in the text. (As far as knowledge goes, I've gotten the complaint that too many of the discussions are surface level regurgitations of various topics, which seems like a more correct complaint to me?)

That said, I certainly don't think that /Worth the Candle/ is without its flaws, and if this is one of them, I think it's an acceptable break from reality to keep conversations more interesting to read. Sorry if you find it off-putting.
