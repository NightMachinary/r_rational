I don't know, I don't buy the dialogue from an 11 year old. But I don't think my vocabulary got significantly more sophisticated in the half decade since I was in high school.

And at a certain point, we do make allowances for the medium and for readable dialogue. If I'm going to read a Harry Potter story, it shouldn't be to the same extent as HPMOR, but I'd rather that the characters sound like they're 13 or 15 than 11. But I don't feel like the dialogue in WtC is significantly out of place, and we don't actually ever see 9-year-old Juniper dialogue IIRC.
