Sounds like you like rational fiction but not rationalist fiction.

from the side bar:

#+begin_quote
  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

  *Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.*

  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

So it sounds like you just don't like the point I bolded which is the major differentiating piece between rational and rationalist fiction.

If you like intelligent characters not holding the idiot ball whose actions make sense given the motivations behind them, worlds that make sense given the rules defining them and problems that are solvable by the reader then I don't think you're in the wrong place.

Anyway, in summary you should probably watch out for that distinction and there are plenty of both types here.

Examples of things which are rational but not rationalist that you may want to check out: Sufficiently Advanced Magic and the rest of Andrew Rowe's works, Cradle series and the rest of Will Wight's stuff, Some of the better written LitRPG genre may also be in your wheelhouse. Stuff like Ascend Online and everything by Dakota Krout would be good examples there.
