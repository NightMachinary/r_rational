This is my rough outline of the history of [[/r/rational]]:

- Mar, 2009: Yudkowsky [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/][posts on LessWrong about Rationalist Fiction]], naming /Null-A/ and /David's Sling/.
- Mar, 2010: Yudkowsky posts first chapters of /[[http://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]/, originally under (fairly obvious) pseudonym.
- Nov, 2010: Alicorn posts first chapters of /[[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]]/, a HPMOR-like reimagining of Twilight.
- Nov, 2012: Iceman posts /[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]]/ to fimfiction.net
- May, 2013: Velorian posts /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting Up the Dark]]/
- Sep, 2013: I post /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]]/ to ff.net.
- Oct, 2013: DayStarEld posts [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][/Pokemon: The Origin of Species/]] to ff.net. Yudkowsky recommends [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]] in an author's note, which pretty much everyone reads.
- Dec, 2013: Following some discussions on [[/r/HPMOR]] (and a dry period for that fic), [[/r/rational]] is created. /Branches/ is one of the first stories posted there, as is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas][/The Last Christmas/]].
- May, 2013: I post [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White][/A Bluer Shade of White/]] (originally written in response to a prompt). Later in the month, I post the first chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][/Metropolitan Man/]] (which finishes at slightly less than a chapter a week in June).

As for how many of those are [[/r/iamverysmart]] material, that would be much more subjective.
