I always liked the first book of Luminosity because it decide the expectation that the main character never makes mistakes due to her intelligence. It's only in the end that she realizes the magnitude of how wrong she was and brings harm to all of her allies because of it. Of course the next book and epilogue reverse all that, but they were still an interesting read.
