I think people have already given you other recs you might enjoy, between Worth the Candle, Worm, Practical Guide to Evil, and Arcane Ascension/Sufficiently Advanced Magic. But I just wanted to chime in and say I 100% understand what you mean- I've been reading MoL since 2011, and the things I enjoy about it aren't necessarily common to the other stuff that gets posted here.

So really, what parts appeal to you? It's easy to see what you don't like about the above stories, but what do you like? Do you enjoy the meta-narrative stuff, do you like characters essentially muchkining systems, do you like the systems of growth more from a skill or character perspective?

But yeah, I feel like some of the stuff that gets posted here (i.e. The Good Student) either isn't very good or doesn't appeal to me. And I read HPMOR as an offshoot of other Harry Potter fanfiction, so there's a whole bevy of other related text to compare it against and issues that it has, especially with the supercilious/preachy nature of the protagonist, both the protagonists and antagonists acting as author mouthpieces, the show v. tell divide, etc.
