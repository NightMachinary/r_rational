The author often makes what he does fail spectacularly, it's kind of the point of the book. Straight out of the sidebar, "Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction." - Harry does this the entire way through, and it's what makes it useful. The world /doesn't/ bend to make him successful for the most part, that's what makes the story so intriguing.
