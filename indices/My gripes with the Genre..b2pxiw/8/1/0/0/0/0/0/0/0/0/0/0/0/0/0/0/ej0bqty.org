Yes, and I definitely think that loosening up is a good thing, especially with regards to this sub. I'm not so much criticizing that scene /just/ because I think it's wrong, but because the work is specifically meant to be teaching rationality, and that scene is clearly set up as a scene that's meant to convey a rationality lesson (as opposed to a Harry is irrational and fails and we learn the lesson afterwards; Harry doesn't fail here and is immediately rewarded, and rewarded throughout the story). I think that rationality lesson is wrong, and I think it stems from bad philosophy of science which I think is the crux of a lot of what the author gets wrong in his philosophy in the sequence. I use that scene specifically as an example of how his reductionism is a map-territory error. So this isn't just some nit-picking philosophical critique of a not terribly important theme, but a critique that gets at the heart of his philosophy.
