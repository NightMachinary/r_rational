Imagine math prodigy Harry knowing differential geometry and applying it to an open problem in apparation. Imagine home chem lab Harry figuring out some open problem in potions. Imagine programming language Harry figuring out some compositional magical interface which is super overpowered (there is a story about this that rationalists sometimes link to as rational). Imagine 100 other such Harrys, and suppose that their own open problem only exists in their world. Now swap all the Harrys into other worlds. No matter how smart or rational or good at research these Harrys are, all of them fail.

Also, understanding, say, the atomic structure of water (which is /still/ not super well understood) doesn't actually convey knowledge of hydrodynamics, and isn't really the thing you should be using as your primary source of knowledge about water, so reductionist fantasies about water powered by an operation of imagined "zooming in" which is not possible in principle in reality hardly constitutes deep knowledge about water.

--------------

By the way, the failure of reductionism is in the problem of intentionality, or the way theories can be applied to or be /about/ specific things in reality. More concretely, the statement "water is reducible to atoms" is not reducible to atoms because it can't deal with how the sentence refers to water.
