Interesting, and I'm not sure I see what's incorrect about my reductionist view, but putting that aside for one moment from memory none of the physics mentioned is required to be correct to have the more simple realisation of “if transfiguring a discreet object is simply changing a set of atoms, why can't any group of atoms be changed regardless of where we subjectively decide discreet objects end?”

Perhaps my interpretation of the scene is more forgiving than yours, but as I can accept the above makes sense with currently accepted physics, I don't agree that it requires the world to fit with his pet theory for it to work.
