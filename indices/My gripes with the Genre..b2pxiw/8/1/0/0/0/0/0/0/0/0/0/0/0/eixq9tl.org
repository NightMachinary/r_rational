The way transfiguration is presented to work within HPMOR is entirely based on your ability to conceptualise objects and have a deep understanding of them, when I was reading I thought that based upon this it was perfectly plausible that without an understanding of the makeup of an object you couldn't perform partial transfiguration even if magic folk had attempted to think about them in a different way philosophically, but I take your point.

I think the main thing we disagree on is how plausible it is that Harry as a character could've held the missing piece to make this breakthrough possible, and given how exceptional his perspective is I'm prepared to accept it, you're of course entitled to disagree, it just didn't feel anywhere near as unreasonable or implausible as the typical types of deus ex machina found in other media, at least in my opinion.
