Pretty sure you're wrong about the Patronus 2.0 not being unique. What is stated to be a hidden conspiracy is the knowledge that dementors are avatars of death, but nowhere is it said that somebody tried a patronus thinking of conquering death before Harry, because the implication is that the vast majority of people would never consider that a possibility. In many ways it's the most childish thing Harry does in the story (as in correlated to childlike 'immaturity') and he's rewarded for it above all his rationality.
