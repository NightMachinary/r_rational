  It's just that the author makes what he does work because that's how the author thinks the world works

I really don't get where people are getting this idea from. HPMOR is the story of Harry repeatedly getting his ass handed to him because he isn't nearly as smart as he thinks he is.

Learning some humility and accepting the difference between clever and smart are the very core of his character arc.

I mean, yes, the character still very much has the world revolve around him and he has a much larger impact on the world than is realistic (a trait he shares with his canon counterpart btw), but him being overconfident is explicitly and repeatedly pointed out in the story.
