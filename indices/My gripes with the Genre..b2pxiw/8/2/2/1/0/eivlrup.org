on this* subreddit, nope! and thank god for that lol but there is an unfortunate surplus of webfiction elsewhere with "iamverysmart" protags

and i was arguing against the poster who said they felt that smart characters were disliked for being arrogant and obnoxious when they show off their smarts, when a strong character displaying their abilities wouldn't be. the issue i personally have with so called "smart" protags is they're thrown into situations for "strong" protags and then intelligence does the same job, rendering them supposedly being smart a moot point.

it's totally my fault for including "rat-fic" in the character description, as it makes my point a little less cogent and a lot less accurate :( , but i suppose that's what i get for posting without thinnking too much
