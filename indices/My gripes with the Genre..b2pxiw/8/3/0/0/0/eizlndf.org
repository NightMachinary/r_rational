I think there's a confounding variable here that's so pervasive as to be invisible to most people. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealisticDictionIsUnrealistic][Realistic diction is unrealistic.]] ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ai2xuc/when_the_needs_of_the_medium_outweigh_the_needs/eela2ry/][See also: this.]]) There's not a single character in written fiction who speaks realistically, because it isn't physically possible to replicate natural speech through the written word. Thought doesn't work IRL the way it does in fiction either, it isn't nicely organized and it often isn't even in sentence form.

People overlook this in most fiction because most authors are writing characters who are like most people. When you create a fictional version of an exceptionally gifted child, you give that character a fictionalized voice and a fictionalized inner narrator just like you'd give any other character. So those who /were/ gifted children see the character as realistic, but everybody else sees an author who doesn't know how to "children" correctly.

The following may be controversial. I am not interested in hearing anyone explain the invalidity of IQ as a measure of intellectual capability, I've already heard those arguments, if I didn't find them convincing the first time I'm not going to magically become convinced just because someone on reddit parroted them back at me again.

One out of six people has an IQ between 115 and 130. That ranges from "noticeably above average" to "pretty damn smart." That also ranges from "smarter than 85% of all other persons they've ever interacted with" to "smarter than 97.5% of all other persons they've ever interacted with." These are people who did well in advanced classes if they were inclined to take them. I think a lot of the pushback comes from that range in particular, noticeably more so than people who are closer to average.

I think they think something like, "I'm pretty damn smart myself, so how much smarter than me could a genius /really/ be, anyways? I'm a Smart Person™. If I applied myself, I'd be capable of the same things as so called "geniuses," I just place value on things that are actually important and they're just "booksmart." I'm [[mistakenly]] confident that my own inner experience of childhood maps onto the inner experience of a gifted child accurately enough to make the comparison. This depiction of Harry doesn't resonate with me, I don't recognize myself in this character. The author of this character, even if his IQ /is/ higher than mine, can't /really/ be all that much smarter than me because I already know how smart I am and I'm the smartest person I've ever met. He must just be one of those arrogant pricks who thinks having a higher IQ means they're smarter than me. That's why he wrote his character to be so arrogant. Just look at how obviously arrogant HJPEV is, speaking in a way I didn't speak at that age and thinking in a way I didn't think at that age and knowing things I didn't know at that age and just generally being capable of more than what I was capable of at that age. How utterly arrogant must HJPEV's author be to /dare/ allege that an 11 year old could be capable of more than what /I/ was capable of at age 11?"

I really genuinely believe that the vast majority of humans - even if mostly subconsciously - believe that their own brain is The Most Intelligent Brain™, and that any other human behaving in a way that would falsify this belief is putting on an act because they're uppity and mistakenly believe that /they/ are the one who possesses The Most Intelligent Brain™, which "obviously" can't be true. That's the reason gifted people are almost universally labeled "arrogant" at some point in their lives by somebody or other, because the ones assigning that label are too arrogant to truly internalize the fact that other people might actually be capable of something the labeler /isn't/ capable of.

  Sometimes when you say something is not believable, that tells others more about you than it tells them about the world.
