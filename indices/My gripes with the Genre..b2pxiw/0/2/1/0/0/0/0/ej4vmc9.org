  I face palmed when the author then made Arthur into a molester later on. Basically just an excuse to make Arthur less sympathetic by exaggerating the flaws he had on Earth.

  Considering that Aerb probably exists to fulfill Joon's fantasies, this is especially suspect. So if it turns out that it really was just to assuage Joons guilt then that would actually be interesting writing.

Eh, I'd argue that Aerb is more of a dark version of wish fulfilment. He gets his world where he can be a badass super warrior but just like real life it has really shitty implications and when you live your desires it turns out you don't actually want it or don't want to want it.

Joon wants his best friend back and wants to feel less guilty about what he did, so he finds himself in a world where those things work together in a way that really just makes Joon more unhappy.
