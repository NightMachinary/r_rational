:END:

It's hard to say so far. I think it depends on how the ending plays out as to whether it ends up staying as a dark type of wish fulfillment or ends up as just regular wish fulfillment played straight. Or with the wish fulfillment parts of Aerb fading (i.e. all of Joon's harem no longer interested in him anymore, Arthur is confirmed dead at the end, etc. ) but Joon manages to improve on his flaws and be at peace with himself despite not getting that wish fulfillment any more, and works towards building a happy life in ways that don't involve dwelling on the past.
