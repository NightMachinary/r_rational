By his own admission, Juniper was a horrible shitbag back on Earth. He stabs his best friend Arthur in the back by stealing his crush, Tiff, and doesn't even have the common decency to tell him. When Arthur dies, Joon goes into a self-destructive spiral where he alienates all his other friends. He makes up grimdark, hopeless, edgelord campaigns, and inflicts them on his friends because he is angry at the world. He gets into a fight with Reimer over his relationship with Tiff, then gets back at him by killing his character 8 times in one session. He abandons Tiff when she needs him the most, because his depressed ass doesn't feel like he deserves to be happy. He assaults Victor Clark over a sympathetic platitude and gets arrested for it. He fucks Craig's 15-year-old sister, Maddie, whom he doesn't even like, and again keeps it secret until Craig confronts him. He /tries to kill himself/; how do you think his parents would have felt about their high schooler doing that?

To a large extent, /Worth the Candle/ is the story of Juniper learning to be a better person. There's a /reason/ why he is being forced to confront his inner demons come to life on Aerb.
