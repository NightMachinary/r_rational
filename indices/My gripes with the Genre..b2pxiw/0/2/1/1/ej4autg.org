I understand what you're saying but that all occurs in the time before Juniper arrives on Aerb. I'm saying the June we encounter from the beginning of the story onwards doesn't seem like a shitty person. He makes mistakes and incorrect choices, as anyone would, but he does seem to do pretty well at being an ok human being for the vast majority of WtC. He definitely has his flaws; I just don't think he qualifies as a "shitty person" during the story.
