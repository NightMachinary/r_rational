FWIW, the chronologically youngest dialogue in WtC is when Juniper is 10 years old, which lasts for a single scene, and there I /did/ make an effort to make sure that the vocabulary/syntax was toned way down, with the exception of some words that are the kind you could pick up from reading YA fantasy. (e.g. "tome", "repent", etc.) That's chapter 83, ctrl+F "the necromancer". YMMV on whether it works well or not.
