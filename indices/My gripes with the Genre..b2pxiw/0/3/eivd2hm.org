I enjoy the series but it has a lot of the same problems.

The only people I have ever heard have dialogue remotely close to anything like these teens from Kansas are extremely few and sometimes still not at their level.

What I'm saying is the teenage dialogue is completely off putting to me. I was friends with a few philosophy Phds while I was in undergrad and they are the only people who came remotely close to the vocab and rhetorical analysys that these 12-17 year old kids from Kansas had. It took a lot of effort to look past.

Overall it's a good read but for definitly has a lot of flaws that I have to actively ignore and look past to enjoy
