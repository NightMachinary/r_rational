  bad people don't tend to give a shit when they hurt people. That's what, in my opinion at least, defines a "bad person".

We can't really know though. A lot of people might do bad things and then actually realise they were bad but still never learn and keep doing them. Or indulge in things they know are bad just like one could indulge in a vice, except smoking or overeating don't rely on hurting others. Sure, there are psychopath, but there are also plenty of people who are just too stupid, stubborn or weak to stop hurting others with their actions despite being aware that they're hurting others. Not as bad, perhaps, but also hard to sympathise with.
