  I'm so confused. Juniper /really/ isn't a particularly bad person... Like at all.

I think the confusion you're experiencing is because Juniper isn't usually acting with the /intention/ of doing bad things. He's not a psychopath who derives pleasure from harming others. But a number of his actions are selfish and/or thoughtless and end up hurting others. He's like a lot of teenagers I've known - someone who acts without thinking through the consequences and winds up causing harm. As those teenagers matured and became adults, a lot of them would look back at their behavior as teens and go "Damn, I was a real prick." Juniper is not quite at that point, but he's moving toward it, IMO.

Examples of how he's been a bad person would include how he used Maddie, pushed his friends away, abandoned that nameless girl at the beginning of the story, the way he originally treated Grak, things he'd say that hurt/upset Fenn, etc. His goal wasn't to hurt other people for most of these, but the result of his actions were that people got hurt.
