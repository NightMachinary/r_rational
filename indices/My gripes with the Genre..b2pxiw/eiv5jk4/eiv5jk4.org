Well its a mix of power fantasy and rationalist fiction. To avoid the teenager part, and the never fail part, checkout the dresden files. If you dislike the more direct power fantasy, the only thing which is close is the standard objectivist fiction loop of "good"/reasonable adult -> bad things and suppressed for and with reasonable reasons -> overcomes by hard work and virtue -> suppressed for idiotic reasons and ways -> acts like asshole and never changes his mind, win by deus ex machina. If you only read the first three thats pretty good. Say the first few of the terry goodkind series. That said I totally get what you mean, if you actually find something please let me know. Im so tired of the younger and younger people beeing mc in fiction in general, especially the new star trek, it basically means everyone must be a borderline superhero, and it never shows someone who achieved something by working hard for a lifetime. That said I do appreciate that hpmor shows that harrys petty powerplays directly results in hermiones death. Though he does draw the wrong lesson from that, despite quirells best efforts in teaching him to lose.\\
There is another issue with rationalist fiction, its mysteries are meant to be solved and this has ... unfortunate consequences. The reader, or at least the character must receive sufficient information to make informed decisions. Consider the classic detective story trope of five people on a speeding train, deduce which are lying about what and who could and couldnt have murdered the sixth. Conclude who did it, they confess or reveal themselves to prove the point ... But now imagine no one did it, in actually Kirk transported down from the enterprise out of sight, kills someone, overacts a line, and transports back. No information or hint that this is possible needs to be available, the mystery simply is unsolvable, and the rational character would do his best, follow all best practices and still either conclude s/he does not know, or worse still makes a convincing case to have someone convicted, but remains privately unsure or worse still fails to realize he did couldnt have known. This type of failure is extremely common when you approach real problems and people grow from, not overcoming the failure, but by trying again for the next problem despite this .
