Well, your other comment in this thread was an assertion that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is full of "nice guy" types, and the written word lacks any of the inflection or body language that we use to interpret intent, so I misinterpreted your single-word reaction of "cute" and figured there was a sarcastic intent behind it with an insinuation of disagreement.
