Hi Daystar! First of all, I love your story and your podcast. That being said, I want to try to offer some constructive criticism here.

No matter how well he's written, it's a fact that there /will/ be people who don't like Red's personality. That being said, these people can still love the story. I would argue one of the greatest strengths of OOS is that it has an ensemble cast with depth. OOS really has three protagonists and you seem like you could pass an ideological turing test for all three of them.

However, this isn't really conveyed at the beginning of the story. I feel like the beginning sets the story up as being about mostly about Red, which could turn off readers who don't like Red very much. I would suggest, if you have the time, rewriting the beginning of the story to better reflect the content of the rest of OOS.

(Disclaimer: You mentioned in your podcast that you've rewritten the beginning before and I'm not sure which iteration was the one I read, so for all I know, you've already done all this.)

Thank you for reading this and I look foreward to reading your next chapter!
