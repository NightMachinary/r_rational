I'm noticing myself feeling somewhat defensive, so take this comment with a handful of salt, but since you explicitly bring up my story and then ask whether your gripes are justified or if you're missing some key part of it, I'm going to try to respond respectfully and see if there is in fact something you're missing.

  but they spend their entire time spouting logical fallacies and [[/r/iamverysmart]]-esque dialogue.

So if you actually go to the sub, you see a bunch of people talking about how smart they are, or putting down others for being dumb, or bragging about accomplishments, or just assertions of being extraordinary. Hence the title of the subreddit.

But I can't really remember Red doing this at any point. Can you point to any? He does use big words and talk about intellectual topics, yes, and he does bring up logical fallacies, but those seem like a strange thing to be upset about. In any case if you just don't find any value in that, then you're probably looking more for rational stories than rational/ist/ stories.

  They are both obsessed with their little list of how to conduct a proper experiment that those stupid adults haven't thought of.
#+end_quote

Can you point to instances of this obsession for Red? The few times he's questioned whether adults have thought of some experiment he rather quickly realized he was wrong, with the exception of when he had access to technology others haven't had yet.

  There doesn't seem to be any growth, I felt as i grew up I realised how little I actually knew and saying occam's razor doesn't make you a genius.

What chapter did you stop reading at? I don't know where the reasonable expectation of character growth is supposed to be in a story, maybe you're expecting them to overcome their flaws by 5 or 10 chapters in, but unless I know how far into the story you've gotten it's hard to point out what you might have missed.

  But they barrel ahead and the only setbacks seem to be them being over confident and they need to go back to their rules that they carelessly disregarded.

Can you name some instances of Red doing this?

  By the time they are 13 they have already overthrown hundreds of years of magical theory because no-one knows how to conduct proper experiments. It just feels like fan-fiction for 15 year olds.

Well neither Harry or Red ever reach age 13 in-story, so I'm assuming this is a hypothetical, but you seem to be upset here that protagonists in a story might be able to accomplish something extraordinary because basically everyone else is dumb. Which would be fair if that's what actually happens, but in HPMOR the reason Harry is able to make unique discoveries is that he's the only wizard who was taught the scientific method or is well versed in scientific discoveries /at all,/ while in OOS Red has an enormous amount of help from his mentors, one of whom is the foremost pokemon researcher in the Region and world, and still only manages to make a single, relatively minor discovery after 66 chapters.

Also, it's worth noting they're fanfic of stories where many things /weren't/ discovered or /don't/ make sense that try to explain why. If it feels like fanfiction for 15 year olds, then I'm assuming you're asserting that by the age of 15 you noticed all these nonsensical things in Harry Potter and Pokemon and already came up with better explanations for why they work that way? If not, I think you rather have missed the point of them, yes.
