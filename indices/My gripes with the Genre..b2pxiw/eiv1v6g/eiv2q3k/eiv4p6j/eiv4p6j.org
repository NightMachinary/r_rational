Average people are smart enough to recognize that other average people use big words to try to show off how smart they are. They generalize that out to "/no one/ who speaks in a more complex manner than myself is actually smarter than I am, they're just speaking that way to try to /appear/ smart" because they aren't smart enough to tell the difference between competent use of language versus sesquipedalian loquaciousness.
