It's just a rewording of the Dunning-Kruger effect. People who lack competence in any given area lack the competence necessary to recognize both the competence of others and their own lack of competence. It's just a fact.

The people who accuse "smart people" of "using big words" genuinely believe that "smart people" do it on purpose to show off, and don't understand that some people learned to read before age 2 and were reading 300+ page books before kindergarten and /of course/ most of the people like that have a more expansive vocabulary etched into their brains than most of the people who learned how to read at age 6.

All people see is "people who try to emulate having a broad vocabulary by incorrectly using words that they don't fully understand," and "people who /actually/ have a broad vocabulary." Not having a broad vocabulary themselves, they can't tell the difference, it all looks the same to them.

It's the same reason why some people mistakenly believe - for example - things like climate change being up for debate, or illegal immigrants causing measles to spread or whatever. They see so-called "experts" using falsehoods and misinformation to support their arguments against the reality of climate change, and they see /actual/ experts using facts to state the fact of the reality of climate change. Not being experts themselves, they can't tell the difference, they just trust whoever the talking head on their television tells them to trust.

Most people think /very highly/ of their own ability to discern or perceive or reason or understand, and somehow /they/ aren't the ones who are arrogant, it's everybody who disagrees with them or who speaks differently than them or whatever. /Funny,/ that.
