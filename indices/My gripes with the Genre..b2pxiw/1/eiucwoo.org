There are a good number of works that are often recommended here that I think would fit what you're looking for (Consistent worldbuilding, consistent powers/abilities, no lectures).

Of those, the one I'm most familiar with is [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][Worm]], which I highly recommend. It's a superhero/supervillain story with interesting powers that have consistent limitations (so the exact opposite of The Flash). Even seemingly simple powers like enhanced strength or durability have clever nuances that allow the users to get creative with them in believable ways.

Unlike rational fiction, the main character is not being set up by the author as someone who the reader should emulate. She's a complicated character making hard decisions, and those decisions aren't always the right one. There's a whole "road to hell paved with good intentions" thing going on.
