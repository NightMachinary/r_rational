I wanted to like worm, but I suffered from the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightDeadlyWords][I don't care what happens to these people]] problem due to the mixed morality motivations of a lot of the characters. Maybe it's just me, but I find it really hard to rally around a character I don't like very much, especially when they're honestly a bit thick like she is.
