It's not just that there are no editors, it's that once written, there's a large pressure to not go back and edit old chapters to trim them down if certain things become irrelevant, or to streamline the plot once the author knows more fully where it's going. Pacing is, IMO, one of the hardest things to get right in a web serial, and it's something that even the best web serials routinely fail at.
