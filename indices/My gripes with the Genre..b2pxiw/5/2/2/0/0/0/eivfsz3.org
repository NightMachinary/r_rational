The point is that if the story hasn't reasonably gotten its legs by chapter 10 the author has already failed. A story can always improve later of course but if the first 10 chapters are bad, it's a sign that the story taken as a whole /still/ fails. I see little reason to excuse such stories when the publishing medium inherently allows re-editing / rewriting the start once the author has "found their voice". If the authors are not willing to do that, the readers or reviewers are in no way obligated to give them any slack either.

TL;DR: Having a story take one or two chapters to get going is fine. Not managing that in 10 chapters is a sign of poor writing.
