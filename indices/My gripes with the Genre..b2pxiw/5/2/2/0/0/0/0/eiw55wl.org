You make rewrites of beginning chapters sound like a very normalized thing for online serial fiction, and I can't help but disagree. The only times I can remember an author going back and rewriting the first few chapters is when the story was already finished and they're doing a full editing pass or the first chapters were /extremely/ bad, and neither case is very common, even among works that I believe do have talented and dedicated authors.

It'd be fair to make the argument that these things /should/ happen more often than they do, I believe, but it sounds like you are expecting it from authors like it's already the standard and deviation from it is a sign of excessive laziness or lack of investment, which feels pretty rude and disrespectful.
