You're begging the question a bit. Of course when you put it that way there's no way to disagree with your perfectly reasonable point that reading "countless chapters of poor quality writing" is a bad idea.

But the truth is it's often a continuum and everyone has their own thresholds. Some people won't read a story unless it starts golden. Some people are willing to give a story a chance to get its legs. Everyone should feel entitled to putting a story down whenever they feel like it's not worth further investment, but that's not the same thing as judging a story by its beginning, which is what I wanted to make sure the person I responded to wasn't doing.

Anyone who actually reads 300k words of a story to get to what they'd just consider "pretty ok" has got way more free time than I do, and I doubt they'd stick around a subreddit like this for long.
