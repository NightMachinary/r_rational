Have you read Twig? It's my favorite of Wildbow's stories, and is pretty great from the beginning. The setting is an alternative history where bio-engineering took off in a big way, so think Steampunk America but instead of steam powered metal horses and tesla guns, the horses are re-animated zombies and the special weapons are all bio-engineered monsters.
