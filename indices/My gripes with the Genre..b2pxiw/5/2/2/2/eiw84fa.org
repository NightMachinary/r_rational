I have read till the end of the cruise ship plot and I had to literally decide that in my headcannon that the planet your story is set in takes 25% longer to rotate around its sun. Twelve year old humans don't have mature enough brains for neither the rationality nor even the specific type of irrationality that your protagonists display. No matter what kind of social conventions exist in your world. So aging them up to being biologically equivalent to 15 year olds was the only way to repair my suspension of disbelief.

And yet I still haven't gotten back to reading your first Endbringer arc.
