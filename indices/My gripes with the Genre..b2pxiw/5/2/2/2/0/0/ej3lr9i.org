Out of curiosity, why didn't you just rewrite the scenario so that Pokemon trainers start their journeys at 18 instead of 11? It seems to me that the reason Pokemon trainers start at 11 in canon is because Game Freak wanted to sell the games to 11 year olds, not because it makes sense in context.

Even given the setting of Origin of Species, I could see children beginning their formal training on handling and battling Pokemon at age 11 and even being pressed into emergency service when a Stormbringer attacks, but it still seems like it'd be more sensible to restrict independent journeying until 18.

I suppose the flip side is that societies only really invest in that kind of controlled environment learning for their children when they are rich, stable, and have industry developed enough that the extra skill acquired in further education can be put to good use. If the setting of OoS is meant to imply that general life expectancy is too short to afford that kind of investment, it might make sense to end formal schooling/training by 10-11 and let gifted students find further tutelage in Gyms.
