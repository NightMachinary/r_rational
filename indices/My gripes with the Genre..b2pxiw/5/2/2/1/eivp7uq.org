Thanks for the reply! I think I'll give it another shot over the next week.

This is all subjective, of course: I do believe HPMOR was intelligently written, don't get me wrong on that. Likely one of the smartest fictions I've ever read. The problem, at least to me, was that it seemed to make every other character an idiot (apart from voldemort) if they didn't use formally defined ('big words') logic. In my experience, most people are entirely familiar with, and naturally use, logical concepts such as explained in the book, such as basic Bayesian statistics or proofs. It's been too long and I'm at work at the moment, so I can't pull better examples. It's always useful to put a word to the concept, but the story (or at least HPJEV) treated them as if they were one and the same. Like, if a character didn't know what Baye's theorem was, they just wouldn't have been able to do the math to calculate a result, despite it being fairly intuitive even without knowing of it. I could be entirely misremembering this, and if so, don't go through too much effort to prove me wrong, I'll take your word for it pretty easily. Obviously Harry isn't supposed to be a super lovable protagonist, and I can't put all the blame on Yudkowsky as a person, but my feelings were that I was getting some authorial ego on top of the protagonists.
