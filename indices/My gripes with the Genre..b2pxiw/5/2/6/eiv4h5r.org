  I enjoyed HPMOR after some getting used to: The idea of long intelligent fiction was extremely exciting to me. I got over the mouthpiecing and 'obviously not a 12 year old', but it feels like the author never got over the 'big words, philosophy = intelligence' stage that lots of teenagers go through.

The author also believes that he personally is going to save the world from certain doom, so there's... *ahem* a lot of /psychology/ going on in that story.
