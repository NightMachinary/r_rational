I don't know, I think Zorian spends the early part of MoL being a pretty believable arse to his relatives and... everyone else, really, and then spends a reasonable chunk of time running around in anguish while expecting Red Robe to appear. The end result of his emotional development is what I find the weakest---I understand why he'd end up as this incredibly grounded person given he survived the time loop, but that shouldn't feel like an absence of emotional reactions from the inside, and that's how his perspective looks like in the recent chapters. But I don't think it's fair to say there's no emotional development at all.

This is somewhat obscured by the glacial pace of the releases, I think. (Glacial in comparison to my reading speed, not in comparison to any hypothetical ideal writing speed.) At least for me the development is much clearer on a reread. It's difficult to keep track of subtle large-scale undercurrents when you can and do read several complete books or serials in the time between the chapters.
