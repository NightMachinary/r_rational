I'd say this sub started off primarily for that sort of [[/r/iamverysmart]] type stories, but it's really evolved into a web fiction subreddit that's more for stories published on the internet than particularly intelligent stories. You seem to just want the quality web fiction.

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] is great, it's a semi-realistic portrayal of "what if people got super powers".

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] Literary tropes have real power in this world, and the main character gets recruited to the Dark side.

I also recommend just browsing topwebfiction.com
