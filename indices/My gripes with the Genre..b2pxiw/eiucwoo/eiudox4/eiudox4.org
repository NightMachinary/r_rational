I've seen Worm recommended a fair amount before but never got round to looking at it. I'll give it a go thanks.

I was thinking of mentioning the Flash tv show as an example, it is absolutely terrible for it. I find it hard to imagine a problem that can't be solved with super speed but he manages to get beaten by a guy with a cold gun. While like 5 times per episode the bad guy manages to run away from him and he is just like 'oh well maybe next time'.
