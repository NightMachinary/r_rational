Speaking of the exact opposite of The Flash, let me plug Flicker from the [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][Fall of Doc Future]] novel series. If you want to read about a super-speed character who both understands and obeys the laws of general relativity, that's best-in-class. It will, unfortunately, ruin all super-speedster stories for you in the future, but if you're as frustrated by The Flash's TV show as I am, it's probably too late for that.

It does have similar problems with over-smart protagonists, but they're not kids. The characters don't run [[/r/iamverysmart]] "proper" experiments on-screen, but that's more because they've already figured out their powers off-screen in non-emergency situations, like any reasonable person would.
