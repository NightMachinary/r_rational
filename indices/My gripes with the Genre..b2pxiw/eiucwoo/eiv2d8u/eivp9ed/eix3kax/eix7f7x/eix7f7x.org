To be honest you probably should read Worm first. You know how series like the Dresden Files have short recaps to allow people to jump in at any time in the series? yeah Ward unfortunately doesn't really do that, there's a lot of stuff that's referenced that makes sense if you've read Worm, but isn't directly explained.

One of the main events that effects Ward's main character's personality and actions happens in Worm, and due to how traumitizing it was she doesn't really think about it in depth, preferring to kind of skirt around it.
