I see how you could say that for hpmor, even if I disagree. But OoS doesn't seem to fit it at all in any way.

And In both cases the characters do know their stuff most of the time , as opposed to just saying half understood technical terms to sound smart.

While just knowing about bayesian statistics, and biases, or goal factoring or whatever doesn't always help you actually be correct (like Harry learnt in the end) it does sometimes.

Also, while overconfidence is a problem heuristics like "adults always know better" or "somebody would have though about it before " don't always work. Underconfidence is also a problem.

Even in my own life I have sometimes avoided doing something out of that kind of consideration(plus lazyness), asuming that if something hasn't been done before there must be a reason. Only for someone else to do it some time latter, showing that I could have totally done it.

And In stories it might actually be the case that the relevant adults don't actually know how to design a proper experiment. In wich case you should try to exploit that. Not doing so would be the stupid decision.
