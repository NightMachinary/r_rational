I would prefer fewer of the [[/r/iamverysmart]] references. That subreddit feels toxic and much too easily applied to anything resembling insufficiently humble intellectual activity; it's a force that serves primarily to make it socially costly to say intelligent things or speak honestly about thinking. It's a trope I consider to be unusually destructive, and I'd rather it not start infecting conversations that it doesn't have to.

When you have a criticism of what these protagonists are saying, you'd be better off putting it in words.
