#1 & #2 are absolutely the most common type on this sub. It's basically a coin flip, but sometimes the coin lands sideways and you end up with Worm, PGTE, MoL, or WtC.

I enjoyed HPMOR after some getting used to: The idea of long intelligent fiction was extremely exciting to me. I got over the mouthpiecing and 'obviously not a 12 year old', but it feels like the author never got over the 'big words, philosophy = intelligence' stage that lots of teenagers go through.

I really /really/ wanted to enjoy Pokemon: OoS, but I just couldn't. Pokemon Game of Champions (not really 'rational', but worldbuilding + character voice were best-in-class) left too big of an imprint on my idea of what a fanfic could be that I got my hopes up. Characters just felt weird, all the scientific explanations felt so forced, I just had to drop it. I'd like to go into more detail, but it was a long time ago and I don't want to say anything incorrect about it. I'd try it again if it got better, I only made it to chapter 10 or so. I don't mean to imply this or HPMOR are bad, but I just wasn't into them.

If a better sub existed for good webnovels, rational or not, I would be very interested. Sadly, this seems to be the best community for it, with all the pros and cons that brings.
