  I've actually been meaning to ask for recs for stories that start good since the beginning and have absolutely nothing to do with superheroes, cartoons or anime.

/Worth the Candle/ is good from the beginning has none of those things, although it /is/ a deconstruction of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai][Isekai]], an anime/manga/light novel genre. On the other hand, Isekai is just the Eastern version of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld][portal fantasy]], so if you are familiar with Western examples (/Oz/, /Narnia/, etc...) you should know enough to understand the serial.
