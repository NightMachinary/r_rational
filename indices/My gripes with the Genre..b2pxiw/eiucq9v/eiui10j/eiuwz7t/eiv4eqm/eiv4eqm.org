  you're over 4 years behind on where the story/characters/quality of the story is now.

I see this defense (for whatever story, not picking on you specifically) come up every now and then but I think it misses the fact that /you're still forced to read through countless chapters of poor quality writing/. Considering how pretty much none of the stories posted here have proper editors who'd fix more than typoes / grammar (and mostly not even that!), even the "good parts" are rarely /that/ great.

"Yes, the story starts out crap but after 300k words it gets pretty ok" is usually much closer to the truth. Now how attractive does that actually sound if you look at it from an outsider perspective?
