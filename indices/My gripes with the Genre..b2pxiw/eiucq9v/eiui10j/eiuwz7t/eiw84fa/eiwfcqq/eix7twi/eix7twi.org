Funnily enough, the education level doesn't surprise me. Standard education in our world is garbage, especially for overachievers. I didn't learn anything new in STEM type classes until my second year of middle school because I already learned everything on my own from books or the internet. Imagine where I would be if a genius professor had taken the time to personally tutor me from the start, without a thought about what I "ought" to know. And I was not a child prodigy.
