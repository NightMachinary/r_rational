Haven't read Hero's War yet, so can't speak on that one, but good point on MoL, characterization is definitely its weakest feature for me and this is a large reason why. Zorian often feels like a robot whose only emotion is annoyance, with maybe occasional mild awkwardness or envy. It's also not explicitly a rational story, but I won't No True Scotsman it since it's very popular on this sub.
