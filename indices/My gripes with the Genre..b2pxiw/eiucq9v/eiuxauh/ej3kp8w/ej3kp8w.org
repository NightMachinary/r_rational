Personally I find most of the characters in Mother of Learning disturbingly unemotional, Zorian most of all. Some, like Zach or Taivan are more expressive, but I'm struggling to think of any situation where a major character does something of consequence because they are in that moment angry, sad, scared, or even happy. The closest I can think of is Zorian's simulacrum indulging Kirielle, and Zorian spends the remainder of the chapter complaining about that, IIRC.

On the second point, the biggest offender I can think of is A Hero's War. It's better than a 12-year old science hero, but being a MatSci grad student does not make you a one-man industrial revolution capable of re-inventing a good chunk of modern engineering using a mostly new, magic-based system of physics.
