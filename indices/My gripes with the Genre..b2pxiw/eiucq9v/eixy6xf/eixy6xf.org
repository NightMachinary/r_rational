The [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/baTWMegR42PAsH9qJ/generalizing-from-one-example][typical mind fallacy]] is always worth looking out for. Yudkowsky isn't neurotypical, and his traits seem shared with a lot of the LessWrong crowd. It's less that he's forgetting what the base state is than that he just lives in a mind that works differently to yours. I personally find that EY's characters feel more alive than anything else I've read, and although I've certainly lived your â€˜base state of a human being', it does not seem to be my base state.
