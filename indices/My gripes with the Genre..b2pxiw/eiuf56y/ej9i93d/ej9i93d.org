Well, HPMOR basically founded the genre. And really, it was written as much as fanfiction as to be a vehicle for EY's own ideas and theories about rationality, which means it really gets a bit pamphlet-y at times. I still enjoyed it a lot but I won't lie, sometimes I would just skim over Harry's rants. I enjoyed the plot, the take on the magical world, the clever battles involving the Armies, and the occasional joke at the expense of the canon. And Minerva McGonagall. Poor Minerva McGonagall.
