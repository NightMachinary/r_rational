Sure, if the author explicitly sets out to depict stereotypical naive booksmart kid on the autism spectrum, the HPMOR approach works. Thing is, that kind of protagonist restricts the story and readership pretty heavily. Most people consider reading about such characters as annoying as those characters often are in real life (as evidenced by the recurring criticism about them in rationalfics).

There's a reason for the common "show, don't tell" advice. Mature actually smart people /solve problems smarter/ instead of constantly trying to publicly advertising their smartness.
