This is hard to express and even harder to prove but accurate. I can vividly remember an argument with a teacher over whether a kid in a book was a well written unusual child or a badly written adult in a child's body. The teacher's point was that few adults thought in that particular manner, and mine was that I was a grade school kid sitting right there saying that I did think like that. Decades later, it's impossible to prove I thought like that unless I come across an illuminating journal entry or home video.

Some kids are weirdly clever. If you never run into one, it's easy to dismiss depictions of them as unrealistic. I've never seen an emu, I don't think anyone I know has seen an emu, and frankly the idea of a bird as tall as I am seems pretty unrealistic. Nevertheless, the Emu War is a thing that happened in the real world. Sometimes when you say something is not believable, that tells others more about you than it tells them about the world.
