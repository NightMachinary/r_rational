Believable to /who?/

For at least the first year after I started reading HPMOR, I was blissfully unaware of anything outside of the text itself, didn't know who EY was, didn't use reddit, didn't read anything on the internet relating to HPMOR. Free of the influence of others' opinions, I never /once/ thought to myself "wow, this version of Harry sure is unrealistic, the author has no idea what real children are like." I thought "wow, this is kinda like a slightly more mature version of what /I/ was like from ages 7 to 10, the author really nailed the behavior of kids who recreationally read encyclopedias."
