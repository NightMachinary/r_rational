throw an extremely smart person and an extremely strong person into a room and have them fight. who wins 9/10 times?

now enter self-insert uber smart Rational-Fic characters being thrown into a room being forced to fight an extremely strong person.

They Notice a Tattoo on the bruisers arm, have a photographic memory of all gangs and their insignia in the local area, intimate that they are a close personal confidant of the gangs leader and not only does this let them avoid the fight but the bruiser assists them in escaping the whole situation without ever.... idk pulling out the settings equivalent of a cellphone and talking to their boss?

The MC hears the Bruiser muttering under their breath, and has been studying the worlds languages since the age of eight, responds with the second half of the obscure tribal chant that holds great personal significance to the bruiser, plays out the same as situation one.

the MC notices the bruiser favoring their left leg(despite having no formal training or brawling experience), intuits that this means the bruiser can be disabled with precise skillful strikes to that area, proceeds to deliver said strikes with surgical precision(despite relative* lack of experience and Total* lack of experience)

MC notices that some of the rebar that forms the makeshift windows in the room/arena is loose and turns it into not only an impromptu spear to slay the bruiser, but a crude prybar or pick to loosen the other bars thus providing them with an escape route.

notice what all these scenarios have in common? the MC isn't intelligent, literally nothing and nobody else in the setting is allowed to have agency unless it directly aids the MC in some manner.

that's why people criticize "smart" characters in the manner they do. not because they're smart, because 9/10 times they're pretty dumb but in a setting where even their limited actual intelligence translates to superpowers.

smart characters making smart choices is criticized rarely here from what i can see, but authors insisting they've written a smart character is another thing entirely.
