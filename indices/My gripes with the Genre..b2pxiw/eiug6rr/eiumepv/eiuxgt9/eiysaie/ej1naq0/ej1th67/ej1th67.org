That's exactly why I called Sherlock Holmes out. It's ostensibly a story about an extremely observant, well-read, and clever man, but it just turns out he was handed a copy of the script just before the opening.

As for Harry, I hear your arguments, but he's literally 11 and up against a wizard cop. I'm all for not underestimating children (and I even agree it /mostly/ works in the story!) but it definitely comes across as "now enter self-insert uber smart Rational-Fic character being thrown into a room being forced to fight an extremely strong person"
