He's not the first person to come up with a Patronus 2.0, the Invisibility cloak is very strong confirmation of that. Those who do don't share the knowledge, because it would cause a normal Patronus to fail. I find partial transfiguration a bit more of a stretch. However, I think you're discounting the fact that the author set up a world where sharing knowledge is significantly more difficult than ours, which means that everyone starts more simple and there's negative technological progress through the years.

That said, the story would have worked better had it taken place over a couple of years, for several reasons.
