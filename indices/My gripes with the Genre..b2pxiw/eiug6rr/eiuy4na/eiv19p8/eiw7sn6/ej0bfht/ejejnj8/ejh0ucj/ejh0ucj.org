The whole end chapter with the secret motto of the peverell's, "the final enemy is death," and the fact that the invisibility cloak is made out of a dementor's cloak seem pretty strong evidence that he is not the first to tread this path. Otherwise they would have had to have a different way to kill a dementor.
