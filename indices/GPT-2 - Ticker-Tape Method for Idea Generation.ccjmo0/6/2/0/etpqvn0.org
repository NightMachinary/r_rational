No, I typically don't vote on comments that aren't part of a conversation I'm having. The only post I've voted on in this thread is [[/u/Iwasahipsterbefore]] 's, because it was funny for me, too.

Of course, I can't offer any evidence of this that isn't something that a vote-manipulator could have trivially falsified. That's sort of the problem, here. Accusations are cheap, but the only defense I could offer that would have the aegis of credibility would be to offer up the account credentials to this account and all my banking and payment accounts, to show I hadn't purchased upvotes.

The best option is therefore silence. I'm taking a slightly worse one to satisfy a desire to explain.
