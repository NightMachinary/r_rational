The third story of the Pisa Cycle has to do with the arrival of the Prince of Hell in Pisa. It's title is "The Prince of Hell" and the opening scene is of the Prince sailing on a ship with four slaves, which eventually takes them to a large temple, where the God of Knowledge, Ketheria, dwells. He enters the temple, and desecrates a large statue of Ketheria, enraging the priests. Ketheria then uses his power to turn the entire temple into water, and attempts to drown them all out of sheer rage, but the Prince of Hell merely snaps his fingers, and all the water is gone. Ketheria then appears at the Prince's feet, bound by his evil power.

The Prince demands that Ketheria reveal to him the human who threatened his life. Ketheria despises the Prince, but is terrified, and tells him that it was an orphan named Luigi who lives in Pisa. The prince of hell is perplexed, because orphans are usually too weak to draw his notice, but he dismisses the incongruity. After sending Ketheria to hell to be tortured for a one hundred thousand years for defying him, the Prince of Hell returns to his ships, and sets off for Pisa.

After making landfall at the port of Livorno, the Prince of Hell arrives in Pisa with his four slaves, wearing the disguise of a catholic priest. The disguise was sewn from the skin of such a priest, who had offered the Prince a place to rest the night previous, unaware of who the Prince was. Searching for Luigi, they find no trace of him; so the Prince and his four slaves begin looking for known associates who might be able to help the Prince and his slaves with their mission. They find three: Tinti Majorana, the surgeon who had saved Luigi; Italo Majorana, the guard who had freed Luigi; and finally, the criminal Enrico, who had been severely crippled by the beating the Luigi gave him. Tinti and Italo refuse to give the Prince of Hell any information about Luigi, but Enrico is eager for revenge and offers to tell the Prince everything that he knows. The Prince graciously accepts Enrico's offer, and then tortures the Majoranas until they talk. In the end, he uses too much of his infernal power, and they realise that he is a devil. They lie to him about Luigi's whereabouts, misleading him.

Unaware that he has been decieved, the Prince kills the Majoranas and sets off in the direction of the Vatican - but not before healing Enrico, so that Enrico can follow him and get his own revenge. This ends the third story.

The fourth story of the Pisa Cycle is titled 'The Last Night', and is based on a story told by Luigi. It takes place during Luigi and Lucino's final preparations to enter Maxime's lair. The story opens with Luigi and Lucino sitting in front of a campfire. They have a warm conversation, and after the two are finished speaking about what's to be done, Lucino asks Luigi how he plans to overcome Maxime's sorcery. Luigi replies that, though he has never fought a sorceror, they are common figures in the legends told in Pisa. Those legends tell of the many powers that sorcerors have, but also, of their fatal weaknesses. Lucino replies that the greatest sorceror ever, named Lancer, lived long before the year 3000 BC, and that he also possessed an incredible power that was impossible to be overcome.

Luigi concedes that the greatest sorcerors are impossible to overcome, but then adds that he's fairly sure that Maxime is far from great. The myths of Pisa tell of what a great sorceror can do. Luigi then tells Lucino the tale of the greatest sorceror known in the myths of Pisa. This sorceror was a woman named Ismael. Ismael was a daughter of Ra, one of the most ancient of the heathen gods and was one of the three demigods who ruled over the realm of Italia many thousands of years ago.

Ismael, not content to be a demigod, sought to learn the power of sorcery. She would travel in the guise of a man and engage the services of various so-called "masters of the art", but none of them had enough wisdom to teach her the secrets she craved. Finally, after many years she grew disgusted with mortals, and began to craft a scheme to gain the wisdom of the one teacher who had the knowledge she sought: Hecate, the Goddess of Magic.

The plan took many years to come to fruition. Ismael, who was a ruler of many nations, used the multitudes under her command to build great sorcerous engines. For she did not know the secrets of true power, but she even paltry knowledge can yield great results with enough sacrifice to make up the difference.

Finally, after 108 years of preparation, the trap was ready, and Ismael summoned Hecate for what was to be her last rite before death. The goddess appeared with a crack of thunder in a pillar of wyrdflame, enraged at the presumption of the half-mortal Ismael. Thoughtlessly, Hecate struck the demigoddess down - and then, Ismael's trap was sprung. For in that place, all who harmed Ismael were harmed equally in turn. Because Ismael had been killed, Hecate also had to die! Such was the nature of the rites that Ismael had performed there. But a goddess cannot physically die - and so Hecate lost her identity, and Ismael's soul poured into her. Thus, Ismael gained Hecate's body and knowledge, and became a true immortal.

Lucino admits that Ismael is a terrifying figure, but asks what the point is. Luigi replies that it should be obvious - Ismael, a demigoddess from the time when the heathen gods still alighted on soil mortal, needed a century to overcome the weaknesses of a sorceror. How could the lowly Maxime have done anything of the sort? This question lifts Lucino's spirits considerably. After a moment of content silence, he asks Luigi what became of Ismael. Luigi reveals that she still exists to this day, living in a dark fortress in the land of Ur. Her evil sorceries are still operating, and Ismael remains just as she was back then, perfect and eternal, surrounded by the tortured ghosts of all the mortals she worked to death to steal Hecate's body and wisdom.

Luigi relates a rumour that she is responsible for the recent increase in solar eclipses. He says that not even the Pope in Rome is able to oppose her. He says he heard the news himself, and it is true, the pope's office has been reduced to a heap of rubble. This disturbs Lucino, but only a little. This ends the fourth story.

The fifth story of the Pisa Cycle is titled 'The Forsaken Temple,' and concerns Luigi and Lucino's assault on Maxime's stronghold. It begins as the sun rises, the two companions slowly stirring from slumber, and making final preparations. For Luigi, this means preparing a shiv. For Lucino, it means transforming into his true form: an enourmous, hideous ogre with three arms and two faces, taller than three men. Luigi is initially shocked and afraid, but Lucino reminds him that he is still the righteous man from the previous night. After several moments, Luigi masters himself and apologises. Lucino laughs, and says that it is good to know that he looks fearsome.

After some tense conversation, the two enter the cave. Luigi is almost immediately shot in the throat by an archer, but he quickly recovers and tears the arrow away, terrifying the sniper who had just shot him. Lucino bounds forward, and kills the man by crushing his face to the stone and shattering his skull with a massive blow. Luigi then steals the man's equipment, including good leather armour, a bow, thirteen arrows, and a large iron dagger. They proceed further into the cave, encountering two more men. Luigi offers them the chance to surrender, and escape with their lives. The men respond to their offer by shooting at them. Lucino transforms into a stone statue of himself, so that the arrows have no effect. He does this not out of cowardice, but because Luigi is immortal. Sure enough, after a few minutes, Luigi successfully stabs the first man in the heart, and then decapitates the second man, with the help of the dagger. Foul magic sent by Maxime also comes into play, causing the first man's corpse to violently explode, injuring Luigi terribly. But Luigi ate one of the golden apples, so he instantly starts healing. After a few minutes, he is back to full health, albeit naked, and he and Lucino proceed deeper into the caves.
