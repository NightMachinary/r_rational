This is an interesting tool but it does seem like the sort of thing that'll make you a worse writer^{1.} For one the parts one is most likely to autocomplete are the spice of the story^{2.} Those parts are important because they set the tone, fill in setting details and are a great place for some sneaky foreshadowing. Using an automated tool to write them results in a subtly different style, unpredictable tone and no setting or foreshadowing details. Instead you get essentially random word patterns pulled from the other works this tool was trained with. And who knows maybe the story you're trying to write isn't Star Wars meets Gilmore Girls. It's got a niche in helping people cheat in creative writing class though.
