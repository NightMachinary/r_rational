IME, GPF-2 has three problems. The first problem is its tendency to repeat earlier elements. The second is that, even if you remove the duplicates, it tends to lose the varied sentence structure of the priming elements. The third problem is that, if you increase the temperature to counteract the first two problems, it tends to lose track of the original material and start going its own direction.

The best results I've gotten so far were when I used it as an oracle to help me write story outlines. I wrote down the outline I had come up with so far and let GPT-2 complete the next sentence. It usually came up with something I didn't like, but there was no cost to rolling the dice again and again until I found something I /did/ like. I fed it a paragraph or two describing a Narnia story, which then evolved into a story where the White Witch was obsessed with a book (whose details elude me now, but I think it dealt with the Lost First Men). The children and Aslan had to retrieve the book before the witch could. The wizard Zaza helped them deal with their first obstacle, an island of amazons. By the end of the story arc one of the amazons, who had been in love with Zaza, faked her death to be with him.

I never would have been able to come up with any of that on my own.
