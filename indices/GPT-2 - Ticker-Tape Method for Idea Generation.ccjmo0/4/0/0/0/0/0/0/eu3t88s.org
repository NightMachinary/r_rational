After encountering a few more men, all of whom explode when killed, Luigi and Lucino stumble upon an ancient staircase carved into the rock. With no other way forward, they head down. After nearly twenty minutes of descending, they come upon a large amphitheater , and find themselves confronted with a pair of warriors named Maxima and Maximus. Maxima, dressed in leather, appears like a cross between a giant lion and a bear, her arms covered in chains. Maximus, dressed in metal armor, appears as a giant demon-headed eagle. They are spirits that had been banished from Earth by the king of Gerel, until Maxime called them back into the world in exchange for their fealty. As a sign of this relationship, they use similar names to their summoner. They tell Luigi and Lucino to turn back, or face death at their hands. Luigi pretends to do as Maxima orders and tells Lucino to follow him to the stairs. Lucino protests, but after a moment, realises that Luigi is no coward, so follows him. They head a little way up the stairs until they are out of sight and earshot of the demons, and then Luigi whispers a plan.

The demons are far too strong for a man, even an immortal man, to fight, and they are also too strong for Lucino to take on alone. Luigi advises Lucino to transform into a flea. Then, as Luigi distracts the demons, Lucino will crawl into their ears and transform into a giant statue, killing them. Lucino thinks that the plan is excellent, and agrees, transforming into a flea that hops into Luigi's hair. Luigi shouts "Lucino, you three-armed traitorous bastard of a whore's son!" Then he runs back down to the apihitheater, where the two demons await, pretending to be furious.

The demons ask where Luigi's companion has gone, and Luigi exclaims that he had a plan to defeat them, but that Lucino is a faithless cur who ran away in fright of their power. The demons call Lucino very wise for fleeing, and ask if Luigi is an idiot. Meanwhile, Lucino has made his way to Maxima and entered her ear. He transforms into a giant statue, and her head explodes. Maximus howls in rage, and lashes out with demonflame at Lucino - but too late, as Lucino has already finished transforming into a copy of Michaelangelo's "David", which is made of marble and impervious to flame. Then the naked Luigi distracts the demon by punching him in the testicles, giving Lucino time to transform into a tiny mite. The demon burns Luigi to a crisp, and then Lucino crawls into his ear and transforms once more, killing Maximus as well. The two demon's souls howl in rage as they are torn out of the world once more, and slowly, Luigi's body reforms from the ash.

At the other end of the aphitheatre is a crude stone doorway. Luigi and Lucino walk through it to find a cavern so large that nations could live in it. It is filled with ruined buildings, and an ominous, obsidian temple, which glows with unclean light. Distant in the background is the horrific, numinous silhouette of an ancient pyramid made of gabbro - a rock found only at the bottom of the deepest oceans in the world. Unable to withstand the sight of it, the two flee into the temple, where Maxime stands to greet them. This ends the fifth story.

The sixth story of the Pisa Cycle is ' The Legend of the Great Fire'. It opens with Luigi and Lucino standing in front of the wicked sorceror, Maxime. [I haven't generated the sixth story yet]
