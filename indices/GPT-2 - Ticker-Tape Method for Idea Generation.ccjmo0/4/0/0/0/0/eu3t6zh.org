Luigi Diomedes is a famous figure from Italian folklore. He is the hero of the "Pisa Cycle", a series of sixteen stories originating from the city of Pisa.

The first of these stories is called "The Golden Apple" and serves to introduce the character. This story begins with Luigi as an orphan struggling to survive on the streets of Pisa, where he is ill-treated and ill-used by a number of disreputable individuals. Chief among these is Enrico, a well-known and infamous criminal who sells illegal goods. Enrico uses Luigi to move stolen merchandises from one corner of the city to another, and in the process Luigi is caught by the local constabulary, and thrown into gaol.

After nearly two weeks without food, Luigi is taken to a nearby camp, where he is forced to perform grueling labor. One night, after the other prisoners are asleep, Luigi is awakened by a knock at the door, and is told that Enrico is in the camp by an injured prisoner. Seeing the man responsible for his suffering, Luigi is determined to beat Enrico down, which he does by attacking the man in his sleep. After beating him to a pulp, Luigi is taken to a waiting guard by another prisoner, and savagely whipped. He is left hanging from the whipping pole, unable to support his own weight.

Broken and delerious, Luigi renounces his faith, and curses God. He is left hanging for three days, and nearly dies of thirst. He is finally rescued from the prison by a guard, who is incapable of watching the boy suffer any longer. The guard smuggles him out of the camp, and takes him to his father, a dubious surgeon, who then attempts to treat enrico with soma, a medicine from the mysterious lands to the east.

The physician administers the soma by applying it to the wounds on Luigi's back. Luigi falls unconcious almost immediately, and then has a vision of a heathen goddess. The image, which resembles an older woman, claims to be an Idun, a goddess from the countries to the north. She informs Luigi that she was only able to contact him because he renounced his faith in Jesus. She says that without her help, he will surely die. Luigi begs for her assistance.

In response to this, the goddess asks Luigi to perform a service. Idun was the goddess in charge of protecting the golden apples of immortality. She will let luigi take a bite of the apple to become immortal. In return, he must become her champion in the mortal world, and track down the thieves who stole appleseeds from her garden. Luigi begins to accept, but before he can take a bite, she gives him a warning: If he does not destroy them, he will die.

One of the thieves, a scoundrel named Maxime, stole Idun's magical dagger. It has two powers: to find immortals, and kill them. Maxime hates the heathen gods and their followers, and will stop at nothing to find and destroy their followers in the mortal world.

"Even so," Idun asks, "Will you become my champion? Death here would see you sent to the halls of Helheim, a gentle place. If Maxime kills you outside of my world, your soul will go to hell."

Luigi decides to become Idun's champion, and takes a bite of the apple. Instantly, all of his wounds are healed. His body, malnourished from hardship, is miraculously restored, as if he had lived life as a lord instead of a street urchin. He feels better, and soon his hunger is met, but not his thirst. For even immortals must drink.

As the vision ends, Idun wishes Luigi luck, promising that if he succeeds, they will meet again, and she will take him as her pupil.

Luigi wakes up in the house of the guard's father, who is holding a sword in his hand. He thinks Luigi might be possessed by a demon, and commands him to pick up a cross. Luigi does so, and after a moment, the surgeon relaxes. He had no idea that soma could be so good for him. Luigi laughs, and thanks the man for saving his life, swearing to repay his debt of gratitude in the future. He then asks for water.

When the surgeon brings a bucket, Luigi drinks the entire thing in one go. Then, feeling restored, he leaves, thanking the surgeon again.

Setting out from the town, Luigi encounters an ogre that has taken the form of a donkey, and is waiting for him. The ogre smashes Luigi into paste, but Luigi is now immortal - he heals back to full health right before the ogre's eyes. This terrifies the ogre, who thinks that Luigi must surely be a heathen god.

Luigi wonders why the ogre attacked, and why it has taken on the form of a donkey. Eager to answer his questions, the ogre informs him that Maxime told him to wait here, and to snatch the first man meeting Luigi's description walking from Pisa. Luigi is frightened by the information, but manages to control his fear and asks why the ogre is doing Maxime's bidding.

The orge replies that Maxime has threatened to kill his daughter if he does not obey his commands. Suddenly feeling sympathy for him, Luigi asks the ogre for his name. He responds that his name is Lucino. Luigi proposes to Lucino that they work together to kill Maxime and save Lucino's daughter. Lucino accepts and tells Luigi that he knows where Maxime is. He then transforms into a thoroughbred steed, and they ride off to find Maxime's secret base in the foothills of the Alps. This ends the first story.

The second story of the Pisa Cycle is called "The Skeleton Horse". It begins with Luigi and Lucino having a friendly conversation as they near the foothills of the alps. Suddenly, the sky grows dark, and they hear the sounds of thundering hooves. Lucino reacts with terror, running off the road over Luigi's protests. He transforms into the form of a man, and pulls Luigi into a culvert, out of sight from the road. Luigi reacts with anger, but Lucino covers his mouth, rasing a fingger to his lips. A minute later, hundreds of riders in black armour led by a man on a giant skeleton horse emerge from the darkness. It takes them nearly an hour to pass through the area as Luigi and Lucino hide from them.

Finally, the column of dark soldiers passes, and light returns. Luigi and Lucino emerge from the culvert. Luigi asks Lucino who the soldiers are, and Lucino answers with a warning not to speak of them. They are evil, nameless things that are only shaped like men, and they have the power to know when any human speaks of them, and where they are. They exist only to find those people, and to do terrible things to them. Luigi begins to say something - but Lucino cover his mouth, and tells him to think carefully, and that he must not talk about the soldiers no matter what. After a long moment, Luigi nods, and they return to the road, Lucino turning back into a horse so that Luigi doesn't have to walk.

After a moment, Luigi realises that Lucino knows that he is an immortal human, and not a god. He asks Lucino why he is still helping him. Lucino explains that, in the past, he did evil things, but then a druid of Toutatis who had been blessed with intangibility met him, and after many years, convinced him that what he did was wrong. The priest died a long time ago, and Lucino spent many years trying to live a good life before Maxime threatened his daughter. While he could save his daughter by doing what the scoundrel Maxime wanted, he'd prefer to save her without having to do wicked things. So it doesn't matter to him that Luigi isn't a divine being, so long as he's willing to help him save Lucino's child.

Luigi is very moved by this story, and after a long while, is in tears because he wishes he could have had a father like Lucino. He swears to save Lucino's child, even if it means taking down the Prince of Hell. Lucino laughs, and calls Luigi a good man. Luigi admits he is just fourteen.

They arrive at the entrance to the scoundrel Maxime's lair. This ends the second story.
