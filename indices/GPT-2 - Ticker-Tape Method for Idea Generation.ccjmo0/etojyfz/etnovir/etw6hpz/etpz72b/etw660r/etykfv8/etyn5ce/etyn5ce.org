LMAO. That's awesome. How much detail did it go into? I mean, are these full-fledged stories or just story outlines? Also, how much curation did you have to do? I usually had to redo the autocomplete about a dozen times each, and I would occasionally cut out part of the result or even insert my own ideas.
