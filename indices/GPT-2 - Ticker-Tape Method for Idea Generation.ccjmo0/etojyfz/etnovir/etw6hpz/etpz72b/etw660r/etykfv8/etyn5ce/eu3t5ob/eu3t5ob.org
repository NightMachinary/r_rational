Curation needs are variable. I did most of my intercessions when it was obvious that the model was gostaking it up. It can go for almost an entire story without doing that, or I might be required to write multiple paragraphs. Sometimes I would directly intercede when I had a particular notion - a giant pyramid in the underground city, for example. I would say about 75% of the content is model-originating. Much of that required multiple attempts. Regarding detail I'll just post what I have as a reply to this comment, so click through into the thread to see it, if you're interested.
