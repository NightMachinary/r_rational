I have something similar. I gave it this prompt: Luigi Diomedes is a famous figure from Italian folklore. He is the hero of the "Pisa Cycle", a series of sixteen stories originating from the city of Pisa.

So far it's up to story six, where the immortal-as-in-regenerates-from-a-pile-of-dust-immortal Luigi and his travelling companion, the shapeshifting ogre Lucino, have descended into a cyclopean underground city to retrieve the seeds stolen from the garden of Idun by the scoundrel Maxime - a man who wants to slaughter the heathen gods - as well as to save Lucino's daughter from him. Meanwhile they're being hunted by the prince of hell, and a greater-scope villain named Ismael has been forshadowed in the fourth story.
