[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Animorphs: The Reckoning]]

The single best ratfic I have ever read. Alien technology (including The Ellimist/Crayak) have logical, internally consistent rules, Visser Three is competent, and the Animorphs are actually trying to win.

Some parts are extremely dark, but it does an amazing job of staying true to the spirit of canon and the characters' core personalities.
