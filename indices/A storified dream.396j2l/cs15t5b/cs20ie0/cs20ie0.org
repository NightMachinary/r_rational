Wow.

My dreams are almost always mundane. Lots of the time they're just replays of IRL events, possibly with minor alterations.

When they're not mundane, they're always chase dreams. Usually I'm getting eaten by something or at least am in danger of being eaten by something (and then the dream resets partly or entirely and I have to try, try again) but in the last one I was being chased by a Sith Yeerk.
