Dreams are */weird/*.

Some rare dreams result in me simultaneously perceiving three separate events with different thoughts about each one which is how I imagine having three similar personalities would be like. It felt as more like I was three people narrating some guy's life since in those dreams we were very passive and didn't make any decisions. It's what I imagine a hive-mind to be like.

Other times I dream in a black-and-white comic book art style where the world is in three dimensions but everything looks drawn or animated. In similar dreams I sometimes interact with a character from my favorite cartoon TV shows (only cartoons for some reason and the dream where I rode Celebi over my bathroom sink was awesomely hilarious).

Other times I think I am someone else from a fantasy setting. There was a dream where I was Justin, a sword fighter literally walking next to a ship over an Ocean with swimming dragons (that was a sad dream when Hercules died). It's why I was convinced the brain-in-a-vat thought experiment was a possibility, because I have literally been another person. If my consciousness can be fooled into being someone else, then why can't my senses be fooled as well?

A few times, I was in an alien body with tentacles. I generally 'sit' in one place moving my tentacles around in what feels like jello. Sometimes I think I was a plant instead, but they seem so similar I can't tell which is which during or after the dream.

Once I even thought I was perceiving the world in 4-D where the extra dimension was color with I think black-blue as one direction and the opposite direction as red-white. Or was I seeing time as a fourth dimension of color? Very little happened in that dream.

I even experienced something like a non-linear perception of time where I dreamed about some events out of chronological order, but my actions made perfect sense at the time as well as when I woke up (for about as long as I could remember the details anyway).

I have woken up wondering who am I with total amnesia. I have wondered why my arms aren't on a different part of my body other than my shoulders. I have wondered why I was sleeping on the ceiling. I have wondered why my senses are off or why my body is different from how it should be. Usually I'm sorted in a few seconds, but I sometimes think the Matrix-Overlords are secretly changing my identity each day. I mean....of course I've always been [[/u/xamueljones]]. But...was I always [[/u/xamueljones]] yesterday?

I don't usually dream (or is that remember them when I wake up?) but when I do, they always come out /odd/.

Dreams are fascinating to me since they are the closest I can get to experiencing things normally impossible for me.

EDIT: For anyone curious, I've never had a nightmare. I've had dreams where I was being attacked or something horrible is happening to me, but I don't feel very much emotion in any of my dreams and the strongest ones are usually some sadness or happiness. I've had dreams where I should be scared, but I don't ever emotionally react until I wake up and by then it's not scary anymore.

EDIT2: I have never done drugs or drank more than two medium-sized cups of alcohol in one sitting.
