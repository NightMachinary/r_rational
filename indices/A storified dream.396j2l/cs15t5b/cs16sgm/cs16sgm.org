  For anyone curious, I've never had a nightmare.

You're really not missing out on much. I tend to feel monumentally /dumb/ after my nightmares, when I wake up and realize how Genre Blind I was being.

Except the annual one where a zombie bites me in the small of my back, and I feel the teeth and the cutting and... ugh. I don't know /why/ I have to dream that dream every March.
