Thanks for sharing!

My dreams usually take place in a mostly realistic world. Space isn't always perfectly euclidic, time can be very flexible, momentum doesn't really exist and water is a bit compressible.

The most fascinating dream of mine was one in which I aged. Slowly. I finished university, got married, struggled with my career, wasted a ton of time in fruitless projects, learned some useful skills in others, but always found happiness with my wife. All of that in almost real time: I remember living through thousands of individual days, countless hours with my family, different hobbies and projects, different cities, some funerals and traveling to at least a dozen countries on holiday. I had five grandchildren, and I saw two of them grow up to Kindergarden. Being old sucked because of the constant pain. It erodes you, makes you complacent. I fought the pain and the complacency every day, and felt victorious to see yet another sunset. Then, on some day, my wife died. It was so sudden and heartwrenching that I woke up. It was just another tuesday; I hadn't even slept longer than usual.

Today, 8 years later, I'm 30. My years of silent mourning for my dead dream wife are behind me, my life is on track, but I still sometimes get a dej√†-vu to some memorable event from my dream life. I feel so much older than I really am, it's ridiculous. I found my inner peace; and there's very little that can shake me.

Oh, by the way - I've never done drugs. I've read that similar experiences could happen on LSD, but apparently my regular brain chemistry is freaky enough, so I won't touch anything that messes with it even more.

Also, I'm deleting this tomorrow because it's way too personal to be found online.
