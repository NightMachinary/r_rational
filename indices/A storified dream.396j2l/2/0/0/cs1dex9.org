Ugh, I hate sad dreams like that. Whenever I get a sad one, it's always me hugging someone I love good-bye for the last time in bright sunshine. It's like a scene right out of a big-budget tragedy movie. I tend to hug my family/friends tightly after a dream like that.

Still better to have known bliss with someone you loved than not at all. I wonder if it would be ethical to have implanted memories of wonderful experiences that never happened?

Since we're discussing this on [[/r/rational]] and we love munchkining weird stuff like this, I have a few ideas. I'm sorry if I sound offensive suggesting ways to take advantage of a painful moment.

- Were you able to retain any of the skills you learned in the dream? I know it's unlikely, but I'm curious.

- Have you considered looking for someone similar to your dream wife? Since you already know (subconsciously) what kind of person you'd like to spend your life with, then you know what to screen for in potential partners.

- Is your dream wife similar to someone you already knew at 22? Maybe your subconscious is hinting at something.

I just realized something horrifyingly funny. Your dream wife is literally the woman of your dreams!

PM if you want to talk further in private. If you delete the above comment, then I'll delete this one as well tomorrow night.
