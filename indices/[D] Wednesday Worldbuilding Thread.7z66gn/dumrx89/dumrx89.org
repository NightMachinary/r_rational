The kingdom of Colo is a country of snakes, where the king has absolute power and can do anything he wants without giving a damn about what the other snakes think. Yet because the king rarely decides to intervene in the affairs of the country, most citizens have led fairly peaceful lives.

But one day, the king summoned all his heirs, even his illegitimate children, and publicly announced that he would soon abdicate the throne, giving all of his powers to one of his children. Which child inherited the throne would be a partially democratic process: every citizen in the kingdom would be able to non-anonymously vote for which heir they wanted to be the next king, but some votes would be weighted more than others, in a manner only known to the king.

Furthermore, the king publicly declared that his legitimate heirs had to pass a test to show they were worthy of the throne: if they did not receive significantly more weighted votes than the illegitimate heirs, the throne would be given to the illegitimate heir with the most weight in votes. Then, without giving any of his heirs a chance to protest or do anything, the king turned his petrifying gaze upon them, freezing them into a state of suspended animation where they could only think, but not move or communicate in any way to meddle with the election process. Only the winning heir would be unpetrified in the end, with the rest left to the new king to do as he pleased. Then, with his announcements complete, the king disappeared, promising to return at a later date to determine the winner.

The king had two legitimate heirs, and it was well-known that while they were both highly intelligent and rational, they had diametrically opposed desires, and diametrically opposed visions for the future of the kingdom. Whoever won would definitely have the other killed and everything the other cared about ruined. Then there were the illegitimate heirs, that were a dime a dozen, but all with horribly warped personalities from their shoddy upbringing. The two princes had a small group of supporters, but these illegitimate heirs were supported by no one, and no one in their right mind would vote for them unless coerced to do so.

It is at this point in time that a thought occurs. Although the princes have been petrified to prevent their meddling in the election, they could still act in one way: they could pre-commit to find and torture any citizen who did not vote for them once they become king. The citizens shuddered at the thought. They were all cowards by nature, and would definitely vote for a prince if threatened with torture. But, they wondered, would the princes really pre-commit to do so? Was such a pre-commitment rational? I want to take this story in the direction where the citizens decide that the pre-commitment is irrational, using the following argument:

Suppose that it was. Then if it was rational for one prince to do so, it would also be rational for the other prince, and both princes would pre-commit to find and torture any citizen who did not vote for them once they become king. Then to avoid being tortured, the citizens of Colo would bend over backwards to obey. However, which prince should they obey then? If they obeyed one prince, and it turned out the other prince won, wouldn't they be horribly tortured by the new king?

Effectively, the optimal way for a citizen to avoid being tortured would be to desperately do everything in its power to vote for an heir and ensure that that heir wins. But then, given the king's test to his legitimate heirs, it would be far, far easier to make an illegitimate heir win. Thus if the princes were to pre-commit, would their plans not backfire and cause an illegitimate heir to win instead?
