If you have intelligent, rational citizens, there's an alternative option. To pre-emptively negate the potential torture plans, conduct an anonymous primary election to determine which prince or illegitimate heir most deserves the throne and persuade everyone to openly vote only for the winner of the primary. This way, you don't have half of the citizens getting tortured, and you most likely exclude the illegitimate heirs with warped personalities, but you leave open the door for an illegitimate heir with a decent personality.
