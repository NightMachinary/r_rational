Not explicitly laid out in the rules above, I'm now realizing, but one variant of the magic (that I think I'm probably going to use) would be one in which you can elect to drop the arena shell /without/ resetting to the previous configuration.

The reason that I bring this up is in the context of medical procedures; if you had a risky one, you could put the doctor, nurses, and patient into the bubble, then do the procedure as many times as necessary until either your doctor burnt out, or you had achieved a good outcome. From a world-building perspective, I really like this, because A) it gives the elites another reason to have the arena in their house, and B) it adds a bit more to the rich/poor divide, given that the bubbles are expensive.

I'm /really/ going to have to figure out the side effects though, even if that just means making up a rule.
