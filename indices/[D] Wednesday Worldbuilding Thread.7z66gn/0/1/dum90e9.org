If you could make a sufficiently portable arena or teleport people into an arena and immediately raise the shield, you could use them to take political or other enemies prisoner. You wouldn't be able to kill them, obviously, but given that you know where they will be when the arena resets, you could set up some kind of trap to obliterate them the moment the shield falls.

I would expect societies with this technology to have remarkably little war. Interhouse rivalries can be settled "peacefully," using (magically?) binding contracts to ensure compliance with the results. As a result, none of the small scuffles which balloon into huge conflicts would get very far. Kingdoms could even agree to such terms on the logic that, if no conflict really occurs on the land they are fighting over, the winner gets it in pristine condition rather than as a pockmarked wasteland. Some kind of known-neutral arbiter would probably be necessary to write up war contracts, and there could be some intrigue if the arbiters aren't actually neutral.

From a mechanical perspective, the easiest way for the reset button to work is for the arena to just be simulating everything happening inside it, then only make changes to the memories of the people leaving them. No complex reassembly of humans and reconstruction of shattered brains, just lots of thinking followed by minor reality alterations. Doing this would also remove the possibility of using arenas as infinite energy sources.
