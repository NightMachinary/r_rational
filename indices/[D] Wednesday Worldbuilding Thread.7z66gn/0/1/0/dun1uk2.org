  From a mechanical perspective, the easiest way for the reset button to work is for the arena to just be simulating everything happening inside it, then only make changes to the memories of the people leaving them. No complex reassembly of humans and reconstruction of shattered brains, just lots of thinking followed by minor reality alterations. Doing this would also remove the possibility of using arenas as infinite energy sources.

From a narrative standpoint, I think simulation leaves a bit to be desired. /Ideally/, the magic ties into the themes, characterization, etc. of a work, and "reverting things to how they were before" has the benefit of being strongly thematic -- if the story is about how hard it is to change things, having one of the primary magics revert things to how they were meshes nicely. Simulation /narratively/ implies something totally different; it's about the nature of reality itself, or about levels of abstraction, or something like that.

The "infinite energy sources" thing isn't necessarily a bug, so long as the social/societal effects produced by the infinite energy sources are in line with the outcomes that I'm looking for. Given a 1700s level of technology, I'm actually not sure what infinite energy actually /does/ for them. Giant, expensive siege weapons? Heating in the winter? Extra light from a continually resetting bonfire? There are a few industrial processes that would be helped, especially in the realm of metallurgy, but I'll have to think about how much. (I'm actually not sure what the most effective form of heat/light generation would be, given that no air can come in or out, which would seem to rule out the old standby of just setting things on fire.)

  I would expect societies with this technology to have remarkably little war.

I /somewhat/ disagree. I think having an outlet for monkeybrain stuff would probably be good, especially if it can be done in front of a whole host of people from both sides intently watching. However, this only works if people can agree to settle things with a match, which they won't necessarily do, especially if they know that they're not favored. You'd need a fairly strong "settling things in the arena" culture, with lots of social/cultural/legal penalties for not consenting to the arena.
