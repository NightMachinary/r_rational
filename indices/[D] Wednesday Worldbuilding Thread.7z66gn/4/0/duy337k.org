How fantastical?

One of my favorite historical examples of cause and effect is that the War of Spanish Succession lasted from 1701-1714, and then one of the Golden Ages of Piracy lasted from 1716-1726. The war had been cause to train a whole generation of skilled sailors with skill in combat, and the end of the war left them all unemployed, which led them to turn to piracy, which was uniquely suited to their skills.

So I guess the first thing that I would like out of a pirate setting is some explanation for why there are pirates. Historically, pirates are often nationalist and quasi-legitimized by one government as a tool of sabotaging trade, but if not that, then you need some reason that the goverments and navies of the world aren't doing something about the piracy problem, or why they're ineffective at combating it. I'd consider this an absolute must.

Other than that, I think the genre has a lot of staples that I really love; pirate havens, pirate codes, buried treasure, visiting with indigenous natives, norm-breaking by the outlaw pirates, etc. Some of this is just the Disney version of piracy as it actually existed, I'll admit, but there's at least some amount of historical truth to pieces of it.
