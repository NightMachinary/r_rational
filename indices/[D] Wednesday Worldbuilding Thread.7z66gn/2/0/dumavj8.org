  I mean if you have the ability to put someone in a different reality, but it's a costly power where just killing the person is usually easier.

Why?

- Because it's funny (to the antagonist)
- Because the antagonist is a dick (see above)
- Because their ability to control the reality warping isn't particularly fine-grained (they /tried/ to kill the protagonist by pushing them halfway through a portal then closing it, but instead they just fell through, or somesuch)
- Maybe the antagonist needs to swap places with someone to change dimensions, and the protagonist drew the short straw?
- The antagonist wants the protagonist to suffer, but doesn't have the time to actually torture them, so instead they automate the process by placing the protagonist in to the nightmare realm.
- It's just a social experiment bro
