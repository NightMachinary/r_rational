Because even if it is easier to kill the protagonist, it could be harder to kill the protagonist *without being caught*. I mean, they would be saddled with a dead body that they have to hide, and what better hiding place than a parallel dimension? But then, if they would have to use the parallel dimension power anyway, why bother going through the hassle of murdering the protagonist first?
