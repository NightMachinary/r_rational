Dumbledore put a ward on the protagonist that pumps probability away from timelines where he dies. The antagonist wanted the protagonist out of the way, so he cleverly shunted him to a dimension where nothing dies, knowing that the ward would work in his favor. That nothing dies in that dimension had interesting, nightmarish effects on its ecosystem.
