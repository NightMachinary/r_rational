What if you omit the power to put someone in a different reality? Perhaps your protagonist accidentally traps himself in a parallel dimension (e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbinder_(TV_series)][Spellbinder]]), and so is initially unknown to your antagonist, but once there, the antagonist targets the other-worlder for his or her knowledge, skills, exoticness, etc.
