Very fantastical. Pirates of Caribbean fantasy level.

Thanks for showing that importance the piracy age is a short transient history period. It can't last 100 years, measures will be taken.

The basic idea is that the setting must look like a now magic one starts familiar with it, and then slowly uncover magic and secrets. Not human races hiding among humans, krkaens taking the role of dragons in the sea etc.

I also need a god reason for why pirates keep hiding their treasure. IRL it happened only once. Most crews spent the money as soon as they earned it.

What fantastical races, like elves and dwarves in fantasy, would you like to see with pirates?
