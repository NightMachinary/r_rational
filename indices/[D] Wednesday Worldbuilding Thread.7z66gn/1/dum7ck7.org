At 00:00 UST tomorrow morning, the world gets the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3dnmuj/d_bst_ff_munchkin_the_inheritance_magic_system/][Inheritance Cycle (eragon)]] magic system "patched in." About 1 in 100 people are mages, with another 7 in 100 being mindbreakers (capable of mindreading/telepathy/mental attacks, but not magic.) Everyone else gains the ability to sense and defend against mental attacks, but only with practice.

Mages and mindbreakers don't have an instinctive grasp of their abilities, although they will notice their senses are behaving differently, and be able to discover what they can do on their own eventually. We won't realize it's the Inheritance Cycle system immediately, but after a while, some Eragon fan is going to try really hard to cast "Brisingr" and in all likelihood kill themselves and people will start catching on.

Assuming you're a mage or a mindbreaker, how would you try to munchkin the worldstate for personal benefit? (assuming you're not, obviously the answer is "get good at defending your thoughts.)

To make things interesting, Christopher Paolini is also a mage, and can "discover" new words at a rate of about once a week, although these words are discovered more or less at random. Also, the probability of a person being a mindbreaker or a mage is weakly correlated with their general intelligence. People with 150 IQ might have a closer to 2/100 chance of being a mage or 14/100 chance of being a mindbreaker, while people with 60 IQ might have a 1/200 chance of being a mage, and 7/200 chance of being a mindbreaker. The chance doesn't increase linearly with IQ, though-- there's more to it than that.

What larger scale consequences are there?

--------------

Some thoughts:

- There's going to be a massive mortality rate in the first few weeks among mages, since as described in Eragon, even the most basic spells are incredibly difficult for new mages
- The ancient language violates simultaneity, but it takes frankly absurd amounts of energy to do so
- Cubic zirconia is going to be incredibly useful, since diamonds (IIRC) are one of the best gems for energy storage, and Cubic Zirconia can be manufactured on demand. I'd probably buy some stock of whichever company manufactures it.
- In the brief period before unsolicited mindreading gets outlawed, /so many/ secrets are going to leak.
