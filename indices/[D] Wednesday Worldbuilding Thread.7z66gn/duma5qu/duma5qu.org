Help! I've been working on a story that involves a protagonist who is a high school student being targeted by an unknown antagonist by being trapped in a parallel dimension. The part I am having trouble with is why go to the trouble in the first place? I mean if you have the ability to put someone in a different reality, but it's a costly power where just killing the person is usually easier.

I just came up with the idea for a story about someone escaping a nightmarish world, but I need to have a reason for the guy to be in the world in the first place. Can anyone help?
