I feel kind of dumb for not thinking about perishable foods. Given the costs involved, your stasis units would be massive walk-ins, and given that the "snap back" doesn't deal with energy I don't think storing ice would actually do much (things would still heat up, I think?), but the thing that causes perishable food to spoil is mostly bacteria, and obviously bacterial (and other biological) processes get snapped back just like everything else. So food would only spoil when the bubble is down, which would only happen when someone wanted to retrieve something from within.
