Battle school worldbuilding, pt. 3. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vwof7/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dtw306v/][pt. 1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7xim6q/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/du8n1im/][pt. 2]])

There are magical arenas whose primary purpose in the narrative is to provide a way for participants to fight to the death over and over without actually having them suffer the consequences of those deaths. (This in turn allows some variety and spice, because some fights within the narrative can take place /outside/ the arena, where that safety is not guaranteed.) When the fight is done, an adjudicator outside the arena will hit a switch (or do some magic) that will put all of the atoms back where they were when the fight began and repair any bonds that were broken.

Arenas come in four standard sizes. D-class arenas are 60 feet across, suitable mostly for quick, personal matches, and cost (the local equivalent of) $200,000. C-class arenas are 200 feet across, suitable for 2v2, or more protracted personal battles, and cost $600,000. B-class arenas are 500 feet across, nearly a football field, suitable for battle royales or a sprawling 5v5, usually with environmental complications, and cost $1,000,000. A-class arenas are 1000 feet across, suitable for the largest types of engagements, where positioning or environment matter a lot, and cost $2,000,000. Commoners usually pay for the privilege of using a community arena (owned by one of the elites); the wealth disparity is large enough that the elites mostly have their own, or part ownership in one of the larger ones (like a golf course). Arenas have no upkeep costs associated with them and do not take any energy to run. Time to expand the sphere depends on size - a minute for the small ones, fifteen minutes for the big ones. Time to snap back is roughly the same.

Arenas are always spherical, built to exacting standards, with a “ring” set into the ground that must be activated from the outside, and can only be deactivated from the outside. Once the arena is active, nothing goes in or out, which means that bouts (especially in smaller arenas) might be limited by available oxygen -- D-class would be 113K cubic feet, halved because it's a half-sphere, which seems like a lot of breathing room (har har), so maybe it's a non-issue unless it's a really long fight.

Once the arena is activated, you cannot leave -- nothing can. Arenas therefore perfectly resist weather, which might have some applications (especially for the large one) and provide some manner of defenses, except that the operator (or mechanism) is a weak point.

There are a number of consequences to the "atoms being put back where they are" mechanic. Namely, if energy is unaffected, then people can still see and hear what's going on in the arena (with sound being a bit muted). In addition, transmutation from one element to another (via e.g. radioactive decay) might mean that the atoms needed to put things back together don't exist, or that very minor errors are necessarily introduced in reconstruction. "Free" energy is a given, but I don't consider that too much of an issue -- probably patch to not completely break physics is that the "arena" does use energy, but that energy comes from random individual atoms being "eaten" by the magic in ways that are really hard to figure out.

(The loss of memories for the participants can probably be handled by one of the other magic systems - if you have your chakras filled, you resist the arena's attempts to undo your memories.)

More generally, this might be an outgrowth of some kind of magic system that can alter physical laws within really large spheres, which would have other applications in industry. Also might make for neat arena battles? Lowered gravity, changed speed of light (a nightmare to write), things like that?

This kind of magic system might tie into the central themes because:

- It's capital intensive, only the realm of the very rich, there are community arenas, but there you're always limited by money and time, which are already limits for commoners
- It's labor intensive, and gives more of a reason for the elites to suppress or devalue the non-elites
- Perhaps some comparison to be made between rich/poor sports like basketball/golf, in terms of entry?

*tl;dr: You can pay a large sum of money for a magical ring of stones that can project a sphere which will snap atoms (but not energy) back to their initial configuration. Atoms cannot pass through while the configuration is set. How do you use this to immediately fuck things up or become super wealthy, using no technology from after 1800?*

Edit: [[http://rerowland.com/bodyactivity.htm][This page]] is probably a useful starting point for "how bad would it be if all your atoms got snapped back to how they were a few minutes ago, but none of the radioactive decay was fixed". I'm not a physicist, nor is physics one of my areas of interest, so if someone could give an answer on a scale from "it would cause an explosion that would annihilate the surrounding mile of countryside" to "you could keep doing to forever without having to worry about cancer" I would appreciate it.
