You could just read [[http://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111][Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom]] but this might be overkill.

I would actually recommend [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]] as an introduction to [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Singleton][singletons]]. It's a much more modern approach than Asimov's.

Then there's [[http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Upon-Deep-Zones-Thought/dp/0812515285][A Fire upon the Deep]] with multiple powerful AIs that are actually in conflict at one time. (From a storytelling point of view this is not the greatest book, though.)

Then there's this snippet from [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/05/prediction-goes-to-war/][Scott Alexander's blog]]:

#+begin_quote
  Imagine a friendly AI and an unfriendly AI expanding at light speed from their home planets until they suddenly encounter each other in the dead of space. They exchange information and determine that their values are in conflict. If they fight, the unfriendly AI is capable of destroying the friendly AI with near certainty, but the war will rip galaxies to shreds. So the two negotiate, and in exchange for the friendly AI surrendering without destroying any galaxies, the unfriendly AI promises to protect a 10m x 10m x 10m cube of computronium simulating billions of humans who live pleasant, fulfilling lives. The friendly AI checks its adversary's source code to ensure it is telling the truth, then self-destructs. Meanwhile, the unfriendly AI protects the cube and goes on to transform the entire rest of the universe to paperclips, unharmed by the dangerous encounter.

And lastly, the fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To the Stars]] in which nano-technologically enhanced humans fight side by side with roughly human-level intelligent AIs against an alien invasion. It's set around the year 2400, I think. There's also a lot of war tactics for space combat in there.
