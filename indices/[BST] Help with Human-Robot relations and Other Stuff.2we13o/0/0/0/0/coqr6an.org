That depends on where the technology goes. I actually think that the movie gets two use cases for humanoid robots right - prostitutes in a world where human prostitution is illegal, and replacement children for parents who don't want or can't have a biological child.

There are a ton of reasons that people would want humanoid robots. If it was possible to get a robot girlfriend that behaved realistically enough that it was possible to suspend disbelief, of course people would buy it! People already buy fake accompaniment for themselves /all the time./

Now, maybe it would be easier to engineer the robot with some fake emotions, or emotions that could be turned off when they became inconvenient. But that's a different question. And it's most likely that fake companionship of whatever kind will come in a purely virtual form (like a wife that lives in the cloud) because of costs, but that's a somewhat different question as well.
