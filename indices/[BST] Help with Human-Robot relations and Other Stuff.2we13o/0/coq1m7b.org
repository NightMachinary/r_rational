If you haven't already, read /The Bicentennial Man/ by Isaac Asimov. It's short - a novelette - and one of the foundational human/robot pieces of writing. It won a Hugo and a Nebula.

Read /I, Robot/ by Cory Doctorow, which you can get [[http://craphound.com/?p=189][free online here]]. It's a short story, and you should be able to chew through it fast - it's probably the quickest deconstruction/reconstruction of Asimov's ideas that you'll be able to find. Nominated for a Hugo, won a Locus.

Read /The Lifecycle of Software Objects/ by Ted Chiang, which you can get [[http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2010/fiction_the_lifecycle_of_software_objects_by_ted_chiang][free online here]]. It's a novella. Also about robots, though also about weak AI and the sometimes nonsensical attachments that people form with them. Won a Hugo, won a Locus.

These are all short, they're all in different styles, and they all have something to say about how people interact with robots. They're all good stories.

There are hundreds of books to read on the subject, but if you just want a quick insight into how people think about humans and robots, and some of the area that's already been sketched out, this should be a good crash course.
