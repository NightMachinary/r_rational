I mean, I know from the author's note that this is going down the Rob = unfriendly AI route, which is an awesome twist. But if I hadn't read that part I would have said that it's probably going to be whoever is behind killing Jess's dad, assuming /that/ wasn't actually Rob. Currently it's largely Protagonist vs. Harsh Environment.

But none of these routes seem like a fundamentally flawed story?
