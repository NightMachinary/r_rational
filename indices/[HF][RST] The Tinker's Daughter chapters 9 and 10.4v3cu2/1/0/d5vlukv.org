well shit, this was one of maybe three ongoing stories that I actually looked forward to without the slightest drop of "meh, it's /mostly/ okay."

I didn't see the plot twist coming, but god damn you just made a singularity when Rob became able to upgrade his own intelligence just now. I'm not completely floored, looking back, but that's just hindsight bias.

Oh well. I look forward to the lore pieces.
