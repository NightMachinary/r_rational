The issue isn't that I'm short on ideas, it's that TTTD is a flawed product. I could grind out another 60-100k words to get to the end, then rewrite the entire thing to turn it into something publishable, all while also producing new content too...or I could just shift to producing new content and learn from the mistakes I made here.

I might post short stories from the setting in the future, though. There's a huge amount of worldbuilding that I never got to use, so I have no shortage of possibilities for subject matter.
