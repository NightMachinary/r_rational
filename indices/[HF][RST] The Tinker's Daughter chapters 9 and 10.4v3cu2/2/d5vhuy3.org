Inspiration! Hat tip to [[/u/whywhisperwhy][u/whywhisperwhy]].

What if, every week, you published a small piece of oral lore like that which you posted in Chapter 10? You can focus on the main story until it's a completed book, you're still providing content to non-patrons, and patrons can get a look behind the scenes on what troubled you that week, or things you're working on, journal-style. At the end of the process, you have a completed short story or short story anthology perhaps a la /Tales of Beedle the Bard/ set in the world of the book you also just finished! Since you've set your patreon to monthly payments, you don't have to answer to your patrons about the change in the production process. You can apply this to your next work, as well - no reason to limit the idea to the tale of the tinkering one's female child if she's not doing it for you anymore.

What a wonderful idea! I'm smiling. Are you? Because I feel very good about this. You should too. Ready? One... two... three...:

*Yay!*
