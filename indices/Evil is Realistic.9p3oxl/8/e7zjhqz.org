I think the problems with The Dragon Prince are a lot broader than "not wanting to commit to an evil villain"; though it /is/ a problem: you can't have a guy who's trying his best to save the king's life in difficult circumstances, laying his own life on the line, and have the same guy try to kill the king's kids two days later.

There are a lot of problems in these series: poor pacing, poor sense of scale (why is the King's winter lodge a morning's walk away from his castle?), underwhelming stakes, etc.

But I think the big thing that keeps The Dragon Prince from working is that the writers have a poor understanding of prejudice. They seem to have this image where racism is something that happens almost by accident, and if we could just learn to tolerate each other everything would work out in the end.

The way this manifests is, we don't ever see the context of the characters' actions. The King mentions "wrongs on both sides", but we know that:

- The elves mass-deported the humans 1000 years ago.

- The humans (probably) murdered the Dragon King and stole his egg a few years ago (a decade tops).

And that's it.

What happened in between? What made the King think that attacking the Dragon King was a good idea? What's the balance of power between the human kingdoms and the magic kingdoms? Do elves bandits regularly perform raids across the border? Do humans? Did either kingdom try to invade the other at some point?

In short, why do these two kingdoms hate each other so much if they're completely separated? It can't be just the mass-deportation, it happened 1000 years ago; it would like if the French were still mad at the English for the Hundred Years' War.

So we have good guys who wants to return the Dragon Prince to stop a war, and a bad guy who wants to kill them and start his own war... except we're never shown what the benefits of that should be! Humans have had 1000 years to settle their part of the continent, which overall looks quite livable except for the lower amounts of magic. We're shown no reason why invading the magic kingdoms would be anything other than a very costly bad idea.
