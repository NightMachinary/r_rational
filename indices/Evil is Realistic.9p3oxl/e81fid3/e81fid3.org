I think ATLA and Worm strike a good formula by having bad guys across the spectrum. Ozai is pure evil, and he serves an important story function, but he's not nearly the most memorable thing about ATLA. Zhao is pretty unmemorable, too. Zuko and Azula are the memorable bad guys. Zuko as the one who ultimately gets redeemed, and Azula as the kinda complex one who still ultimately doesn't.

Likewise Worm hits all across the board. Petty bad guys who are out for themselves. Racists. Forces of nature. Alien god thing. Corrupt organizations who think they're working for the greater good. Psychos. It's the super-evil ones (like the slaughter house nine, who honestly just aren't that complex*) that provide a lot of the stakes but the less evil ones that provide a lot of interesting philosophical moral conflict.

I think 'bad guys across the board' is generally a good formula.

That having been said, I also think Quirrell is one of the most successful instances of trying to make a bad guy who is simultaneously very complex and very evil all in one, which is pretty hard to pull off. His whole 'indifference' schtick really helps with that, I think. It allows him to go around doing a wide variety of things, sometimes even /good/ things (being a competent teacher, helping fight bullies), while still effortlessly stepping into the role of a monster.

It also helps that much of Quirrell's philosophy, like his trademark jaded cynicism, is somewhat... tempting. And no, I don't mean that I'm tempted to go out and kill idiots for fun, but I am often tempted to just write off most of the human race as terrible and stupid. On the other hand, Thanos sucks. His life philosophy just isn't tempting at all. Thanos could have been good, maybe, if they had really dug into the cognitive failings that led him to this point (and in fact I see some discussion of here in this thread) but it just wasn't there in the movie.

(*) In some sense I think that was the point. Jack was ultimately a pretty shallow edge-lord, despite being 'the most in alignment with' his shard, but hey, guess what, the alien-god's plan to stop entropy by giving people super powers and having them fight was also pretty shallow.
