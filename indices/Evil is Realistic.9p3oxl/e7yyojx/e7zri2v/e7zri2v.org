The main problem with Thanos for me is that the utter stupidity of him kinda majorly undermines all of that.

Like, dude. You've got the God Gauntlet, just make a bajillion times the resources we need, and just keep doing that when we start using them up? And if you can't do that, kill half of everyone plan doesn't do shit anyway due to how population growth works. Unless it's /super different/ for aliens??
