Personally, I felt like the show was doing pretty well until they left the castle.

Decent conflict (elves vs humans), plans that make sense and almost work (moth) and good characterization. I found the last conversation between Verin and the king to be an awesome example of rolling 1 on a diplomacy check. Verin went into the room waiting to literally give his life for the king and walked out pondering how to take over (plausibly too).

After leaving the castle and the elf attack resolving... Things started making a lot less sense and the conflict (where there was any) did seem pretty forced. Also, Verin started doing things for the evulz for no apparent reason.
