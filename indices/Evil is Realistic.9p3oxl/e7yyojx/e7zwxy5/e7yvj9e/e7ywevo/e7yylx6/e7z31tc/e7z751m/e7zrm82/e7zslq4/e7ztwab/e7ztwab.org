They don't call Thanos 'The Mad Titan' because he rationally weighs his options before coming to a balanced decision.

Thanos isn't trying to save the universe, not really, he is trying to "prove" that his solution for saving Titan would have worked, if only people had listened to him.

Granted, the movie could have done a whole lot more to make this clear, but there /is/ an interesting character there.
