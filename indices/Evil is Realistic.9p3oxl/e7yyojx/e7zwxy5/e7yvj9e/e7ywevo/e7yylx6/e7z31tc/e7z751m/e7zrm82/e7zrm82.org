That's my take, as well.

I wouldn't even count Sauron as a villain. He's a force of nature, and killed off-screen. Vader didn't destroy any planets, and his character was redeemed by his love for his son. Quirrel was frustrated by the stupidity of everyone around him (and who /hasn't/ been frustrated by the incompetence of government?), and sees most of the good guys as enemies because he (reasonably) sees their conviction that people shouldn't live forever as a threat to his life.

The best villains are the ones that are a dark reflection of the protagonist. They're who the protagonist could be if they give into anger (Vader) or weren't brought up by loving, moral parents (Quirrel), or have a different concept of what "saving the universe" means (Thanos).

Yes, they need to be an effective opposing force in order to make the conflict interesting, and yes, there needs to at least be the /appearance/ of an irreconcilable difference between the antagonist's goals and/or methods and the protagonist's. I haven't seen /The Dragon Prince/, so I can't comment to the effectiveness of the villains.

But having the villain just be capital-E *Evil*, with no effort taken to give them existence beyond the fact that they need to be opposed, robs you of so much depth that could exist within the story, if you make who the villain is and what they want important to the story.
