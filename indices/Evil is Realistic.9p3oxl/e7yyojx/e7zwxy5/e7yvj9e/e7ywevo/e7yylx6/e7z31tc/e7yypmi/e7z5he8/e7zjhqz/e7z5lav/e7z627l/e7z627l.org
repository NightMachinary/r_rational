I really like your post! It made me think a lot about my favorite villains. I don't know if I agree with villains NEEDING to be evil to be interesting.

For Thanos, I don't think he was necessarily a dumb guy with no personality. His nickname was the Mad Titan, mad as in insane. And he literally was courting Death, who has a physical manifestation in the Marvel comics universe.

Sorry it's hard to keep track of what I want to say by typing on a phone. My thoughts are everywhere here. I think I just started agreeing that his role as a father was pretty distracting to the plot as I was typing.

However, as some other counter examples of villains who weren't evil being done well:

Watchmen I think the villain I liked most growing up had to be Ozymandias, who was a hero. According to the author, Rorschach was meant to be horrifying to the readers as someone who was unable to compromise. Ozymandias, always had the good of the world as an end goal, and ended with him +temporarily+ succeeding.

The musical /Wicked/ was pretty mind blowing for me as a kid, too. In that story the villains are the heroes in /The Wizard of Oz/. Actually I don't remember much about the story besides the awesome soundtrack. But that's another story where the Villain isn't a BBEG, and does it well.

Again, I really like how your post got me thinking, thanks for sharing!
