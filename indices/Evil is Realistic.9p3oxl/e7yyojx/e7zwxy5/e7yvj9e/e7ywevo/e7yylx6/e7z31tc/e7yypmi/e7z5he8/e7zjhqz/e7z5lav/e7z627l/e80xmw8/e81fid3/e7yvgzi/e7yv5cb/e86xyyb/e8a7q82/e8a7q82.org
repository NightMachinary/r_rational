I disagree. This may just apply to me and few other people, but I strongly prefer characters who are not pure evil, except in a few rare cases. In history, there are rarely actual pure evil. Hitler was anti-animal cruelty for example. The book series I think that does this best is A Song of Ice and Fire. The books do not have any clear villains besides a few smaller characters like slavers and insane killers. Most of the antagonists are anti-villains who do evil things, but also love their families and will do anything to protect their children. I think that's incredibly accurate to real history, where people do love their children and do anything for their children. And that makes sense with evo-psych too: As an animal, your primary goal above literally everything else should be to ensure the survival of your children.

I strongly disliked it when Viren said he'd prefer the egg over his son's life. You can be near morally bankrupt but still value the lives of your children, most people do.

As for my exceptions, I'd say there are a few pure evil people in the form of sadistic serial killers. Characters like the Joker or the Slaughter House 9 represent them. No major army-leading or nation-ruling people are pure evil though, you can't rise that high without someone realising you're pure evil and stopping you from advancing.

But that might be just my preference. What's realistic may not be what makes for the best stories in general after all.
