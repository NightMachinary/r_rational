Yeah, but it was advertising itself as complex and political; with the phrase "wrongs on both sides" prominent in the trailers; and it's diffused on Netflix, which means they're targeting mature-ish audiences.

Besides, it's still a missed opportunity. Cartoons can tell ranges of stories that aren't available in live-actions. I'm sick of these stories being dumbed down because people assume kids/teens can't tell the difference.
