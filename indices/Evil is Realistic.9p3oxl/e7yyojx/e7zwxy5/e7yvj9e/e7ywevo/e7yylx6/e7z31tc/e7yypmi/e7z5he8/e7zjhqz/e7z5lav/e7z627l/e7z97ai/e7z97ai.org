IIRC, /Wicked/ actually has an extremely simple black-and-white morality; it's just mostly inverted from the original story. The Wizard is absolutely portrayed as an evil antagonist figure and Elphaba is absolutely portrayed as a heroic protagonist figure. It's more thematically about how the winners write history than about morality being grey.
