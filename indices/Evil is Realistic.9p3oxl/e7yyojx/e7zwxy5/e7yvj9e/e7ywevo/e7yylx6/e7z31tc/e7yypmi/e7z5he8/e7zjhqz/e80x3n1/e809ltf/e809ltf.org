  I think the problems with The Dragon Prince are a lot broader than "not wanting to commit to an evil villain"; though it is a problem: you can't have a guy who's trying his best to save the king's life in difficult circumstances, laying his own life on the line, and have the same guy try to kill the king's kids two days later.

I caught that part of the show when my son was watching it. To me, it came across that the advisor had been corrupted by the magic he was doing and his loyalty to the king had been keeping him from tipping over to full evil. Once he was put down by the king, then he lost that last anchor.
