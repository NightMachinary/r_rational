I think it is because Thanos is traumatised by the death of Titan, obsessed with it.

At the time, He didn't have infinite power. So his solution wasn't to double the resources, he couldnt. He wanted to half the population.

But he sees he needs to fix that problem that exists on other worlds. So he goes after the means to do so. He gets an army, followers, etc. And he starts to massacre worlds like Gamora's. He looks for powers to do more. So he discovers the Infinity Stones and attempts to gather them, And use them to continue his goal.

At this point he is set in his ways. He has been doing it for decades. He believes he is right, despite what the rest of the universe says. He plants his feet and says "you move".

Which is part of my problem with Cap in Civil War. Sure he was right. But what about the next time? Or the next? Eventually he will be wrong. Thanos is wrong, but he believes he is right.
