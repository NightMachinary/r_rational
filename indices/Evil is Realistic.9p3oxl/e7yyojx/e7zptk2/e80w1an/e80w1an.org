Just to be certain, when you say "But no, he's gonna kill half the universe because he can't be arsed to take three seconds to think of alternatives." you *ARE* referring to the three seconds he has after acquiring the last stone before Thor rainbow-ports in and chucks a god-slaying lightning axe at him, yes?

Because, while I disagree with his entire line of thinking, it's kinda moot until he actually has all the stones, and he never gets to test to see what their limits are before /yet another guy/ appears and tries to kill him. Except, unlike the last 30, he manages to take a critical wound from Thor and has only a few seconds left before he dies to make his Wish.
