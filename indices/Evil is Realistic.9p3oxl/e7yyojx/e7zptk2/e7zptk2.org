Movie!Thanos' motivations are easy to follow, but they fall down when examined in the light of collecting all the Infinity Stones. The Stones could easily rewrite the universe to have twice the resources, or give every civilization, knowledge, and tools capable of letting them use far fewer resources. He could be the greatest savior in the history of, well, ever. But no, he's gonna kill half the universe because he can't be arsed to take three seconds to think of alternatives.

In the comics, it's easier - Thanos would do that because he's not sympathetic, he's a dick. He could think of all the alternate ways to use the Stones and still go with killing untold numbers of beings because he just really, really, really likes killing.
