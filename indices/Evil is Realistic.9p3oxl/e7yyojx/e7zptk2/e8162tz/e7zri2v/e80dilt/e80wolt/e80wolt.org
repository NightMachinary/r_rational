Your making up some nice headcanon as to why the overpopulation argument works in the movie.

However, there's really only four answers.

Yours is the first, and most unlikely. Apparently their entire universe ignores all the learning we have on overpopulation, and it was designed to be this way for some weird reason.

The second is that Thanos is /insane/. In fact, he's called the "Mad Titan", so there's a lot more support for this. He went through a traumatic experience that shaped his younger life, and from that he has built his entire worldview. He tested his beliefs and found that they seemed to work (Gamora's homeworld), so decided to keep increasing the scale. This is one of those "Category Error" situations where someone has failed to understand the true nature of the problem, and by sheer chance or other influences they don't understand their response /seems/ to work, so they just upscale it... until it doesn't.

The third is that the /writers/ believe that the Overpopulation is a thing in reality, and are letting their biases bleed through to their work. Either this is because they don't actually know any better, or because they have some ethical or political agenda.

The fourth is that the writers /originally/ had a different motivation in mind, but had to change it for some reason (quite possibly dovetailing with three). For what little evidence I can think of for this is in the first Avengers movie, the mid-credits scene where his advisor tells him that to challenge the Avengers is "to court Death", followed by Thanos' big cheesy grin. This is more in line with the comics, and probably was the original intent until they had to re-write it for some reason--perhaps because of their beliefs, or perhaps they didn't want such a far out there motivation. Or likely because they don't have the rights to a certain character. The last and most likely is simply that the writers have changed over the years, and what Group A intended might not be what Group F chooses to implement.

As it stands, the second, third, and fourth reasons are not mutually exclusive. Any of them can be true or not true in any combination and it would still apply.
