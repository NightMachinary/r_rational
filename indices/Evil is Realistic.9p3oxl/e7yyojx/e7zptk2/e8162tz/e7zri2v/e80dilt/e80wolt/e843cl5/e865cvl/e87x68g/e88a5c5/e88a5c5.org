Yes it is an oscillating process with its amplitude decreasing in time. But as you mentioned in the predators and prey system, if the swing is too big some population die of.

I'm worried about the shape of the first bust. In that period human condition will deteriorate and we will live in poverty for decades. Human society needs a sizable number of professionals to function correctly, if new generations are too small, a sufficient number of professionals might not be available. This will lead to cascade effect where we produce even less resources to sustain itself and the bust keep going down to the Middle Ages.

​

We need to implement the measures NOW so the swing is as little as possible.
