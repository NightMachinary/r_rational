Well, their entire universe has kind of been shown to ignore all the learning we have. I thinks it's just one of those suspension of disbelief things, that sometimes you just have to take into account when watching some fiction.

Thanos says overpopulation is an existential threat to even advanced, high tech life, seems reasonably intelligent throughout the film, and has spent centuries (I assume) taking action to stop it. He even gives examples in the film, of how not only his planet was destroyed by overpopulation, but also how Gamora's planet was on the brink of succumbing to the same issue before he 'saved' it, so we can reasonably assume that, in his travels, he's seen many such planets going down his old home-worlds path, and so had his beliefs reaffirmed.

I just took it to be suspension of disbelief, which is kind of also basically the exact same thing as your third point. If the writers believe that overpopulation is a thing in reality, and are letting it bleed into their work... then in the MCU, overpopulation is a thing, because it is the writers that determine the laws of their created universe, not actual science. So my head-canon, I think, looks very similar to your third point, when you look at how they actually affect how we should interpret Thanos's place in the story, and the sanity of his plan. So I don't really think you can separate my argument from yours in a way that actually matters. (Which means we agree :D )

I do think the 'to court Death' thing is good evidence for your fourth point, but I think they probably changed that motivation long ago enough to have put some serious thought into Thanos (though it also could have been multi-purpose; with so many big purple villains, they may have just wanted a way to clearly signify that this was Thanos, and never actually intended to use his OG motivation).

I agree almost completely with your third point (in fact it's part of my head-canon). I agree that Thanos definitely is mad. I just don't think he's stupid and that, within his less than sane world view, he actually behaves pretty rationally and realistically, and that makes him a good villain.
