Well Thanos's planet looked hyper-advanced, and still managed to wipe itself out with overpopulation, despite what every trend on Earth tells us about the effects of technological advancement and wealth on population growth, so we can assume that humans are a special case (population growth wise), in this universe. And creating more resources doesn't solve the underlying problem, as you can only use the Infinity Gauntlet once (seeing as how it broke immediately after the snap). Thanos believes that life will always eventually outpace the amount of resources given to it, and that he only gets one-shot at saving the world, so from his point of view it's easy to see why he immediately rules out creating more resources. (The irony here is that creating more resources has the exact same flaw as killing half of all life; eventually life will catch back up). He's still wrong though, that's why he's the villain. But I don't think there are as many holes in his logic as people tend to assume. I'm not arguing that Thanos's plan is super logical, or even rational. I'm just saying that it's easy to look at the backstory they gave him (and the kind of trauma that would cause), look at the tools he has, and kind of understand why someone who actually deserves the title the Mad Titan (emphasis on the Mad part) would come to the conclusion he did.

I'm still kind of assuming they're going to go more into what the Infinity Gauntlet is, and what it's limits are, in the next Avengers film, revealing a ton of information that might make our entire argument invalid. Every time Thanos warped reality, it eventually faded (e.g Mantis didn't stay a pile of rocks on the ground forever). Maybe it can't create something out of nothing in the MCU, so doubling resources wasn't possible? Maybe it could not only do that, but create a never ending fountain of food, and Thanos just didn't think of it? Who knows?

I think that, given how the MCU changed Thanos and his motivations, they're probably going to change some stuff about the Gauntlet and how it works, to make those motivations make more sense. After all, from what I remember from my vague readings of the comics, the Gauntlet isn't supposed to break after one use, so already things are different from the comics.
