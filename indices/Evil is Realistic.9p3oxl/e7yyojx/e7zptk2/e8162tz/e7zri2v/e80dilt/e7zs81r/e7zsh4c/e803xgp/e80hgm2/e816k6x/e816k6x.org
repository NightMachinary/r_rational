Steelmanning the Snap so that it works to achieve its goals: rather than doing anything instantaneously, it instead manifests as a demiurge that watches for every organism attempting to conceive children throughout time and space, and then will ensure a universe-wide One Child Policy on every plant and animal. (That is, it allows an organism to continue to pursue an R-selective strategy by creating as many children as it wants, as long as at most one of those children themselves reproduce. Any children beyond the first that /would/ go on to reproduce, are instead retroactively erased from existence, so that they were never conceived, leaving only the ones that /won't/ successfully reproduce alive.)
