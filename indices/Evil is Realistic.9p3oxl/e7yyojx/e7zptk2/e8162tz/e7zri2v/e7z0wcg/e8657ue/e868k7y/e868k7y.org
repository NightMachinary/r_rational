Oh yeah, that part of Thanos's plan is something I also find poorly thought out. There are probably tons of civilizations out there in the universe that are just going to go extinct, because they can't afford to lose half their people. Lose half of a modern society, and yeah, it's tough, but maybe we can still manage to make it through. If half of you stone age tribe turns to dust, you're probably just wrecked.

But I went on to explain my views on Thanos and his plan in much more depth, in other comment replies on this post. I think we actually agree on most stuff, but I just don't feel like retyping it all again.
