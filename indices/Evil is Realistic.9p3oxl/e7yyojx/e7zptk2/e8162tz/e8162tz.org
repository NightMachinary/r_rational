Potentially surprising assertion: Thanos is the *protagonist* of /Avengers: Infinity War - Part 1/.

A /potentially/ convincing argument: you can look for a hero's journey arc for him, and you'll find it. Refusal of the Call, Meeting with the Goddess, Apotheosis, Refusal of the Return, Freedom to Live, etc. It's all there.

A knock-down argument: at the end of the movie, there's a card that says "Thanos will return in /Avengers: Infinity War - Part 2/." The only time that card has ever been used, so far in the MCU canon, is in a heroic (rather than epic) story, to say that the protagonist of the story (the eponymous hero) will get another movie.

The question of whether /Avengers: Infinity War - Part 2/ will continue on with Thanos as protagonist, is left open to interpretation. I have a feeling it will---just being told in the mode of tragedy. (Hamlet is the protagonist of /Hamlet/.)
