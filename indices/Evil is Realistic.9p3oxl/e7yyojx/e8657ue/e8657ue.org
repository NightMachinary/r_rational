I disagree with people saying that halting the population and doubling the resources are the same thing.\\
In case of resource increase populations will continue to grow undisturbed, and reach a point of failure again.

In case of massive genocide society will fucking collapse. Rebuilding will be much harder. Fuck the world called decimated come when 10% of a unit is destroyed making it no longer functional.

This is not considering that Thanos plans on remaining around putting all the universe under the threat of genocide in a couple hundred years if needed. Single planet are highly motivated to insure population control policies if a giant maniac with unlimited powers is around.

​

Also Infinite gauntlet is not infinite. Killing half population wrecked it. And destroying is easier then creating. I believe increasing resources would be beyond its powers.

I strongly believe that continuous menace plus a demonstration of its ability to carry out the threats through mass genocide is the FASTEST way for Thanos to achieve his goals.
