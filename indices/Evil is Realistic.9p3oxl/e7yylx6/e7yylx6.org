I'd list The Joker's portrayal in The Dark Knight. The movie spends a good amount of time contrasting his motives with run of the mill gangsters, and some people certainly entertain the idea that he's got a point about whether or not a person turns out good and evil depends on external pressures/circumstances, but he's still really transparently /fucking evil/.

There's also Kreia in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, who doesn't add tension by violently attempting to stop the heroes, but instead by constantly undercutting their belief that they're doing the right thing, and still, in the end, is /really fucking evil/.
