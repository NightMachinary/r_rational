  I wouldn't even count Sauron as a villain. He's a force of nature, and killed off-screen.

Yup. Having only watched the LotR movies, without reading the books (I know, I know), I actually can't answer the question of what Sauron /wanted/. His motivation was, IIRC, literally never stated in the movies. He's just... a bad guy. He wants the ring, but that's an instrumental goal. He wants to take over the world, but even /that's/ an instrumental goal.

What would make Sauron /stop/? What would make him /satisfied/? What would make him go retire to a log cabin, like Thanos?

I don't know. And I don't /need/ to know. Because Sauron isn't a character in the story of LotR. (He's a character in the /backstory/, but not the /story/.)
