>! The advicer/black mage looks later like an evil character in hiding. !< (hope that is how to make spoiler tags)

not sure if you mentioned it later, but since I disagree with the first premise I stopped reading.

the essay is too long to read it, especially if I think the premise is faulty. I probably wouldn't read it if it was about my fav. show.

You need a tl;dr

Still to prove your writing advice, write a story (maybe shorter than your essay) with a pure evil character and then change the villain parts so it is the kind of villain you think is less good.

Then make a story with the kind of villain you don't like and rewrite a version with an evil villain. (better ask another writer who believes the opposite)

Now publish those 4 versions and ask the readers to rate it. Compare results. (Maybe include metaanalysis like how long where readers on the page before voting or came back or...)

After you know your measurements make a prediction for each measurement and what a failed pridiction meant...

Or write a 4000 essay why you are right.
