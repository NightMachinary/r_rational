Nice post! Have a mostly-tangential comment.

Lately I've spent a lot of time thinking about Daniel Ellsberg's [[https://www.amazon.com/Doomsday-Machine-Confessions-Nuclear-Planner/dp/1608196704/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1539293405&sr=8-1&keywords=the+doomsday+machine+daniel+ellsberg&dpID=41%252BmzqktiML&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch][The Doomsday Machine]]. The author was a RAND consultant working on nuclear war planning in the '50s and early '60s, and the book describes how he, his colleagues, and the US military decided on hugely risky war plans for what seemed like good ideas at the time. One highlight: the Joint Chiefs of Staff deliberately hid their nuclear war plan from civilian authority, because their plan was basically "as soon as US and Russian forces interact at all, we launch all nuclear forces immediately against both Russia and China". What business did a goddam civilian have, telling battle-hardened veterans of the US military how to conduct a war?

An especially chilling part is when Ellsberg requests a bunch of details from military planners, knowing they'll be uncomfortable giving him a straight answer. Indeed, it's mostly met with radio silence. The only response he gets is about casualties; they've already got the calculations, and they predict the plan will kill 500 million people if carried out. (They didn't know about nuclear winter at the time, so this was an underestimate.) Sober men, men whose intellect and principles Ellsberg had come to respect, had calculated out that number and decided it was a necessary risk. They, after all, were the guards on the wall between civilization and obliteration, men who had to make hard decisions in the face of a totalitarian existential threat.

I think there's a lot of viewpoints out there that have cackling-madman consequences without being FOR THE EVULZ.

(Oh, and if you're interested in the book, there's also a great [[https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/daniel-ellsberg-doomsday-machines/][interview with the author]] (+transcript!) on the 80K website.)
