  Let's talk theory before looking at the specific implementation in /The Dragon Prince/. While people praise the /idea/of complex, three-dimensional villains whose motives can't be summed up as “because he's evil,” the villains people actually praise are pretty damn evil. Sauron is basically just a big old pile of evil. Darth Vader blows up a planet for basically no reason. Agent Smith wants to wipe out humanity. Anton Chigurh is a psychopathic killer who murders someone just to test his makeshift gun.

I don't think this really supports any sort of larger theory about villains, for the simple reason that these are screen villains and actor presence and filmmaking can pull a hell of a lot of weight even when the writing slacks (though being well written in general helps too). Chigurh is Javier Bardem playing the creepiest robot person he possibly can. Vader has the mask, the voice, the cool lines, and the fight with Luke where he becomes an indomitable force of evil instead of just a big guy in a silly helmet. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is just a fun, wacky goofball with cool scenes where he spouts cod philosophy. Heath Ledger's Joker mentioned below is a fun and creepy synthesis of silly comic book villain and serial killer. Whether or not the evil of these characters is realistic is besides the point, because the trick is that they /become/ interesting and cool and give the impression of a personality through execution. Something which is far less doable with prose (or even with animation) simply because the rules and toolset for film is different.

And... I don't really know who really consider's Sauron a great villain. I mean, he's a pretty good fantasy visual shorthand for the abstract concept of evil. But he's hardly a villain in the sense that he's a character in the story.

The stuff about tension and the need for a threat to the heroes is fair enough. But it focuses too much on the in-story nitty-gritty of how they're a threat and misses the theatre and thematics of it. For Vader, the ultimate clincher of his status as a villain during the Bespin duel wasn't how much of a threat her was physically to Luke. It was how he turned the entire core of the story totally upside down with one line. He's so evil and so indomitable that even the entire concept of the hero fighting the villain crumbles in his grasp, leaving only Evil standing before a broken Luke, who allows himself to follow the shattered pieces of Good into the pit (also his redemption strengthens the arc as a whole after the fact by having Luke break down the hero/villain dichotomy in turn but that's another discussion).

This is why Thanos, despite very spotty writing is a pretty baller villain and has been received so well. Because he's an anthropomorphic representation of the question of how far a man will go to achieve a goal, and answers that question with ALL THE FUCKING WAY MOTHERFUCKER. He's the man who's will to do what he thinks must be done is so strong that Earth's mightiest heroes can't stand against it, and Josh Brolin crushes it selling that concept.

The problem here is that you're over focusing on the granular diagetic elements of a story and not enough on the thematics and execution that makes villains really memorable. All fiction is to some degree theatre, even if different mediums operate on different rules, and the best villains leverage that to do half the work for them.
