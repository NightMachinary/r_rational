I agree with a lot of what you said. I had the same thought when writing my own story, and one of my editors thought the villains were "cartoony" and "unrealistic". However with the Dragon Prince it feels to me like maybe the danger and tension doesnt come from the advisor figure, but from /the protagonists themselves/. There's a reason the egg wasn't destroyed but instead hidden. That reason is obviously to keep humans safe. The dragon prince can be raised to care about humans or he can be used as leverage to negotiate with the magical races in a final ditch effort to save the humans. I fully expect a "nice job breaking it hero" big reveal moment at some point in the future. And there were already a bunch of people trying to find the princes and bring them back, and if they were caught their elf friend would have been in danger.
