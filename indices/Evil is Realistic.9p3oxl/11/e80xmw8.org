It's odd reading this, because my favorite characters in The Dragon Prince were actually the villains. Which, like... I guess that indicates a failure insofar as I was supposed to be more invested than I am in the heroes' success, but honestly, watching Viren trying to salvage the political mess he'd been left with and watching his kids struggling with the orders he gave them got me way more invested in things than watching the heroes arguing with each other and then cleaning up the resulting messes did. If the villain-POV sections had been cut out of the show except where directly relevant to the heroes' experiences, I'd be much less likely than I in fact am to go on to the second season when it comes out. So on my view the show's villains were written extremely well, although I'll grant that the narrative suffered from the degree to which it treated Viren as an Obvious Villain Figure even before he started doing anything particularly evil.

Separately from the Dragon Prince-specific case you made, on which my view seems to be outlierly judging by everyone else's comments here, I've got another counterexample against your case for definitively-evil villains being important: Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha.

Nanoha is a particularly action-focused magical girl show, featuring excellent fight scenes and excellent characters; it's pretty much exactly the sort of source material your various examples above were drawn from. The first season worked basically according to the model you've laid out, with a highly sympathetic non-evil antagonist working for a much-more-evil-but-still-well-characterized-and-not-just-a-personality-void antagonist, and with the latter providing driving plot force when the former falters.

But then there's the second season, which is widely considered to be better than the first. The second season dispenses with that model, instead having no evil antagonists at all, just various groups of sympathetic antagonists reacting to a lousy situation which was established centuries prior. There's one group of sympathetic antagonists who are running on lousy information while trying to save the life of another sympathetic character; there's another group of sympathetic antagonists whose plan involves sacrificing a few innocent lives in order to destroy an artifact which kills large numbers of people on a regular basis; there's the artifact itself, which is sapient and actually hates the killing-large-numbers-of-people-on-a-regular-basis thing, but is corrupted in such a way as to be unable to stop; and then there's the artifact's self-defense system, which is the ultimate cause of the whole mess (or at least the ultimate cause that's directly relevant to the plot, its creator presumably being long dead) and is barely even sentient and thus not really evil in any way worth mentioning.

And all of these forces colliding with each other and with the heroes creates plenty of conflict for the season, with no need to bring in any more straightforwardly evil villains. The role of the antagonist-that-ultimately-drives-everything is instead played by the barely-sentient self-defense system. It works extremely well, being the best season of the show in the eyes of a large fraction of the fandom. (The remainder mostly like the third season best, for reasons I don't really understand.)

In light of the example of Nanoha's second season, I think your model is too narrow. I'll happily grant that unambiguously-evil villains can be realistic and can do a lot to improve narratives lacking in driving threats, but I think you're going too far when you reject narratives which omit them, even just within the space of the action-driven narratives you're focusing on. The protagonists need a strong threat to work against, yes, but appropriate threats can equally be non-sapient forces of nature, or well-intentioned opponents acting due to misunderstandings, or well-intentioned opponents who /actually have reasonable points/ working against protagonists doing stupid risky things, or dozens of other sorts of non-evil threats. All that's necessary is that there be /some/ sort of intimidatingly-powerful force gunning for the protagonists whose defeat will be followed either with the introduction of a new serious threat or with the conclusion of the story.
