Good points, but I think marvel kind of has its bases covered here with what it can do to make Thanos make more sense. Thanos seems to have come from a highly advanced civilization (going from the tech they had going on in the brief snippet we've seen, and that he seems to be immortal, and almost all the immortal aliens in the franchise seem to be hyper-advanced). So he a lot of reason to believe that having more technology and knowledge isn't the solution. And creating more resources is just as bad a solution as killing off half the universe, if you're main goal is to stop overpopulation and you can only make one 'wish ' (seeing as the infinity gauntlet seemed pretty wrecked after the snap). Thanos is wrong, of course, but I think there aren't as many wholes in his logic as people tend to assume, once you actually examine the backstory marvel gave him.
