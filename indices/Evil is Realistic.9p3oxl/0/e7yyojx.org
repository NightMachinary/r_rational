I agree with almost all of this, except for the argument against Thanos. Thanos was, in my opinion, and in the opinion of most of the people I know, one of the best things about Infinity War, because of how well he was characterized.

Thanos is, in my opinion, your example of a pure evil villain done right. Thanos is evil. His motivations are evil. The fact that he thinks he is right doesn't make his motivations any less evil, but it also leaves him acting a lot more human that other classic superhero movie villains, and that came off pretty well.

He even fits the universe. Thor is thousands of years old, but still acts like a normal person, so this is a world where immortality and time doesn't necessarily lead to ever escalating emotional maturity and wisdom. The idea that a Thor-style immortal could watch his entire planet- his entire species- self-destruct due to overpopulation, and come out of that obsessed with 'saving the universe' by doing everything he could to fight over-population, felt realistic to me. It even fit with the rest of the Marvel universe, and even felt like an escalation of already established themes; Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron are both films that either start, or have their main conflict defined by characters going way too far in their quest to "save the world".

Thanos isn't meant to just turn up and punch the avengers until we all get bored. That's not the kind of villain he is. That's not the kind of villain you foreshadow in the first Avengers film and then spend the rest of the franchise planting little teasers about. Thanos, in my opinion, serves as a worthy ultimate villain of the franchise precisely because of how he was characterized.

Tony wants to save the world, and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. He invents Ultron, an AI based on alien technology he doesn't fully understand, against the advice of the only other expert he consulted (Bruce wanted to ask the team), and nearly caused the extinction of the entire human race. Hydra (at least in the Winter Soldier) wants to save the world; they want to protect people from the dangers of freedom, and create a safer Earth by enforcing Order all over the globe; and they do some pretty messed up things in order to try and achieve that goal. Killmonger wants to protect/liberate/promote his people, and, again, is willing to do some pretty messed up things in order to achieve what is actually a pretty messed up goal, but, again, is one you can easily see him viewing as noble.

Civil War is essentially an entire movie based around the idea of people having two separate ideas of what is good and right, and coming to blows over it.

Thanos is a good ultimate villain for the franchise, because he takes these themes, and runs with them, taking them new and unexplored heights. How evil could someones goal be, while still allowing them to think they're a hero acting in the best interests of everyone? How psychopathic could someones actions be, and yet still let themselves pretend they're the hero of the story? Thanos is meant to be the answer to that, the series final examination of the ideas that have permeated so many of the films leading up to this. His characterization, and the time spent on it, was necessary for him to fulfill that purpose, and considering how well the film was received, I think it worked pretty well.

TL:DR - I think Thanos is an example of a realistic villain done right, not an example of how "evil is realistic" would have been better.
