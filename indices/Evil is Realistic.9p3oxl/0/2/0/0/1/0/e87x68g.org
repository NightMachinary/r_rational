I dismiss it because it stabilizes either naturally or unnaturally.

In nature, a balance is established due to the effects of predators and prey and resources, barring an invasive species. In the case of the latter, it focuses more on the supply and demand side of necessary resources. IE: There will be a boom, then a bust, followed by smaller versions until parity is reached or the entire population dies off. In a normal scenario its more of a see-saw effect. These clearly don't work 100% of the time with sapient beings by dint of the fact that they are sapient. Thus, the second option.

Humans tend to have overpopulation only due to finding a new equilibrium with their environment. In most cases, the groundwork is laid down in a culture that has a high birth rate due to high mortality. When that culture transitions to a safer environment, via technological advancement and/or destruction of its mortal threats, it tends to take awhile for the cultural need for large numbers of children to lessen. During that time it suffers from overpopulation issues. Once the need dies down, however, a more reasonable balance is made.

This is why the birth rate is lower in more advanced countries. They don't /need/ as many children to replace their losses, because there aren't any, and life can be more about ends other than survival.

The same would occur in a hypothetical future or alien world that in any way follows similar principles of survival and advancement. One COULD say that some alien race may not have the same groundwork, but doing so means the overpopulation argument doesn't either.
