Thanks for the great read! I agree with a lot of what you mentioned. It's one of the reasons that everything after the original star wars felt sorely lacking. There was no immediate threat and feeling of urgency in them. There's no big bad that makes your butt clench on behalf of the characters. There's a lot of melodrama and pausing, breathers that feel forced into the story for the sake of creating a connection with the characters
