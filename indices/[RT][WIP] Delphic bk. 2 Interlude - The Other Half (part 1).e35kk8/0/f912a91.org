This is the first half of the Lady Liberty interlude. It got a bit longer than expected, and I decided that the rest of the scenario could stand on its own as a second chapter.

The rest should be up within a week, and then I'm going to try to keep up a couple of chapters a month at least through the end of Book 2.
