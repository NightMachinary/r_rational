Erm, I'm sorry, but /which/ history, exactly?

Learning all of it would be a chore, of course, but are we limiting ourselves to the kind of Classical education that an 18th century polymath would know? Should we focus on the history of our nation of origin, or branch out? How specific should we get about minutia, or how meta should we get about historiography/historical sources? To what extent should the average person be paying attention to files being declassified, and the implications for the historical record? Of course, that's only relevant for history of the past 500 or so years, earlier than that and we're mostly rehashing interpretations of known documents or integrating archeological knowledge, barring uncommon circumstances.

There's quite a few directions to go regarding history education -- some of them hopefully even relate to the craft itself. But there are decisions to make above just "History", given that people generally don't agree on what constitutes the basics.
