I think a /modern/ well-rounded person should basically be the equivalent of an 18th century polymath. You should know:

- Math
- Science
- Engineering
- Literature
- Technology
- Art
- History
- Economics
- Politics
- Philosophy
- Biology
- Food
- Geography

... and you should know these things fairly well. You should also know when you /don't/ know something, so that you don't expose yourself as a fraud to a domain expert - meaning, you shouldn't pretend at having expertise where none exists, and if the extent of what you know about Brutalism is that it was an architectural movement, you should know enough to stop there and not making educated guesses in conversation.

If you want my advice on how to accomplish getting to a point where you could consider yourself well-rounded, I would say to go grab some college syllabuses and see how much of what the 101 classes are discussing you actually /know/ (not just things that you've heard of). College textbooks are dirt cheap if you grab old editions that no one is using - generally speaking, most subjects don't undergo huge changes. If you are in college, you can usually grab an old textbook from any professor. They have gobs of them, because they get sent them by the textbook companies.
