This sounds worthy and thoughtful, and I wish you the best of luck. There are many places to turn to learn and to find resources about how to learn. It might be worth checking out [[/r/lesswrong]], which is a subreddit related to the Less Wrong rationalist community. Other places to check out include the comments section of the blog [[http://slatestarcodex.com/][Slate Star Codex]] which is full of people who are trying to become well-versed in all manner of things.

[[/r/rational]], despite the name, is actually a subreddit devoted to rational and rationalist fiction (and fanfiction). You'll certainly find people in [[/r/rational]] interested in what you're doing here-- many will share your interests. Given that what you're talking about is reading, which is pretty close to fiction, you're pretty close to being on-topic. Hopefully in this thread and at the communities I linked you find what you're looking for.

All that being said, I will be downvoting this post to reduce its visibility on this subreddit. I wish to discourage divergence from the core goal of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] , even when I think the thread is good, like this one is.
