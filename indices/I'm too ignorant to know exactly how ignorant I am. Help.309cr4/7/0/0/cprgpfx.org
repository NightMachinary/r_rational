The thing about online encyclopedias is that they use hypertext. If you want structure and context, just click on the blue text :)

If after a wikiwalk you feel that you need more structure, consider looking for a MOOC that teaches whatever topic interests you. [[https://www.coursera.org/courses][Coursera]] has a broad selection, for example.
