Everyone, not just well-rounded people, should know basic medicine. How to clean and dress a wound. How to treat shock. How to treat a sucking chest wound or flail chest, since those can kill quickly. How to move someone with potential spinal injuries. How to make a splint. How to recognize common maladies and potential big problems -- like ectopic pregnancy, heart attacks (notably, women have appreciably different presentation for heart attacks than men, and the media only portrays male heart attacks), and appendicitis.

You can learn this in ten days for about US$700 with the Wilderness First Responder course.

I wish this were a standard part of high school education.
