You say you are not just interested in sounding impressive and knowledgeable to people, but rather in knowing the sort of things a "well-rounded person" should know. Can you expand more on that?

I guess what I want to know is what do you want to use that knowledge for, exactly.

If you just enjoy learning things, there is always [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random][random wikipedia articles]]. Try to read the talk pages, too, and form opinions beyond the neutral-point-of-view.
