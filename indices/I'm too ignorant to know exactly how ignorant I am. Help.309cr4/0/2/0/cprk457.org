Predict what regions you'll be interacting with most. Get a decent overview of their history -- the sort of thing that averages ten years per page or thereabouts. Then get a more detailed overview of more recent history, something like the past two to three hundred years.

Also spare some time for Roman and Greek history from the imperial period, if you're dealing with western nations, or Chinese history in antiquity, if you're dealing with eastern nations. This is for much the same reason as you'd study literature -- the actual impact today is nothing you can't glean from recent history, but people make references.
