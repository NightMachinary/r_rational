Social theory? Psychology? Anthropology?

All more fundamental than politics, right? Like, politics is an extrapolation of these things and history?

If you want to understand the human world around you, you need social science.

And no specific mention of computer science? I don't think we all need to know how a combine harvester works, but without coding your impact on any given field is reduced.

My list is pretty cut down from yours.

  Maths

  Physics

  Chem

  Biology (focus on human biology and medicine)

  Computer science (focus on coding and systems design)

  Social science (focus on psychology and social theory)

  Economics

The rest on your list are extension or interest topics to my mind.
