Most of the topics have direct, obvious utility.

Literature helps expose you to divergent viewpoints in ways that you likely wouldn't get from the rest of the topics. It's also useful socially in that you can talk about it and understand references.

Food knowledge is useful socially. It means you can talk about food, and you can go to a wider variety of restaurants while knowing what you might want and, more importantly, not being afraid.

Art knowledge is useful socially. Additionally, a dry analysis of it (as opposed to appreciation of art) works similarly to literature: how people choose to portray events, and which events they choose to portray, tells you about the people.
