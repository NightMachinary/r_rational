Read "Guns, Germs, and Steel" for history. Then hop over to [[/r/AskHistorians]] and [[/r/badhistory]] and read their opinions on the work (but seriously read the book first, it's important to the lesson). This process will both brush you up on a lot of history knowledge, and explain some of the major pitfalls of being an autodidact.

For the sciences, I would recommend learning Newtonian physics thoroughly, with calculus-based kinematics, and deriving out contrived scenarios involving springs and pulleys and magnets for yourself. It's the most practical, visible portion of science on a daily human scale and it has some of the most approachable math.

You can't learn too much math.

If you just want to have learned conversations, the most bang for your study buck is art history. The history of music and architecture are the most broadly applicable. It's also really enjoyable to know.
