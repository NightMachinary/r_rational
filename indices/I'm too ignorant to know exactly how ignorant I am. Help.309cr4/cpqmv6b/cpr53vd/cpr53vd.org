Weirdly, the most thorough criticisms of Guns, Germs, and Steel I've ever found are in the reviews section on Amazon. Many of those reviews are garbage, and this is true no matter what the reviewer's opinion on the book was, but there are a lot of people there calling out the people who are posting the garbage comments which helps result in a good understanding of what is and is not valid in the book.

In contrast, on [[/r/badhistory]] I found a couple very general complaints, a couple very specific examples of flaws, and lots of scoffing. The [[/r/badX]] subreddits in general are bad for neophytes to learn from because they're dominated by the social signalling games of more knowledgeable people.

[[/r/askhistorians]] doesn't suffer from the scoffing, but had a similar problem with not targeting the criticism at the right level to make me feel the full extent of that book's failure. The overview criticisms seemed somehow weak, perhaps as though argued in bad faith, and the specific criticisms got bogged down in trivial details and didn't normally provide strong alternative explanations.

I'm not saying those sources shouldn't be looked at, they were helpful to me. But in addition to them, I would recommend glancing through all the reviews on Amazon and paying attention to anything that seems interesting (while being sure to fact check the reviews, and to read the comments replying to them).
