We live in a capitalist society. A well rounded person needs to know about business and the economic history of the rise of the west, the basics of materials chemistry and telecommunications technology. Additionally, one should know everything about coffee.

JK, I don't know. I always kind of figured that its /better/ if everyone had different spheres of knowledge, that way you become a more well rounded person by talking to people and learning from them directly. Plus, if you all know the same stuff to start, what's the point of talking at all? The fact that you are educated in /something/ is a great start, I wouldn't beat myself up over not knowing what you're "supposed to."
