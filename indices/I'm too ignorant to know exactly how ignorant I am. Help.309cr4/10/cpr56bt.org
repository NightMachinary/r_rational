It's difficult to answer a question like this without having more information. Obviously, learning everything about everything is what would be ideal if resources weren't limited, but they are. What are your personal goals, and how do you rank them relative to one another? Do you want to learn things which you can apply? Do you want to learn things that help you understand the world around you? Do you want to learn things because learning is fun? Do you want to learn things so you can talk about them with others? Which of these is most important to you? Are there any other things than these which seem potentially valuable to you?
