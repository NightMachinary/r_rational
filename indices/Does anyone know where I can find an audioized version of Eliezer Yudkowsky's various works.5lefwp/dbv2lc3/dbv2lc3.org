There is a website where a podcast of HPMOR has been made: [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/]]

If you're looking for things other than fiction, you'd probably want to look in [[/r/lesswrong][r/lesswrong]] or [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]] instead of here. [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is for works of fiction.
