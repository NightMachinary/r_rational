  Gaining control over various "autonomic" functions, like heart rate.

I think this is more along the lines of [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2939454/][biofeedback]]. There have been studies that show meditation to help directly control heart rate, but honestly they don't sound like meditation to me [[https://www.theconnection.tv/use-mind-control-heart-rate/][like in this one]], where they ask participants specifically to pay high attention to their heart rate. I've gotten the impression they're related skills but if that's your goal, meditation probably isn't the most efficient route there.
