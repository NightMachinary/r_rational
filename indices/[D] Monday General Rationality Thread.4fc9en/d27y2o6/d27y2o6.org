Another thing I wanted to discuss was my magic system. Please note that I'm trying *not* to compare this system to other people's- I've discussed this with friends and they're like "Brandon Sanderson this/that" yeah, that's cool, but I'd like my own.

What if mana was a resource like fuel, not inherent in any person, but rather around and in our environment, with certain areas where it would/could be gathered?

Then I'd use runes to interact in various ways with the mana, and different runes stacking/providing various effects.
