That's part of what I'm trying to figure out, I want to figure out how I want mana to work in the series. And the conversion laws, being the laws of thermodynamics or newtons laws, etc?

Basically, mana is this pseudo-physical element, which has some special properties. In gas form, it can be interacted with via runes or stored in containers like any other gas, however, without runes on the container, there are some strange effects (working on that part)

Certain runes can initiate a 'burn' effect, where the mana is used up like gas and a bunsen or stove burner, and based on that rune, the "burn" can be controlled to cause different effects, such as a "cold" fire which actually reduces the surrounding heat in the area, or increase heat, one which generates electrical current or one which absorbs electricity, acting as a grounding line.

These effects would only be active so long as there is mana there to fuel it.

The design of the runes which channels and powers the mana would be similar to the way language works. You have a bunch of lines which make individual characters, and the combination of these letters make phrases sentences, and so forth.

Runes may be anything from 3d shapes, to carvings, to drawings on a piece of paper. Each medium will be able to create different effects, but these shapes which mana react to are going to be a natural part of the world, and animals, land features, plants, etc, will all have different reactions to these systems based on this.

What do you think about these rules? It's basically all i've got after a few days of thought on the subject.
