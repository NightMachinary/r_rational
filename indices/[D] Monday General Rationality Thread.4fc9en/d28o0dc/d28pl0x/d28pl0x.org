Get into a comfortable position. Set a timer for 5 minutes. Close your eyes, sit still and focus on something specific e.g Your breath, counting, a particular idea or sensation. When you notice you have started focusing on something else redirect your attention back to whatever you were supposed to be focusing on without judging, shame or feeling frustration.

Doing meditation consistently and regularly is more important then doing it perfectly. If you keep feeling frustrated then either lower the amount of time you do each day or have multiple shorter sessions. As you become better at mediation and more patient you can increase the length of your sessions.
