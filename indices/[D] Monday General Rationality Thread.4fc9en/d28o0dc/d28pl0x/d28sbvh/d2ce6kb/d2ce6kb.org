  I feel like there should be a skill progression, like any other art

Well besides the obvious route, practicing meditation under states of duress, I've heard anecdotal evidence that that's a thing. For instance, building on the skill of "paying attention to something", I've heard:

- Falling asleep in seconds by force of will, by focusing on hypnotic imagery.
- Gaining control over various "autonomic" functions, like heart rate.

Frankly, I'm not familiar with the meditation literature, so I don't know how well this stuff checks out, or what a recommended progression would be... but you can worry about that a thousand hours (or at least a hundred) from now. There's a LOT of progression to be had in the basics.
