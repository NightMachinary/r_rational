I would suggest guided scripts initially; [[https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app][Headspace]] is a good place to start, the free trial is a good way to get started. There's also a similar progression of audio scripts that can be downloaded [[http://franticworld.com/free-meditations-from-mindfulness/][here]]. Then move on to solo sessions.

Personally, I find the "body scan" technique (both links will teach this) useful to get into the mindset and then continuing much like MrCogmor suggested. There's also square breathing (breathe in for 4 seconds, hold it in for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, repeat).

Last, some people suggest doing this before bed and if it works for you, great, but personally I found I started to associate it with sleep and would instead suggest trying it at junctures doing the day (just got home from work? 10 minutes).
