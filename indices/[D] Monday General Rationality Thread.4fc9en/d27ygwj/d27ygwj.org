Another story from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4eb2md/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d1yxt6h][my ongoing adventures in the day clinic]]:

The most amazing progress has been happening. My brain rather suddenly updatet from alieving that it is stuck in a child-like state that needs to be afraid of /everything/ to alieving that I am now an adult.

Tasks that were previously were hard for me are kinda easy now, and I am rather happy as a result.
