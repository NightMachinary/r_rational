Retrospective realization about HPMoR: the fact that the kid who teaches people to yell "Blood for the blood god!" is kinda the bad guy and very much not to be admired... really should have come as less of a surprise. I mean, I didn't know shit about 40k then, so I took it as a fairly cheap joke, but no, Khornates and other worshipers of the Chaos Gods are /never, ever/ the good guys. They're the /Larger Context Villains/.
