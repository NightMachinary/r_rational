Is this veering into "Hitler ate sugar" territory? I mean, sure the actors who use that battle cry in WH are nasty, but it's an admittedly badass one, even in the absence of any WH knowledge. If you're going to find fault with HJPEV using it, the fault is in him getting into situations where he needs a battle cry in the first place, not in choosing this particular one. If the only piece of information you had about a 11-year-old boy is that he used such a war cry while playing wargames with other children, you'd conclude that he's a fabulous chuuni nerd, not that he's a burgeoning Dark Lord.

I think that going all conscientious objector on the 11-year-old Ender-esque wargames and dedicating himself to something that actually matters in the long run might have been a better strategy, but the whole point of his character arc is that he's still a child at the onset.
