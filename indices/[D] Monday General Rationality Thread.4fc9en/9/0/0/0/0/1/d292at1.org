MrCogmor has some good points, but you also want to keep in mind the implications. That runes - human-created geometric shapes - hold the ability to define how a fundamental force is expressed implies something about the laws of reality.

For example, say if you were to uncover a cavern replete with mana, either the mana of the entire cavern or certain zones within it would group into the shape of what has become known and used as runes, each rune-formation affecting reality within a certain radius. Why mana groups into runes may have an answer similar to why molecules form in specific patterns. I find 'magical magnetism' an unconvincing reason, but it's convenient. However, magnetism itself has far-ranging implications on how the universe works, and so will your meta-force that defines how mana groups into shapes. Other suggestions might be emotions having a metaphysical and lasting impact on the earth and or mana, mana being an engineered force that is not naturally occurring, mana being an organism or domain of organisms rather than a force, etc.
