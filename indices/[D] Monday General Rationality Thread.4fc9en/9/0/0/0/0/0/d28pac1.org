What are you designing the magic system for? What kind of setting do you want it to like? Generally the exact mechanics are unimportant, what is important is the applications and limitations. It doesn't really matter whether you enchant a magic object with runes, words, rituals or magic crystals compared to whether magic items are uber-rare luxury goods, common upper-class items or household equipment and how easily they can be used for automation.

If you are trying to make a story then it is generally easier to alter a magic system to suit a plot then create plots suited to a particular magic system.

The magic system as outlined is fairly generic in tvtropes terms is geometric magic + background magic field + functional magic.
