Mana is a renewable resource in that it reappears after 4 thousand years or so, from deep under the earth. It is not renewable in that after the majority is burnt off, the mana seeping out is quite small. That said, the amount in my story is roughly equivalent to fossil fuels today, however finding wells of it is much more difficult than finding wells of oil/natural gas, at least for the first ten years of my story until people figure out how to use it more effectively.
