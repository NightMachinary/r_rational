Yesterday I started implementing on a life hack attempt.

For every act of 'feel good' charity such as funding a cat's pacemaker, helping out a friend or maybe donating time at a soup kitchen/giving a bum some change.

You match it with a large scale 'best good' donation to a charity.

Ideally you should try and do these close together if able.

For me I'm currently siding with funding malaria nets as my 'best good' charity to match.
