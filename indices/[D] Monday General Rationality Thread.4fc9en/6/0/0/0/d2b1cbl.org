Might have to go back three years for some straight lectures, but it's worth it. Not sure how necessary the powerpoint slides are, for the professors that used them.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/StanfordUniversity/videos?sort=da&flow=grid&view=0]]

Similar to the above, but more of a focus on guest lecturers than full lecture-based courses.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/oxford/videos?sort=da&flow=grid&view=0]]

Similar to the above. I'm just googling a university name + youtube.

[[https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/]]

Might be the better option over the above link.

Not sure how to navigate that site. Might want to just search by topic, rather than browse large categories.

Now I'm googing "audio + [discipline] + lectures".

This site is worth exploring further.\\

For anything else you'll have to either be more specific, or try to query yourself.
