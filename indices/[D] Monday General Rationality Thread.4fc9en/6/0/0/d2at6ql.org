My interests are wide. Sciencey stuff, philosophy, game theory, history, politics, offensive jokes, Fantasy... As for domain expertise, while I can listen to stuff all day long, I occasionally have to just pull the plugs out for a few minutes without waiting to pause, and my eyes are busy scanning documents, so I can't pay attention to the screen most of the time. Would have loved to learn coding (I'm a beginner and have been learning a little html/js in the last month), but I don't think that's much of a learning by listening project. If there is any particular [[/r/rational]] approved skillset you can learn mainly by listening to stuff (I don't mind potentially relistening to the same thing a few times), I'd be interested in that. Learning a new language, maybe?

So far I've listened to youtube Let's Plays, creepypastas and started relistening to the hpmor podcast.
