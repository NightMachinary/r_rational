If I recall correctly, you get one free pass to post a brainstorming thread for your potential works for every piece of work you post to the site, be it a chapter or the work in its entirety.

That said, I'm unclear on what qualifies - is, "munchkin this system!" disallowed without a pass? What about, "What might the world look like today if in 1973 someone won the Randi prize, then disappeared without any trace whatsoever, and no other has since won the successor prize offered to determine whether others like the first exist?"

Paging [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] for answers.
