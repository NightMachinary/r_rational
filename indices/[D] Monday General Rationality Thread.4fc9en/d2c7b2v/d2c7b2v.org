Judging by the sidebar rules, it's unclear whether I can make a [BST] thread for a new series I'm considering. I have written books in the past but never plugged/shared them here, and the [BST] thread would be helping out with the rules of a new series. Can anyone with more experience with this subreddit's rules help me out?
