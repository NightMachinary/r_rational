I started at a new job yesterday. What the company does is they/we receive tens of thousands of documents every day and digitize them. My work is just making sure documents are appropriate, whole and in the correct order. It is exceptionally monotonous, and the pay is pretty good because people hate how boring it is. However. We get to listen to podcasts/youtube/whatever while we work, as long as we can keep a good pace. So. I think I can make this work. Anyone got any good recommendations for a guy who has eight hours/day to listen to stuff on the Internet?
