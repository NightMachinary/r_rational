Well, here's the theory behind impairment of visual development, which I think makes a good deal of intuitive sense:

Normally, a baby hits some object with their poor motor skills and watches how it reacts. From that, they begin to build up an intuitive understanding of physics, just like our savannah ancestors did. The rules are easy to learn, given lots of examples, and eventually the baby understands physics.

Television doesn't follow physics. For one thing, it's all two dimensional. For another, there are a ton of cuts and fades. If a baby is watching bowling on television, he might see one shot as the bowler releases the ball, then a shot from a different angle as it goes down the lane, then a /third/ shot from behind the pins as it makes a strike. Adults can follow this, but the movement of a regular ball in the room with him would be confusing enough for the baby. The baby not only doesn't understand what's happening on the screen, it actively hurts his developing sense of physics, because he's getting fed information that conflicts with the other rules his brain is learning. This results in an overall slowdown of him learning rules.

But nice sounding theories aren't what science is about, so maybe that's just totally wrong.

As far as language learning goes, it might be that the extra auditory input from television is harmful to development because it's so divorced from anything interactive; the baby can listen, but when they point to things off-camera and say words, the baby might be learning that those words don't carry meaning, in the same way that a baby might end up confused if you held up an apple and an orange and called them both bananas. It's not enough to just /hear/ language, there need to be some feedback mechanisms in place so that the baby can actually learn; otherwise the baby learns that there /is/ no feedback from that stimulus, or gets confused about what rules are in play. Further, a baby watching television gets exposed to a /huge/ variety of accents and dialects, which might hinder development by obfuscating the rules.

At least, that's how I would steelman it. Needs more evidence though, and early childhood stuff is notoriously difficult to ethically test given consent issues.
