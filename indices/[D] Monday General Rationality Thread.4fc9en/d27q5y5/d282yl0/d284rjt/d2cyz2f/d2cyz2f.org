I wonder if it's less of a problem with tv as a general thing, and more of a problem with the type of things that are on tv. If tv shows are designed now to constantly flash new things on screen to hook peoples attention, then it makes sense that you would lose ability to intentionally focus your attention.

I have not seen the current state of modern childrens shows, so I have no data to back this up.
