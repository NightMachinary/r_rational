The perhaps more insane part is that early childhood science isn't the only area where these answers are lacking. It's still not clear how anyone goes about learning a language, including adults. Even a simple question like, "Is there any language learning task X such that, if I keep doing it, I will learn this language to fluency?" appears to have no definite answer. There are a lot of people with different ideas (such as conversation or comprehensible input, which both beg the question of how precisely you begin comprehending or conversing -- and if you converse using only Pimsleur phrases back and forth, how could that possibly help you learn the 99% of the language that cannot be represented in such a constrained format?), and is FAR from being settled at all.

If deliberate study is needed (again: we have no idea if it is) then can this be done without another human? Unknown, because we have no idea /what/ the deliberate study would entail. If we design a task that we think will allow people to learn a language a la Pimsleur, there is an additional wrench that /clearly this is not how children learn./ So we're back at square one.

EDIT: My two cents: I've been learning Mandarin, and I've found flash cards useful. Popping an infant down with those would be... I don't know. Everything is an experiment in this area, but like I said, I find flash cards useful for increasing comprehension in real life scenarios that occurs at much fast speeds and in different contexts than the flash cards.
