Mostly it comes down to moderator discretion, with the guiding principle that [[/r/rational]] is for rational fiction, not brainstorming about it.

[[/u/royishere]] - post something short, such as a contest entry (not necessarily the current contest), and then you're clear. Feel free to ask in modmail if there's any other unclear rules.

The idea is that this allows some brainstorming, but also encourages the creation and posting of rational fiction :)

[[/u/TennisMaster2]] - the first would probably be disallowed regardless, the second should be fine (if OP is eligible). Our preference is for a snippet-plus-questions format, so it's already rational fiction in progress :)
