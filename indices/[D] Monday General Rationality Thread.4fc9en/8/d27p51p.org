The average total-correlation-explained gain from conditioning [[https://probmods.org/hierarchical-models.html][the third model given here]] on the sample data they specify is 2.6545447488 bits.

Now to try to re-code their fourth model, and do my own graph showing the TC of the conditioned-on data, the total-correlation-explained by the model, and the mean-squared-error and variance of the prototype from the ground truth. That should expose something interesting about how TC helps abstract learning proceed.

Then other things.
