I'd say that this applies to children below the age of 5 if at all.

There's a minimum level of comprehension that you need to make TV a useful resource for learning a language (a few hundred words and basic grammar); and even then it kind of depends on the type of show.

I'd expect research regarding how adults can learn a foreign language without access to study materials to have some useful information about this, assuming it covers media.

I can tell you a bit about how I learned English, but it's not really proper research.

Have you considered that watching TV might not necessarily hurt language development, but that these children simply lack other useful activities that would have been done in that time? In addition, there's also the possibility that early on in an infant's life there 's a crucial time where they can get a massive leg up compared to their competition by engaging in interaction instead of watching TV.
