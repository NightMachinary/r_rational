More confusion:

I read a study in The Economist that looked at the impact of the rollout of Sesame Street across the US. It didn't go national all at once so the researcher was able to see what impact it had. Turns out it increased the school grades and adult IQ of the kids who were exposed.

So an example of TV being good.

Unless totalTV stayed the same and it was just SS instead of Giligans Island which made the difference. Both could have lowered IQ but SS by not as much?
