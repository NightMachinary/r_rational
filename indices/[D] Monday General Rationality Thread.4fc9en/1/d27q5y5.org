It's currently recommended that you not let infants watch television because of the risk of attentional problems and slowed brain development in regards to language and vision.

I'm not a hundred percent convinced of this, especially since there are studies like [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4042392/][this one]] which contradict that wisdom. There are a lot of confounders, since there are a lot of things that are likely to be different between a child that watches a lot of television and one that doesn't. For example, I would expect that this divides along class, education, and wealth lines. In general, I find the state of early childhood science to be quite lacking.

However, if I'm going to follow the advice to limit television exposure /anyway/, because while it might not be detrimental I wouldn't really expect it to be beneficial and there's little risk in limiting television time, I'm left curious as to what mechanism might be at work there. Would we expect radio to be equally bad? Podcasts? Talking to children is supposed to be good for language development, but is it the component of interactivity or just hearing the words? (I think my biggest problem with trying to find out the answers to these questions is that so many of the results are idiotic blogs that are content to make assertions without backing them up.)
