[[/u/Dwood15]], [[/u/Quillwraith]] pretty much said what I was trying to:

(Mistborn spoilers below)

By the definition in the sidebar:

- Nothing happens because the plot requires it.
- The conflict is mostly due to factional differences instead of plot points.
- The characters solve problems with their brains.
- The rules are sane and consistent.

It meets those requirements fairly well.

On the other hand (repeating my spoiler warning):

- The characters actions are also driven by prophecy and the subtle and direct actions of two opposed god/elemental/people (whatever you want to call Ruin and Preservation, or Ati and Leras)
- Ruin is pretty much Evil. That /is/ its beliefs and values, and it /is/ what drives it into conflict with everything else, but still...
- No real complaints about how they solve problems.
- The rules are sane and consistent, but the actions of Ruin and Preservation can make them act less like physics (including magic-physics) and more like something people do.

I'd give it a solid B+ for how well it fits the definition of "rational fiction."

The second question is how useful is knowing that Mistborn is rational fiction actually is. (I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader.)
