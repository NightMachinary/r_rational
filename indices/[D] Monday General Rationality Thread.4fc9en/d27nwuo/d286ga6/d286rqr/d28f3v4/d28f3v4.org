Words carry a lot of hidden information, and whenever a word is used to describe a thing that only meets some (or none) of that hidden information, it is less useful.

For example: Is this particular ostrich a bird? (alternatively, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/][is a whale a fish?]])

A "bird" is defined as a member of the class /Aves/, and an ostrich is a member of that class, therefore this ostrich is a bird.

The second question is how useful knowing that the ostrich is a bird actually is. If I knew nothing else about ostriches, I could make the following predictions with relatively high certainty:

- It has four limbs (two legs, two wings), a beak, is endothermic with a four chambered heart, and lays eggs if female. (True)
- it has hollow bones (Partly true)
- It can fly. (False)
- It is larger than a golfball, and smaller than a toilet. (False)

Describing an ostrich as "a bird" is less useful than describing a duck as "a bird" because it matches less of the hidden information about what "a bird" is.
