I'm not sure I'm interpreting this correctly, but I believe [[/u/ulyssessword][u/ulyssessword]] is implying that Mistborn is a border case of the category 'rational fiction', and that describing it as rational is thus probably accurate, but not very useful.

(Sorry for stating the obvious, if I am. I'm not sure I interpreted your post correctly either.)

Incidentally, I would certainly consider Mistborn to be rational fiction myself, for the same reasons Rhamni pointed out.
