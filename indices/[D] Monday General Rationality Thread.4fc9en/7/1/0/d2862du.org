  Throughout the entire story he tries to be a hero, fails miserably at it and it ends up being the psychopathic antagonist that saves the day from his stupidity.

Partly from his own stupidity. Partly. But also, and I do think this is what the author was trying to convey, /he wasn't even looking at the right scale/. The moral of the story was supposed to be that only Albus Dumbledore was actually playing the right game to begin with by considering the Larger Context Problems rather than the day-to-day political jockeying.

That, and ALICORN PRINCESS HERMIONE DID NOTHING WRONG, but that's just my personal and insistent interpretation.

  He did have heroic intentions though.

Heroic intentions, but started out as literally a copy of the villain's mind.

  I don't think the blood for the blood god quote contradicts that.

It shows that you're looking at someone predisposed to act in blatantly villainous ways. Even among the Four Gods of Chaos, /Khorne is a nasty motherfucker/. He doesn't particularly /favor/ slaughtering the weak and defenseless, but hey, he'll take their skulls if no better skulls are available.

Actually, I take back the first remark. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG7VvMGw6w0][They're /all/ nasty motherfuckers.]] Death to Chaos and Heresy with it.
