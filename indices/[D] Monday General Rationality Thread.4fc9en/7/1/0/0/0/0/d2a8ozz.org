[[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Chuunibyou][urbandictionary has a somewhat adequate summary]], which is, incidentally, the first result google returns on "chuuni" search string.

Essentially, I'm referring to the fact that Harry acts in over-dramatic fashion without much apparent self consciousness. He also sees himself as someone truly special and acts correspondingly (as is typical with chūnibyō), but that's not as relevant in this particular case. From the outside he looks like an archetypical chūnibyō (even though he arguably doesn't fit, once his thoughts are known).

Jeez, [[/u/Velorien]] and I spent like ten minutes discussing whether HJPEV can be accurately described by the term or not. It's a bit tricky to precisely define.
