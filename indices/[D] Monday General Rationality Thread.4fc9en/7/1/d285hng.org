Hmm. Kinda the bad guy, I guess that's one way to put it. Throughout the entire story he tries to be a hero, fails miserably at it and it ends up being the psychopathic antagonist that saves the day from his stupidity. He did have heroic intentions though. I don't think the blood for the blood god quote contradicts that.
