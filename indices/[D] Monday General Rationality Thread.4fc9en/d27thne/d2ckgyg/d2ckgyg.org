Assuming you're income's not too high, Turbotax literally makes it a breeze in my opinion (uploading your W2 and 1095s, etc. that it tells you to, and answering it's question is just a few hours of mild effort).

That having been said, I would recommend keeping track yourself through the year of deductibles like giving to charity, miles traveled or items purchased for work. And depending on your experience, may want to claim slightly fewer deductions to guarantee that you don't need to pay the gov't.
