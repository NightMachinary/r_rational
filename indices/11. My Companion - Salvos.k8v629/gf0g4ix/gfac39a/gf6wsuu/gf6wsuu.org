I've been reading Salvos for awhile, and I'd very much recommend it. The characters are definitely the strong point of of the story, but it's doesn't lose out in other aspects.

My personal take is that the story is very much about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization][self-actualization]], and goes about it in a very literal way. Character progression is measured by evolution, where each evolution essentially "resets" the character in terms of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs][desires/needs]] and immediate goals.

The last few chapters have been especially good, with the story starting to take shape and the plot progressing nicely.
