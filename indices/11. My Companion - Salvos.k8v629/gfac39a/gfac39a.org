I just read the whole thing. It's good stuff. I care about Salvos, which is the most important part of any story.

I really want to see the opening chapters turned into an anime. No dialog, no narrator. All emotions conveyed through actions and camerawork. The scene where she investigates the rocks would be gorgeous. And then when she sees the first group, the camera would abuse perspective to show a rock next to her, and have it be approximately the same size and shape on the screen.
