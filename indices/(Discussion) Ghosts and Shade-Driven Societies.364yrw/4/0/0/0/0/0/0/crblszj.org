Well, it's basically like Beetlejuice and Ghost together. You play as ghosts in the Shadowlands, a cast off husk of reality, trying to figure out why you haven't passed on.

The only things that transfer from life into the world of spectres are things with emotion. So you can find say, a gun, but no one loves bullets. This makes arming yourself against the darker nightmare creatures in the Shadowlands difficult, as you only have random things that people once had strong emotions for.

Some ghosts have decided to form an empire. They use a money system with small coins and they roam the land looking for new ghosts to either draft into their armies or enslave into chains. But funny thing is, there's not a lot of coins or chains. Some of the ghosts have the ability to shape the bodies of other ghosts. So if you don't obey the empire, they pound you into chains and coins to be used by the empire. So every coin you earn and spend is likely some [[http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Obolus][poor bastard that's been folded down for currency.]]

In fact, it's hinted that the great city spires that their architects have erected may be partially constructed from shaped souls, and their entire economy and system is based on slavery and a torturous fate worse than death.

I just thought to mention that in context of your above post and interactions. Even in death, we can imagine greed and power abuse as a malevolent cruelty that churns for eternity.
