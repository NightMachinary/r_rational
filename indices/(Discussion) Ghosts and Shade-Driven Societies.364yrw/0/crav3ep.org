  They may apply acceleration of 13.34 metres per second per second per kilogram
#+end_quote

So they can accelerate heavy objects faster? I think you either meant 13.34 metres per second per second (limited acceleration) or 13.34 kilogram metres per second per second or just 13.34 newtons for short (limited force).

I think you just meant 8 watts (8 joules per second). 8 watts per second would imply that the power is increasing.
