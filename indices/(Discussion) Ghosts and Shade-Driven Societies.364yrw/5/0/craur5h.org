I misspoke. What I meant is that they "latch on" to the nearest mass that size or larger, gaining angular momentum related to that object's rotation and location. When a ghost is created, they've already got momentum from the earth enabling them to begin at rest - the thing is, as soon as they move within range of something else, that momentum is abruptly replaced.
