  They operate within the frame of reference of the nearest mass larger than 73% of the moon.

There's nothing here about a frame of reference. You bounded their acceleration, not their top speed. Although their acceleration is significantly smaller than gravity, so I guess they're accelerating compared to the ground. But it's not like the whole planet is accelerating in that direction.

I suspect people would always carry around some kind of drug they can take if they're about to die that won't make them spend the afterlife terrified.
