What's wrong with letting shades take samples of Alpha Centauri? They could send rockets to Alpha Centauri, which seems like more of a munchkin thing, but if you're doing that you could tell the shade to glow so you can shoot it with a railgun to lead it back to a ship. Or you could just use a ghost and shine a light at it.

I'm also not entirely clear on how this latching on works. Can they move faster than light if they latch on to a far away spinning body? Do they end up with the momentum they had compared to the old body, but now it's compared to the new one? What happens if the reference frame from each body pushes them towards the other body?
