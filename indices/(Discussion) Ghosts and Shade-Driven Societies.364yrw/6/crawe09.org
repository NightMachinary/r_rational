Ghosts and shades could presumably carry sensors into hazardous environments. Ghosts could also be used to search for survivors in earthquake or war areas.

Come to think of it, shades could be used to carry levitate weaponry and fire it at detectable targets in a given area. Essentially, be floating long-range patrolling mines. Or they could carry signaling hardware and act as targets for heavier ranged weaponry once they detect and lock onto a designated opponent.

How complex are atomic commands allowed to be? Could a shade be commanded to copy an artist's style? Solve a mathematical puzzle/equation? Summarize data? Perform research on whatever subject they were handed? Remember everything they ever sensed in perfect detail? Request data from other shades?

Can shades tell where they are, relevant to the planetary surface they're on, even if blind? Could they thus be given commands such as "Go to the lobby of the Empire State Building" or "Go to 13 degrees north by 65 degrees west", regardless of where they were currently located?
