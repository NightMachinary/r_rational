I'm rewriting chapter one to make it more palatable. There were too many pronouns, mixed perspectives, tenses and ambiguous parts. Basically I got excited and tried to cram too much at once. I'll be rewriting it and will probably have to increase the chapter length. Hopefully it because less jarring. You didn't miss anything. It was a quick way of describing Oliver as respectful, right minded boy. But it missed the mark and I've taken that portion out. Would you like me to let you know when it's ready?
