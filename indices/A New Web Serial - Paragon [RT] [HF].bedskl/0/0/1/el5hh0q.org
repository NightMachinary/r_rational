I'm just a random pleb so take it with a grain of salt, but reading through it didn't feel like it pulled me into the scene because dialogue alone doesn't carry a lot of tone. Not seeing the ticks, mannerisms, reactions and in general all of the nonverbal communication between the characters makes it harder for me to give a voice to the dialogue in my head.
