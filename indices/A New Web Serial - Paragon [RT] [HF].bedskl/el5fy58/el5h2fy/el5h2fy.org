Thank you for the detailed feedback. I'll pour through this and clean up my chapter. I was worried about the overflow of concepts to be honest, and it sounds like that was warranted. I'll see what I can do make it easier to understand and flesh out concepts when they are introduced.

When you say, “a lot of dialogue and not a lot of description.” What do you mean? Do you mean description of characters or the concepts themselves?
