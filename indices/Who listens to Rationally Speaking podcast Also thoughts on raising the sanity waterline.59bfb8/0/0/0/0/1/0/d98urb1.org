Two separate answers, seemingly contradictory and both true:

1) It's a thing we're working on, via improving our write-ups (both in content and in ease-of-comprehension) and experimenting with other things like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKpH-7fs9zE][videos]] and one-topic seminars. Ideally, we'll have at least 3-4 pieces of broadly-disseminated and useful content out there in the next year.

2) We've tried it, and it doesn't work. Actual experiments, actual data. I know where your "80% of the results" thing comes from, because I had the same belief going into my workshop, and it's only after seeing a variety of experiments first-hand that that belief has been shaken.

There are several things at play, here (longer, in-depth discussion [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/n5h/unofficial_canon_on_applied_rationality/ddco?context=3][here]]). First, the concepts interact with everyone's personal beliefs, preconceptions, problems, and goals differently, and you'd need something like fifty different versions to actually get the thing to land (and the difference between "mostly got it" and "really got it" is /in fact/ enormous---you get something like /20%/ of the results from an 80% version of the concepts).

Second, there are issues with idea inoculation, where people will /think/ that they get it, but in fact they don't, or they get something nearby, and this causes them to stop seeking and become complacent (and become resistant to further attempts to clarify or re-teach). In-person transfer prevents this at a much higher rate than simply dumping the information online.

Third, people just don't actually do the work---believing that Technique X is worth using with your System 2 (analytic, verbal, reasoning brain) doesn't lead to people remembering or putting forth actual effort, and instead leads to "Huh. Neat." followed by /no change in behavior./ The workshop environment, on the other hand, forces people to try things repeatedly until their System 1 (intuitive, nonverbal, emotional brain) learns "Hey, this /actually/ makes a difference," which results in /some change in behavior for some people./

(Note that getting people to update in the direction of rationality is /actually hard,/ and that we're in fact trying many things to see if we can improve outcomes in this direction.)

There are other concerns in the mix, like intellectual property and continuing to sustain our research through workshop revenue, but those are honestly waaaay down the list, and make up something like 5-10% of our reluctance to publish. Overall, the reason we haven't done a blitz of online education or published a ton of content is because we've tried it in the past in small ways, and it's actually worse for the world. It makes some people get the wrong ideas, makes others "full" and "satisfied" and stops them from seeking further growth, and simply doesn't work at all for the rest.

That being said, we have indeed occasionally provided our content (i.e. our ~200pg handbook) to those who've asked. There are people who are deeply suspicious of "you just have to come and try it," and I can't really fault their suspicion, as it pattern-matches to a lot of things that ARE fake or bad. But I'll note that NONE of the people who've just received our handbook and read it have reported leveling up, switching to better careers, doubling their output, etc. etc., which are things that happen fairly frequently after workshops.
