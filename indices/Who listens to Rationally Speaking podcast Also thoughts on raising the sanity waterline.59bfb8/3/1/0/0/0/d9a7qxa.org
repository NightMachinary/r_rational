I'd rather not have to defend my spiritual beliefs /again/, since I am incredibly unlikely to change my mind at this point. I've filled in every obvious hole in my belief system to the point where it cannot be disproven, and the act of having faith in the existence of something I cannot prove is something I have accepted about myself.
