Thank you for answering my question so well and dissuading me from yet another existential crisis. I do really like rationality, HPMOR and LessWrong have taught me things that have made my life objectively better. Rationality is something I cherish, but it's things like this make me doubt myself, or at least give my anxiety and depression an excuse to latch onto that I can't easily throw off.

Ever since I first started reading Yudkowsky's LessWrong posts I found myself agreeing with his reasoning, but disagreeing with many of his beliefs. At the time, I decided that was okay since I was still learning useful heuristics that were improving my life. Over time, though, I got deeper into rationality and have become more judgmental of myself out of a implicit loyalty to the group's moral paradigm.

If if is rational to be an atheist, how could I claim to be rational if I am a spiritualist? If my values prevented me from giving up a belief that lacked objective evidence, why did I even want to be a rationalist? If I believe differently from them and I think I'm right even after they criticized my beliefs, shouldn't I think they're wrong and leave their community?

In the end, I decided those questions were irrelevant and I was just looking for excuses to beat myself up, but I've never managed to resolve the paradox that is me being here if I don't fit in. Religion is just one example. I'm the odd man out on a lot of the popular fiction posted here, either because I have different tastes or I'm outside the fandom they cater to, and I not only sided with Robin Hanson in the AI Foom Debate but consider the goal of building an AI God to be immoral.
