Only that I followed the instructions for how to perform astral projection, which appear to be the same across spiritualist websites, and experimented with gradually expanded my mental parameters for what I could do with it. Since there's no medium between my mind and what I observer while projecting, I suspect my visions were colored by my personal beliefs and yours will be as well.

I was already speaking to spirits at the time, particularly the dead and associated support staff, when I decided I wanted to speak to God personally. I entered a world of pure white where I met Jesus and he led me to a being that seemed to encompass the entire universe, actually looking like false color images of space, and spoke to me in a booming yet soothing voice that knew me and encouraged me to be the best I could be.
