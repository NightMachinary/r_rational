As long as you stay away from the same failure modes inherent to traditional religions and New Age pseudoscience philosophies, you're probably on the more-rational side of the spectrum. It may be that all you need are some courses on probability and epistemic philosophy to let go of the last vestiges. Just recognize that any friction you feel between them and the promotion of objective truths is going to occur for justified reasons, and don't worry about proving to others whether you're right or they're wrong, if you do at all. If your beliefs are based on subjective things, you know you can't do that anyway, so why beat yourself up over it?

If your personal beliefs make you happy and don't harm others, then it's really not that big a deal. Many people are smart and competent and still have irrational beliefs. That does make them "less rational", and if that bothers you, ultimately that friction is up to you to resolve at some point. I know plenty of people here agree with me in saying we'd be happy to help, but it probably won't happen as long as you /want/ to believe in spiritual things, or they provide you some irreplaceable value for now. Which again, is fine. No rush.

  but it often sounds like people intend to create something specifically to take over the world, which I disapprove of no matter how benevolent it is.

Super AI will take over or destroy the world when it comes into existence, or at the very least change it completely in unforeseeable ways. Specifically wanting to build a "good" one doesn't have to conflict with the belief that one shouldn't be built, but /recognizing that it will/ regardless of whether we want it to allows us to aim our beliefs and preferences toward "build a good one" rather than stand on "not wanting one to be built" as if that matters.

It's like talking about nuclear bombs. It was going to happen, eventually. Someone would discover how to utilize them. The choice was to either decide they shouldn't be built, and be at the mercy of others who do make them, or build your own so you could have some say in how events unfolded.
