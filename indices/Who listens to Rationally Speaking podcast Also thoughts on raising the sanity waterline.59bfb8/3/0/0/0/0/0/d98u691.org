  Ever since I first started reading Yudkowsky's LessWrong posts I found myself agreeing with his reasoning, but disagreeing with many of his beliefs. At the time, I decided that was okay since I was still learning useful heuristics that were improving my life. Over time, though, I got deeper into rationality and have become more judgmental of myself out of a implicit loyalty to the group's moral paradigm.

I respect EY immensely for many different reasons, but still disagree with him on a number of perspectives. Many of them make me think that I just don't know enough to understand the issue the way he does, but others I believe he would change his mind on if he had more info.

There's nothing wrong with disagreeing with someone you respect, as long as you do your best to be honest to yourself about why. If you can articulate your reasons for believing what you do, and defend them logically or empirically, that's great, even if you don't at the end of the day end up changing someone's mind.

  If is rational to be an atheist, how could I claim to be rational if I am a spiritualist?
#+end_quote

Are you a spiritualist, or a theist? You said theist earlier on, but there's a marked difference in irrationality between them. So maybe you can't be fully rational if you're a spiritualist, but you're still avoiding the blatant irrationality and hypocrisy rife throughout specific theologies.

  If my values prevented me from giving up a belief that lacked objective evidence, why did I even want to be a rationalist? If I believe differently from them and I think I'm right even after they criticized my beliefs, shouldn't I think they're wrong and leave their community?
#+end_quote

Ultimately, it's better to be a rationalist to some degree than not at all. If your life is improving from rationality, then that's the most important factor. Don't worry too much about how much you "fit in." Maybe that'll come in time, when you're older and wiser and learn more, maybe it won't and you'll find another community that you feel more part of.

  I not only sided with Robin Hanson in the AI Foom Debate but consider the goal of building an AI God to be immoral.
#+end_quote

Personally, I think building an "AI God" isn't about morality but necessity. It's going to happen eventually. Someone will figure it out. I want the people who do to have enough virtue and intelligence to do it in a way that benefits mankind rather than ends up causing suffering or calamity.
