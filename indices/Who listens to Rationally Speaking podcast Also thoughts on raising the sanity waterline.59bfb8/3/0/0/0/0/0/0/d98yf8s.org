I was under the impression that spiritualism was considered a form of theism, though it makes sense that it wouldn't be now that I think about it. It's a religion I've made for myself out of personal experiences and philosophical ideas I liked rather than an ideology I was raised in. I haven't had loyalty to a particular religion since I began to take issue with the Catholicism I was raised in, and even moved away from the trappings of New Age when I discovered I was embracing pseudoscience.

I said AI God because the way I've often seen a singleton presented is similar to Friendship is Optimal, even if the AI's values more acceptable. I don't think it's possible to build an optimizer AI, don't understand why anyone would ever want to build it, and find the idea of it ruling over humanity to be horrifying even if it is benevolent. If it possessed the same legal rights and responsibilities as a human then I would accept it as a politician, but it often sounds like people intend to create something specifically to take over the world, which I disapprove of no matter how benevolent it is.
