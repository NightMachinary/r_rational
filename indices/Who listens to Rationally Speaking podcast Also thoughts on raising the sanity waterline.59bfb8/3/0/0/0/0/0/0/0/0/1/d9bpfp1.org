Well, I don't think anyone's looking down on you. But maybe having such a different map from most other rationally minded people is making it hard for you to relate to them. Like, you feel like you live in a different world from them, and vice versa? Or something like that. It's not that you're being excluded or anything.

If you don't mind my asking, why do you need to believe in a God? If...

-your belief has no evidential basis

-you know that your belief has no evidential basis

-you know that you know that your belief has no evidential basis

-you consciously know what evidence is, and you know that truth is just a correspondence between beliefs and reality.

Then there must be some other reason why you're still holding that belief. Maybe "A world without a God would be too horrible a place to confront?" or "I need to believe that there's someone high above watching out for me, because otherwise I will feel very very unsafe, and that feeling of unsafety will cause a panic attack?" Or maybe even "It's socially unacceptable to be an atheist, and if I become an atheist then I will be ostracized and a lot of people will hate me, including my own family" or something like that. Or maybe there's some other reason. Regardless, you might want to consider whether there are any healthier alternative solutions to such problems besides consciously deceiving yourself.

I swear, I wouldn't have said anything if not for the fact that conscious self-deception probably makes it harder for you to evaluate the decision of whether conscious self-deception is worth doing. Evaluating the reasons you need that self-deception in the first place would be necessary in order to evaluate alternative solutions to the same sorts of problems that you would need that self-deception to solve.

However, if you are consciously deceiving yourself you wouldn't want to examine that deception for fear that the deception will fall apart, and if you don't already have alternative solutions that you know are likely to work, then you would risk being left very vulnerable to whatever problems you were using self-deception to solve.

Hopefully I haven't caused you any psychological distress with this post, I was just trying to explain it in a way so that other people here might have an easier time understanding you.
