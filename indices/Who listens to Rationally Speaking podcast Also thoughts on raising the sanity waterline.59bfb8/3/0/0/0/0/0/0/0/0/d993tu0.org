Well...thanks. I can tell you're just tolerating my beliefs rather than approving of them, but I still appreciate you working to bridge the gap for me. Seriously, reading that response did make me feel a little better about this when I would normally be looking for a reason to be depressed, so I'm calling this a victory for my self-actualization.
