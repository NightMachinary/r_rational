Rationalists /are/ weird. By definition of being in the minority, we're not the usual. But as I said in the other comment, the idea impicit in the concecpt of "raising the waterline" is that this is something that can change, and should change. That it is better to be (by and large) weird in the ways that we are weird, and that that weirdness should not be weird eventually, but the norm.
