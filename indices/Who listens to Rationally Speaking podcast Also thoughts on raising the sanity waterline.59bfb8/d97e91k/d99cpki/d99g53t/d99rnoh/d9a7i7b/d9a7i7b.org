I said tests to indicate that my beliefs do not fall prey to the biases that Yudkowsky mentioned in those articles, and I have abandoned beliefs that did me wrong like favoring pseudoscience while keeping the beliefs that have done me right like communing with spirits. I don't know the difference between spiritual and theological beliefs, and while I do believe in God I do not identify with any particular religion.
