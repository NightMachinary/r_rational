  Literally everyone has hundreds of irrational beliefs, and it's not something to feel shame or guilt or weakness about, but rather something to include in your awareness, and build into your understanding of the broader universe.

Well put. I don't want [[/u/trekie140]] to feel like people are looking down on him for his irrational beliefs, because as you say, we all have those. I really like how you define the distinguishing factor of what makes a rationalist /what happens next:/

  ...sacrifice some degree of comfort, blissful ignorance, social normativity, and general chillness... in favor of moving toward truth, accuracy, openness to objective reality, and (thereby) greater ability to successfully cause good things to happen in the world.

Doesn't mean people who disagree can't still enjoy rational, consistent, high quality, plot-hole-free fiction, but if they feel any kind of friction while doing so (if it's more of a rationalist story) or from the community, it's likely going to come from that difference in outlook.
