Because I think I've met God, and other spirits, while meditating and speak to what I think is God regularly. SlateStarCodex had an article called "Universal Love, said the Cactus Person", the pretty much sums up my experience except I wasn't on drugs. I don't have any objective evidence to indicate I was talking to God and cannot prove to anyone else that I was talking to God, but I still believe that I was. One of my other comments on this thread leads to my original discussion about this, which you can read for more detail.
