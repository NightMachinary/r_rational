This is perhaps my favorite expression of this point, and I want to add (for trekie140 and other people with similar perspective) that the first-order goal is less about "release all irrational beliefs" and more about "/recognize/ your irrational beliefs for what they are."

I catch myself having irrational beliefs /all the time,/ in part because I work for a rationality education organization, and we incentivize /noticing./ Literally everyone has hundreds of irrational beliefs, and it's not something to feel shame or guilt or weakness about, but rather something to include in your awareness, and build into your understanding of the broader universe.

Both "rationalists" and thoughtful, perceptive, introspective "non-rationalists" can and often do that. The difference is what happens /next,/ which is that, upon noticing an unfounded or unjustified belief, a rationalist then takes explicit steps to "update their map" and replace that belief with a correct, justified, or at least /less wrong/ new belief. The central assumption is that there isn't really any such thing as a "harmless" false belief---many, many, many of the weird things our brains do are /useful,/ but the usefulness of a false belief comes at the high cost of distancing us from a deep understanding of how things /really/ work.

Rationalists are those who, for inductive reasons, believe that the correct move is to sacrifice some degree of comfort, blissful ignorance, social normativity, and general chillness about what goes on behind the curtain in favor of moving toward truth, accuracy, openness to objective reality, and (thereby) greater ability to successfully cause good things to happen in the world.
