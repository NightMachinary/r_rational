I'll try to put this very gently, and I'm sorry in advance if what I say hurts you: I don't mean to make you feel pain for the sake of pain, but for the sake of truth and growth. We've talked before about your feeling of not "belonging" here, and I don't want you to feel further estranged: ultimately this subreddit is about rational stories, not rationality. But you expressed confusion, so I feel compelled to answer:

Your fears will not be dispelled before you "buy in." Your fears are totally justified.

To admit that you know your theistic beliefs aren't epistemically supported, but that you continue to hold them anyway, puts you under the "sanity waterline." That is partially what the point of it is: to measure the clear difference between people who can recognize and care about how rational their beliefs are, and those that don't know, or don't care.

The word "sanity" was originally used tongue-in-cheek, if I remember correctly. It's not that people who aren't explicitly pro-rationality and empricism are clinically, pathologically insane, just that they do seem at times "crazy" in particular areas of their thoughts/actions, and /do/ make rationalists at times feel like an island of sanity in a world of madness.

Not perfect beacons of sanity. Not flawless machines of sterling logic. Not incarnations and avatars of Truth.

But /rational enough/ to want to further understand our own brains and avoid what we know are its weaknesses. To resist the tide of biases and cultural baggage that crashes on the shores of our minds. And willing to say yes that matters and yes it's objectively better than the alternative.

That's going to be offputting to some people no matter what. Maybe it's going to be offputting to MOST people in most current cultures. But implicit in the idea of raising the sanity waterline is the recognition that this isn't set in stone: that people can learn, improve, get better at thinking more logically.

Superstitions, religiosity, and prejudice are all shrinking in many western countries as education becomes more widespread and information more widely available. That is not an accident, to me: that's evidence that while people are born with some irrational biases, others are culturally imprinted, and the attitude of not caring about those irrational biases is itself something that can change.
