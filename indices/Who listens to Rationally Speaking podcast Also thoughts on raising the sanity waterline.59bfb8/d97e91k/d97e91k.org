It's never been clear to me what "raising the sanity waterline" actually means, and the phrasing has always made me shirk. I instinctively assume that it means that they're extending the definition of insanity to cover holding irrational beliefs, which leaves me worried that I would fall under that umbrella as a theist. I know my spiritual beliefs aren't epistemically supported, but that hasn't made me stop believing in them.

Sometimes I worry that many rationalists see themselves as an island of sanity in a world of maddness, which has some distressing implications no matter which side of the line you're on. I am very likely to be overreacting to something that I don't understand very well, but it might still indicate a problem with marketing this idea. People like me need our fears dispelled before we buy in.
