You talked in the original post about raising the sanity waterline for the general population. Lots of groups do this, usually by working in a specific area, like general math literacy, or informing the public on better driving skills. Some also do general stuff, like the lifehacking community.

But CFAR is really focused on increasing rationality at the high level. In this respect, they're fairly unique as an organization. Some of the skills they teach are complex enough that you wouldn't ordinarily expect them to be taught underneath the undergraduate level. Because of this, I wouldn't say they're increasing the sanity waterline so much as to focus on making the a smaller subset of the population significantly more rational.

Of course, I say this only as an outsider looking at what CFAR does. For all I know, they may have a desire inside the org to reach out more to the general public.
