Yeah, but r!Animorphs is /snooty/ fanfiction. =P

We don't have any plans to expand to additional centers in the foreseeable future, but a major goal of the next four months is to basically double our instructor staff, allowing us to run two or three times as many workshops in 2017. Most of those will be within an hour or two of Berkeley, CA (and the time commitment is usually Wednesday evening through Monday morning, with a recommended day off Tuesday, so four days off from work).

Thanks for the thanks! It's pretty sweet to spend my time thinking about thinking and then finding ways to make it better.
