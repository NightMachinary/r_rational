It seems to me that unless you're teaching something that involves physical movement/object manipulation/equipment/etc, virtually anything can be taught online. It might not be the very best format, but I can't see why you couldn't achieve at least 80% of the results as in-person. You'd certainly be a lot more accessible and reach a lot more people. I assume that's the purpose of CFAR, so I'm very surprised they're not doing this.

As someone who is currently going through the Sequences, I think these are very inaccessible to the average person. Some kind of video course seems like a no-brainer. Can anyone explain why this isn't happening?
