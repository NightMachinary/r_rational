Disclaimer: Not the guy you asked.

I remember reading that the CFAR classes tend to be more group focused - there's a reason that the workshops are 5 nights long. It's a bit like math camp. If you just wanted to remotely teach somebody about biases and rationality, you would make the /Sequences/. (admittedly, this isn't in video form. I've been thinking about making a video series on the sequences for a little while, and it seems like the logical step for people to take)
