Because I keep telling myself I'll "get around to it" and never end up drafting a script? I think seeing the demand for a video series in action might have inspired me to actually take that up as an option.

(also, as for why nobody else seems to try, think about the niche the Sequences fill. They primarily cater to people who have already read most or all of the things the sequences are based off of - most of us view the Sequences the same way most of the readers of /Superintelligence/ and /Godel, Escher, Bach/ viewed those books when they came out. What more is there to say on the topic? Anyone who wants to know can just read the Sequences. But there is something to be said for linking similar concepts together and putting them in one place.)
