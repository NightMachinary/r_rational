  So how much should we be raising the sanity waterline, or where should we be focusing our efforts to raise the waterline? Thoughts?

We'll have our best shot at convincing people to do things that are fun or useful.

"Fun" seems kind of dangerous. If I'm being honest, the most fun I have with rationality is attacking beliefs that I'm already predisposed to dislike. Mostly, that turns out to be anti-bigfoot-style silliness. Or articles making some tribal point.

I'm not sure that "fun" is the best tactic because it's not going to accomplish all that much that's useful. We don't help people by giving them new ways to confirm their existing beliefs.

So, if we want to do it, I'd focus on "useful." And this would come down to measurement.

Do our approaches measurably improve our lives? Are we, as rationalists, healthier than other people in our demographics? Are we more likely to exercise? Happier with our jobs?

If so, I'd focus on the places where rationalism matters and get people in that way.
