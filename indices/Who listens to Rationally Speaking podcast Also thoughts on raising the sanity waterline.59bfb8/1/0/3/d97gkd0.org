I think it's the other way around. Our message is forbids dismissing or attacking low-status, "weird", people like transpeople, neoreactionaries, and the mentally ill, and so naturally transpeople, neoreactionaries, and the mentally ill will be disproportionately attracted to our community. The views beget the community, not the other way around.

Of course, without knowing what views you're talking about, I can't say for sure, but if you'd care to bring up a specific one maybe I can go into more detail.
