I've noticed that we do have a high number of people in that category, and I think that has to do with the fact that most 'rational' people were led here from places such as fanfiction.net, SV, tumblr, etc.

Very few people actually read fanfiction at all except for the most dedicated of fans like you'd find in our demographic. I'm sure it will get better as rational writers start getting bigger and branching out into OC.
