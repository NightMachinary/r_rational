I think another important question is why people are or aren't drawn to rationality. I have found our community to be overwhelmingly composed of members of the WEIRD demographic, which is a limited pool to draw from considering we want to appeal to the whole human race, and I think also biases our community towards views held by that demographic that aren't necessarily rational. My concerns may be overblown, but I still think it's important to understand who are becoming rationalists and why.
