  I'm sure many people here would prefer HPMOR to MoL, but maybe the community simply grew since then and that means the latter had a bigger basin of voters to draw from.

Sure, but more importantly popularity begets popularity. Some people who sub to this subreddit along with hundreds of other lit subs just recognise familiar titles.

  . My point was that if something receives a lot of upvotes, then it's very likely that if you asked everyone around here "hey, do you think this story is rational and belongs in this subreddit?", the majority would answer "yes", even if you wouldn't.
#+end_quote

That's where I disagree, I think people just see something and think "I like this" and give it an upvote. I imagine most people saw the post on their feed and don't give two cahoots what subreddit it was in.

This post is the perfect example, there's no way 18 people have read it, considered its place in this community, then came back and upvoted it all without contributing to the discussion.

  The only alternative model would be to have some sort of committee of Rational Fiction Guardians whose opinion is used to vet which works are appropriately defined as "rational" even against the opinion of the unthinking masses if need be and, well... you see where this is going, and it gets especially ridiculous for such a small community as this one.

Plenty of subreddits have automod comments upvotes which moves the voting system from the main page to the comment section where at least people will see the automod message and know what community they're in.

I remember that discussion on [[/r/anime]] and talking about Avatar in relation and where is the line drawn and all that.

  That is an extreme case, but personally I'm more in favour of overly loose than overly strict criteria when it comes to classification of artistic products - a concept that is inherently fuzzy and hard to pin down exactly.
#+end_quote

Again it seems to be where we disagree, there are plenty of places to be fuzzy but there are very few places that are strict. I don't think I'm asking for much that someone who posts here should explain why it's relevant and for people to at least comment once and contribute in someway before posting their own content.
