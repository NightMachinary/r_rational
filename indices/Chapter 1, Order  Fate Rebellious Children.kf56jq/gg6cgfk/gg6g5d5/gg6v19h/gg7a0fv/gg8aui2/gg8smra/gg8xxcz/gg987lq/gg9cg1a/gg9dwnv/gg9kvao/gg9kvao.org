Useless is an exaggeration, and yes as a trend certainly correlated, but you can still see posts on [[/r/all]] with 500k upvotes and 50 comments. Upvotes are usually summarised as a comment that literally says "I like this", while downvotes while meant to be used otherwise mean "I didn't like this".

It's surprising to me that WtC isn't higher but again that's my point upvotes are useless. MoL while a fine enough story (I enjoyed reading it) is really not that great in terms of prose or characters. For the most part everyone spoke with the same voice and the most interesting part of it was the idea. Even the world building wasn't exactly incredible. I don't really know why it's done so well. Certainly if I have a handful of the top webfiction in isolation I would never think that MoL deserves the top spot, whether in popularity, patreon or upvotes. But then that's true of published works too.
