If that were happening, it would be a problem to worry about. However, that is not happening. It seems moot to worsen the experience that we currently have to avoid the risk of an experience that we do not. A cure should be taken when you have the corresponding disease; otherwise it will just hurt you without any point.

Obviously in general you'd hope and expect that people who post stories also participate in the community. But posting a story can be an entry point; someone lurked, read other people's stories, and then wrote their own and posted it. That may lead to them integrating more in the community. Overly strict gatekeeping might deter them from doing that. That degree of gatekeeping could be an acceptable evil if we were plagued by spam, but we're not, so for now it's likely perfectly good to keep operating as we are.
