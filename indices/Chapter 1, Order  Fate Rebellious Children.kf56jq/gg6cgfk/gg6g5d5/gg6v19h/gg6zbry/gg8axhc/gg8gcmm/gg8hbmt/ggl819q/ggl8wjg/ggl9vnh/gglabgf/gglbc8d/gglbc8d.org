A community gets to decide what content is appropriate for it. We have a pretty active moderation team and a pretty selective userbase. If both those groups have deemed this post OK, then maybe your dislike of it is a personal issue and not an existential threat to the quality of the sub.

By the way, you haven't given a single qualitative reason why this doesn't belong here. Your arguments have been entirely based around a reddit guideline that, as you mentioned, nobody really follows anyway.
