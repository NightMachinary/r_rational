  It originally means ten shared posts to one of your own content but even any comments showing that you're part of the community and understand the rules rather than spamming posts on whatever subreddit you can under a new account and then trying to explain yourself when called out would be somewhat considerate.

That's a little harsh. Besides, if this subreddit has a major problem, it's definitely not an /excess/ of new stories being posted here.
