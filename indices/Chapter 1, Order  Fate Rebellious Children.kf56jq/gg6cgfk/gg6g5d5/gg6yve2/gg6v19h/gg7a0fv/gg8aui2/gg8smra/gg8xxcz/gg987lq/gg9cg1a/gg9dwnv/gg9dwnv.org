  Upvotes are useless without comments. This post is a perfect example, people upvote it without reading and they do it before.

Is that so? Sure, an upvote is cheaper and can be given from the front page, but as a general rule, more upvotes generally do correlate with more comments and more interaction. It'd be an interesting thing by the way to see a historical series for most upvoted posts here on this subreddit... I suspect numbers would stay pretty low, but maybe we would get some insights.

EDIT: so if Reddit's "top" functionality really is an all time thing (I'm not 100% sure but I suppose so), then the first post is Mother of Learning's ending, with almost 600 upvotes, and lots of the remaining top spots are dominated by MoL. So basically nothing has risen up to the same level of prominence in over 10 months now.
