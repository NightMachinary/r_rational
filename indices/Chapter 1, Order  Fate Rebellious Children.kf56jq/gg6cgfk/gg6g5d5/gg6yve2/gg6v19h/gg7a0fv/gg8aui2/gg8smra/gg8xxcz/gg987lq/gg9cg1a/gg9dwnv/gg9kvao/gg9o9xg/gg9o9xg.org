  MoL while a fine enough story (I enjoyed reading it) is really not that great in terms of prose or characters.

I never said upvotes are a measure of literary quality (something that is not objectively measurable anyway), just of popularity at a given moment. There's a number of things that contribute to that; I'm sure many people here would prefer HPMOR to MoL, but maybe the community simply grew since then and that means the latter had a bigger basin of voters to draw from.

But if you have a problem with the average opinion of the member of this community, or think it does not align with yours, there's not much that can be done to fix that. It's simply how it is. My point was that if something receives a lot of upvotes, then it's very likely that if you asked everyone around here "hey, do you think this story is rational and belongs in this subreddit?", the majority would answer "yes", even if you wouldn't. The only alternative model would be to have some sort of committee of Rational Fiction Guardians whose opinion is used to vet which works are appropriately defined as "rational" even against the opinion of the unthinking masses if need be and, well... you see where this is going, and it gets especially ridiculous for such a small community as this one.

Remembers me of the endless diatribes about "what counts as anime?" on the anime subreddit. There was a huge argument then when a link to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0][the Shelter music video]], something animated by a Japanese studio, with Japanese voice acting, almost exclusively Japanese people in its credits, a distinctly anime aesthetic, and multiple anime stylistic and thematic quirks, was taken off the subreddit because the mods considered it "not anime" due to being commissioned and produced by a western artist. That is an extreme case, but personally I'm more in favour of overly loose than overly strict criteria when it comes to classification of artistic products - a concept that is inherently fuzzy and hard to pin down exactly.
