  However, I don't agree that we should wait for things to get bad before we address it.

We should, however, wait until things show signs of being getting bad before taking non-free measures to address them. Otherwise the only logical conclusion would be that we need to take an infinity of potentially contradictory measures to address an infinity of potential problems. Asking for restrictive anti-respiratory disease containment measures in March 2020 was sanity. Asking for them in August 2019 would have been absurd.

  If we, like thousands of subreddits before us, abandon all sort of community policing and just blindly upvotes decide what is allowed then as with all major subreddits the quality will deteriorate and the niche will be evaporated in favour of lowest common denominator.

We're a small subreddit largely under the radar of most people. In fact, interestingly enough, despite there being a significant group of people who find the rationalist community irritating or politically problematic (there was a post about this some days ago), we're surprisingly free of trolls or people spoiling for a fight. Discussions are most of the time reasonably polite and agreeable. I'm not saying that means we're invulnerable, but for now, things are pretty okay. In the face of that, putting up further barriers to entry does more harm than good, as it is more likely to deter the entrance of members who would enrich the community than to keep away supposed troublesome people that we do not have good evidence would show up anyway.

About the subreddit being flooded with self-promotion... I /do/ see your point in that OP seems indeed to have only posted about this story (in fact, they seem to have only /created their account/ for this purpose). Though the very fact that they know about this subreddit being a potential outlet for their story suggests they probably have had contact with some rational fiction works before. But also, how many stories show up for a first chapter, and then never again? There's very few regularly posted stories here overall. In this sense, upvotes aren't even such a bad guide, as long as they're used judiciously. Anyone who receives approval by the community meets the taste of the people who usually hang out here; anyone who doesn't will likely not even bother posting again. I get wanting the community to stay relatively focused on its own original purpose rather than drifting towards being a generic blob of fantasy and sci-fi fanfiction or webnovels, but do we really have any sign of such a drift being happening? That stuff usually is the consequence of a sudden influx of popularity causing large numbers of newcomers to dilute the core group into irrelevance, and this doesn't seem to be happening. It'll be a worry the hypothetical and highly improbable day someone makes a TV adaptation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, I suppose.
