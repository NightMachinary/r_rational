  This sub would be better off with more content, therefore enforcing a rule to limit content is counterproductive.

Rule 5 in no way limits content, however yet again I am more than happy to limit content from this subreddit. I do not want stories that are unsuitable here. I have no interest in people spamming every RoyalRoad story here just so we have more content.

It's a fundamental disagreement so I don't know what you wanted to add that's different from what the other guy said. I already said I'd agree to disagree on that.
