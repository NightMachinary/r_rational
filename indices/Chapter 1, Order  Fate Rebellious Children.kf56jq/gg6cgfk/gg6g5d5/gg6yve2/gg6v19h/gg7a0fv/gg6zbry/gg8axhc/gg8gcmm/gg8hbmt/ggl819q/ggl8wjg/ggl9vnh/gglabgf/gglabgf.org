  Clearly the lowest common denominator

Right, hence why I want gatekeeping.

The lowest common denominator is why most content is shit that's the whole reason we're in this subreddit because we don't enjoy (or want a place that's not about) the lowest common denominator media. If you want that go to any still open cinema, watch any TV show, go to any subreddit. The lowest common denominator is literally catered to everywhere else

  And [[/r/worldpolitics]] is explicitly an "anything goes" subreddit according to the sidebar, so using it as an example of a sub with non-aligned posts is nonsense.

Go look at worldpolitics 10 months ago. The mods said ok we'll let the lowest common denominator post what they want in this subreddit

That's what gatekeeping does, it changed [[/r/worldpolitics]] from you know being about world politics (with an enormous amount of USA politics) to what it is now. Probably an improvement
