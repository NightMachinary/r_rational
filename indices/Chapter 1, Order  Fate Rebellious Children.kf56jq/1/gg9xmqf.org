Since no one else is discussing the merits of the story itself...

Let's start with the good stuff. The premise of having to fight off the influence of a possessing spirit (or something) in a world with superpowers (or something) is a good one. It's remarkably free of technical and logical mistakes; as much of the plot and worldbuilding that has been revealed seems to be consistent and plausible within the rules of the world.

That said, I quit before reaching the most recent chapter. It just doesn't suit my tastes.

The first chapter almost lost me within three lines. Worldbuilding is one of my very favourite things in fiction, and this story seemed to be leaning entirely into the "Person says X, Person does Y" style of narrative, with almost no explanation. Speaking only on behalf of my own personal tastes, this was not a good way to make a strong first impression upon me.

Thankfully, after the first chapter (which appears to be a memory/dream?) the style shifts significantly for the better. However, there's still a dearth of setting information (I made it ~8 chapters in, and I still have very little idea about what an Imperium is, beyond being some kind of supernatural ability, or what is special about this SSS school to make the main character want to attend), and I still find the ratio of dialogue/action to character/setting/plot development to be weighted much too heavily to the former.

The main conflict for the first few (present-day) chapters is that the main character is late for her first day of school. The problem with this conflict is that it feels like there's no stakes, for several reasons. First, the consequences of being late aren't really considered by the main character, so we don't know what kind of trouble this could cause her. It's a vague, impending sense of doom. Second, the character adopts an attitude of, "Well, I'm already late, so it can't hurt to be a little later," which robs the decision to take the time to help someone else at the further expense of her punctuality of any tension. If she doesn't care that she's late, why should we? Third, after making the decision to help the person, there's no real suggestion about how it will impact the main conflict (yes, it will make her later, but *how much* later is never considered, nor what consequences being that much later will create). And finally, to put the cherry on top of the complete lack of stakes, when she finally finishes helping out and arrives at school, it turns out she was *never late in the first place.* School doesn't start until the afternoon of the first day.

I managed to make it a few chapters further in, when the main character has to make a choice between being late (which I've already been thoroughly immunized to as a source of tension at this point) and not being able to take the bag with her clothes to school --- I guess this is a boarding school? --- which is immediately shown to have no consequences whatsoever (uniforms will be provided, and the MC is apparently cool with wearing a uniform at all times), at which point, I gave up.

A story where the main character's choices don't have consequences just has zero appeal to me. Especially not when the other aspects of storytelling ---worldbuilding, history, backstory, themes, etc. --- are barely touched on.

If you don't like the first chapter, I strongly recommend at least proceeding to the second: it takes a remarkable shift for the better (in my opinion). After that, as far as I've read, what you see is what you get; if you enjoy the second chapter, you'll probably keep enjoying it, otherwise perhaps not.
