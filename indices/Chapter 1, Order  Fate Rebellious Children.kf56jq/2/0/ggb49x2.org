Thanks for the feedback! I know it's usually out of place, but Japan inspired the setting, so I felt it'd be authentic to mention manga. Is there a way that you feel I could've written it that would've hooked you better? The goal was to introduce you to Sumire's character before launching you into the events of the story, as understanding her background makes her future choices more understandable.
