Thanks for the feedback! It should be pretty evident through the storytelling, but I spent most of my efforts on internal conflict and character development. The real external conflicts are whats being established in the later chapters, which is what ties into the synopsis of the story. My thought process for setting it up this way was that the things that happen to the characters would mean more when you have an idea of what makes them tick & what their goals and motivations are.

As for the worldbuilding and setting, it's more of the same. Things are explained more as the series goes on, but I didn't want to info dump or put a bigger emphasis on the external makings of the world until their personalities were established to a basic degree.

Do you know any books that you like that handle the internal/external conflict better and more interestingly? I'd love to read them for reference as I continue writing. Thanks again for the feedback!
