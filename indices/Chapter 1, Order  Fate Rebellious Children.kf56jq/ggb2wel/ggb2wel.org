The dialogue in the first chapter kind of put me off.

I don't really know how to explain it, but it basically hit my uncanny valley of character dialogue, where I could tell there was a lot of thought put into narration and character motivations and stuff, but it felt /just/ off enough that I couldn't get into the story.

(also having characters talk about mangas or other bits of popular culture in the opening scene of a story is a big no-no for me)
