Well I think we've said our piece, I think we should implement good community rules from the get go, you think wait until it seems like it will be needed but:

#+begin_quote
  In this sense, upvotes aren't even such a bad guide, as long as they're used judiciously.
#+end_quote

Upvotes are useless without comments. This post is a perfect example, people upvote it without reading and they do it before.

#+begin_quote
  I do see your point in that OP seems indeed to have only posted about this story (in fact, they seem to have only created their account for this purpose).
#+end_quote

I checked this immediately that's why I even brought up the 9:1 rule
