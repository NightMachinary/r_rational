First off, this is a minor problem. I accept that. But this is not the first time, I've reported a dozen or so posts on this subreddit that have been removed by the mods. I didn't report this one for reference.

Secondly, it's completely possible that this subreddit will never suffer quality degradation.

However, I don't agree that we should wait for things to get bad before we address it. This subreddit is better when those who post here ARE part of the community, have read the major works (cultural tomes so to speak) and so have a strong understanding of the type of literature meant to be shared. Fomenting that attitude amongst the community will improve it.

If we, like thousands of subreddits before us, abandon all sort of community policing and just blindly upvotes decide what is allowed then as with all major subreddits the quality will deteriorate and the niche will be evaporated in favour of lowest common denominator. That is, if there is growth, which is not guaranteed, but you just need one highly upvoted [[/r/askreddit]] thread to double the numbers. You can already see that people, who even read this thread and are part of this community, fall prone to misuse of votes.

In addition, I would almost argue against self posts by authors in general as they have strong incentives to post to as many places at once with any post-hoc justification they can get away with. The account is only 22 hours old so whether or not they just googled "good places to share my fiction" or whether they were a member of the community is in doubt.

If works are shared by readers who have no relation to the author then not only do they lack any incentive to share they at least have been convinced by the work's merit that it's worth sharing.

I'm not especially interesting in posting being an entry point for this community, the entry point should be reading rational fiction. Even if they had just shared it in the recommendation thread, where there is no high standard, and someone else had posted it after reading it, then I think the average quality would be much higher for posts that grace our vaunted front page.

Taking all of that into consideration there is as of yet no one who has even read it who has commented, all we have is the author's word that it's a good fit and no ability to judge their character from their interaction with the community. This is the very reason the 9:1 guideline was designed and I stand by it in almost all cases.
