To share things on reddit you are meant to follow the 10 to 1 rule.

It originally means ten shared posts to one of your own content but even any comments showing that you're part of the community and understand the rules rather than spamming posts on whatever subreddit you can under a new account and then trying to explain yourself when called out would be somewhat considerate.

To the mods I say yet again evidence of why we should have a rule 5 equivalent on every post. Stick it on the submit page so that everyone posting can see that if they're posting content they should explain it

Edit:

  Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror --- you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.

Edit 2: Of course no one follows this stuff:

#+begin_quote
  Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

So outdated
