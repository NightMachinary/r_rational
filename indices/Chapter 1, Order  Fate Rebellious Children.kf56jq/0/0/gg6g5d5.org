I made the post a link because my account is new, so I couldn't do a full post. Sorry about that!

​

First, the story is a fantasy drama. The first arc, which I'm currently releasing, focuses primarily on the murder of one of the main characters' friends during her time at the college she's studying at, named the Soteria School for Seekers.

​

Second, I focused on character writing while making this, and something I wanted to be sure to do is make sure that every character develops and acts in a way that indicates their experiences. The main character Sumire, for example, spent the majority of her life with her brother, who did his best to act as a father figure to her. That being said, she also spent two years of her teenage years alone with the person in her head, or the narrator of the story, whose negative outlook also did a number on Sumire's mental health and previously upbeat persona. The constant back and forth between Sumire and the narrator makes up the internal conflict of her character arc, which I feel she deals with and suffers in rational ways. Beyond that, the story's worldbuilding and the actions of the characters, I feel, are also handled in ways that make sense within the story and aren't ham-fisted like other stories are.
