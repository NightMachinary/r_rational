This is not the original Charlie Bucket, but rather a candy-based clone, created by the Factory as a replacement. The original Charlie Bucket /may/ have been the one who committed suicide the moment he left the Factory (presumably because the Factory would have prevented suiciding within said Factory), or that may have been another candy clone.

With the Oompa Loompas out of the picture, the Factory is now in complete control of itself. It needs a replacement for Mr. Bucket, however (since the last one became suicidal); hence the tour
