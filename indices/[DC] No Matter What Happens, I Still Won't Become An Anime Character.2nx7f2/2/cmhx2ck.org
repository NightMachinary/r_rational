Just read introduction. Wouldn't the best strategy be to select a favorable genre as opposed to avoiding any genre? Action-Harem anime would guarantee multiple strong allies, at the expense normal relationships. You could go for magical realism and benefit from having an ordinary life except for random magic events. Just avoiding it seems like a bad plan.

Of course knowing sufficient velocity, I'll bet they tried something like I described... I'll read it later if I have time.
