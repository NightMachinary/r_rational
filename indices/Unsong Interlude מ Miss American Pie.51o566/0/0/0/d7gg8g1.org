Your theory is plausible, conditional on the Vital Name being the solution to the problem with the divine light. Perhaps the Vital Name could be used on the universe itself, making the divine machinery -- or the klipot, or something -- sentient and ensouled. I think that on prior evidence it is much more likely that the Most Holy Name is the solution to the problem, but there is a lot of circumstantial evidence for the Vital Name playing that role.

Aaron ending up in Brimstone Acres would be a huge downer ending (if it were an ending), and I don't /think/ Scott would do that to us.

  Aaron manages to single-handedly foil every plan intended to keep the ensouling Name from Thamiel

This is a very interesting point. UNSONG and Jane are both pursuing goals presumably aligned with those of the Comet King. Aaron foiling the Comet King's plans /inadvertently/ seems incredibly unlikely. For that matter, his discovery of the Vital Name was also incredibly unlikely. Influence by some external agent seems likely, even though there doesn't seem to be an obvious candidate -- perhaps God has stopped being strictly ontological and everything is going according to some overly complex divine plan?
