Looks like the apocalypse is imminent.

Chapter 1 began: "The apocalypse began in a cubicle". Somehow, the apocalypse began with Aaron's learning of the Vital Name. Also, we learnt in the last chapter it is no more than a few years until the divine machinery runs out of energy. That event is a very good candidate for the apocalypse. If the apocalypse is something else entirely then unless it is so thorough that there is no longer a drain on the divine energy, the divine machinery is still going to run out of energy and we will have both The Apocalypse and something sort-of-like-an-apocalypse-but-not-actually-the-apocalypse.

Aaron used the Vital Name once and was unable to get it to work a second time. The Vital Name is "a greater Name than any ever discovered". It is likely that the Vital Name was spoken at most twice -- for Adam and Eve -- until Aaron discovered it. This is consistent with the theory that Aaron's use of the Vital Name consumed enough divine energy that there was not enough remaining for it to be used a second time. In "Interlude ×“: N-Grammata" we learnt that the Tetragrammaton, being among the simplest of Names, continued to function for a period after Uriel moved the world to "a substrate of mathematics", so we have a precedent for depletion of the divine light causing only some Names to no longer function.

However, this explanation doesn't seem entirely consistent with the "apocalypse [beginning] in a cubicle" -- the apocalypse would still be inevitable and at most Aaron caused it to occur on a somewhat accelerated timetable.

Aaron does not know that the divine energy is running out and does not seem to consider -- or at least has no way to test -- whether only that particular Name was no longer working, however he considers several alternate hypotheses. In particular, that there was some sort of divine intervention and/or he simply forgot the Name.

It is exceedingly unlikely for a mnemonist such as Aaron to forget the Name without some external cause, his reaction suggests this would be almost entirely unprecedented. For an external cause -- divine intervention -- Uriel would be the obvious candidate. However, for Uriel to do this would be uncharacteristically subtle: "He'd smitten people who were using up too many system resources. Or who were trying to go into areas he hadn't finished simulating at the necessary level of fidelity. And of course people who were boiling goats in their mothers' milk. Or who were planning to boil goats in their mothers' milk. Or who looked like the sort of people who might do that." Uriel smiting Aaron for consuming too much of the divine energy is /exactly/ what I would expect from him, which obviously didn't happen. Perhaps Sohu's influence could have made him less disposed to killing unnecessarily, but Uriel simply causing Aaron to forget the Name seems very unlikely.

The lesser angels do not appear to have the agency to interfere in such a direct way. Thamiel does not appear to have a motive for stopping Aaron, and, like Uriel, simply causing Aaron to forget the name does not appear to be his style. Similarly, the Right Hand of God does not seem disposed to interfering in such a way, and Uriel's belief that "God's role [is] entirely ontological" would preclude God taking direct action.

  I tell you this story as an apology. So that when we get to the part in the next chapter where I had to decide between dooming the world and dooming Ana, you understand why it was such a tough choice.

"dooming the world" seems to refer to the apocalypse, but I cannot see how that would be consistent with the apocalypse being the exhaustion of divine energy. It is apparently inevitable, and in chapter 16 we learn that Uriel has considered the problem for "subjective aeons" and considers solving it "impossible". Aaron's quote implies a choice, that there was some way for him to forestall the end of the world -- presumably some source of divine light -- and that he had to choose between it and Ana.

Aaron is currently spatially separated from Ana by a considerable distance, so anything involving Ana probably involves their kabbalistic marriage.

"I tell you this story as an apology" seems to imply Aaron chose Ana over the world -- saving the world would be the obvious choice for most people who are not Aaron, and he is attempting to justify his decision. On the other hand, taken as a whole I think the entire statement is more consistent with Aaron having chosen to save the world -- he is apologising for even seriously considering choosing Ana over the world. Things do not look good for Ana, I fear.

I suspect we'll also be seing Sarah again soon, and there's a good chance she'll play a significant role in what's about to happen. Sarah's investment with the Divine Spark, like Adam and Eve, required the use of the Vital Name, but people reproduce just fine without the Vital Name. Sarah should be able to reproduce -- asexually or otherwise -- without needing enough divine energy to power the Vital Name. Also Sarah should now has a body, and probably worships Aaron as her creator, or something along those lines.
