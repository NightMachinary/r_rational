  Aaron foiling the Comet King's plans /inadvertently/ seems incredibly unlikely
#+end_quote

Aye, but there's the rub -- Aaron isn't foiling UNSONG and Jane by /accident/, but rather he's gone out of his way to make sure that Malia Ngo doesn't hear the Vital Name and that Jane can't use her seven dragons.

Well, we can say that it's someone who knows the Vital Name, and needs AST, a Kabbalist/Unitarian Universalist/Nerd/??? to find it. Maybe one of those lovecraftian entities Simeon hinted at a few updates ago?
