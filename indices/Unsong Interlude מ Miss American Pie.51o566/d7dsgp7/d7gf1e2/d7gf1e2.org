  "dooming the world" seems to refer to the apocalypse, but I cannot see how that would be consistent with the apocalypse being the exhaustion of divine energy.

I had posted the following possibility way back when we first learned of The Broadcast:

  For all we know the reveal at the end is that Uriel and Sohu figured out how to fix the divine light, all they needed was a Name that gave souls to inanimate objects, UNSONG was recruited to help find it, they built a hell-proof facility with security measures that create an ineffable sense of wrongness as an unfortunate byproduct, Jane and her seven dragons are a failsafe plan implemented by the Comet King, Aaron manages to single-handedly foil every plan intended to keep the ensouling Name from Thamiel, and he's writing Unsong in a villa in Brimstone Acres reserved for him as reward for ensuring Thamiel's ultimate victory.

So... here's a possibility: we know that the /Not A Metaphor/ was just serviced by the Drug Lord, who is (possibly) in league with The Other King. Maybe the Drug Lord tips off TOK, who sends his navy to corner and captures the ship, and learns of both Ana's knowledge of The Name via <Kabbalbabble> and of Aaron + Jane's location via SCABMOM and <more Kabbalbabble>. Then TOK's agents in Las Vegas capture Aaron and threaten to murder Ana unless he helps them recover The Name? And again, Aaron's failure to deliver The Name to Unsong and the Cometspawn prevents Uriel and Sohu from repairing the machinery of the universe.
