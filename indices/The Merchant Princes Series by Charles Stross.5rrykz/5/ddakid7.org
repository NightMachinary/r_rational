No they are not using their ability rationally. Rational use would be concentrate on research of physics of interdimentional travels. It worth many orders of magnitude more than any trade profit. There is another problem with most of Stross writing. He can start the plot but never able to develop or resolve it satisfactory. Just trying to put one existential horror on top of another, and they stop being scary very fast. All of his books I have read were exercise in annoyance how such an intriguing premise was completely botched. After several restart I just stopped reading him. The fact that his writing stile leave a lot to be desired was not helping too.
