The plot of Saturn's Children didn't seem to hang together, but then again many noir plots are a little nonsensical. The conceit of the novel is a good one, there are some great moments and turns of phrase, and the melancholic atmosphere is pretty perfect. Worth a read, if only for the description of trees as "dendriform photosynthetes."
