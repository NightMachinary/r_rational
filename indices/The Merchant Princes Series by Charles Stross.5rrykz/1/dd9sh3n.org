Note that until 2/7 you can get the omnibus version of the first two books FREE via the [[http://ebookclub.tor.com/][Tor ebook club]]. The omnibus version is my preferred version (also Stross's preferred version). I'm a fan of the series, mostly because of the thought put into social/political worldbuilding, as is typical for Stross.
