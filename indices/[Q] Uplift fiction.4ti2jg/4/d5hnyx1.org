A major theme of [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][With This Ring]] is uplifting DC Earth so that it can compete with other interstellar societies. It's a very slow burn, and the beginning few episodes don't indicate the quality of the whole, but overall it's very well done on a number of levels and I would recommend it without hesitation.

Much of the uplift is through getting various pieces of DC fiction to work together in order to improve technology everywhere. Mostly, this includes getting the super tech made by mad scientists to become widely understood and distributed, and in making magic available to everyone. As of the most recent update, this includes people working on making autonomous drones for controlling the weather on a large scale, special gates that are able to teleport you to their opposite gate regardless of distance, mass producing a superconducting wire for all kinds of uses, and advancing research in alchemy with a focus on human augmentation.
