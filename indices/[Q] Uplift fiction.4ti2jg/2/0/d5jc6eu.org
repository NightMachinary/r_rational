I second the recommendation, and yes Weber is very strong on his Author Tract how "soft" religion (no persecution of unbelievers, no messed up customs, etc.) is such a nice thing, while fanatical zealots are the evilest of evil (although I guess strictly speaking they do adhere to the rules on the sidebar, because they really believe in that shit). It sometimes reaches ridiculous levels, at one point in /Safehold/, I remember, some of the characters thought how nice it would be when after dismantling the false religion they'll re-introduce all the diversity of religions from the Old Earth. Although I must say that except for a few especially obnoxious episodes like that one, Weber is possibly the only author who managed to make his religious characters so nice that my militant atheist self finds them hard to dislike.
