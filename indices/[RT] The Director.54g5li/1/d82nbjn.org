Fascinating.

While Starwhisp was a complete story in its own right, this one felt like it left more questions than it answered as a sequel. It feels like there's a whole world built up out there, but I can't see enough of it to know what's actually happening. Hoping for more!

As an aside, on my mobile device, the PDFs are most easily handled if you remove the '?dl=0' from the URL.
