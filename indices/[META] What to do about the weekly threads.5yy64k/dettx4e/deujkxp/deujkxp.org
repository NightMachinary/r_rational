I think twice a month would be a great compromise for it. I've been using the thread, but I have to admit that half of the time I'm posting in it for the sake of posting in it, since I want to support the thread's existence. But the other half of the time I actually do have an important question I'd like other peoples' comments on. So I think bimonthly would be a great compromise (better than monthly IMO).
