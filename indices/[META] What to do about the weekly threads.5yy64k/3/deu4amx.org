Personally I don't know if writing skills works as a weekly thread. The others are sort of rational-fic-adjacent and a place to funnel various mostly-off-topic posts. "Writing skills" doesn't seem to fit the pattern of "rationality topics", "rational world building", "miscellaneous", "munchkin". I would just as soon eliminate it altogether.

As a tangent, I'm also not a huge fan of the munchkin thread being on Saturday. It has much the same utility as the Wednesday thread ("here's an idea, now tell me how it works/doesn't work"), and it cuts the off topic thread short from its pinned position. It only makes sense to me to have a place for idle chatter that's in place over much of the weekend, instead of just Friday. Moving Saturday Munchkin to Sunday is something I would propose (and was about to, before that slot was taken by this new thread).

(Full disclosure, I /do/ use that thread every week to announce/discuss progress on my game project, so I'm obviously biased in this regard.)
