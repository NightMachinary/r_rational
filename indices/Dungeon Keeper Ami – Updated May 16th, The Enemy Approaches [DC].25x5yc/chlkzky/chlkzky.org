Checking my [[http://page2rss.com/rss/0ff8bb3c441dc586101d6ed6c068feb8][RSS feed]], there was much undignified squeeing involved on my part. Pusakuronu hasn't updated forever.. I'll read through few of the last chapters though, to recap.

To the folks who are seeing this for the first time I introduce you to one of the best written Magical Girl story, recommended by the Yudkowsky. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DungeonKeeperAmi][The Tvtropes link]].

The author brilliantly fleshed out the Dungeon Keeper verse into an Epic, implementing the Sailor Moon crossover aspect seamlessly. And you won't need prior knowledge for either of the franchise -- the story progression will naturally fill you up on everything.

A note of warning though. Easily Worm-esque level door stopper. You will find weeks of your life suddenly and gloriously devoured.

Edit: [[http://addventure.bast-enterprises.de/224921.html][First Chapter]], only paths and branches written by Pusakuronu are canon.
