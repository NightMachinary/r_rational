My library didn't have that book :\

If there is scummy social engineering in the tip bot, then I think it's just inherited. I'm pretty sure the bot's just a clone of the bitcoin tipbot that's been around since forever.

I see dogecoin's value proposition more as "The other currencies are too serious and bloodthirsty. Let's make something silly and jokey that we can throw around like the crazy internet points they are." It's something to have fun with and not take too seriously.

Or maybe more idealistically, even if I'm wrong about that and dogecoin was made as a scam, I think it's evolved beyond that. With the community that it's fostered and the crazy things they do, it's become more than just its numbers and its memes.

And what makes skinner box techniques etc an invalid tool, anyway? If you can use them to make something positive, then you should do so.

Ugh, and now I'm caught between the urge to continue this interesting debate, and the knowledge that it's /waaay/ off-topic for this subreddit and thread.
