I think Hierophant is an old and uncommon name. I believe his parents would have been considerably more interested if it were brand new, and more knowledgeable about how tough it would be to keep him prisoner if it were recently used/known.

Adjutant on the other hand seems unknown. Everyone was blown away that he had a name and based on my understanding of his culture in aeons past, it doesnt seem to be a Name they would have had. If I recall correctly, Warlock mentioned that he wanted to study Adjutant as well.

Since Cat breaks stories and narratives like she does, it makes sense to me that Names would be weird around her. Old/New ones appearing and existing names sometimes reacting oddly.

I wonder if reality itself is demanding change. All this stratified good/evil looks like it is heading for Arcadia's fate...stagnation. With reality being the "dynamic" part of the universe, Cat might be a result. Ripping up the things that are too unable to change. Not even Winter, with all it's power, froze her entirely and her influence has clearly affected Akua as well.
