Did we ever find out what Cat asked Akua to do at the end of Chapter 72?

  “I need you to do something for me,” I said.

  She turned to face me completely. In Masego that would have been a notice I had his full attention, but with her I always had that. Even when she pretended otherwise.

  “I had role given in the battle to come,” Akua said.

  “I know,” I said. “But this is more important.”

  “And what exactly do you need of me, dearest?” she asked.

  There were a lot of ways I could have answered her. Some true, others euphemisms or a hundred different shades of flippant. It'd helped me over the years, the quips. Allowed me to make it a joke or a game, anything but a reality so often ugly. But if I was to let the monster off her leash, then she should be given her due.

  “Folly,” I said.

  Akua Sahelian smiled, and in that smile lay the promise of things great and terrible to behold.
