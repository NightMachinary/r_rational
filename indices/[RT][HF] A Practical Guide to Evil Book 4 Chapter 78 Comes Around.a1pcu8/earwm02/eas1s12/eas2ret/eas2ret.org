*points at all of Cat's shenanigans...Godslayer

I thought a Name is a kind of groove worn in reality? I agree that neither direction is likely to support a name like that, but Cat seems to be wearing grooves into reality left and right.

I am honestly surprised we haven't seen more new Names popping up around her just because of the way she messes with reality.
