Love this!

The idea of Akua loving and trying to be better is a fascinating idea and shows that Akua might still be trapped in the stories that Cat cuts through with gusto.

Too bad, it's a great dream. I suspect she is pushing Cat to win so Akua can usurp the mantle that she now has a stronger attachment to.

The option I think would be the most fun is for cat to walk out of here with her new Name finally solidified and two new aspects, Night and Winter, that are less continent-breaking and suitably confusing for her foes. Or even just finally gaining a full Name. Godslayer is starting to seem appropriate.

I think the other sister taking over Night/Winter as a new goddess is better than Sve doing so, but it feels waaay too narratively easy. Like Cat shreds the story to victory, but somehow the "obviously" dark sister who seems nice ends up in power? I think those excited about this idea already forgot the lesson we just learned (again)...our amazing writer is sneaky and tricksy like the hobbitses!

I am filled with tension over these last few chapters. I dearly love Cat and seeing her soul ripped out, ripped open, and then devoured while she watched has me emotional ðŸ˜­
