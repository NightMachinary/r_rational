The Ubua heroic turn is even better then I thought it might be. And, concurrently with that, its a FANTASTIC story. Evil villain that doesn't really believe in good but follows the praxis of it to see if it works, snarking the whole way? I know that the names are grooves worn in creation but I feel like in a world that runs on metaphor, novel arcs have to give you a little more metaphysical juice. So excited to see where this goes.
