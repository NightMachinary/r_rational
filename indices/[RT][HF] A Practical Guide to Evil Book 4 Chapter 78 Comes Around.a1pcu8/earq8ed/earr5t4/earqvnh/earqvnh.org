Oh shit... we were sent in an entirely wrong direction about the plot!

How could I forget, EE is the master of hiding important things in plain sight all the while redirecting us elsewhere.

All this time we argued about whether Winter would Devour the night or the other way around, but Catherine doesn't work like that! Either way is /bad/ because it's playing /into/ the narrative, /into/ the story.

Cat breaks stories!

And so, we come upon the foreshadowing set up that the sisters are two beings in one body? soul? anyway, there's two of them. And Catherine's now found, perhaps, the "good" sister of the two!

Catherine wants to be mortal again, but she doesn't want to lose all the powers and ties that come with being the Sovereign of Moonless nights. Some of us thought that *Akua* of all people was going to inherit the mantle (seriously?). But now we have another option! Talk with Antonike, find out what she wants, and help her take control of the night. I assume because of her background as a sage, she will have a better time controlling the alienation.

Her request is likely going to be the salvation of her people, which Cat can definitely help with. And so the /real/ sixth ranger enters the Woe, reducing Akua's role, maybe enough that she can try for her redemption and subsequent destruction.
