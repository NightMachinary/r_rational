Names like Adjutant and Captain aren't out of nowhere. They do have roles in everyday life that serve as grooves for them. It makes sense that they would pop out, even if they may be rare.

Something like Astronaut would't be a Name considering there is no idea or concept of such a role in the Guideverse. (That we know of atleast)
