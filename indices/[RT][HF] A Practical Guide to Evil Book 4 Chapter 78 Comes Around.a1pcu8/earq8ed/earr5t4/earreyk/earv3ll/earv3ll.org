Hey, Contrition, this is your area, right?

"Uh... no, no we've got other plans. Secret plans! We can't tell you, they're secret. But important. Very important!"

Ok. Judgement?

"We already have one. We only ever have one at a time."

Endurance?

"She's a mage. We don't take mages. We prefer our heroes to be humble peasant boys with swords who don't ask too many questions."

Mercy? She's got the whole 'sacrifices for the greater good thing' already, and you wouldn't have to teach her healing.

"She isn't nice enough. She wouldn't be able to fake being a kind girl who wants everyone to get along. Everyone would see the ruthless fixer beneath the surface. We prefer our heroes to look sad when they massacre a bunch of civilians."

Alright...Compassion?

"Hah. Hah hah hah hah hah. Oh. You were serious. Hehhehheh. No."
