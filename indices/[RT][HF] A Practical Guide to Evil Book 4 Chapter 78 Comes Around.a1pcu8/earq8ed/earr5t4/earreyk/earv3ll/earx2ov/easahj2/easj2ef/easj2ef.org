If the Gods Above are based on Christianity (which it seems to be), the common perception of the Christian afterlife is based on Dante, who borrowed heavily from Classical Mythology...

I guess what I'm trying to say here is that there may be a Choir of Fitting/Ironic Punishment (Retribution?). And I think that Akua serving that Choir would both suit her situation (enslaved to rebuild the country she almost destroyed) as well as her temperament.
