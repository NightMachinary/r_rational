We are getting into the details. Some infectious tracking spell on their souls. I do like the two new characters too. A badass priest and a monstrous transformer.

The magic is quite fun too. I like the ideas of how it works, of there being some cost for whatever effect that can be reduced by changing it's properties. It's a much more detailed and rational magic system.

Also, I've finished the basic system of my MOL roleplay game. It is actually theoretically playable now. It also has lots of character and place names in it for reference.

While without internet I did lots of work on it.
