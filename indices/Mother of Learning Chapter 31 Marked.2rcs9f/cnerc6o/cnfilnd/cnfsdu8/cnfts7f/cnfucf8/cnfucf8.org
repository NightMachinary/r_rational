I likewise would be happy to support a patreon for MoL.

I suppose that's possible. I don't really know how the author feels about writing. Do they enjoy it, dread it? Ideally I'd hope they enjoy it, and money would just be for their personal enjoyment or life issues. Regardless, with patreon it's a constant reward so hopefully any instrinsic+extrinsic reward total won't be substantially reduced.
