Read everything in one shot up to Chapter 30 and enjoyed it immensely. Mother of Learning is better than a lot of published fantasy out there in terms of consistent, interesting world building, character development and just plain meticulous planning (e.g. all that building up to the Sister Effect was simply glorious, literary orgasm). Anyways, it's almost criminally underappreciated on online forums where people are aware of it.

To the author, nobody103, who's known to lurk here (ღ˘⌣˘ღ):

Have you considered publishing it?

I understand it may be for your own creative enjoyment as an author and avid reader/player of fantasy books/games, but it's such a beautiful, well-cultivated story and it would be a shame to see such a hidden gem stay obscure.

Regarding publishing, I'm not sure how Mother of Learning fits into any niche, since it reads a lot like a Japanese light novel with the casual narration, but there isn't much of a market outside Japan for those. However, even though light novel writing is often lacking, they have quite a cult following. Maybe this is the work to propel such a medium into popularity for Western fantasy lovers?!

In short, regardless of whether you have publishing aspirations, just want to say I love your work. Thank you so much for spinning and sharing your imaginative tale!
