I'm not sure about the implications of Patreon funding. Does it limit opportunities to later publish the work? e.g. exclusively under Patreon.

Patreon sounds like a service for artists who need to support themselves financially to continue their work. nobody103 sounds like he's doing it for fun in his free time. It might also downplay the quality of Mother of Learning by shooting for incremental earnings when there is a large market out there for the fantasy genre.

Overall, I don't know enough about Patreon and its advantages/disadvantages, but I'd definitely support the work!
