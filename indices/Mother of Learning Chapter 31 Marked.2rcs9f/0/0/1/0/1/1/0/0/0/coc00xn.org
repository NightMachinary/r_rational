No, thank /you/. A few days ago, when I was setting up my account, I had several people tell me that paying anything for a story they can read for free is stupid, and that I'm stupid for trying it. Thanks to you and the other 5 people who donated, I can feel smug at their failed predictions of doom and gloom.
