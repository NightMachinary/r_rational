You need a visa card, mastercard, american express card (not american press start for students), diner's club card or a few card other types i doubt you have access to like a Japanese JCB card, a mostly USA Discover card, or paypal. Then you can link your visa to patreon and it should pay straight to your whatever bank account.

Basically, get a multinational American card to do the work for you.
