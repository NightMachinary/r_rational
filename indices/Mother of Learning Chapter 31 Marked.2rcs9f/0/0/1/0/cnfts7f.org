I would support a Patreon for Mother of Learning: $2.50/chapter?

This is assuming that a monetary incentive doesn't make the story take longer and the chapters don't go down in quality or length. Adding extrinsic motivation sometimes reduces intrinsic motivation and may reduce your creativity and pleasure in writing, so you'd have to let us know if you would appreciate this.
