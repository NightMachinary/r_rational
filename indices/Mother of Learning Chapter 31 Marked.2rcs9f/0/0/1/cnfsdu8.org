Wildbow, an independent author who I obsessively follow the works of and support financially, noted the sort of things he saw as valuable for whether a work would have a good return. Being at the top of some site, a regular patreon audience, having a large mailing list.

Those sort of things which are fairly low maintenance timewise do build up over time, are worth thinking about. If you have them passively working through the three arcs you'll be better able to make a choice at the end. If there are 500 people on your mailing list who will buy anything you put out that makes selling stories a lot easier and more likely to be worth time and nerves. If you have 2, probably not.
