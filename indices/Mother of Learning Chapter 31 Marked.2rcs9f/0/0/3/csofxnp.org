Man, it's so awesome to be able to directly communicate with the book's author themselves!

Your story and your writing style are delightfully good --- especially your descriptions of the aranea, their body language and gesticulations.

I've also marked some ~150 typos and minor error throughout the text, and if you want, I can send them to you through fictionpress.
