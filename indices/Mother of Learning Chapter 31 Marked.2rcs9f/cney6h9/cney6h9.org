I think Zorian now has a method to "invite" other people into the loop. If I understand correctly, all he needs to do is implant the target with a tiny fragment of his soul, the marker will spread and mark the person for the hypothetical looping spell.

Although, having a magical marker of unknown origin and unclear purpose infect your soul may raise some objections.
