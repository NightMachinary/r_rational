Think this thread is far enough down for people not to notice? Tutor me on economics. I must be doing something wrong. I've been a subscriber to the voluntaryist / ancap / agorist viewpoint for a few years now, and genuinely think it's the best we could come up with in a scarcity environment. What am I doing wrong? Or better yet: Why /shouldn't/ I be libertarian?

(Though for the record I better think of myself as "Up", but that's yet to be a "thing".)
