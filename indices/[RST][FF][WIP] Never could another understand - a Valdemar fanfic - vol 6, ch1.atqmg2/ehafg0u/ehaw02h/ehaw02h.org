I've gotten mixed responses on the slow divergence (some dislike from rationalists who've read canon, which is a pretty small subset of people), but I liked writing it that way! I loved Vanyel's character in canon and tried to write him pretty close to the original, though apparently I've ended up with enough differences that re-reading Magic's Promise for reference on book 5 was one of the most deeply uncanny-valley experiences I've ever had.
