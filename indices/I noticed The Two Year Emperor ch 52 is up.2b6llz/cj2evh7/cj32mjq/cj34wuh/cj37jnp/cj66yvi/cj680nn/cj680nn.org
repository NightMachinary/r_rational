Jake /is/ on the side of everyone being immortal. He wanted to surrender to the Deorsi as soon as he knew that they had effective immortality. He only reason he didn't is because of the Archmagi's mind whammy.

Right now, though, he's just on the side of "not dying."

As to Loki, there will be more information coming up in the next few chapters. I've finally gotten to a point where I can start getting into the whole "gods and why they do stuff" plot. It's taken a long time, but I'm glad to finally be here.
