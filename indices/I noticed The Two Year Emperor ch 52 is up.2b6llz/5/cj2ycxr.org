Any ideas yet on color-coding sacrifices?

Class-based? Personal secrets, strategic secrets, other people's secrets? Shameful, useful, nostalgic? Something having to do with affinity of various pieces of knowledge to various gods, alignments, races? Something to do with potential consequences of this knowledge being used?

That last one fits neatly with magnitudes of flashes, but then we've seen so little that nearly everything would fit.
