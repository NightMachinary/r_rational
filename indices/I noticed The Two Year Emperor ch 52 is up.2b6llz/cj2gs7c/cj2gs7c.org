A little bit ago I posted an announcement item myself, not noticing this one; I have now deleted it. In that thread, Zephyr1011 asked "Afi knows where they are and has reason to destroy Grofhamr. Why hasn't he interrupted the ritual?"

The answer is in this chapter, although I don't expect anyone to spot it -- the various pieces of it are fairly well buried. Suffice to say: there is a reason, and it's in character for him.
