Thank you for this knowledge.

Based on that, supposing that thing that said "I'm Afi" was something magical like a Simulacrum, if it sacrificed knowledge or secrets any effect would be restricted to it's personal ice magic brain?

If so, that would be an interesting exploit for future reference. Suppose a few dozen wizards had created Simulacrums of our hero. He could have perhaps made a goddess mostly in his own image with his personality and a lot of munchkin tricks.
