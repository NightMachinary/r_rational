You're both right, actually.

When you sacrifice knowledge (i.e., information that is generally available) or secrets (information known only to you, or only to a very few, all of whom /think of it/ as secret) to Herrún, that information is erased from your personal brain. You cannot get that information back by any means short of divine intervention (by Herrún herself, or by another god). If someone tells it to you, you can't understand the words. If someone writes it down, you can't read it. etc.

On the other hand, your sacrifice doesn't change the state of the world aside from you -- it doesn't take the knowledge from anyone or anything else and, if your secret was something like "I'm pregnant", then the baby doesn't just disappear. You won't be able to understand why you suddenly look fat, or why you are experiencing waves of pain, but you will still have the baby. You will be able to remember that the baby is yours, but you will be sure that you were never pregnant, and will even pass magical truth detection. When presented with the contradiction, you simply won't understand the problem.

And yes, if the thing that walked into the room and said "I'm Afi" were to try to sacrifice to Herrún, his (its?) secrets would still power her up.
