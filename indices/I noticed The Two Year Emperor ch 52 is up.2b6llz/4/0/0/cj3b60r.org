  "The Stupi...this world's universe is, presumably, as large as my own---nigh infinite, for practical purposes. There're also other realities parallel to this one, mine being one of them, but they're all variations on the Prime Material Planes and most likely not other planes per se. Assuming this is something like the Copenhagen Model, the number of these realities is probably either infinite or so large that it might as well be infinite."

  "I'd talk to an artist," I told her. "Describe a made-up imaginary world for him, have him draw it. Somewhere in the multiverse, that world almost certainly exists. With the picture, you can use Greater Scrying to locate that world. Use Greater Teleport to send a mage there---with proper protections against the environment, of course---so she can scout it and make sure it's safe. Once we know that it is, use GrÇ«fhamr to transport the surviving Deorsi there.

  "Once everyone was safely there, send one mage back here to blow the place up," I finished. Immediately, I got worried that she'd be offended by the idea of me using a suicide bomber, so I hurred to correct that impression. "She could Shapechange into a ghost or some other incorporeal so as to be immune to the blast, and then Greater Teleport to us once the world was gone."

Assuming there actually are sufficient worlds for a "made-up imaginary world" to have a reasonable chance of existing, it seems like one of the following must be true:

1. The undead can reach such worlds themselves, in which case the destruction of this world will prevent the conquering of other worlds. Given the number of world is "nigh infinite", that's a nigh-infinite number of lives he saved.

2. The undead cannot reach such worlds themselves. That's weirder, but in that case, simply retreating to such a world would be enough to evacuate the common people of Deorsi. If he doesn't want to blow up this world, that's fine. It's a little strange to me, given that they're doomed anyway, but it's his (moral) choice.

Either of these making sacrificing the whole plan a little weird.

One possible explanation is that the undead wouldn't normally come up with the idea, but they might scry and follow, or they might read his mind and take the plan. In the first case it isn't a good idea to flee, in the second it's a good idea to get rid of the knowledge. I'm not quite sure how this balances out.

EDIT: Hm, and is it me, or was there so far no confirmation the world is a ball of rock floating through space? I wouldn't be surprised if this ended with another "you believe in evolution?" moment...
