If the undead are unable to spread to other worlds in the multiverse, it isn't quite clear why he doesn't just use the Greater Teleport part of the plan. On the other hand, if the undead /can/ spread and once this world falls the rest of the multiverse will follow, the cost of not destroying them is so great that the whole remaining population of this world is nothing.

I can see some argument like "we don't want to lure them out", but it seems strange that they don't know about these things already. (By the way, why would they need Polymorph machines if they have an effectively infinite number of worlds? With the size of the armies they have, raiding those shouldn't be too hard.)
