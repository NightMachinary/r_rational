It wasn't stated in story, but what Jake wrote on the paper was:

"I could use a drawing of an imaginary location with Scry Location to find a human-habitable world -- somewhere in the nigh-infinite multiverse, that scene must exist. I could transport all the Grǫfhamrites there using Greater Teleport, then have a mage use Polymorph Any Object to create a few trillion tons of antimatter here on Earth; that would destroy the entire planet, including the liches."

As such, he's forgotten:

- That any imagined scene will exist somewhere, given a nigh-infinite multiverse.
- That he could use Scry Location to find an imagined scene. (He still remembers that the spell exists and can be used to find something that's known.)
- That Grǫfhamr could be moved to a different planet.
- That Polymorph Any Object could create enough antimatter to blow up the planet. (He still remembers that antimatter exists and can make big explosions.)
