The one about Loki? It was important enough that he could use it to blackmail a god; whether "eight honest answers" was the best use of that blackmail is uncertain. Jake isn't great about thinking things through, and it was the first thing he thought of that seemed to have strategic importance. If he was able to tell Albrecht about it, Albrecht would probably tear his hair out and beating him with a rolled up newspaper. Once Thomas found out the details, he would probably let Albrecht do it.
