- Assumption 1 'the one true god' is part of the faction starting the undead cycle

- Assumption 2 Loki know the side of life is threatened by the treat to tell the landguard and thus the 'the one true god'

- AssUMe 3 /weak/ Our Hero: Jake has not deduced Assumption 1

I'm still confused why Loki caved: *A:* either he did it to prevent our hero from shooting life's faction in the foot, *B:* he did it so he can play his genially evil role while helping the life faction, or *C* some other reason, but I'm leaning towards answer *D:* both A and B.

[edit] P.S. Why is Jake not on the side of defeating death through immortal undeath?
