I meant more that she likely wouldn't abide someone sidestepping the rule that you lose the secret you sacrifice. The secret is supposed to be lost to the /world/, not just to you. I doubt a secret "sacrificed" by such a minion would provide any power if it wasn't truly lost, and even if it did, I expect her to avenge the breaking of her own rule. Loki would give a pass to someone breaking his rules because he's the /god of rulebreaking/. I see Herr√∫n punishing abusers of such a loophole even just on principle, and /even if the loophole provided her a net benefit/, because that's what gods do.
