I actually laughed out loud at that last line.

Also, as someone with actual legal training holy /crap/ would none of that shit fly if it was brought up in court!

There are very, /very/ strict rules, especially in Canadian business law about directors and other controlling minds of a company making decisions in their own interest, and conflicts with holding positions in many related companies. There are time limits and voting requirements before selling off major assets, notification requirements to all of the shareholders before any mergers or full acquisitions can be done (with up to 6 month lead times) and a whole bunch of other crap.

This is the kind of case a business lawyer would jump on. It's /incredibly/ hard to get a judge to pierce the corporate veil and hold people directly accountable, but this is just a gift-wrapped negligent misappropriation case waiting to happen.

Admittedly, that is mostly post 1980 development, and might have been different in a world with superhumans, but modern technology without significant restrictions in at least a close vein would lead to a collapsed economy so fast I'm not sure even the work of pre-cogs could stop it.
