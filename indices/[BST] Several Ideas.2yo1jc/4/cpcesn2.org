  Dune Dune is ripe with possibility. The Bene Gesserit mind training could be replaced with CFAR-like techniques. The mentats, too, although I am imagining a somewhat different sort of training for the. Dune is littered with actual precognition. I'm imagining this being replaced with predictive skill, both by trained humans and by superhuman. I would like the mentats to secretly be "cheating" by coordinating their predictions without communication between them. In other words, mentats make surprisingly good predictions in part because they advise the nobility and they can predict what others with mentat training will advise. They understand advanced decision theory similar to TDT.

Ok, personal opinion and info-dump time.

"TDT doesn't reals." This is why Eliezer had such a damned hard time trying to naturalize it, and why it was scrapped in favor of UDT. Even UDT, I think, will have to be scrapped in favor of something that accounts better for logical/computational uncertainty and limited information. /However/, TDT and UDT work very well in a setting like that of /Dune/, where precognition, and therefore "timelessness", is /actually a thing/ -- FTL/wormhole-y information transmission /actually works/.

Another thing is that /Dune/ started off with a genuinely passable notion of uncertainty /about/ prescient vision. I think you should keep this: do something like /Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy/ and treat probability as a /dimension/ in its log-odds form, with the "origin" point being 50/50 odds (maximum uncertainty) and increasingly "real" and "unreal" universes/timelines extending out towards the positive and negative infinities. This then allows you to treat predictive probability theory as an /actual theory of prescience/, with both stochastic and computational information-gain allowing you to further and further constrain the region you're in on the Possibility/Probability of Timelines axis of the Whole Sort of General Mish-Mash.

Of course, /Dune/ is also full of all kinds of sociological fucked-upness and scheming bastardry, which doesn't appeal to me personally now that I notice it, but rationalizing how and why it all /lasts/, despite not usually working in real life, could be great fun for you.
