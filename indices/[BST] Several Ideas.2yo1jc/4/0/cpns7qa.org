I'm rather well aware of TDT and UDT and why they don't quite work as written and what MIRI has done so far to fix it, but I didn't expect to be called out on it here. :)

I don't know exactly how deep I'd want to go into it in the story, either. It seems worth going as deep as Hofstadter's concept of super-rational, explaining about cooperating on Prisoner's Dilemma and such things. Further than that is likely to lose a lot of readers.
