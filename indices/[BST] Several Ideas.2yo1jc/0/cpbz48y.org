The Dune one seems really interesting. Acausal agreements between mentats would be an excellent way to enforce the prohibition on thinking machines.

What role, if any, would melange play in this setting? Prescience, extended life, and metamorphosis into a freaky fish guy seem like an odd suite of effects, but maybe they all have a common cause. Melange could cause cells to dedifferentiate, creating a greater pool of adult stem cells and increased cell proliferation (somehow without causing cancer in the process - hence its value). Take a little, and you reverse the aging process.

Take more, and the proliferation of new neuronal stem cells leads to dramatically increased brain plasticity. Your brain's pattern recognition improves, but on a pre-conscious level. The result is intuitive predictions that are often uncannily accurate, but can't be verified through others' reasoning. (This isn't to say that there's a hokey conflict between reason and intuition here. Experienced melange users learn to attach confidence intervals to their strange visions, and to make sure to consciously frame problems in such a way that their [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems][Type 1 thinking]] doesn't fall prey to cognitive biases.)

Take even more melange, for a long enough period, and so much new cellular proliferation occurs that you barely even look like a human being -- or think like one. Your brain begins to resemble a powerful but untrained neural network. Trained in isolation, in an environment consisting entirely of astrophysical data and Holtzman Effect equations, you will develop an intuitive aptitude for plotting a course through foldspace.
