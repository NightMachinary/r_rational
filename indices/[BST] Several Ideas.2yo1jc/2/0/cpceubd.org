I feel that if Dr. Manhattan was a very high level rationalist before his change, the kinds of changes we talk about here might, /might/, be possible, maybe. But his freedom to take action is constantly in question. He himself believes in predestination from the beginning.

Very broadly speaking, with his stream of consciousness being essentially stretched over countless simultaneous moments in time, there is no possible way he could be the omnipotent figure he's often expected to be, at least at first. Decent summary from wikia:

"Jon is not omniscient; he remains reliant on his intellect and sensory experience to reach conclusions, but his range of sensory data has been abruptly extended, "

By the time he realizes the reach of his control, and decides to take action for the sake of someone else, regardless of his own feelings towards predestination, he has already both observed and experienced many of the results of his own actions and inactions. We are given no strict bounds for his experience, it is possible he is rippling this throughout all time even, and not just his own semi-local experience we observe. But even bound only to his own local timeline, his actions up to this point in his "life" become a singularity, as he is bound by his own observations of their results. Everything to him, is in the present. He is in the past, but he is also in the now.

People thinking Dr. Manhattan stupid or ineffectual don't properly process the quantum nature his mental state is said to be in after the incident. He is moving forward, in his own perception of "time", but that is simultaneous and disconnected from ours. Imagine each of your eyes seeing a different image, but you still must command your body to walk in each of these places you see.

Were he to start incredibly rational, perhaps he may have been able to take some extreme actions earlier once comprehending his new nature. This still would require "time". However he wasn't stupid, he was simply content with his existing view of predestination and his new feeling of disconnection from the human race only amplifying that. He saw his own relationship's end coming, and could not avoid it, because he didn't know how because he cannot relate to specific moments the same way any longer. However the same bounds of cognition would apply to even a skilled rationalist, and we have no idea how long even a rational mind would take to comprehend it's new nature of being. So the entire events of Watchmen could very well have unfolded just the same, only with more experimental physics on Mars perhaps. Or perhaps unconstrained by time and equally divorced from humanity, a rationalist could end the universe for the much much "greater good" we could not perceive.
