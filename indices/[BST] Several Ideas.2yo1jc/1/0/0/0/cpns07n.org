Yes, somewhat, but I think they still aren't up to a high enough standard of rational characters. Too much is done for the sake of the plot. It's even lampshaded - when we first meet the Baron Harkonnen, he goes about ineffectively rationalizing his dastardly plot while denying his true motivations. I think a bit of Bwahaha Teh Evuls are being used as an effective distraction to make the reader not think about it too much.
