I still don't know whether this is actually going to happen, but I have been thinking about it and making notes (especially extensive notes of source material to draw on for rationality techniques). I'm quite excited about it and I do think it might turn awesome (but, moderated by my writing ability).

It's possible that Paul himself is a proponent of scientific method, or philosophy, or some other branch which is neglected by the other schools. LessWrong uses the scientific method as a foil to contrast Bayesian rationality against, so the picture of science which gets painted ends up not entirely positive for that reason. HPMOR does less of this, I think, and science / scientific method are well-championed there (thoroughly, I'd say).

It's clear that Paul is special in his mixing Bene Gesserit and Mentat ways. I have some ideas for childhood scenes illustrating the ideological conflicts between the two schools and how he deals with it. What I need to be able to explain is why Paul is unique. There must be strong forces against the two schools mixing, perhaps based partly on gender, and ideological differences.

I have not yet had good ideas about the Harkonnen.
