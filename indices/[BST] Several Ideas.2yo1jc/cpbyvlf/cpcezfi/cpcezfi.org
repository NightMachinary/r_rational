Confession: /I am only just now reading Dune,/ although I know a lot about it from years of not avoiding spoilers. I'm presently excited about it since I'm reading it, but, I don't actually know all the details.

Yea, that link is the kind of thing I'm looking for. Because a large part of rationalist-fic is characters knowing and applying specific techniques, I'm sort of compiling different "camps" of mental/behavioral training or philosophy about people's behavior. So far:

- Lesswrong/CFAR style rationality
- Robin Hanson (everything is signaling!)
- Memory Sport (memory techniques and training)
- Mentalism (this is about cold reading and misdirection)
- Neurolinguistic Programming
- Nonviolent Communication
- Behaviorism (everything is about conditioning behavior!)
- Econ (everything is about incentive structure!)

Some of these are questionable as schools of thought, but regardless, provide frameworks which specific characters or groups might see the world through - and generally, have techniques which those characters/groups could train in and apply in situations.

This will allow me to have Bene Gesserit and Mentat mental training be highly distinct. Bene Gesserit would include more of the mentalism type skills, to fit with the witch image (this replaces The Voice) and discuss actual methods of cold reading. They would also have something resembling the CFAR skillset of dialog between system 1 and system 2, which would be associated with their predictive skill. Mentats would focus more on memory, mental math, and (lesswrong-style) formal rationality.

  How far from the original plot are you thinking? Would you be following Paul Atreides? How would he have become a rationalist?

I think it's somewhat about Paul combining different camps, rather than being really uniquely rationalist (being trained as both a mentat and a Bene Gesserit, despite prohibitions). I think House Harkonnen needs a large redesign, being not well-suited for a rationalfic, and therefore things wouldn't be too close to the original plot.
