I generally like this story, but I'd advise people to wait until it's finished if you haven't picked it up yet.

The story just has some nice worldbuilding and characters, but it's 640k words long and the pacing is off. It feels like the story was 50% written at 600k, then realized that it had to finish the other 50% by 700k.

It's still a recommend for me, but there's a probably high chance of it going off the rails.
