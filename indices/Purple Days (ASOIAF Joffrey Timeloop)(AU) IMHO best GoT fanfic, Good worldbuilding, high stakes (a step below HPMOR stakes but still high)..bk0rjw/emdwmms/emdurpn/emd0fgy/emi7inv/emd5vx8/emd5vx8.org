I'm the middle of it. The loop mechanics and protag's actions aren't really too rational so I wouldn't put it in the category. In fact he does your typical fantasy protagonist inefficient happenstance road to coincidental victory thing quite a lot.

Still an enjoyable read granted, minus the Yi Ti chapters which was an absolute slog.
