Yea, these concerns (among others) were probably why the author scrapped the prologue entirely as non-canon. In fact, with the way the story has progressed thus far, it has also been rendered obsolete in terms of content too (many of the plot points not having been explored the way they were implied to have been in the prologue.\\
IMO, scrapping it entirely would probably be ideal (instead of leaving it in as a 'teaser' of what is to coe) as the readers are very much /meant/ to dislike Joffrey at the beginning and let the story the follows try to persuade you otherwise.
