If you don't read the story, you don't care. So spoilers are only an issue if you read the story. The point of the search would be to locate a point in the story where the spelling quality (which is easily evaluated) is sufficient to be engaged with. This method is probably preferable to "just skip to the latest chapter", as it probably provides less spoilers. (The amount of spoilers a chapter may have, increases with the chapter number, so the latest chapter has the most spoilers. 1/2 way through should only have half as much.) Additionally, significant spoilers are not guaranteed. You're not reading the chapter, just evaluating spelling/etc. quality.
