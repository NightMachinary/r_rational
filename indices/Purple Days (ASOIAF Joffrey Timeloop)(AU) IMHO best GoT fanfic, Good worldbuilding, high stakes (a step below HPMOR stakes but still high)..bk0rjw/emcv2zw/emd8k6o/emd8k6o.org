Didn't like it enough to continue the series or just tired of reading series that suffer Author Existence Failure? The world has pretty massive changes that literally start as the first book ends. (Before the dragons are born, there is no credible evidence magic exists or ever did, except that dragons used to exist and Valyrian steel is extra-special. After they are born, a bunch of things happen that only make sense if magic always existed and was just weak for a few centuries.)
