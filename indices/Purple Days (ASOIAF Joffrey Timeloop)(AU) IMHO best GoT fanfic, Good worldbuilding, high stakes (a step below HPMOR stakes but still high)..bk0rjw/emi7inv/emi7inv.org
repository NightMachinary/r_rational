The prose is very stilted and awkward. Numerous grammatical mistakes, dialogue doesn't sound natural, inner monologues are awkward, suffers from the 'look how cool, but angsty and tortured but also so strong my protagonist is' syndrome. Justified somewhat by the concept, but seeing the near-end state of the loop is a terrible mistake to start with. You need to build to that, not keep forward. It's a payoff without a buildup. Author has to 'earn'that Joffrey. This is based only off of my reading of the prologue. I'm planning to give it 1-2 chapters to change my mind, but it's pretty bad so far.
