I liked this one a lot. The early chapters (after the prologue) are a bit of a slog, because Joffrey starts the fanfic as his charming canon self, and reading about his stupidities gets old really fast. But around chapter 7 he gets hit with character development after the reality of his situation sinks in and he hits rock bottom, and that's when he starts to become the likable protagonist he will remain throughout the rest of the story. I particularly enjoyed the Yi-Ti arc, though the TVTropes page [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/PurpleDays][says]] a lot of people thought it went on for too long.

The awesomeness reaches a climax when Joffrey finds out the true nature of his curse and its relationship to the White Walkers. Unfortunately, shortly after that the fic adds another looper, and I didn't find the second looper nearly as interesting as the first, so my interest waned and that's when I dropped the story. Maybe I'll come back to it later, after it has progressed a bit more.

In terms of rationality, I'm not sure it's a good fit for this sub. The characters are all [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][level 1 intelligent]], and there aren't any blatant plot holes or incoherent worldbuilding, but the same is true of the source material so it doesn't count as a deconstruction. The mysteries are not particularly solvable in advance by the reader, Joeffrey gets a lot of help from The Powers That Be, and he doesn't display any unusual cognitive techniques or scientific knowledge. On the other hand, the sub needs content, so we can probably let it slide.
