Have a pretty good explanation for who white walkers are, on par with Preston Jacobs one ( The guy who read All Martin works and ties parallels through them all to make asoiaf theories).

Alternates between trying to fix westeros and exploring the world, Westeros constantly punches Jeoffrey in the gut.

Nice character relationships and growth.
