Well. Didn't expect Naruto to experience Chakra Exhaustion chasing after Hinata - his lack of mastery of the Tree Walking must've used a chunk more than was healthy as he pursued her. Kinda impressed with how Orochimaru reacted to learning about Naruto's injuries, and the little chat he had with Shino was interesting.

That Sound village is sounding more and more like a better alternative to the other ninja village all the time.
