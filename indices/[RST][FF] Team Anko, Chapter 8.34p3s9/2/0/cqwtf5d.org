Naruto's regeneration was keeping up with his movement and treewalking on the roofs just fine -- he burned zero net chakra during the entire chase. The problem was treewalking.

Treewalking is normally done on something you're touching. It requires exponentially more chakra the farther you are from the surface you're "walking" on. Most jonin can't 'walk on anything more than an inch away from them, and even that far they generally can't do for more than a few seconds without exhausting themselves.

When Naruto saw Hinata about to die and he couldn't move fast enough to save her, he treewalked on a man's head from /three feet away/. He burned every scrap of chakra he had in a fraction of a second and would have died if he hadn't been able to get a very substantial chakra transfusion.

[EDIT: I should also have mentioned: ordinarily you can't 'walk on things that have notable amounts of chakra. Trees have chakra, but not a lot and it doesn't move around much. People have a lot of chakra (comparatively), and it flows quickly, so it will tend to brush off any attempt from foreign chakra to grab on. That's why ninja don't use treewalking in combination with taijutsu in order to rip holes in their opponents every time they land a strike. Naruto has so much chakra he was able to overcome that limitation, although it was a big part of what drained him so far.]

And no, none of what I just said is Naruto canon as far as I know. It's just the only way that I can make sense of ninja not weaponizing the treewalking ability.
