It doesn't mention trade offs - just that you have to learn from experience/experiment, because when all you have is the uniform distribution as a prior, that's all you can do - and if you don't have the information you need when/before you need it, then you're doomed. 'Test the rules to find out which ones are most important, and always be prepared to learn.'

'figure stuff out before you need it' (by doing stuff, testing, empiricism, etc.)

'you can only learn big lessons by doing big things. Failure is your teacher, and if you don't give it your all, eventually your illusion of control/superiority (via holding back, not risking failure, not being honest with yourself about what you're doing) will be shattered and you will fail, when a bunch of lessons you didn't learn come crashing down on you all at once (as soon as the context switches). If you're not failing and changing things and learning as fast as you can, then your enemies may grow to defeat you in your comfortable equilibrium. If you stop growing, then you're half dead.[1]'
