Something that I noticed is that many of these ideas are only good if the Evil Overlord exists in a universe that is recognized as operating according to specific genre conventions.

I believe that it would be very interesting to see an Evil Overlord list for a more realistic universe where the genre conventions are not quite as blatant or overpowering. Does anyone have some ideas for this?

One interesting example of this is found in HPMOR when Quirrel discusses how he learned to turn into a snake following the guidelines of his own list which dictated that he should become an animagus. I found this to be amusing as it makes a lot of sense within the setting but runs into complete conflict with Rule 34 of the Evil Overlord List
