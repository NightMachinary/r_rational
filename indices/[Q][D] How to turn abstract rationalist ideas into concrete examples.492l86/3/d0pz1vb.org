Here's a nice way to explain to a small child just what a complexity penalty and Occam's Razor is:

  ...keeping track of complexity penalties."

  "Ba?"

  "Hm... do you know what ninjas are?"

  "Na."

  "They're people who do sneaky, tricky, spy stuff, and are very good at hiding. In fact, they're so good at hiding, that there's always a chance that one is hiding right behind you, /right now/." Minnie turned her head to look behind her, and I grinned. "And they're clever enough to keep moving, to stay behind you where you can't see them. So one explanation for anything that happens while you're not looking at it is, 'A ninja did it.'"

  "Did a ninja do it?"

  "You tell me. Say you hear a clack sound beside you, and you turn your head, and there's a stone where there was no stone before. One explanation is I threw it at you. Another is a ninja did it. Another might be, oh, a squirrel dropped it. The 'complexity penalty' for each of these explanations is how many other things have to be true for that explanation to be true. So if I threw a rock at you, then what else would have to be true, that wouldn't necessarily be true if it wasn't me?"

  "You... wanted to hurt me? And you didn't like me? And were hiding that you didn't like me?"

  "Alright. And if it was a squirrel?"

  "That... she carried a rock up a tree?"

  "And a ninja?"

  "That... she's been following me all this time? And nobody's talking about her? And she's been really really quiet, until she dropped a rock? And she knows how to keep hiding from me, and wants to, and-"

  I held up a hand to interrupt. "That's good enough for now. So out of all of those, which has the smallest complexity penalty."

  "The squirrel?"

  "Got it in one. There's an idea called 'Occam's Razor' that says 'the simplest explanation is probably the right one', which is actually based on a bit of math called 'Kolmogorov Complexity' that gives precise definitions for what counts as 'simple'... but anyway. That's one of the tricks - come up with a list of explanations, and figure out which ones need the least extra things to be true."
