I'm thinking my series could be set in a world 10-20 years from now, where the world is rapidly approaching singularity, and cool scifi inventions are being created every day(every hour). But all the cool potentially world-changing gadgets are copyrighted and protected by huge companies, and used for silly purposes(equivalent of using an iPhone that has more power than NASA computers in 80's for playing candy crush). And my characters would be a group of outlaws/hackers that are stealing these inventions and open sourcing them or using them for something cool.

I also had an idea that a Stanford student from our times gets somehow frozen in time, and wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future where all that's left of humanity is small tribes who are surviving by using gadgets of previously great civilization. And this student would pretend to be a shaman(to not get eaten or something), and under this pretense he would teach the tribe people rationality and science, and try to rebuild civilization...

Or maybe I'll just be coming up with a different scifi idea for every sketch.... The problem with telling all stories in one world is that it has to have consistent rules, and that could stand in a way of some crazier comedy ideas, also I don't yet have the skill to put together a world for long series, I'll spend forever trying to figure out what the "perfect" setting and rules should be....

Or frame it as dialogues between a couple of coworkers, on various topics. But that could be too boring for animation....

I'm still brainstorming it....
