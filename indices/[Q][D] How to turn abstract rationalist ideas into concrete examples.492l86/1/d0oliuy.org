I believe the best way to go about it is to first find your characters. If you want a fable about Occam's Razor, you either have two characters with competing hypotheses or a single character who has an obviously overly complex hypothesis. I don't know how universal reading Highlights magazine was, but think of Goofus and Gallant. Goofus always goes with the explanation that's the most complex. Gallant always goes with the simplest explanation.

If you need a scenario, just pick something at random. Or better, if you want a series, figure out some sort of frame. Animals in the forest are a classic for fables (including the one that won the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3pp3lw/biweekly_challenge_fables_and_legends/cw9o0kj][legends and fables challenge]]).
