The trouble with communicating ideas is that you can't be subtle. My most salient example of unsubtlety is Umberto Eco's /Baudolino/, which really, really, really beats the audience over the head with the idea of the unreliable narrator. And I think it's just about right! If the book wasn't half obviously unreliable, with occasional references to what a liar the narrator was, you could have had a serious problem with readers noticing it's unreliable at all.

Now, this example only directly bears on longer-form fiction. But still, if you want the audience to really notice (e.g.) the planning fallacy, not just as words but as a pattern, you may need to go to similarly ridiculous lengths; the book didn't just explain its conceit and use it in the obvious way, although it was explained, it was also mentioned, expressed in metaphor, and used in places both obvious and minor.

Compare this to The Codeless Code. You're still really beaten over the head with the message; the plotlets revolve entirely around a moral, which is not necessarily a general principle, maybe just a bite-sized piece of one. The prose style is obscure when obscurity serves the purpose of getting you to think more about the moral, and otherwise is just setting a tone of Deepness that attracts readers. There's no room for most of the trappings of a story. You could absolutely do this with rationality content. Goodness knows it's easy enough to sound deep. Maybe you could even do something like trying to get people to think about the moral because of humor rather then because of obfuscation.

Another option would be to jump straight to trying to give people mnemonics. "You're hiking across the plains when you begin to think something is stalking you in the high grass. You look at your map, and realize you've covered much less of the trail than you expected. One section of the map is marked 'plan,' and the other is marked 'fallacy' - no, wait, that's 'plains' and 'forest.' You hear something behind you and try to walk faster, but you've only covered 50% of the trail when you thought you'd be 95% done, and the sun is beginning to set. You look at the map again - the shape of the trail has twisted to spell the words 'planning fallacy.' The rustling from behind you seems to grow louder, and you break into a run. Your footsteps sound like 'plan plan plan plan' and the rustling of the grass sounds like 'fallllaccccyyyyyy.' You wish you'd planned this hike better."
