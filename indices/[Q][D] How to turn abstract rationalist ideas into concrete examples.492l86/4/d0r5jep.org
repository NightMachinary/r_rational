Do you think #15 could incorporate Julia Galef's "Redefining Success" video?

[[https://youtu.be/96VlDtwfbpQ]]

Basically, success should be measured more so by how quickly/efficiently we get back to attempting to achieve our goal after we fall off the path, rather than whether or not we actually achieve the goal. (Could fit better with goals that transform due to new knowledge and understanding)

Or do you think it could be its own story/theme?
