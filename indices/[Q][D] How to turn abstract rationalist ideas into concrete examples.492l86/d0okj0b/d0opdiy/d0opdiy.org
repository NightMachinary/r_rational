Thank you for the advice! I think you're right, this makes a lot of sense. Though I wish I could do it in reverse, for practical reasons, so that I could figure out a "curriculum" and use it as a starting point for coming up with my stories. It seems to be a more structured approach, and the guys writing koans seem to be using it.... Though maybe there's some reason it doesn't work for me....

But this will definitely help me with writing fiction. Just coming up with a story first and then figuring out a way to connect it to rationality....
