I think you're going about it the wrong way. You want to start with a cool idea and then layer the rationality on top of it. It's not like rationality only applies in certain scenarios: the whole point is to apply to everything you encounter!

For example, let's take a story about alchemy/potion-making. You could apply any of these to this.

1. Confirmation Bias: Everyone knows that "X fundamental principles of alchemy" are true, so nobody ever tries anything that contradicts those principles.

2. Expectation Value: I'm actually stealing this from "Master of the Five Magics", but potions have a varying chance of being brewed successfully, even if everything is correct. Thus potion prices are based on the chance of brewing.

3. Local vs global optima: Devastate local environment to procure enough ingredients for immortality elixir.

4. Ad hominem/Genetic fallacy: Everyone dismisses "heathen" alchemy, but what is there's more to know? Our protagonist combines both forms of knowledge, revolutionizing the field.

Obviously these aren't perfect, but you get the idea. I'd recommend picking a story type or idea you've enjoyed before and apply rationality to it.
