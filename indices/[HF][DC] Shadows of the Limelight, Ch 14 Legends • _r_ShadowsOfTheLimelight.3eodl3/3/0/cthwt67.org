The fudge factor here is that some unknown quantity of air has already been removed from the room by the time Vidre finds the vent (and she only finds the vent /because/ there's enough air being removed that this noticeably disturbs particles in the air). When the door opens, there's a hiss of air from the pressure difference. I'll confess to having done only some sketchy math, but I was hoping that it wouldn't break plausibility if it was off a little (especially since no times are given, especially in the break between when Welexi leaves and comes back).

If you would be so kind, let me know whether this is something that you thought was intuitively wrong, or whether it was something that you worked out with math after the fact? I probably won't be changing it anytime soon, but it might be something that I come back to when I do a full edit at the end.
