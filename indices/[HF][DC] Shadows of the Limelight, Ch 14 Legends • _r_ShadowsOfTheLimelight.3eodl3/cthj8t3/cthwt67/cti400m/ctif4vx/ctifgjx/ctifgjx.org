Minutes passed. (Combat rounds, even.) Not the /several hours/ that would be required under normal conditions for a small room to become stuffy.

That aside, I think that it's fixable in-story. All that is needed, is some good reason for the air to be going out of the room much faster than it normally would, without Vidre being able to do anything about it. Like a water-driven suction pump, with the room set up as a metal bell jar. Vidre could probably still stopper it though.

Maybe the air could be teleported out in chunks? "Scooped out"? I don't know what domain that might be.
