A strong chapter which I thoroughly enjoyed reading.

I'm often surprised by the comments and complaints that a clever, fun and well written story can somehow generate. You've created a world where a man can turn himself completely into light, where a woman can have what seems to be a pretty complete control over glass and where, in general, fame grants super powers. With all of that, air being removed quickly from a room is no surprise to me at all and I simply assume 'illustrati magic' and continue to enjoy the story.

It's already noted that Dominic was feeling light headed and wondering if the air was thinner at the top of the building. Perhaps the room, or even the whole floor, had reduced oxygen in it. This needn't cause a significant change in air pressure if the oxygen was replaced with a greater concentration of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. In this case, removing the oxygen out of the room could be much faster than in the normal, everyday situation that we initially imagine it to be.

I'm surprised how often readers assume that all the information they've been given so far is all the information they could possibly need to judge (and then criticise) a situation. This is even more surprising when it's an unfinished story set in an unfamiliar world which we are discovering through the eyes of the protagonist.
