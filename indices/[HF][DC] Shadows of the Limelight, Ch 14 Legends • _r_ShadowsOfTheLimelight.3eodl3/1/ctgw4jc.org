Reposted from my comment on the website:

Interesting that Welexi believes his light-form takes something away from him when he uses it. How does he know? Did something change in him the first time he used it (presumably when he discovered he could)? And did he learn of that change by comparing it to his memories, or did somebody close to him say (I think not the latter, since only Dominic knew of the ability before this chapter)?

Assuming it's true, it means that prolonged usage might progress him towards some prototypical "light-domain" personality, which is an interesting concept. Personality doesn't directly correspond to domain (e.g. you wouldn't say "That's so typically flesh of you."), but it could be the personality of the progenitor of the domain (if they exist).

I'm also interested in how the whole thing works. He travels through the iron door just fine, but doesn't fall through the iron floor. There could be an element of intent behind it (he didn't intend to fall through the floor, so he didn't), which seems to be the usual explanation for phasing.

Further, his light-form continued to move in the direction he planned and reconstituted itself as expected. That means that he must either be able to consciously control his transformed self, or it derives instructions from his mental state at the time.

Also, I'm curious about the potential "final form" for other domains. Shadow is obvious (like light's, but dark), as are electricity, frost, fire, etc. But what about the non-elementals? Is the ultimate iron skill basically the terminator from T2? Is ultimate flesh as gross as it seems? Does ultimate cat just turn them into a cat?
