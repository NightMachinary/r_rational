Just because there's a meta-system that's affecting their actions doesn't break the rule by itself. It just means that cause and effect is manipulated by a system that they have to account for in their decisions. The characters are doing their best to map the system, then exploit or circumvent it as best serves their goals, that the system is designed to encourage narrative or game-like outcomes is irrelevant.

To put it another way if a character is able to kill their rival by finding their weakness by accident in the final confrontation it breaks the rule. (Wicked Witch demise)

If the weakness is placed there for the character to find by another of the rival's enemies who is using the character as a proxy it doesn't break the rule. (Good Witch is using Dorothy as an unwitting assassin)

If the character deduces that the weakness being conveniently available is highly unlikely and co-opts the assassination plot to whatever goal they desire it's rational.

I think WTC is the third example here. The DM's system that manipulates Joon and company is like the manipulator's assassination plot. When Joon uses narrative knowledge to guide decisions in a system where narratives are observably real it's as rational as using any other knowledge relevant to the situation.
