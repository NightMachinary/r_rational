  the RT stipulation that nothing must happen simply because the plot demands it. What do you guys think?

The RT stipulations at the sidebar are IMO a /bad/ description of what this genre is like, something that a single person threw together, without good and proper thought & discussion of what the definiting characteristics of rational fiction are like -- those listed characteristic obfuscate more than they illuminate. They look like mere /praise/ of rational fiction rather than a proper description of it. They're stuck there, impossible to change, out of sheer inertia.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6s2cad/meta_a_suggested_rewrite_of_the_characteristics/][My own suggestion]] for the characteristics of rational fiction is this:

In Rational Fiction:\\
- The author displays respect for the value of intelligence, reason, forethought, and preparation.\\
- The author attempts to explore the moral and material implications and consequences of the elements in the story, and to investigate alternate solutions to presented problems, even if they violate the usual conventions of the genre.\\
- The author doesn't use 'narrativium'. The characters should not rely on events happening as they would happen in a story, unless there's explicitly a force conspiring to make them happen this way. (Any usage of destiny, divine providence, miracles, willpower-produced powerups, etc, must be justified in-story or not used at all.)

--------------

'Worth the Candle' is rational fiction because though narrativium exists, it exists on a /Watsonian/ level. There's explicitly a force conspiring to make things follow a narrative. This force is discussed by the characters, it's part of the world.
