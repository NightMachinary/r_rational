Word choice does matter when you're trying to describe something. But I think the whole "Does this specific story match this specific definition of a word that is also the title of this subreddit" discussion is navel-gazing.

We can easily determine that WtC is likely to appeal to (a reasonable portion of) [[/r/rational][r/rational]] readers. I don't see why we'd need to ask "But is it /really/ rational?"
