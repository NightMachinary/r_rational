I disagree with this comment because people may come here to see how rational fiction can operate; remove that and we may as well call ourselves WebSerials or something.

But i do think the story fits because the story is character driven. The prompts deliver options, but the characters are rational and (spoilers) the MC meets the DM and changes how things work a bit. I'm not good with words but I think someone else will explain better than me.
