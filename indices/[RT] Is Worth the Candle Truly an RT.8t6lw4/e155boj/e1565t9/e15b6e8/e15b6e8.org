> meets the DM and changes how things work

I think there's a major difference between WtC, where the DM's narrative influence is a real, in-universe effect, and non-rational fiction, where things happen without any in-universe justification due to an authorial narrative influence.

It's a convenient tool that does happen to make the story easily tweaked by the author - and let's be careful not to abuse it - but it fits in as a logical extension of the worldbuilding.
