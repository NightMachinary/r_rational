In the context of fiction, being truly rational means optimizing your actions based on the facts of the universe you find yourself in. (As an aside, it's been argued around here before that Tengan Toppa Guren Lagann is technically already pretty rational given the setting's mechanics)

So, yeah, just being in a world that has quests laid out for you with clear goals, stated methods, weighable consequences, and concrete rewards makes being rational easier to do for the characters, and easier to follow for the readers; you could call it a cheap writing tactic if you want, but that last bit is very important for the genre! Even though real world problems aren't necessarily as simple as Quests, /sometimes they can be/, and deliberately framing them in those exact terms above can become a good, rational habit.
