I think you're right that a game-like world makes it easier for readers to follow along and have a better of understanding of why the characters should or should not make certain choices.

My main point of contention with [[/u/Xtraordinaire]]'s comment was the last line "The more a setting resembles a computer game, the closer it is to [RT]".

I don't think making a story increasingly more game-like actually makes it embody more of the characteristics of good rational fiction. As you said, some gamification can make it easier for readers to follow along. But at a certain point I think you get diminishing returns on this, and the story becomes more about how to rationally play the particular game that the author created rather than an interesting character driven story.

I'd argue that the greater importance that game mechanics have on a story, the less emphasis is placed on agency.

Edit: This may just be a difference of personal taste as well. Since I find that stories that get more bogged down in the more technical parts of world building and optimization don't hold my attention as long as stories that are more character driven. For example, Mother of Learning was a story that I initially enjoyed, but grew tired of as the author spent the majority of the time describing how the main character attempted to optimize his time and grow stronger. There are interesting character in interactions in the story, but they were not the focus. So the story began to feel more like watching someone grinding in a video game, than a captivating tale.

It's possible that someone who enjoys the optimization parts more than character driven moments would agree with [[/u/Xtraordinaire]]'s statement.
