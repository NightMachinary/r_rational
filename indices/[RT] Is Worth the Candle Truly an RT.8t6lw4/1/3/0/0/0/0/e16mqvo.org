I'm going to emphasize the word "setting" in the quote you refer to. Not story, but setting.

In a typical computer game, there is no author (or GM) fiat. Instead, there are several layers of rules, and all the outcomes are subject to them (plus some rnd, but no more than the rules allow). This is a well-defined system that the player/protagonist has to navigate.

That doesn't automatically make a good story. A rational story isn't necessarily a good story, and neither is a rationalist one.
