The main thing that would weigh against WtC being a "rational fic," in my mind, would be the antagonists.

I'll compare with Mother of Learning.

In MoL, we have four main antagonists: Quatach Ichl (and the Ibasans), Sudomir, the Cult of the Dragon Below, and Red Robe.

Except for Red Robe, whose motives, like his identity, have been kept secret, these antagonists have been explored in detail. Quatach Ichl has a plan that's in the interests of Ulquaan Ibasa, and it seems like a good bet that it'll work, if the invasion succeeds. Sudomir is highly unstable and his goal is extremely weird, but the invasion is about the only way that it could work. The Cult is doing something stupidly risky, but they'll basically have a god on a leash if they can pull it off. Their plans are rational, work towards the well-defined goals of the ones planning, and, even without Red Robe assisting, have proven difficult to derail even /with/ time travel.

On the other hand, WtC's antagonists aren't really explored much. The gold mage wants gold. The soul mage wants freedom, and to learn more about souls. Larkspur wants political power. The backstabbing thieves from the zombie city want money. The DM is inscrutable.

Aside from the DM, everybody has tried to come after the PCs with overwhelming force of one form or another, and have simply been wrong about the level of force necessary, because they're not expecting to meet the next Uther Penndraig. No one has really tried to out-/think/ the protagonists.

I'm reminded of a quote I came across, related to HPMOR. "If you make Frodo a Jedi, you have to give Sauron the Death Star."

And that's what I haven't really seen evidence of. The protagonists have well-defined goals and character motivations, and have been really good at using their advantages to make plans which further those goals. And that's great, and absolutely necessary for rational fiction. But we haven't really seen a rational /antagonist/, which would be about the only thing, in my mind, that would weigh against including WtC in that genre.
