I disagree, only because part of truly being rational is learning how to optimize your actions/decisions without having quests laid out for you or hard numbers to judge effectiveness.

The real world is messy. Working from a game like system is a crutch that real rational people don't have.

I'm not saying that stories with game like systems are inherently less rational. I'm just saying that they require a little less from the main characters in terms of actually needing to use their rationality in ways that mimic the real world.

(Note: I'm not 100% sure of this opinion even though I just sprouted it out like I believe it. It's really late here and I'd have to think about it deeper to be certain.)
