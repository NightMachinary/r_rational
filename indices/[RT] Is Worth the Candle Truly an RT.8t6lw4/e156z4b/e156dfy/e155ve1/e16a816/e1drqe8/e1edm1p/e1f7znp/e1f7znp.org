I don't necessarily mean that there needs to be a single overarching nemesis for Joon & Co. to defeat. Smaller villains of smaller arcs can still be demonstrated to be rational.

I'll give an example for something that /could/ have happened.

Uniquities hears of the activities of the Council of Arches, and figures that it's their job to lock it down and put an end to it. It's threatening the stability of the Empire, after all.

They send a scout party to evaluate Amaryllis's capabilities (having assumed she's in charge), and get a taste of the sheer power that the PCs have. They backtrack, and start to look closer at the party and its recent actions.

Eventually, after a few more encounters, they figure out exactly who and what Joon is (the next Uther) and immediately switch sides, because opposing him is the worst idea ever. And besides, if it gets to a point where he needs to be neutralized, like the monster that Uther became so long ago (dun dun DUN!), better to be close, and in a position of trust, to make that strike if, gods forbid, it becomes necessary. They join up, like they do in the actual story, and we end up just about exactly where we are, but with an interesting conflict between two rational forces having taken place and having been resolved.

/That/ would be a rational antagonist. Not Larkspur, who never once stopped to question whether he should continue opposing a person with the obvious power being displayed; not soul-mage-I-forget-his-name, who decides that the best way to ensure his own safety is to meddle with the souls of the good friends of the multidisciplinary magical prodigy and take them hostage. Someone who, having touched a hot surface and been burnt, /pulls their hand back/, as opposed to doubling down.
