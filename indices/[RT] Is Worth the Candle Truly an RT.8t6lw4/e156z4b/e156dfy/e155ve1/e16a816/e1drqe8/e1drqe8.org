I personally think looking at the DM as an antagonist and his potential interventions in a purposeful light make for a rationalist story. Does the composition of Joon's companions say more about Joon, the DM, or the DM's conception of what Joon wants? The DM seems to be nearly all powerful, but likely not Omnipotent. I believe he has knowable motivations.
