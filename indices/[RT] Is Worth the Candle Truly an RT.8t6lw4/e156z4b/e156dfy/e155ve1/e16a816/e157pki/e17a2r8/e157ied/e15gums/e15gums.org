It's all well and good to complain about the setting of Worth the Candle -- that it's completely unrealistic and unreasonable for the universe to be controlled and manipulated by a sapient DM with goals conspicuously aligned with producing an interesting narrative -- but if you were in Juniper's shoes, if you found yourself in the completely unreasonable position of being in a world seeming cobbled together from D&D campaigns and subject to the whims of an apparently omnipotent and capricious DM, then it would be somewhat less than optimal to ignore those observations.

Rationality is a property of a cognitive process, in particular, the requirement that the agent uses all the information at its disposal to produce decisions that result in as good an outcome as possible. It is not a prescription that the rules of the universe work a particular way. Like Phillip K. Dick said, “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.”

If you find that reality is "unrealistic", then tough luck, but it does no good to complain about it. A rational actor updates their internal models accordingly, formulates hypotheses, performs experiments to test those hypotheses, and gets on with making decisions as well as they can given the information they have.

And Juniper does pretty much that. He certainly considers how utterly ridiculous and impossible his situation is, and seriously considers the possibility that he's in a simulation, but absent any other viable courses of action he tries to determine the rules of the world and moves on with making decisions to the best of his ability.

A number of other comments have been made on the shortcoming of the checklist in the sidebar; my view is that a rational story is nothing more or less than a story where characters are rational (or at least approximately rational, subject to the constraint that humans are not perfectly intelligent and some are conspicuously less intelligent than others). The premise of the story is entirely orthogonal to this requirement, except to the extent that it must be internally consistent. The D&D-derived universe, the game mechanics, the DM: all those things are merely part of the premise and the author can chose the premise to be whatever they like. It's up to the characters to work within the premise they're given, whatever its rules might be.
