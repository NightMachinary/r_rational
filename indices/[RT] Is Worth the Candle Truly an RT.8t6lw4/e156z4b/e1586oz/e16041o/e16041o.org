I'll throw my hat behind this once again. Reddit is uniquely situated as a flexible voting platform, so we might as well use it. Set up pinned messages to discuss different aspects of the problem for a week or two, then pin an iteration or two of proposal threads, then pin the final voting thread in contest mode and declare the winner after the votes coalesce into something solid.
