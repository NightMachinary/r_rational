Whether you consider WTC rational fiction will depend on two major criteria

1. What exact definition of rational / rationalist / etc. fiction you use.

2. How much in your opinion the work in question satisfies those criteria.

I personally prefer to define Science Fiction using the extensional definition Damon Knight gives:

#+begin_quote
  Science fiction means what we point to when we say it.
#+end_quote

The obvious parallel extensional definition for Rational Fiction is of course

#+begin_quote
  Rational fiction means what we point to when we say it.
#+end_quote

That is, I don't think there's a perfect intensional definition of 'rational fiction' that labels everything I'd consider rational and non-rational appropriately and concisely, that fits neatly into a half dozen sentences. I personally feel like Worth The Candle is definitely rational fiction, and I'm very comfortable with pointing to WTC and saying "Rational Fiction".

--------------

There are several reasons that influence my classification of WTC. For one, my idea of rational fiction includes elements that are at least partially cultural, including a number of shibboleths, signifiers, and references that WTC hits in spades. The story was very obviously written from a rationalist-informed point-of-view by a rationalist community member and considers and plays with common rationalist ideas and tropes constantly, and where it subverts or entirely avoids those rationalists ideas and tropes it is doing so knowingly, with a wink and a nod towards them.

To discuss what you most take issue with, Worth The Candle, in having a plot driven at least partially by the fact a nigh-omnipotent character or setting force has values that include enacting narrative tropes, is treading familiar ground for rationalist fiction. Terry Pratchett, who influenced a lot of rational writers and was at least partially there himself fairly often, played with this idea a ton, most explicitly and dramatically in Witches Abroad but really throughout his entire oeuvre. Scott Alexander's Unsong is extremely definitely rationalist fiction and similarly did very much a similar thing with it's plot and 'coincidences'. And Practical Guide to Evil is of course probably the poster child for this idea, if Worth The Candle isn't. And then there's Erogamer, which is super rationalist. Basically, the whole idea of a powerful character (or non-sentient setting element) enforcing or enacting a world with more typical story tropes on a character who then learns that this is happening and attempts to predict, subvert, or otherwise exploit these tropes is a theme we've seen in a bunch of rationalist and rationalist-adjacent books - it makes for a good 'excuse' to encounter traditional tropes that the rational character can then react to rationally. I don't think that having a particular character or setting element like that is irrational or disqualifies a work from the rationalist canon.
