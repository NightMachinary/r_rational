You're right - Worth the Candle is hardly absent of plot and pacing intervention. But they're /characteristics/ of rational fiction, not intrinsic attributes, for a reason, and that's because often times meeting all of the characteristics is hard or impossible within the constraints of the story.

Nonetheless, I think that Worth the Candle is really good at avoiding exactly what you're saying. Just because it happened because the plot required it doesn't mean it happened /solely/ because the plot required it - from a Doylist perspective it has, maybe, but there is usually a Watsonian explanation in the work itself. This is lazier than pure simulation, and obvious, but Worth the Candle isn't as rigorously plotted and written as some of Alexander Wales' other works - the exposed gears of the "game" are what they are, a convenient tool for the author. It certainly holds a place on the subreddit.

EDIT: This isn't really a formal principle, but I'd like to say additionally that whether or not a reader is impressed or entertained by something clearly explained as an afterthought is a good contributor to how it feels for them to read it. A reader concerned that this was a harem self-insert story might object more to the fact that, conveniently, all of his party members save Grak have identified as female - the avenues for nitpicking depend /entirely/ on whether something has broken your suspension of disbelief. The characteristics for rational fiction are really good at lowering the risk of breaking the suspension of disbelief, but if you're familiar enough with the Rule of Cool and other forms of emotional manipulation you can safely drop them without making a story /bad/.

EDIT: EDIT: And Brandon Sanderson says that you can't solve problems in a story with a system you don't understand, but notes as a corrolary that you can /cause/ them with one.
