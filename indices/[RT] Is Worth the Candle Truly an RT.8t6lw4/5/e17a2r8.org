Honestly the fact that there's so much contention of this subject casts serious doubt as to rational fiction even being useful as a genre construct. Like if you have any piece of fiction it should be fairly easy to slot it into fantasy or sci fi or conspiracy narrative or any other genre and it should be relatively easy to say whether it's rational or no. But when you have very iconic examples of rational fiction not being accepted as rational what do you get?
