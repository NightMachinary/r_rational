*Spoilers* and such. Turn back if you don't wanna know.

Having self-aware characters who are genre-savvy and make decisions based upon that knowledge seem rather rational to me.

The fact that they are all in a simulation sort of removes 1. The main character was uncertain of this, but once he pumped his Intelligence score high enough we were told of it, and when he spoke to the Dungeon Master it was confirmed. Yeah, it's kinda hard to accept Lit RPG as Rational in normal cases, but in this one the main character knows he is in a created world and acts accordingly. The fact that his friends don't, because they are part of that world, fits together well.

The fact that a Dungeon Master is setting up challenges and such deals with 2 and 3. If this were happening just out of plot convenience, it would be a sensible complaint, but there is an active sapient intelligence out there setting these events into motion in a way that will be interesting. It was confirmed this world was set up for the main character as the player, and while the world does have all manner of other beings going about their lives, things are naturally going to be 'bent' toward providing a more complex experience for him.
