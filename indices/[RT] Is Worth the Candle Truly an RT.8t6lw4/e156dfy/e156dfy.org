I think it's a rational story because the characters themselves don't make dumb decisions "simply because the plot demands it".

Suspiciously convenient things happen to them, but the world was set up in such a way that this was meant to happen. The creator of the world (and to an extent Aerb itself) is as much of a character as Juniper and the rest of the party.

It's not so much that things happen because the plot requires it, but rather because the DM requires a world where interesting things constantly happen to Joon.

Also I think you may be looking at things through the lens of Joon a bit too much. While Joon sees things happening certain ways because "That's how a GM would contstruct it", there is always a logical in-world reason for why certain things occur. Things may seem game-like in general, but there has never been a situation (that I've noticed) where that game-like qualities would be out of place in the world that was created.

And there's nothing specifically in the rules that says the setting has to be normal, or even natural. It just has to be consistent. And all actions of the characters involved have to come from individual personal motivations, instead of just happening because it would be cool or dramatic.

I think the story satisfies those conditions, even if the world is game-like and artificial in nature.
