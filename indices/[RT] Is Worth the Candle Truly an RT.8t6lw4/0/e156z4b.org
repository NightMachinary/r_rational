I hate the definition on the sidebar. I don't think it's very good at defining the genre, and I don't think that it works /at all/ when used as a checklist, which people always do, because the sidebar is put into bullet points, and bullet points lend themselves to checklists. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6s2cad/meta_a_suggested_rewrite_of_the_characteristics/][See this discussion]] for what I feel is a better, more in-depth attempt by a number of people to define the genre. Specifically, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6s2cad/meta_a_suggested_rewrite_of_the_characteristics/dlafglf/][this comment by me]] about where the list in the sidebar actually came from.

I would change the sidebar, but getting an actual definition that matches community consensus is a lot of work, and I feel like my effort is probably spent elsewhere. Additionally, I have fairly obvious conflicts of interest on the matter.
