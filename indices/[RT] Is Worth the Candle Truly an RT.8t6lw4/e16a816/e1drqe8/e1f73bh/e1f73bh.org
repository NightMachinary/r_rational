To be honest, and contrary to what I say above, I can't really think of the DM as an antagonist, because nothing that has been shown has given any indication that his goals are opposed to Joon's. True, Juniper would rather achieve those goals with a lot less drama than what the GM would prefer, but that's not the GM being an antagonist so much as a nuisance.

Still, I'll concede that at some point in the future, when Joon is strong enough to oppose the GM directly and their goals don't align, the GM's character could be explored to a point where his rationality will be exposed. However, I don't see that happening any time soon, and I certainly haven't seen it yet.
