I think extreme risk-aversion is part and parcel of his philosophy. Declarations of invulnerability, no matter how justified, run the risk of creating a narrative that culminates in their undoing. Why give them a chance to examine his personal defenses when he can negotiate perfectly well without doing that, especially since Hierophant's entire deal is analyzing and recreating miraculous magics? He's the Dead King, he doesn't need the marginal bump to intimidation. The man intends to live forever, and even very small risks add up over time. Giving no openings is consistent with his style.
