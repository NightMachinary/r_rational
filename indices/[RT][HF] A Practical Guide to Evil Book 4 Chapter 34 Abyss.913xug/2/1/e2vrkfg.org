  /The shade of Splendour/

  Oh dear, muted alarm bells ringing in my head.

I felt this way at first too, but reading it over again it actually doesn't seem that worrisome. In the last chapter, Akua (in fae form) was referred to as "one of the Splendid." The Dead King obviously isn't some chump to be fooled by her appearance, and so recognized her for what she is: a shade (as she is dead) of Splendour (as she is infused with Winter). It IS interesting that there's nary a mention of her Name, though. I'd have expected The Dead King to at least call that out too. Possibly he doesn't know, or maybe it hints that she's moving from Diabolist to a new Name, potentially the redemption arc theory people are batting around?
