Cat doesn't necessarily know how what she did to Akua interacts with namelore, though. She's been a lich before, and she knew she didn't have a Name then, but Akua isn't an animated body bound to undeath by a soul stored in an object. Her soul is stored, for sure, but she has no true body. Cat could simply be reminding herself of the extreme danger implied in letting Akua loose, whether on purpose or on accident.
