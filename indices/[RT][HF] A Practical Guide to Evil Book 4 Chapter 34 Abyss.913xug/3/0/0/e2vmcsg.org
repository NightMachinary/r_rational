It does change the context, since I'm pretty sure Pilgrim knew who he was talking to. Consider their exchange in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/kaleidoscope-vi/][interlude Kaleidoscope VI]]:

  “Child,” he said, tone appalled. “What have you done to yourself?”

  “What needed to be done,” the Black Queen calmly replied. “My side doesn't get to walk away clean, Pilgrim. I see you've been tossing around resurrections like they're godsdamned solstice treats, too. Charming. Not going to have any long-term ramifications at all.”

  The monster paused, then leaned forward.

  “Did that register as a lie?” she grinned. “It didn't, did it? Have a good think about that one next time you try to sleep, Pilgrim.”

  “Surrender,” the Great Elder said. “Abdicate. It is not too late.”

  “You missing the part where I'm currently winning the battle?” the Black Queen drawled. “Hells, it's not too late for you either. Terms were offered and they hold. Take your army and go home. This doesn't need to turn into a Named pissing contest.”

  “You would argue this, after slaying thousands?” the Pilgrim asked.

  “I feel like we might need to revisit the concept of foreign invasion,” the villain noted. “Specifically the part where it has fucking consequences. Like, you know, people dying. You'd think that one would be a given, but apparently you're slow learners. Wahwah, my attempt to conquer a -- sort of -- sovereign nation wasn't met with flowers and a godsdamned parade. It's almost like we're not happy about the whole thing. Go figure.”

  “And you think your reign a better alternative?” the Grey Pilgrim asked calmly.

  “Hells, Pilgrim, I was born to rule,” the Black Queen replied with a toothy grin. “But I'll settle for getting you fucks out of my backyard, this once. Any takers?”

  The monster's gaze swept across the crowd of Bestowed as she idly emptied her pipe and put it away within her cloak. The only answer was Light blooming and weapons raised.

  “Ah, well,” the Black Queen mused. “Pissing contest it is, then.”

Catherine's body isn't looking any different from usual, here, so the Pilgrim must be looking at the soul. There's a chance that he meant that Catherine's transformation when so deep into Winter is troubling, but he's already shown he can ignore this if necessary. In contrast, Akua's soul being long extracted, bound to a cloak's collar and then shoved into Catherine's body is definitely something that would catch his attention.

Akua's response may be interpreted both as telling the Pilgrim that him putting his hand to the scales was a narrative invitation for her to get "resurrected" as well, and as offer for him to think about actually resurrecting her at a later date.

Tariq replies with pretty much the same conditions that were constantly offered to Catherine, confirming to the Diabolist that a redemption into a Good name is still an option, and gets the same kind of retort.

I'd like to point out (again) that the phrasing “You would argue this, after slaying thousands?” implies that casualties inflicted by Catherine personally are significantly larger than the ones inflicted by the armies, which isn't true. However, if he's addressing Akua, then this turns into a reminder that he can't simply leave alone a mass-murderer who killed more people than the both present armies combined. When hearing an extended (and roundabout) explanation of why she considers herself already having suffered consequences of her failed conquest, he responds with understandably sceptical “And you think your reign a better alternative?”

Then Akua straight up says she was born to rule Hells. I know she kicks ass in this chapter, but I can't wrap my head around /everybody in the comment section missing it/. At best some people remarked that this phrase is out of character for Catherine. But after Akua realizes he wouldn't budge on the subject, draws the line of what she considers her due and effectively closes the negotiation, she doesn't harm heroes that much either! Her section of the interlude starts with her musing about playing a hero herself, and then she proceeds to throw around attacks an average hero would easily shrug off. The only serious attacks are on people who have a healer on hand (Silent Guardia, Forsworn Healer) or heavy hitters (Saint of Swords).

In that context, refusing to help with the negotiations Catherine was raising the pressure that made her either fold (in which case the redemption is applied straightforwardly, since she now has to fight everyone that previously backed her to “amend her sins”), or resort to the drastic measures he no doubt saw her considering, which gives the next batch of heroes narrative advantage and makes her let Akua out more frequently, who either backstabs her (which brings us back to Evil turns on Evil) or behaves like a decent person until she has a chance to contact the Pilgrim again (which, aside from story of an artifact backfiring on its owner, would allow him more control over her “character development”, or at least trick the villains to their doom).

Either way, the consequences of Below's interference are mitigated by the fact that the people it props up are divided and fighting amongst themselves. Playing the narrative, as far as the balance is concerned, isn't a big enough addition of power by itself, so he has all the chances to sic the emerging threats on each other (at least from his own point of view).
