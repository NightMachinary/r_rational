I'm glad to see them finally reach the Dead King, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this all plays out, but I'm still really unconvinced by this whole plan. Cat talks about how she thinks this is safe because of two reasons, the heroes and her leverage. I'm not sure either can really be relied upon.

For the latter we have the doubt that Akua is raising, and for the former we've seen how the heroes in the Crusade went. They barely managed to match up to the Woe. Cat proved she was a match for ten junior heroes at once, and Archer held up against the Saint (who couldn't kill Nauk when given a chance). I mean, the heroes in total only managed a stalemate against Callow when they had double the number of soldiers /and/ both Cat and Masego were out of it for three days.

What are they going to do against the Dead King?
