Presumably they're hoping that the full might of the crusade might fall upon the Dead King, rather than the fraction that was going after Cat's armies. There were the armies attacking the Vales, too, and I think more are due to land (they are, at least, raiding Praes right now).

That said, given that the Dead King has repelled /intact/ crusades in the past, I would assume that a crusade crippled by their campaigns elsewhere and split up significantly would at the very least lose a lot of ground before Above could salvage the situation.
