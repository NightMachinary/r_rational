The heroes invading Callow via the Stairway were matched by the Woe because it makes for a much better story. The close calls, the struggle of nearly-matched opponents, etc. And Catherine was doing her best to frame the narrative of that battle as a hostile, invading army rather than the heroic liberators freeing Callow from the yoke of Evil.

The heroes are still very much leverage against the Dead King, especially if the Dead King attempts to cross the Proceran border. The "junior heroes", as you call them, will lose their incompetence overnight. They'll do some soul-searching, both literal and figurative. And then they'll declare in one voice, "Let's get dangerous!"

EDIT: In fact, their defeat at the hands of the Woe makes the Let's Get Dangerous trope even more effective. The entire Battle of Two Camps may have occured simply as the narrative prerequisite for powering up against the Dead King.
