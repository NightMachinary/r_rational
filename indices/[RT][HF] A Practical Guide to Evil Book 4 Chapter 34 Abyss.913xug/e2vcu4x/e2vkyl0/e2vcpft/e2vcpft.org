Oh dear, muted alarm bells ringing in my head.

Dead King is somehow /still/ very paranoid about his visitors. I would've thought he might have made a statement about their inability to hurt him by being physically present, but he chose not to. Is he really vulnerable then? Or is it simply a leftover paranoia from when he was human?
