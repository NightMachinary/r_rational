This Place recently made a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MRHcYtZjFY][Youtube video]] that's decently short (20 minutes) but goes into great and fairly engaging detail about how science works, and what's more, how rational beliefs and a rational epistemology are justified. It probably doesn't say anything new to anyone here, but if you ever meet someone that you want to introduce to concepts like "what is science" or "why science is great," it's a good video for that.
