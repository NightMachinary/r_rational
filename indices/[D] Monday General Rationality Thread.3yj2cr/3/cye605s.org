I've been watching [[http://bxrme.tumblr.com/tagged/the-genius][The Genius]] after a friend recommended it to me. Loving it so far, it's a Korean reality TV show without all the drama and nonsense and with lots of plotting and interesting games instead. Still a lot of your usual filler but that's easy enough to skip through. Reminded me a bit of HPMOR's army battles.
