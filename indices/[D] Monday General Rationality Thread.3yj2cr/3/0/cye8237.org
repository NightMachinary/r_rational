Ah, someone made Liar Game the TV Show, huh?

First game, I'm disappointed that they're not doing the obvious thing (gain the maximum points via cooperation, use randomization or threat of future punishment to keep people honest). All that talk about making the producers feel regret was, in fact, probably just prompted by the producers.
