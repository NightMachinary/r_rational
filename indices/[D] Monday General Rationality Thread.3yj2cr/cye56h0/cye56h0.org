I'd like to introduce a term adjacent to taboo tradeoff: taboo analysis. A taboo tradeoff is taboo because it trades sacred values for non-sacred ones. A taboo analysis is taboo because it analyzes sacred values through a non-sacred lens. In effect, people are offended that you have tried to claim their terminal values are not terminal values, but the result of other terminal values, because this implies you could theoretically trade them off.
