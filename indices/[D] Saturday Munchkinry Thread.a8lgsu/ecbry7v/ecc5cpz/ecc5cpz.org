Set up mass production of X, where X is a small, docile, easy to transport animal. Then any good citizen can kill a X to record a moment in time (plus 5 seconds audio). Use tiny writings on the tapestry to copy books this way. We'll call this a leaf. Collect the leaves in one place, put labels and descriptions on them, murder another X. Collect those Xs as well and so on and so on, forming a giant graph, which is directed and cycle-free. To create a simple reference to the content of a node, simply murder a new X next to them. This should allow you to send information across long distances as well (by murdering a new X whenever the last corpse rots), and to make backups.

Demonstrate your ability to use the Memento Mortem, and write some sci-fi books on how to revive people from minimal information. Who knows what potential future Memento Mortems will be able to do... Sell the idea to rich people and let them sponsor your X-farms.

Make sure the Memento Mortem is protected by the state in a secure place. Optimally you'll still have access to it, but perhaps there are people more skilled at using it. Don't let anyone who might break it near the device. Maximize its lifetime, even if it means sacrificing its usefulness at the moment.

Also, try to figure out where the Memento Mortem comes from. Constantly let someone murder Xs in its proximity to record any subtle changes. If possible (not sure if any living animal can be used as equipment/clothing), murder them inside a space-time-sphere for even more documentation.

Before delving into the graph, record and add your current goal. It might take some time to figure out the mystery you are looking for, and this ought to help with that.

I've considered how to get infinite computational power, but without actually interacting with the frozen objects you only got your own memory, your current position in the frozen sphere, and the path you have taken inside the graph. Latter two are an neglectible amount of data, and the first one isn't enough to do the work of a computer / someone with pen and paper. So the Memento Mortem should only be useful for thinking about "relatively simple" tasks using infinite time.

If a murder occurs let them kill a X at the scene and send it to you with the next update of your local graph-node. I believe that dead X can travel faster than a human, and that requiring a Memento Mortem is good enough encryption as not to violate privacy. This might not be the case for point 4.
