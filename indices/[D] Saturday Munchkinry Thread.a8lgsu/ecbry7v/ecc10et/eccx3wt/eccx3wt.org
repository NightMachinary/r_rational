I'd expect the same techniques from your (1) to work for sleeping too. It'd be really weird if whatever chemical changes to your brain created by learning are preserved but not the ones from sleep. (Then again it's magic, it can work however it wants, but that's not an excuse not to check.) Bring a sleeping bag if time-frozen furniture is uncomfortable. There's an extra 8 hours a day, plus the ability to rest up and collect your thoughts whenever you want.

There's also physical science to be examined using time stops. Anything someone currently studies with a high speed camera can be studied in more depth by killing some mice at the right moment. You can't do fundamental physics research in the bubble because it's clearly futzing with the rules for at least light propagation (I mean, that'd still be interesting science to do, but you'd be learning about magic-physics instead of regular-physics), but I expect there's something in engineering, medical, or biomechanical research that would save enough lives to be worth killing mice for. Structural engineers looking at the exact way a stress fracture propagates?

Finally, because you can use the Memento Mortem recursively, if you have any of these uses that require cleverly chosen corpses and moments of death, you can preserve all of them into an index by getting a bunch of corpses in one spot and sacrificing an animal (which you preserve traditionally until it's getting musty, then chain in a new animal). You can make an index of indices. In fact, for (2) an the local morgue can sacrifice a mouse every so often and later add them all to a huge index of every death that's passed through there.
