The reset strongly limits things - You can only carry memory back out, which means, sure, you can carry a laptop in and do coding to the limit of your ability to tolerate solitude and fasting, but you are going to have to rewrite the end product from memory. Which means the killer app is.. studying, since what you want from that is to stuff things into your memory.
