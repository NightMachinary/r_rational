how do mirrors work? if mirrors from the sphere reflect stuff outside then something that would help detectives is if every one went around wearing stupid amounts of reflective clothing.

or if it worked within the rules (which this is a stretch) then detectives could bring mirrors in to see outside the allotted range (though if your eyes cant see out of it then i dont see why a mirror could).

something murderers could do is make there crime scenes incredibly dangerous to investigate. spider webs are harmless but if you accidentally walked through a time frozen one you would probably be cut in half before you realized what happened, though you would just leave before you would die. murderers shooting off confetti canons will stop investigators from walking around. or you could try to be deviouse and use something hard to see like hairs or whatever the smallest piece of dust would have to be for you to not be able to move it. another way to attack people investigating would be powerful fuck off lazers. not that you need to harm the detectives, allot of bright lights could blind detectives and stop them from seeing in the crime scene bubble (though some goggles to dampen light would fix that).

just spit balling a few more ideas here but if you spray painted the air would it stick to dust particles and such to show you where vacuums are (that someone has recently been). or if you could use a corpse to disappear for a few seconds (away from authority's or murderer's?), - not sure what good 2 seconds is though.

easiest and most obviouse way id use this is kill a chicken within range of a chicken corpse, bring a weeks worth of food and a laptop with a terabyte of learning material, maybe some instruments and spend my free decade inside learning, using up only 2 seconds of my life span. or forget being a robot bring a few terrabytes filled with shows/books/comics and do it again. if someone said i could spend a decade doing either of those things and it wouldnt effect anything else you'd have to wait 2 seconds for my answer.
