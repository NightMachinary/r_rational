One thing before munchkinnery; the third paragraph says you are interested in what a pewter twinborn compounder can do, which I think is a typo.

Anyway, the allomancy can be used in a strange way to generate negentropy if used in the far future. If you stored a single consciousness inside a massive structure like a Matrioshka brain, and deliberately made it inefficient by making it take a lot of energy to simulate, say, anger, then by soothing that anger you can create a massive energy gap that will mean more heat flows to the point where the anger is simulated. That's a really awkward way of doing things, but it works, since it's one mind. Theoretically, if sapience allows the allomancer to increase the dampening if the target is more intelligent than a human, then the process could be even better.

As for less far flung things, (for a definition of that) the fact that 'feelings' are so vague might mean that you could dampen really esoteric things to communicate silently. As an example, I might discuss with my companion that dampening their feeling of heat in their left big toe means 'Danger!', while dampening in their right big toe means 'I'm bluffing'. You could do this with less esoteric things, but this would be the way to do it with the least amount of knock-on effects, I believe.

There is the obvious benefit with allomancy that you essentially have an objective test of sapience, if you can detect the ease of numbing a mind's emotions. This would be useful for AI, and also making sure that we haven't accidently been committing murder of sapient minds in animal testing.

A feruchemist could use lemon juice or urine based invisible ink without having to have access to a portable heater. This could have an (admittedly niche) use during covert operations. They can use it by raising their body temperature until it starts to show.

A feruchemist could temperature sensors fixed on their body to wordlessly and motionlessly trigger various weapons and devices, which could be useful if they are caught in a 'Do anything and I shoot you' situation.

I'm starting to think that a bronze feruchemist could be really good at stealth operations, as another use of the ability is making their heat signiture without fancy gadgets, rendering them near immune to IR detection.

That's all I have for now - at first I thought bronze feruchemy wouldn't be very useful, but this exercise had given me something to think about. Also, the idea of a spy in bronze plate seems hilarious to me, even if they probably wouldn't wear exactly that if it turned out to be useful.
