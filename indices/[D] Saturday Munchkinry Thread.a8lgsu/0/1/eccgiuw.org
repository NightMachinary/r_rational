Why, make a zombie army of course. Having one person Sooth away people's feeling of volition while another does more intensive emotional editting would get rid of the downside of "be able to be fought against". As any major depressive or schizophrenic person could tell you, it's /really hard/ to care that you're currently e.g. literally starving if you're in the throws of avolition.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Serpent_and_the_Rainbow_(book][Hoodoo zombi]]) are maybe-real, but were very intensive to make due to having to induce ego death and delirium chemically and killing people due to high variance in toxicity of datura root. If you can just tamp down someone's willpower, self of self, feeling of resistance, self regard, etcetera etcetera for a week and feed them propaganda through it, you can probably make an army.

I'd just test limits and see what you can do, tbh. "Emotions" is a really broad category. It sounds like it's be something like "external force changing your mind", but "loyalty" is a more passive state of mind. I'd try more esoteric things, like "self-possession" or "comprehension" and see if those work - if you feel less self-possessed then you'd be off balance and vicious circle down to feeling completely out of control, hopefully having a panic attack, while if you lose the feeling of comprehension of what's going on you might start self-doubting and vicious circle down, even if you intellectually understand things still.

Something like soothing "self-doubt" sounds like it'd be pretty dangerous, since you could run around and get people to make bad decisions they would usually hedge against, with the same kind of self-rationalization for once you stop. Depending on the range of soothing, you could influence heads of state, or else just sweep people in poker.

You could become the best mental hospital orderly ever seen, or provide suppression for drug cravings at a rehab. Sooth away mania, depression, psychosis, etc.

Alternatively, if you're on Earth, influence elections - politicians having bad emotional reactions or not being able to build up enthusiasm for a talking point on live TV would kill support very quickly, and debates or rallys are done in front of large audiences.
