*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 5: Brass*

Ok, week five of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is brass, the first of the mental metals. As always I'm interested in what a brass twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Brass allomancers are known as soothers. An allomancer burning brass can focus on a person or a group of people to reduce the intensity of (soothe) the emotions those people are feeling. Soothers can soothe away all emotions (in which case the target feels nothing but an oppressive numbness clouding their mind) or pick one or more individual emotions to soothe away.

What counts as an emotion for Allomancy is fairly broad, it includes things like fear, anger and happiness, but also hunger, pride, feelings of loyalty and even someone's sense of fatigue. Note that soothing the sensation of hunger or fatigue is purely a mental effect, it doesn't make the physical effects of exhaustion/starvation go away, it just makes it easier for the target to ignore those effects for a while.

This ability is not mind control, brass allomancers have to be subtle if they want to use their abilities to influence unwilling targets. Emotions can be dampened, but not fully taken away and once someone catches on that you are playing with their emotions it is fairly easy for them to resist it (you can numb their anger/indignation at being messed with, but a person can summon more anger than you can soothe away).

While brass does not allow you to increase the intensity of emotions, skilful allomancers can achieve a similar effect by soothing away all emotions except the one they want their target to focus on. If you want someone to be scared, for instance, you could soothe away whatever other emotions are currently vying for their attention to make the fear they are naturally feeling stand out more.

One other thing that perhaps goes without saying, but while the effects of allomancy are temporary, you can still use it to influence what people are thinking in the long run. For instance, if you want someone to not freak out about some new piece of information, you can soothe away their fear and anger while you tell them about it. Then once they remember the conversation after the allomantic effects have worn off, they will remember being pretty blasé about it and (depending on the person in question) the brain's desire for consistency might kick in and justify their reaction by make up some kind of reason why it wasn't that big of a deal.

The maximum number of people you can influence at a time is dependent on your skill as an allomancer, but a rough upper bound might be a large room full of people. You do not strictly need line of sight to your targets, but it does make it easier.

Any aluminium placed between your center of mass and the targets head prevents you from targeting their emotions and extremely strong emotions in the target can interfere with (though not outright block) your abilities. Non-humans are susceptible to soothing to an extent directly proportional to their level of sapience (so you're not going to soothe an ant, but you might be able to soothe a gorilla or a dolphin or even a particularly smart dog).

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemic brass allows you to store heat. When storing heat, the feruchemists body cools down and when tapping heat the feruchemists body warms up. This ability allows the feruchemist to exists comfortably across a wide range of temperatures, a feruchemist with enough heat stored can walk naked through a blizzard without freezing to death and (with enough unfilled brass) run through a desert in thick clothing without breaking a sweat.

In both of those examples the feruchemist maintains a body temperature of 37 °C and simply siphons of the excess heat/cold, but brass also allows a feruchemist to raise or lower their body temperature to beyond what a human body can normally function under. There are limits to this though, a feruchemist storing heat can drop their body temperature to roughly 0 °C before the effects of hypothermia set in and when tapping heat they can reach temperatures of around 200 °C before they start burning themselves.

Note that these numbers are the upper limits before physical damage starts to happen, the feruchemist is going to feel pretty miserable long before that.

While feruchemy does not make one immune to heat and cold in excess of your body temperature, heating up your body to above the ambient temperature does, by virtue of thermodynamics, mean that you are not getting any warmer (and vice versa for cold).

A brass feruchemist thus has two ways of dealing with extreme heat: either raising their body temperature above the ambient temperature or storing away the incoming heat to keep their body at a reasonable temperature. The latter tactic is much more comfortable for the feruchemist, but only really works when dealing with moderate, ambient heat because feruchemy always works on the entire body at once. In order to not burn your hands when putting them in boiling water you'd have to store about 50 °C, which means the temperature in the rest of your body also drops by 50 °C (which kills you).
