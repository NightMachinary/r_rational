What happens if you burn the wood and someone breathes the product? Do they die horribly of transfiguration sickness?.

If that doesn't happen you can use it to get unlimited fuel basically.

Also you can transport stuff by creating things near it so the pressure pushes them.

And cut stuff, assuming you can make thin sheets of iron or glass. (you could cut and process trees whith this for example)

Also a few questions :

How far can you make the batches appear?

How fast?

How much pressure can the object assert ?

Depending on the answers I see multiple ways of making wmd.
