Like with tin, I had to fill in some of the gaps on how feruchemic brass actually works in order to make it specific enough for this thread. Like before, I don't think anything up here contradicts canon/WoB, but due to time constraints I didn't dig in as deep as I did with tin, so apologies if I missed anything.

There are a bunch of IRL obligations coming up so I suspect I will be skipping the next week or two and come back in the second week of the new year with the next metal: zinc.
