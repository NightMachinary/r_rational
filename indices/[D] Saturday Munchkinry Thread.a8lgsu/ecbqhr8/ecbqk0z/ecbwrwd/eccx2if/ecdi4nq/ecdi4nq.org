  is there precedent for controlling more specific emotions like that?

You could soothe away suspicion, which would make the target more likely to believe you are not bluffing. Maybe soothe away nervousness and fear to make them believe you are bluffing (depending on what exactly you're bluffing about)?

#+begin_quote
  not that heat storage and emotional dampening would compound like that, im presuming its the rules of compounding in general
#+end_quote

Unfortunately you can't use compounding to enhance your allomancy, all compounding does is give you a limitless supply of feruchemically stored attributes.

In fact, burning a feruchemically charged bit of metal does not even give you its allomantic effect at all. Burning a piece of brass with heat stored gives you (more) heat back, it doesn't let you soothe emotions.

Also, minor nitpick: brass is the metal that lets you store heat/dampen emotions, bronze does something else.

  with the fighting entropy thing all of the powers have had good ability there, and instead of hooking someone up to a neg entropy engine you could store and release heat/cold in place A-place B and you have an easy displacement going on. with the benefit that your not limited by how much brass to burn or how much heat(or whatever your converting to emotion) there is in the universe.

Yup, brass is definitely one of the more straightforward negentropy generating powers in feruchemy's arsenal, but keep in mind that you can only heat yourself to around 200Â°C. I suspect you'd have to do some pretty clever tricks to counteract significant amounts of entropy that way.
