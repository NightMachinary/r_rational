  the third paragraph says you are interested in what a pewter twinborn compounder can do, which I think is a typo.
#+end_quote

Whoops, corrected now. Thanks!

  If you stored a single consciousness inside a massive structure like a Matrioshka brain, and deliberately made it inefficient by making it take a lot of energy to simulate, say, anger, then by soothing that anger you can create a massive energy gap that will mean more heat flows to the point where the anger is simulated.

Ooh, this is very clever. I like it.

  As for less far flung things, (for a definition of that) the fact that 'feelings' are so vague might mean that you could dampen really esoteric things to communicate silently.
#+end_quote

I think your example here is a little too esoteric, but soothing away hunger -> 'Danger', soothing away fatigue -> 'I'm bluffing' should work. With practice you can probably distinguish a pretty wide scala of emotions, especially if the soother is deliberately trying to not be subtle about it.

  There is the obvious benefit with allomancy that you essentially have an objective test of sapience,
#+end_quote

I thought about this too, but the trick is figuring out a way to objectively test to what extent emotions are being soothed. Sapience is gradient, not an on/off switch (at least it is in the cosmere universe apparently), so you'd have to be able to quantify to what extent two differently designed brains are experiencing an emotion. Seems like that would be tricky.

  A feruchemist could temperature sensors fixed on their body to wordlessly and motionlessly trigger various weapons and devices
#+end_quote

Remember that you can't heat up specific parts of your body, so all you'd be able to send to the sensors is a single number (and even then you'd be limited by the precision with which you can tap and store heat). You could still do things like "Raise temp to 40°C then drop temp to 30 °C -> detonate explosives", so it isn't that big of a deal, but it will reduce the speed at which you can send triggers.

  another use of the ability is making their heat signiture without fancy gadgets, rendering them near immune to IR detection.
#+end_quote

Neat! Yeah, that would absolutely work.
