reworking your silent communications thing instead of making "your big toe going numb means im bluffing" you could make someone you want to know your bluffing feel like your bluffing -is there precedent for controlling more specific emotions like that?- tell them if they have a hunch or feeling for something your doing then theyre right.

with the 'zombies' a benefit of emotional control over them instead of the ?real? method is that they could still do complex tasks. and if you dampen all of there feelings beside the ones for the task your doing and theyll do it whole heartedly, maybe making them even better than when they were normal. and for a compounder they shouldnt be hard to make - if burning brass with stored heat in it makes your allomancy power stronger then you could dampen any aversion they have to you brass them, and bronze them harder (not that heat storage and emotional dampening would compound like that, im presuming its the rules of compounding in general).

edit- noticed the zombie army thing is from another commenter, not you.

edit 2- changed bronze to brass thx

with the fighting entropy thing all of the powers have had good ability there, and instead of hooking someone up to a neg entropy engine you could store and release heat/cold in place A-place B and you have an easy displacement going on. with the benefit that your not limited by how much brass to burn or how much heat(or whatever your converting to emotion) there is in the universe.
