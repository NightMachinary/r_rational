A brass feruchemist can counter negentropy on their own by consistently charging in one place and discharging in another. They wouldn't be able to produce much negentropy on their own, but sufficient advances in biological engineering should make it possible to make massive implants which count as parts of their body, massively increasing the amount of energy they can move.

If you have one full Feruchemist you could use them and an orbiting loop of brass baubles to do this without moving the Feruchemist. Aluminum lets you store identity, and if a Feruchemist stores all of their identity while storing another attribute, the resulting metalmind will be usable by anyone. So, put the heavily modified Feruchemist with a huge body on one side of the last black hole, put a bunch of people on the other, an orbiting ring of countless brass beads between them, and you will create a radiative wind accross the black hole, which could be harvested the same way you would harvest any other black hole.
