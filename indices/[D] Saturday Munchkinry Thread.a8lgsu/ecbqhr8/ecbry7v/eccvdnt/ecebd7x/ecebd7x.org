You can create matter out of nothing from this list: rock, stone, wood, clay, iron, and glass. The matter disappears after an hour. You can create batches between 1-5 kg at a time and the batch must be connected. You can't create matter inside a solid object though if you create it within an empty area it doesn't fit(such as between your palm and the wall) it will assert pressure onto the surrounding area to try to create such space. You can only create very simple shapes. After you have created the matter it will follow the natural rules of physics and you have no more control. Matter are created with a velocity of 0 with respect to your current position and at a temperature that matches the surrounding temperature.

Setting is medieval.

I haven't really found any utility uses for this power. Offensive uses basicly boils down to creating something in front of someone when they are running, creating an iron lump over their head or inside their mouth/nose. Ideas? I was really hoping for something that could be used to generate coin but I'm commin up short.
