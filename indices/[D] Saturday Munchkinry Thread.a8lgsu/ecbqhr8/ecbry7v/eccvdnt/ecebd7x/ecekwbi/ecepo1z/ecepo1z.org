  What happens if you burn the wood and someone breathes the product? Do they die horribly of transfiguration sickness?.
#+end_quote

Yes. I guess I should be ashamed of not thinking about that offensive use after reading hpmor.

  How far can you make the batches appear?
#+end_quote

10 meter.

#+begin_quote
  How fast?
#+end_quote

5 seconds though you get exhausted after one use and really exhausted after 2.

#+begin_quote
  How much pressure can the object assert ?
#+end_quote

As much as it can without bending/breaking. Ie. a glass thing under a heavy rock would break the glass though maybe not if it was iron.
