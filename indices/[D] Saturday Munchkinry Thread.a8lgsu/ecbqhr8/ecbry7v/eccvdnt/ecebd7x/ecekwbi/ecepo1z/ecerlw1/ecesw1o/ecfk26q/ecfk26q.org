Well 1 2 cm that still let's you do thigs like destroying buildings or fortifications by making things appear inside any hole on the walls.

Also you can lift a lot of weight by creating a iron platform under something. Or make a machine move. Basically you can push something whith as much force a lump of iron can wistand , which I guess is a lot. (maybe you could make some kind of machinery that uses that force to do stuff?,though it's going to be difficult if the setting doesn't have good gears and things like springs yet )

Can't think of concrete uses right now, but the fact the material dissapears, apart from being potentially letal if it's inside someone's body, could be really usefull. Break buildings in ways that will cause them to collapse after a while, set something to fall after 1 hour etc. Also depending on what shapes you can do you have any simple tool you want.

A lot of uses depend a lot on the situation you are in. Like you might need to create an improvised boat for example.
