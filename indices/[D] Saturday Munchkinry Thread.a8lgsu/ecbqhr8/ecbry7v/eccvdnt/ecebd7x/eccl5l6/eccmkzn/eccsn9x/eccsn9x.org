Alright, the task is to find an optimal character build for the following product of r/ nsfwcyoa, [[https://imgur.com/a/Aio07IG][Divine Trials]].

Basically, you're thrown into some another world along with whatever penalties, boons, magic powers, physical powers, special items, and companions you purchase with your points, and you've got to "kill or capture all threats" against a goddess who also gets to select a wide range of nasty things to throw at you.

Notable details: It's heavily implied that the only reason you have a chance at winning is due to the expansive "take a penalty for extra points" section, which wasn't present on any previous iteration, and the baseline 750 points you get at the start results in "no victors in living memory, which for a god, is quite a long time". So it can be safely assumed that you're up against some pretty nasty competition, and apparently completing the trial in the span of 100 years is considered quite fast, almost time-attack mode.

There's one specific exploit for (finitely many) free points, namely combining the "Sleepy" penalty for +40 points in exchange for spending 2 extra hours asleep per day, and the "Relentless" boon for -35 points, which cuts your sleep time (as well as all other physical needs) in half. Making the worst-case assumption that "Relentless" applies first before "Sleepy", that's 50 free points from applying Relentless twice, and Sleepy 3 times.

I think there's a few further tricks to be found, but I don't want to anchor readers /too/ heavily on my current plan, there's probably plenty of exploits I missed. I suspect that taking a broad macro-level view of where the points are going will lead sufficiently smart character-builders to a convergent general strategy, but I'll have to see if anyone else picks it up.

Note that a green crystal denotes something you can buy multiple times, and a blue crystal denotes boons which apply to any team members you want, instead of just yourself.

In 48 hours, I'll post my build.
