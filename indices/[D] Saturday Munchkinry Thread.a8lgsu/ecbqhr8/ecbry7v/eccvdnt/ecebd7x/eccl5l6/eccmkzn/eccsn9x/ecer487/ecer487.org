Like most CYOA's there's enough egregious exploits here that the rest of your build doesn't matter much, though given how easy it is to get points in this CYOA (lots of manageable drawbacks) you can certainly take all of these:

- /Grand Theft Waifu/ and /Waifu/ like most powers of this sort are broken because even if the powers/superintelligence of anybody you summon with this may be nerfed you can still summon people with truly staggering amounts of exploitable knowledge including tech knowledge. If you're in a world which already has moderate tech this means by summoning some loyal entity who previously had near omniscience you can have them kick off a singularity potentially within the week (by messing with biotech in all likelihood, since that lets you piggyback on life in order to create your first generation of self replicating nanites). The actual celebrity waifu option has the same exploit since you can alter their mind (and thus add knowledge).

- /Technomancy/ is probably OP as well if you can make magitek AI or do brain augmenting cybernetics though it's hard to say exactly how exploitable it is given the scarce details given. Depending on specifics enchanting, verbal magic, ritual magic and many others may also have certain similar exploits but it's hard to say given the details available.

- /Biomancy/ should be super exploitable since it even lets you make changes no biologically possible. So it should be a simple matter to design microbes which assemble self replicating nanites or alternatively just start a biological based singularity if tech doesn't work right in your world.

- /Divination/ can be exploited in really obvious ways even given its inaccuracy over long timescales. Really the main hazard with using it is looking into the future to retrieve tech knowledge without going far enough to risk being manipulated by UFAI.

Of course those are just the exploits I was able to pick out that were egregious and obvious just skimming the text, I didn't look at companions but some of those may be brokenly OP as well.
