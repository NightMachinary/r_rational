Alright, here was my first-draft build (I didn't think of the /Divination/ or /Biomancy/ exploit, so it needs to be updated for that)

First consideration is what immortality method to go for. Obviously, /Cursed With Awesome/ would be taken, so we actually get two of them.

The ones to rule out: /Draft of Death/ is decent, but with a big “death of spirit” weak point. /Elixer of Life/ has the big flaw of massively boosting sensation, so it's a terrible choice against an enemy who's willing to torture you. /Cherub/, /Succubus/, /Ethereal/, /Blood and Bone/, and /Servant/ just make you hard to kill, not immortal. /Bound to the Pit/ is just a stupid one to select, and /Guardian/ means you've gotta enforce “balance” in order to be immortal, which is incompatible with long-range “good wins” plans.

/Shards of Mortality/ is the best one, it's basically a rate-limited horcrux. It leads to victory as long as you don't get killed more often than some limiting rate, because your soul can be repaired over time, and if you craft backup bodies, you won't have a problem. /Rebirth by Death/ is another extremely good one, and synergizes very well with /Shards of Mortality/ and a suicide method, except that it has a “captured for one year” failure condition. However, if you're captured for one year, the enemy can probably figure out some way of capturing your soul and destroying it, so it actually isn't doubling up on failure conditions as much as it looks like. Also, it's notable that the same benefits can be gained by just giving /one of your companions/ the /Rebirth by Death/ feat and instructing them to suicide when it looks like the situation is really bad and loss is imminent, freeing up one extra slot. I decided to make my second immortality method be /Cast off Humanity/ because the multi-purchase /Custom Robot/ in the item section gives me a bunch of backup bodies to start with if I get killed before I figure out how to make backup bodies, it grants free access to /HUD/ and /Technomancy/ which are both pretty useful, and the “any substance you wish from your former world” option opens the door to having a body made of extremely durable materials such as diamondoid, iridium, and various carbides, which should be able to take some pretty serious hits, as well as being flame and acid resistant. Obviously this forces Automaton as a race.
