Powers (on waifu team): /Pyromancy, Hydromancy, Geomancy, Aeromancy, Alacritomancy, Ferromancy, Arcanomancy, Fusion, Discord, Holy Magic, Black Magic, Telekinesis, Chronomancy, Summoning Magic, Telepathy, Druid Magic, Hemomancy, Necromancy/ (raising dead is really really really useful), /Alchemy, Enchanting, Golemancy/ (make backup bodies for everyone and also make loads of minions), /Gravity Magic, Blue Magic, Eromancy, Binding Magic, Bardic Magic, Biomancy, Destiny Magic, Divination, Illusion Magic, Shapeshifting, Subjugation Magic, Verbal Magic, Ritual Magic, Runic Magic, True Magic, Strength, Endurance, Dexterity, Charisma, Willpower, Intelligence, Luck, Ninja, Sorceror, Gambler, Survivor, Mimicry, Imbue, True Sight, Chakra, Infusion, Martial Forms, Feral Arsenal, Beast Mastery, Thievery, Rider, Sharpshooter, Bulwark, Nurture, Industry, Bargaining, Tactician, Aegis, Assassin, Herblore, Smithing, Stealth, Magic Resistance, Eroticism/

Powers (personally): /Ferromancy/ (I'm a robot, of course I need metal-manipulation abilities), /Arcanomancy/ (metamagic is a force-multiplier), /Chronomancy/ (teleportation is already high-value, and time-magic is even higher value, this lets you pull off stuff like the hyperbolic time chamber, ultra-rapid movement, time-freezing enemies you don't want to deal with a.t.m.... It's unbelievably exploitable and high-value), /Technomancy/ (see other discussion, also it was free), /Destiny Magic/ (probability-manipulation is also stupidly useful), /Charisma/ (I've got a charisma penalty due to being an automaton, and am already not that good at it, might as well buff that), /Intelligence/ (duh), /Tactician/ (they literally have “Be a Munchkin” as a selectable choice), /Technophile/ (needed to pair with technomancy), /Magic Resistance/ (very helpful)

Items Selected With Explanation: /Custom Robot x4/ (I need backup bodies) /Mystery Box Rolls x17/ (the mystery box is +EV, the deck isn't. I got a pretty good haul including the Portable Black Hole, Subtle Knife, Seven League Boots, and Lodestone Network. Just by the description, it should be clear why these are really good to draw, it's basically a god-stalling WMD, ability for any teammate to go to any world, fast travel, and teleportation network.) /Crown of Great Adversary/ is one of the few known god-killing weapons, seems good to have around in a very secure location. /Staff of Defilement/ is something to whip out when you know you're going to lose to screw over the enemy, especially because there's another copy of me out there ready to exploit the spell of bad luck it induces. /Draklor Laboratory/ seems like one of the few places that'll easily serve as a base for 40 people that isn't a fixer-upper. /Tear of the Moon/ is hella useful for the whole horcrux reincarnation thing. /Throne of Want/ is good for the appropriate waifu, and /Eye of Leviathan/ is repurposed to summoning fish for the 12x giant waifu team to eat, their total food needs are pretty high even after Relentless x2.

Items Selected Without Explanation: /Iron Chef, Tough Love, World History Vol 1, Bestiary, Magic for Dummies x10, Usidore's Tome, Cerulean Guardian, Multiversal Laptop, Tricky Ricky, Sanitation Distributor, Lover's Rings, Dragon's Hoard, Babylon's Bane, Emelia's Reprive, Axe of the Gigas, Lordly Robes, Second Skin, Homonculus, Doll Making Kit, Crystal Ball, Starting Kit, Herb Garden, Personal Symphony, Ward of Sacrifice/

Items not Selected Without Explanation: /Ultimate Attire, Hardlight Projector, Blood Diamond, Soylent Green, Sacrificial Lamb, Another Fucking Tank, Alethiometer/ (I'm genuinely unsure about this one) /Cloranthy Ring, Midnight Lost Child, Chalice of Yunnx/ (although this one might be exploitable to get poison, or have blood donations from a pure child), /Dragon's Egg, Homonculus's Aria, Swan Song, The Good Shephard, Spear of the False Martyr/, All armor except /Lordly Robes, Second Skin/, /Fountain of Youth, Lot 2195, Student Chambers, King's App, Hemlock and Nightshade, Telescope of Dreamer, Obelisk MK2, ATV, Creator's Tablet, Go Home Brush, Prosthetic Limbs/

World of choice is Lindblum.

Basically, just get a ton of them, the more the merrier, since they're so cheap.
