Agreed on Waifu, even besides the "summon someone with specific knowledge" exploit, there's a lot of other shenanigans you can get up to with it, such as /Buy In Bulk/+Giant character+Eye of Leviathan (to summon food, because even /Relentless x2/ doesn't cut down food needs that much. Now you have a team to gang up on big scary monsters). Idk about /Technomancy/ being quite that OP, /Golemancy/ seems quite a bit more relevant towards AI-making, and it seems implied that you've gotta build up the tech tree yourself. Regarding AI, you can probably also have one of the AI companions send you their own source code to have a baseline to start with of "AI that's human-level and not that inclined to take over the world".

Putting /Biomancy/ and /Divination/ to one side for now, there's something I wanted to talk about that'll probably put a damper on your plans.

I don't think the gods are able to create a waifu that knows stuff that /they/ don't know, and the fact that Schierke has "start the singularity" as a quest for you (as well as the ridiculously human robots running around) seems to strongly imply that neither Schierke (nor any of the gods) know what to code to get a strongly superhuman AI, because if they wanted a singularity and they knew that information, they could just go to a computer and type in the code. Therefore, detailed information about starting a singularity, how to assemble self-replicating nanites, and such, will probably not be available and you'll have to figure out how to do it safely from scratch. There's also the issue where you really don't want to be doing this research around spectators, as the gods that are helping you out on this don't exactly seem reliable enough to entrust such knowledge to. It also seems to imply that there's this weird barrier around human-level in AI in this story.

You should still be able to do some trick like "my waifu is 300 years old from a long-lived race and has had [how to build the entire tech tree of my civilization from scratch] as a special interest this whole time", though, that knowledge doesn't seem intrinsically off-limits, and the same sort of trick also means you don't have to buy a bunch of volumes of /Magic For Dummies/.

So I think you're going to have to clean up the trial /without/ strong AI or nano-stuff (although there's still a lot of exploits with /Biomancy/, like creating a gene-drive version of [evil monster race you want to wipe out]), and do the research for those things on your own time after the trial is cleaned up and you're a deity.

Similarly, since they said that the maximum reliable lookahead on /Divination/ is about a month, and actually probably closer to a few days, the "look a few weeks ahead, copy down what future-you is writing on the paper" trick seems like it'd just be unreliable if you look too far ahead. Also the unreliability of far-lookahead might put a damper on getting future-tech-knowledge. It can still basically be used as an NP-oracle for small-ish spaces, though. If the failure probability for a 1-day divination is, say, 1/100, then if you want to check less than 100 things for property X, and it takes less than a day to check a thing for the property, then with high probability you'll divine the proper thing, check it, and it will indeed have property X. (this assumes it's a promise problem where you know just that something has the property, not which thing it is.)
