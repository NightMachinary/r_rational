Drawbacks With Explanations (Taken): Assuming a massive benefit to winning the trial (I'd become a god), taking drawbacks that make the surrounding world kinda suck to live in in exchange for a small increase in probability of winning makes sense, so that means a lot of the sex-based ones are selected. Namely /Cruel and Unusual/, /In the Hole/, /Breeding Program/, /Evolving Flora/, /Girl Power/, /Furries Suck/, /Communal Property/, /Cultic Conversion/, /Game Over/, /World of Whorecraft/, and /Sex Sells/. Also, regarding the “new enemy” drawbacks, based on the fact that Valeria says that she's got a very long list of dangerous foes to pick from, adding /Public Menace/, /Soulmate/, /The Spirit/, /The Broker/, /Wrong Genre Buddy/ and /The Bitch/ to the mix doesn't really make my job that much harder on the margin. /Yandere Generator/ is actually a pretty good pick, a 1/100,000 chance of yandere is actually surprisingly low and is unlikely to fire during the trial if I'm not interacting with really large crowds. /Pre-Determined Event/ is worth a lot of points and can be cheesed by intentionally suiciding at 100 years and reincarnating in a new body. /Oh Look It's Hitler/ can be overcome if you've got the ability to change your appearance, which I do. /Chessmaster/ seems like a bad one to pick, but I'm already going for an extremely teammate-heavy build, so it seems like a natural one to pick up if I'm going that way. /Gated/ is cheesable with the /Lover's Rings/, you just need one person to stay back with a ring, and everyone near me to wear a ring, and when we go missing at one year's time, the person staying back shatters a ring to instantly negate the gating. Also, if I can get teleportation for me and everyone around me, it no longer requires a ring sacrifice and is immediately fixable. /Cold Blooded/ is completely redundant if I'm an automaton, robots don't need to worry about having their core body temperature get too cold. Controversially, I took 2 of /Retard/, for -20 IQ points. The basic reasoning behind this was that, because Automatons have +intelligence, and I'll also be taking /Intelligence/ as a power, and starting from my current state, I'd be smart enough afterwards that I could lose 20 IQ without critically compromising the mission.

Taken Drawbacks Without Explanations: These just look straightforwardly sensible. /Infertile/, /No Way Home/, /Involuntary Lolicon/, /Envy/ /Sleepy/ (already explained why this works), /Senseless/ (give up sense of smell), /Tulpa/, /Dwarf Fever/, /Gender Bender/, /Karma Farmer/, /Weaboo x4/, /Clingy/, /Tally Ho/, /Mental Break/, /Same Shit/, /Drowning In Bliss/,

Untaken Drawbacks Without Explanations: These just look straight-up bad. /Fertile/, /Use Protection/, /Deviously Cursed Loot/, /Money Maker/, /Real Casual/, /Just a Dweam/, /Fugly/, /All Business/, /Exhibitionism/, /Alcoholism/, /Fetish Bait/, /Congratulations!/, /Armless/, /Just Die/, /Loner/, /Missionary/, /Easily Bound/, /Wuss/, /Heal Slut/ (actually, I just realized that since I can't fight directly due to taking Chessmaster, this one might make sense to pick), /Come Home Moon Man/, /Shivers/, /On My Own/ (might actually be viable due to taking Chessmaster and not fighting directly), /Mixed Signals/, /Quick Fire Round/, /LAAAAAAW/, /Limiter/, /Narcolepsy/, /Better to have Loved/ (might be cheesable with Shards of Mortality and reincarnation), /Lightning Rod/, /Spaz/, /Eye Catcher/

Untaken Drawbacks With Explanations: /Demon Queen/ seems a bit risky, and /The Ringer/ is damn-near suicidal to pick, 90 anima is not enough to run the risk of drawing someone near-or-exceeding my level of munchkining. /Heartless/ seems like a terrible drawback to take if I want to be a god, along with /Deadly as Sin/. /Consistent Fuckup/, /Wolverine/, and /Hothead/ are all just terrible choices to have, good decision-making is a superpower. /Parasite Pal/ also seems to fall under this, although it seems more surmountable there. I'm also unsure of how it'd play out if you're playing an automaton. /True Name/ means you've got a huge information leak problem if you've got a simple first name. /Insubordination/ is another terrible one to pick if you're playing a very teammate-heavy build. /Mana Transfer/ is iffy but was rejected because it means I don't get mana if I'm alone, and shortly-after-reincarnating-in-hidden-location is a time when I'm alone and I /really/ need the mana. /Challenge Run/ is a bad choice if you're going for a magic-heavy “crack the secrets of the universe” approach to the trial. /Slow Start/ looks good, but the sex-based drawbacks are a lot more brutal on a mere mortal than someone with a bunch of powers, so that's not going to be a fun first year. /Alternate Start/ is just a bad choice because I don't think all “small groups of companions” are capable of avoiding death until they figure out where on the entire planet the base is, especially since we'll be pretty paranoid about preventing information leaks. The start of the trial is the most vulnerable part. /Magic Overhaul/ is something I don't want to take but I don't know why, and I get a mysterious sense of doom from /Free for All/.
