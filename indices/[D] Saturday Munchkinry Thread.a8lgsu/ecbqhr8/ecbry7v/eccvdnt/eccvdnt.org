Vim is the force of creation and can be used to conjure objects or heat them. Nix is the force of uncreation and can be used to vanish objects or cool them. Both can be used to telekinetically move objects around or to infuse matter.

Infusion: - Transfers vim or nix into matter for storage. - Stored vim or nix has a one hour half life, except for crystals which have a one year half life. - Matter infused with vim can't be directly affected by nix and vice-versa. - Vim-infused matter can be de-infused by spending 10x the vim in nix and vice versa.

Limitations:

/Specificity:/ You can only conjure or vanish one compound at a time. For example, you could conjure salt (NaCl) but not a bag of french fries to go with it.

/Comprehension:/ You have to know the bonds in the conjured molecule as well as the molecule's shape. Magicians study a lot of chemistry.

/Conservation:/ Mass and energy are both conserved. Conjuring objects gathers atoms from nearby. Vanishing them disperses the atoms over the same area. Heating draws energy from nearby. Cooling disperses that heat.

/Displacement:/ Conjured objects displace the matter around them. Vanished objects leave a vacuum.

/Elements:/ Conjuring or vanishing compounds with more elements takes exponentially longer.

/Pathing:/ You have to specify a path from the vim/nix source to the target point. Paths for nix can't go through matter infused with vim. Paths for vim can't go through matter infused with nix. Spells with longer paths cost more to cast. Five meters is a normal casting range. Shorter paths cost much, much less, up to 1/100th at a few centimeters.

/Targeting:/ You can increase the precision of targeting conjuration, vanishing, etc, but as the precision goes below 1cm the cost approaches infinity rapidly. A precision of 1mm costs 10x, 0.1mm is 1000x.

/Whole:/ You can only conjure or vanish entire objects. An "object" is a group of identical bonded molecules. For example, a layer of oil between two sheets of steel could be vanished, but two separate pockets of oil inside a steel block couldn't (though you could vanish them separately).

The average magician can channel 6000 units of vim or nix per second, enough to let them: - Conjure or vanish 0.5kg of matter, assuming the atoms are plentiful. The cost increases if they aren't. - Apply 30kN of force. - Transfer 12kJ of energy from two objects that start at equal temperature. The cost increases if you're trying to cool a cold object or heat a hot one.

These rates are mutually exclusive. If you're conjuring half a kg of matter, you can't also push stuff around. Note also that these are the base rates. Spending all 6k units on force targeting a person a hundred meters away will result in less force than a light breeze because the path is so long.

Conjuration and vanishing doesn't happen all at once. You get the effects as you pay, growing outward from the targeted point. So, for example, if you conjured a large metal ball you would first see a small marble that swelled and grew until it was as big as you wanted. Or if you wanted to break into a padlocked room, you could start a vanishing on the hasp and wait until a cross-section had been vanished before stopping the spell.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. I've gone over this a couple times but there's probably something I'm missing. I've already got the obvious weaponized use of conjuration by putting a bullet in someone's head, but I'm more interested in techniques that would work against a fellow caster. I think it's inevitable that in any hard magic system the non-mages will just flat out lose to mages.

Edit: Oh, and the strain of channelling vim or nix gradually causes permanent insanity over decades of use.
