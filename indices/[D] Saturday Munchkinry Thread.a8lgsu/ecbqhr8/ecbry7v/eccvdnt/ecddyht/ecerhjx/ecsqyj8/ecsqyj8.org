If you can control which matter you use to conjure objects with vim, then you can do things like using a person's body to create a block of ice, killing them via dehydration. If you knew the right target element, like say carbon, you could summon it from somebody's flesh to effectively disintegrate them. It's basically using nix without the whole object restriction.

Even if you can't do this at any time and still need to set up specific conditions for it to work, it's still kinda powerful. Basically, if you can do this at all then the system breaks a bit.

You could solve this by saying, "using vim to conjure something draws from all matter on earth/in the universe at an equal spread, with an equal likelihood", which pretty much lets you do what you want about that exploit in a somewhat believable way.
