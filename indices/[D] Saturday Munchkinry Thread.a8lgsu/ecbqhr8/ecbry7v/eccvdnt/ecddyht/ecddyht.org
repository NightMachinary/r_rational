- What area are vanished objects dispersed over? And are compounds broken into their constituent elements? As an example, what does salt vanish into? Can you sneak into the basement of the building your enemy is in and just start vanishing loads of salt to disperse sodium metal and chlorine gas throughout the building?
- Can you infuse compressed gas with nix and then vanish it to create a (short-lived) vim-nullification zone?
- Also, it's interesting that telekinesis is limited by force rather than by energy output. With the right mechanism, you can pump theoretically infinite energy out of it. (The actual limits would be determined by material properties. Too extreme a gear ratio and you'll bust the gears apart.) Is the kinetic energy pulled out of the surroundings? That might be a faster way to cool things than using vim directly.
- It would be neat to weaponize the heat draw of vim-heating to flash freeze the area around the target, but the rates involved are too low for that to be an effective attack.That raises the question: If you have a lump of nix infused matter next to the target of vim-heating, does the heat get drawn from the nix matter, or is it shielded from that secondary effect?
