  What area are vanished objects dispersed over? And are compounds broken into their constituent elements? As an example, what does salt vanish into? Can you sneak into the basement of the building your enemy is in and just start vanishing loads of salt to disperse sodium metal and chlorine gas throughout the building?

Vanished objects get spread over a sphere centered on the cache several meters in radius and the compounds are broken into their elements. The salt trick won't work because the Na and Cl will mostly bond back with each other. If any Cl2 is formed, it'll react with Na to form NaCl again. Unfortunately, I don't know enough chemistry to say whether this is generally true or if it might be possible to weaponize with some other molecule.

Edit: Actually, you could just bring the bag of salt and conjure your Cl2 normally, so this is definitely a viable tactic.

  Can you infuse compressed gas with nix and then vanish it to create a (short-lived) vim-nullification zone?

Ooh that's clever.

  Also, it's interesting that telekinesis is limited by force rather than by energy output. With the right mechanism, you can pump theoretically infinite energy out of it. (The actual limits would be determined by material properties. Too extreme a gear ratio and you'll bust the gears apart.) Is the kinetic energy pulled out of the surroundings? That might be a faster way to cool things than using vim directly.

The telekinesis is the part I've paid the least attention to, mostly because it didn't seem quite so overpowered as the conjuration/vanishing aspect. Apparently that was a mistake. What's the difference between limiting by force vs limiting by energy output? I know you could drive a machine with vim/nix, but how would you get infinite energy from it, since the machine would halt as soon as the magician stopped channeling magic into it.

As for conservation, yes, but cooling wouldn't be very effective unless you wanted to affect a large area since nix could do it to a much higher degree of precision.

  It would be neat to weaponize the heat draw of vim-heating to flash freeze the area around the target, but the rates involved are too low for that to be an effective attack. That raises the question: If you have a lump of nix infused matter next to the target of vim-heating, does the heat get drawn from the nix matter, or is it shielded from that secondary effect?
#+end_quote

Yeah, the infusion will stop that, but it won't stop the natural loss of heat if the surroundings get cold.
