(1) Learning! Work or live somewhere with easy access to dead animals (if frozen counts as "relatively intact" I'd just have a freezer with a frozen 50cm^{2} piece of an animal killed in a suitable place to study), and spend 2 seconds reading, re-reading and reflecting on any amount of text you can reasonably bring with you using the 25kg limit. Might have a special set of pants with soft cushioning around the buttocks to sit comfortably on the time-frozen furniture.

It is unclear from your description if the pages in a book you brought with you could be turned, but its seems reasonable - presumable worn clothes deform to allow you to move around in the sphere, or you'd have to use the Memento Mortem naked.

(3) Always kill people from more than 10 meters to avoid visual identification is a good first step.

Also, pick a method of killing that prevents the victim from speaking, making signs or writing, and that at the same time takes as long as possible (at least over 5 seconds) before the brain activity shuts down, so that the details of the crime like direction of attack etc are not readily apparent.
