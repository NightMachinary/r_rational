The time-freeze aspect of this pocket watch kind of overwhelms everything else. Sure you could use the watch to find murderers, but that's a really mundane use of having an object that FREEZES TIME. I would spend all my time constantly entering such frozen time spaces so I can do all the thinking I need in there.

The fact that you can bring in items with you makes things even better, you can bring in video games for entertainment whenever you get bored, or a computer to help you calculate things and store all your thoughts. The fact that these objects are effectively memory wiped when you leave is a problem, but that just means you need to improve your memory. Or just make multiple trips, memorize one chunk of a story or proof you wrote at a time.

The only real problem is that you need constant access to corpses in order to abuse this frozen space-time. Can you just buy a whole duck (from a restaurant) and keep it frozen in your fridge forever? That's probably the easiest method if it works.
