Incredibly mild mechanical spoilers for /The Return of the Obra Dinn/ follow.

--------------

You have come into possession of the *Momento Mortem*, a magical object that looks like a wind-up pocket watch. This magic item has several properties:

- If you point it at a corpse, the hands of the pocket-watch will spin around to show the time of death.
- If you press the button on the top of the pocket-watch while it's pointed at a corpse, two effects happen:

  - You will hear five seconds of audio from the time and location where the person or animal died.
  - Following that, you will be transported to a sphere of frozen space-time roughly 10 meters wide, depicting the exact moment of death, centered on the corpse. You can move freely around this bubble of frozen space-time, though solid objects are still solid to you, and nothing can be moved. When you leave (requiring an act of will), two seconds will have passed, no matter how much time you spend looking around. If you find a corpse in this chunk of frozen time, you can recursively use the Momento Mortem to investigate it, resulting in being 'transported' to a new chunk of frozen time and hearing five seconds of audio.

- For the purposes of this prompt, 'time of death' will be assigned according to either destruction of the brain or cessation of brain activity.
- For the purposes of this prompt, 'corpse' is defined as any distinct piece of a dead member of a species of the animal kingdom larger than 50 cubic centimeters and relatively intact (e.g. the item won't work on a slurry made of different people, as they're not distinct, and won't work on a deer that's eaten a corpse, as it's not intact).
- You can bring in up to 25 kilograms of equipment and clothing into the slice of frozen time with you, but no changes to you or them will carry over to the real world when you exit, and interaction with the objects is in terms of light only, as they repel all touch.

Given the above, answer at least one of the below:

1. How do you use this item to satisfy your values?
2. How do you use this item to most effectively solve the most crimes?
3. If this item is in someone else's possession, what's your standard operating procedure to not get caught when you commit your murders?
4. If you live in a society which can produce more of this item on demand, what different laws would you make regarding it?
