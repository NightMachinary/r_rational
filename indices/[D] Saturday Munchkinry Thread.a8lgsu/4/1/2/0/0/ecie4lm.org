Taken Boons with Explanations: /Stockholm Syndrome/ is pricey but sensible to pick up in case some good capture method is developed. /Presence/ is good to stick on team leaders, to help team cohesion, since I'm going for a teammate-heavy build. /Sex God/ is something I'd normally opt out of, if it wasn't for the implication that the trial will be sex-heavy. /Privacy/ is surprisingly awesome for the cost, it effectively prevents information leaks. /Waifu x16/ is a core part of my build, I'll explain the rationale behind this later. /Harem/ and /Hearts and Minds/ both pair well with teammate-heavy builds. /Buying in Bulk/ pairs well with one waifu in particular. /Better Together/ is just an incredibly obvious one to pick, now they have to take down two of me in order to win, which is a lot harder to do. Getting a clone for only 40 anima is an absolute steal. /Fluffsville/ is another ultra-useful one to get, to prevent fates worse than death. /Home Sick/ might be worthwhile, because 500 bucks worth of stuff from the character's homeworld, times 40 or so team members, /every month/, for however many years the trial lasts, means we'll be swimming in miscellaneous useful trinkets. /French Maid x5/ seems sensible to get, because with 40 or so teammates, somebody's going to need to be doing homemaking. /Cursed With Awesome/, /Always Be Prepared/, and /You are not Alone/ are ultra-ultra-essential choices.

Taken Boons without Explanations: (they just look straightforwardly good) /Relentless x2/, /Lazy Body-Building/, /No Bully/ (very flexible and cheap), /Mana Factory/, /Place of Power/, /Soul Gem Oven/, /Mana Tanks/ (yay mana), /Priorities/ (anti-akrasia power), /Chameleon/, /Synergy/, /Infiltrator/, /HUD/ (utility, also its free), /Gratz/, /Soulbound/, /AI Friend/

Untaken Boons without Explanations: (not worth cost) /Total Recall/, /Ready to Roll/, /Grand Theft Waifu/, /Domestication/, /Beautiful World/, /Leadership/, /Aura/, /Victim/, /Seduction/, /Morphologist/, /Poison-Proof/, /3d Piggu/, /Teacher's Pet/, /Erotic Norm/, /You Suck/, /Ebay/ (I don't really know what to get), /Prison of Love/, /Trapification/, /Hostile Takeover/, /Prep Time/, /Sidekick/, /Meta Human/, /Faith/, /Submission/, /Jocasta Complex/, /Xray Specs/, /King of Kong/, /100% Match/, /Chikan/, /Natural High/, /Foreplay/, /It's just Business/, /Vacation/, /One Waifu One Laifu/, /Like You Never Even Left/, /Toby/, /Tomboy Bonanza/, /Girl Next Door/, /Cupid's Arrow/, /Bad Girls/, /Christmas Come Early/, /Dynamic/, /Demographic Shift/, /A World of my own Design/, /Mary Sue/, /Dicked Over/, /Tastes Like Snozzberries/,

Untaken Boons with Explanations: /Pawn/ seems like it'd blow up in my face, I want to preserve the ability for teammates to disobey me if the advised action is just a really bad one. /Sod Cancer/ is a redundant one to have if everyone has Shards of Mortality immortality via /Cursed With Awesome/. /Soul Refraction/ is just dumb, don't have the key to your immortality projected outside of your body. /Indulgence/ makes you weak to sex-based foes, of which there will be a lot, bad choice. /Mummy will make it all Better/ and /Mental Landscape/ are both fine choices, just a bit overpriced and I had to drop something. /A Fucking Tank/ is just useless, because another tank is available in the items section, at lower cost, even before the half-off discount from /Be Prepared/ is applied.

A side note on Waifus: We can ask the question “what's the cost per power?”. For standard companions, the cost is 5 anima per power, dropping to 2.5 anima per power after the bonus from /You are not Alone/ is applied. This is /20x/ cheaper than acquiring the power yourself. Therefore, it makes sense to direct as many spare points as you can into acquiring companions, and waifus to have a massive team where, for any given power, /someone/ has it. If you just want to get as many powers as possible, the optimal strategy is an /extremely/ team-based build. Now, for waifus, assuming all the purchased powers are 50 anima, it comes out to about 16 anima per power, which is 3x more expensive than getting the power via a companion (pre-discount). Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the half-off discount from /You are not Alone/ applies to waifus as well (they're pretty clearly companions, and even after the discount, you're still paying 3x extra for a power instead of 6x). So this is why I bought 16 waifus. If you're trying to get as much magical firepower as possible, the optimal strategy is to distribute it among companions instead of trying to hoard it all yourself, because you can get 6 powers distributed amongst waifus for the price of having one for yourself. Also, /Buy in Bulk/ synergizes really well with having one of the sixteen be a giant character. You now have 12 hive-mind-linked giant characters, good for beating up large enemies, even taking into account the fact that they're only as strong as an average mortal (who is also a giant, so very strong indeed). So I'll refrain from giving a build for all of them individually, and just list stuff that /somebody/ on the waifu team knows. Also, of course I'm bringing over Harry from HPMOR, that's just a given.
