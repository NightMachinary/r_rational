ive only been playing around with the races so far, might add stuff to this but probably wont.\\
got a few ideas right now,undead lich's are always super powerful magicaly and they naturally sortof work like 'draft of death' (except maybe the ability to rebuild there body? idk). letting you choose something besides that which i thought was the best option next to elixir of life and rebirth by death. getting 'cursed with awesome' should let you get both of those. im hoping you can choose to self destruct your soul if you get captured activating the rebirth by death.

mary sue lets you choose another race and get rid of the negatives of one of them, being vulnerable to holy magic is to bad to keep but not sure what to choose out of; a spirit Djinn which are usually pretty bloody powerful, an undead lich (the downsides of both a lich and a djinn might make them not worth playing together) and a monster girl Gorgon- omnipotent stone stares are awesome but are usually there downfall.

being a giant is useless when you can just choose your size to be 100ft tall. which im doing, the bonus to strength is too insane coupled with 'synergy' it'd be an insane boost to magic to. and being a djinn/lich would add there magical prowess onto your strength again.\\
breeding program and maybe evolving flora will be a cool boon to gratz (the video game leveling up one), plus the give you more points to work with. a hundred foot tall gorgon could just stare a a monster infested kingdom in level up instantly. a hundred foot tall gorgons tail and snake hair is also gonna be pretty dangerous.

the undead race should probably let you choose a skeleton dragon which might be able to shapeshift like a normal dragon (though why not be a normal dragon?)

ive got nothing really. some obvious things like if you choose infertile then choose fertile aswell, get some extra points, but being able to make kids is to valuable a resource of super-powered minions. cold blooded is a free 30 points if you dont care about being cold (like if you dont have a physical body). and alota the bonus points are about sex, so from a sorta min-maxish point of view you could take most of them. if you choose a mind flayer penis and i think there were other things for controlling people you "hang with", plus some allot of the other sex boons and playing a sex fight game could probably be 100% workable. with the pick a fetish boon that normalizes and makes everyone sorta into a fetish of your choice you could choose make being mindcontrolled by me during sex be a fetish which would be exploiting that.

theres allot to work with and hard to see what does what with a setting so vague.
