Just thought I'd pop in and comment saying that I've been loving the read thus far and keep up the good work! Authors don't often get positive comments due most only feeling the need to speak up when the dislike something... but I thought I'd just return some of the positivity that I gained from reading the last three chapters. Secondary, more selfish reasons, include that many fanfictions get abandoned because Authors get too discouraged to finish them.

If you don't mind answering (you can spoiler it, if need be), what were the four levels Kakashi was playing on during his escapade? So far I've got this:

- Kakashi is currently weakened enough to not defeat Zabuza easily. (core / first level)
- Kakashi is actually strong enough to defeat Zabuza, but wants to flush the real him out. (second level)
- Kakashi is weakened and desperate and wishes for a simple resolution. (third level)
- Kakashi is strong enough to fight him, chase him off and survive... but not enough to kill him or find the real him. (fourth level)
