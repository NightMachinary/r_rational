Glad that I could provide my little bit of encouragement. :)

Oh neat. Yea, I remember the example given as well as the HPMOR discussion. That is partially why I was trying to think of it from the context of changes to a single individual, perhaps. Eg. A Ninja pretending to be a Civilian With a Dark Secret pretending to be a Merchant (or something along those lines). Perhaps it primed my thoughts in that direction or perhaps I just didn't spend enough time thinking on it in a broader context. >_<"
