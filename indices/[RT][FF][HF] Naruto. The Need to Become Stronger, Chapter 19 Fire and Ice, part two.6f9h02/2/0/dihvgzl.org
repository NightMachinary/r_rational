Thanks! It's true that lack of comments can be discouraging - I stopped updating for almost two months when I wasn't getting much positive feedback at the start, though that was also because I was depressed from the Trump calamity. Anyway, to answer your question, the '4th level strategy' doesn't refer to the attack itself, but to the way Kakashi orchestrated the events leading up to it. Think of it this way:

#+begin_quote
  1st level: Haku tries to kill the Bridge builder in his sleep.\\
  2nd level: Kakashi anticipates this, and uses genjutsu to fool Haku into thinking he killed the bridge builder so he can kill Haku instead.\\
  3rd level: Haku anticipates this, and instead pretends to execute the first level plan so Kakashi will defend Tazuna which will exhaust Kakashi so they can kill him.\\
  4th level: Kakashi realizes their strategy at the last second, and instead pretends to fall for their trap by going to the Bridge alone and thereby giving Zabuza the perfect ambush position, so his students can protect the villagers while he uses Genjutsu to fool Zabuza into attacking and wasting his chakra while also uncovering the location of Zabuza's real body.â€‹

It's basically the same stuff that Quirrel and HJPEV also discuss in HPMOR, where they also refer to "playing at level X", which is why I didn't go into too much detail discussing it. It's also covered in the same chapter that explains genjutsu, however (Armoury Economics, chapter 8 if I recall)
