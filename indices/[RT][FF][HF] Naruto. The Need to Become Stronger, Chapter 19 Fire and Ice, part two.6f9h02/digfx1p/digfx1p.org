And thus concludes the second part of the climax! And with it, incidentally, the last of my beta-reader's notes, since this was where he dropped off. It's amazing he spent as much time on the story as he did, really, considering he was never into Naruto to begin with. Let's hope the chapter doesn't have any more flaws as a result!

I'm really looking forward to hearing what you guys thought of the climax!
