I'm late but I only found out about this two days ago and I've been steadily reading it.

SÃ¬ it's obvious that it's inspired by hpmor, maybe too obvious at the beginning but I saw the quality improving as time went and the latest chapters have been amazing.

It'd definitely a story I can't wait to read each week or however much it takes for chapters to come out
