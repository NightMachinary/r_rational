I think a more rational Bella would not have wanted to live as an immortal in the body of a teenager.

And while it has no bearing on their rationality, I didn't enjoy Luminosity, Radiance, Worm, or Pact, at all. Nothing against those who enjoy them, but I find it strange to be in the minority here. I find it even stranger that some of my favorite authors (Elizer, alexanderwales), consider them to be good to great.
