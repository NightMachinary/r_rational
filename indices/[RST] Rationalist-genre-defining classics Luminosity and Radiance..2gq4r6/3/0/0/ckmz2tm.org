You are probably right. With all of the stories I mentioned, the /idea/ behind the stories sounded great, but I couldn't get into any of them. It has been long enough that I can't recall any specific complaints, but because the premise of each story was so interesting, I've tried each story at least twice.

When discussing a story, no matter how much I enjoyed (or didn't enjoy) it, I always try to keep in mind both its merits and its flaws. What I am tired of is the (what seems to me) disproportionate amount of praise that these stories receive on this subreddit.

When I look at reviews of books and stories (and anything else for that matter) on Amazon, Goodreads, or FFN, I always look for well-written critical reviews first. These are the reviews that I enjoy reading the most--especially if it's a book that I really enjoyed. Critical reviews spark the most interesting debates--they point out flaws I may have glossed over, and as an author, they help me learn what isn't working in my writing. If it is a review of something I haven't read, they help me decide if I should give the book a chance--can I deal with the flaws that the reviewer has pointed out?

I understand that these reviews are harder to write, but I have had a hard time finding critical reviews of any of these stories (but especially Worm) anywhere on the web. I would enjoy reading a well-written review that points out both Worm's faults and merits, written by someone who enjoyed the story just enough to finish it. Maybe Worm's length is the problem.
