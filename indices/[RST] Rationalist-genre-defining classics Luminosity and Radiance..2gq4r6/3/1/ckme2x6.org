  I think a more rational Bella would not have wanted to live as an immortal in the body of a teenager.

I think you may be misremembering. There was a very dangerous window of opportunity there. That was clearly the most rational choice with the information available in that situation. She was in very real existential danger, beyond even that involved in normal, non-immortal life.

I obviously couldn't say if not getting those sorts of things affected your enjoyment of /Luminosity/, and other fics like it, but it can't have helped.
