The basic idea of this trope is that a cast of characters in a story go through a lot more hardship, anguish and grief than is really necessary. In the end, however, you see them get their happily-ever-after. While humans may act [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards][bad]] and the world may seem like it's a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld][crapsack]] , that doesn't mean that the worst villain is beyond [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn][redemption]] , or that things can't be improved with hard work or even [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove][The Power of Love]] .

Not to be confused with the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding][Golden Ending]] in video games, where players actually have to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRewards][earn]] their happy ending. It is possible for both tropes to be in play at the same time, however.

Compare [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding][Earn Your Bad Ending]] , the polar opposite.

As this is an ending trope, assume examples will be ** spoilertastic ** .
