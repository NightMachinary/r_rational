I get it with Pact, but not the others. In Worm it reads to me as problems proportionate to the power of the main character, /Luminosity/ and /Radiance/ has a pacing issue with the majority of conflict concentrated in the second book but it's more about concentration than overall levels of awfulness. I prefer the intensity of /Radiance/ to the sort of easygoing feel of /Luminosity/. /Luminosity/ has more of that typical fanfic feel of nothing really going wrong.
