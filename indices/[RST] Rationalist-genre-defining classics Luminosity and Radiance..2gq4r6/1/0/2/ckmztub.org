Huh. You put it a lot better than I did in my review of Luminosity. I'll put it here (warning: spoilers) for comparison.

  I think this is the best Twilight fic there is. Thank you very much for your wrighting! HPMOR still beats it, but that's a different universe, and I think Twilight is a much more difficult one to rationalize. For example, your reimagining inherited some of the inherent contradictions, such as Aro saying he doesn't know why Edward doesn't simply eat Bella, even though it's common knowledge among vampires that mates come first, always. There may be several singers providing momentary pleasure, but there is only one mate. That's an incredibly silly thing to say for a millenia-year-old vampire with thousands of millenia of memories stored in his head.

  One complaint I do have is that a little too many of the major plot points are based on highly improbable events, even in this highly improbable universe. I'm not speaking of the one event that made all Bella's plans go askew at the end of Luminosity, although it does irk me; that's plausible, and only a little improbable, but once is okay. But when this happens over and over again... A friendly pack of werewolves being in the neighbourhood just in time for Elspeth to stumble into after she runs from another, not so friendly pack of werewolves? Cody defecting right after he finds out about Bella being alive, not a week earlier, not a week later? The highly improbable coincidence that Petra is Bella's singer? And this is just the beginning of the second book.

  All these coincidences mean that the plot develops in an entirely unpredictable, illogical way, subject only to the author's fancy. You can't predict the people in the universe; when you're reading the novel, you are forced to try to predict the author, instead, and that just detracts from the enjoyment. Where such coincidences were acceptable for the not entirely serious, adolescently romantic canon, this fic presumes to be serious and rational, and expecting readers to suspend their disbelief just isn't very compatible with this style of writing.

  I think the reason you had to use coincidences is because you made too few changes in the universe. You made Bella smarter and more rational, but everything else, as I see it, is the same. There was no other way to make life more difficult for the heroes without some major bad luck. I think it would have been better if you altered the universe to be a harder challenge for Bella's wit; made the Volturi smarter, changed some of the laws, introduced new elements - whatever.

  But, again, Twilight is a very difficult universe to make sensible, and a lot of effort was obviously made towards that end. I enjoyed the fic very much, I agree with Bella's thinking in the first book a lot, and I find the end result very satisfactory.

  Thanks again for writing.
