I'm fairly certain it was [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1m7gta/good_stories/cc6i2ik][my recommendation]] that made EY and everyone else go read it. I said it was clever and emotional, but never rational, and certainly not rationalist. EY never said it was rationalist.

/Worm/ is not rationalist. It was never meant to be. It's a deconstruction of superhero tropes first and a smart web serial second, written at the speed of light. A fully rational /Worm/ looks like [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2crqh0/weaver_nine_worm_fanfic_au/][/Weaver Nine/]], but that rearranges the character roster and was a patched version anyway. I'm looking forward to the print edition.

Honestly I think you went in with some skewed/hyped expectations (can't blame you, looking back at that rec thread -- ugh), but I'm still going to hold to /Worm/ as a very special piece of fiction for the scale and speed of its run, considering the fact that the author probably hadn't have heard of true rationality when he'd started writing.

You said it yourself:

  It's okay to read about irrational things and stories written in emotion and silly stories. Because let's face it, writing hpmor took a lot of effort on EY, and it would take an even greater effort to write like that about a whole world which is being attacked by nigh invincible monsters that wage war on all of mankind.
