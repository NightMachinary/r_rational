/Radiance/ was, I thought, a lot better than /Luminosity/. You could see the author getting better as she went, I thought. One of the cool things that the original series of Twilight books did was having different character possess extra powers that were unique to them, and /Luminosity/ carried it much further than the original series did, and took it in some unique directions.
