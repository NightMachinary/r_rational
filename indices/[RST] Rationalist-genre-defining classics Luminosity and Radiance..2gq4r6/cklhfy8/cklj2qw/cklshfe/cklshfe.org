I mostly agree with this. I stopped reading Pact because it was too grim and gritty without many spots of hope - it felt suffocating (and it's weird, because Wildbow has said that he realized Worm needed more hope and more breathers, but I felt like if anything, he made Pact worse). I very nearly stopped reading Worm for the same reason, but I tend to stick things out once I've started, and the use of powers was at least novel enough that I stuck with it.
