  Along with Worm, these are at the vanguard of a wave of rational and rationalist fiction that seems to demand constant maximum worst results in the pursuit of "realism", with not even a earn your happy ending in sight.

One of Worm's warnings is that it is not a story that you should read if you are the type of person who requires trigger warnings. I am the type of person who requires trigger warnings. If trauma becomes a major defining point of rationalist fanfiction, I will be very sad because I cannot read stories which engage in more than a certain density of character trauma. (Oddly, I am fine with depictions of the /aftermath/ of that trauma.)
