  and Radiance has to be read to be believed

I don't know...I think /Radiance/ had some serious, serious problems, even after the rough start. I completely stalled out in it, something that didn't happen even in the probably-too-long /Luminosity/.

I think you can only jerk the reader and the characters around so much without losing them. /[[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Pact]]/ has a similar issue of trying to be dangerous and edgy, but it just ends up just being a rollercoaster full of violent jerks without any payoff. I've stopped reading it entirely at this point.

All three stories seem to have been made with a certain type of (I hate to say it) juvenile character abuse porn in mind, and it doesn't seem to ever allow anyone to accomplish anything. /Luminosity/ didn't start that way, which if you know its history is telling.

The start of /Luminosity/ is some of the best rationalist fanfic ever written. The rest is very average.

Along with /Worm/, these are at the vanguard of a wave of rational and rationalist fiction that seems to demand constant maximum worst results in the pursuit of "realism", with not even a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding][earn your happy ending]] in sight.

If the protagonist makes a sandwich in chapter 6, someone will try to murder them because of it by the end of chapter 10. If people aren't naked, alone, and bleeding, just wait until the next arc.

Cheap drama from constant danger isn't good writing. But these are also very popular stories.

So, I'd like to hope that some day they /don't/ define the genre of rationalist fiction, but I can't really argue that they haven't so far.

Wow. That didn't start out so negative and grumpy. Oh well. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI][Anyone want some pizza rolls? I can email them to you]]...
