I don't think you're necessarily in the minority, it's just that there are strong in-group/out-group pressures that tend to stop people from commenting and saying that they disliked something, even though that information is valuable and good for conversation. And at the same time, if I liked something /overall/, I don't tend to want to talk about its faults - and if I like it enough, I don't even want to admit that it /has/ faults.

I can understand why someone wouldn't like /Worm/, or /Luminosity/. I'm fairly aware of their faults (though it's been quite a while since I've read the latter), though I do think I have a fairly high tolerance for their particular problems.
