I know I'm late, but I just got done reading both fics and wanted to throw my thoughts down. I liked /Luminosity/ a lot more - perhaps I was just caught up in the novelty of it all, but I loved following Bella through the whole 'there are vampires now what' stuff. Watching her analyze all the information as it came in was the highlight of my readings. I think that's why I liked HPMoR so much too - it was really interesting reading about these novel decision-making techniques, me being new to this whole 'rational' thing.

/Luminosity/ and /Radiance/ took a turn for the worse, IMO, when the grimdark never-ending troubles hit. I wasn't interested in reading about vampires duking it out for power, however creative they got with their powers (which wasn't very, again IMO). I wasn't attached to Elspeth like I was Bella, and I wasn't very fond of her ability to develop plot powers as was convenient (Bella began to suffer from that too). I finished /Radiance/ to finish it. Like someone else said, you can see the ending coming miles away, and it kind of slogs on its way there.

I've never read Twilight or even seen the movies, though, so that was kind of nice. I like that this is my only exposure. I'm almost tempted to put myself through the movies just to see, heh. All in all, I enjoyed both /Luminosity/ and /Radiance/, I just liked /Luminosity/ a lot more. It all comes down to personal preference, I guess?
