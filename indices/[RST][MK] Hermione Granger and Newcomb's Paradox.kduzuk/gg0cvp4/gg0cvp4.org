As I understand it the rules of timetravel in HPMOR are essentially divine/mathematical (is there a difference?) in nature; I think something would happen that would cause Hermione's time travel plan to fail; an earthquake strikes the golem for example. There's no reason to think so, except that that's the way it has been said to work within the fiction. It's as fundamental as the rule that all time loops are closed; all time loops are no longer than 6 hours.

not that this isn't terribly smart, nor not good writing, nor not fitting into the universe, nor not excellent in general.
