This is the first time I read about Newcomb's paradox. Interestingly:

#+begin_quote
  Nozick noted that "To almost everyone, it is perfectly clear and obvious what should be done. The difficulty is that these people seem to divide almost evenly on the problem, with large numbers thinking that the opposing half is just being silly."

I belong to the group that instinctively thinks that sure, the only sensible move is to grab box B. I basically have no problems thinking in terms of retrocausality or closed time loops, so I assume a perfect predictor is just that and trying to cheat them makes no sense. Not sure what that says about me, probably that I dropped any illusion of having true "free will" long ago.
