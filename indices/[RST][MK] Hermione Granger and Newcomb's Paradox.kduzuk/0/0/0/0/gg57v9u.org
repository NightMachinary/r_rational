It's a fun paradox, and involves quite a lot of fun assumptions about how the world works. For me, while I don't have trouble thinking in terms of retrocausality, we having seen any evidence of it in the real world, so I wouldn't use it as a justification. I would still take the opaque box only, but for different reasons.

I believe that any sufficiently detailed simulation of a conscious mind is itself conscious. For the predictor to have 100% accuracy, it must have made that detailed simulation. Therefore, there are two copies of me, one being offered the choice in reality, and one being offered the choice in the predictor's simulation. Ideally, with a goal to maximize the amount of money received by the physical me, I would pick one box while in the simulation, and two boxes while in the physical world. However, there is no way to tell which instance I am, so I need to choose the same in both cases. Therefore, I pick only a single box.
