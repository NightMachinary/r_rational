The problem still works if the predictor is 60% accurate. In the sense that agents that one box get more expected money. And newcomb's problem is a toy example of a broader case of decision problems that actually kind of includes more comon examples.

So like it seems that for a good acausal decision theory that does this kind of thing properly we need some notion of logical dependencies of events to your decision algorithm better than just considering exact copies of your algorithm.
