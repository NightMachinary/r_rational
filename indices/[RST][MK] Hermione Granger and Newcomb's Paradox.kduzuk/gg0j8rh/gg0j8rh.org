Whoever wrote that doesn't have a very good understanding of money. A bank absolutely can create money ex nihilo, at least insofar as the contents of a bank account count as money (some definitions of the money supply only count checking accounts, some also count savings accounts). Given that the account balance essentially represents a short-term uncollateralized debt to the account-holder (who has no claim on any particular banknotes or coins), the bank can simply increase the balance. There is no need for anyone to give the bank corresponding physical currency, and there's no real zero sum situation.
