I believe "divine" is indeed the correct term for the 6-hour restriction, as in "has to be implemented by having an intelligent agent supervise reality".

It certainly sounds [[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/causal+locality][non-local]].

I think you have to take naturally composable things (closed timelike curves) and by surgery on reality you make them non-composable (esentially by destroying worlds that do not satisfy your rule).

That's my strong gut feeling, anyways.
