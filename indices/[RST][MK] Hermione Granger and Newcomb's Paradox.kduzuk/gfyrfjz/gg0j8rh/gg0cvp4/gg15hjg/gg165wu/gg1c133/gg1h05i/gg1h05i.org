Well, in /HPMoR/, there are no self-inconsistent time loops. What there is is:

1. self-consistent time loops (perfectly fine in the general theory of relativity)
2. a 6-hour limit on information transfer backwards in time (pure story conceit, AFAICT)

You can compose self-inconsistent time loops from self-consistent time loops + weird (semi-)parallel universes. So they are potentially physical just from that and so far more reasonable than the 6-hour limit, AFAICT.

Superdeterminism seems like just a contrived way to avoid many-worlds by making the entire world a cutscene instead of a simulation.
