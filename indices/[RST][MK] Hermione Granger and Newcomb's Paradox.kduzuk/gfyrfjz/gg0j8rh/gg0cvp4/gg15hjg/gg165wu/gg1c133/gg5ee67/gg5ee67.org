Oooh, I need to look into that. Huge Egan fan here, but haven't read all his works. The guy's math skill is way beyond the average sci-fi author, but his characterization in his novels is so zero-dimensional, in contrast to his excellent characterization in his short stories. Guess there is no space to focus on characterization when his stories are often literal math classes, lol.
