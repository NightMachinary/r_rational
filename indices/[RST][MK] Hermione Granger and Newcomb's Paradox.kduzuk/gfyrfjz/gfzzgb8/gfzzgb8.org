To be clear, the omake does *not* assume knowledge of /Luna Lovegood and the Chamber of Secrets/, /HPMoR/, or even /Harry Potter/, really.

All you need to know is

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox#The_problem][Newcomb's paradox]],
- that Omega is the "reliable predictor" mentioned in the former,
- that Gringotts is a bank and
- that Hermione Granger is a person.

That said, I second the /Luna Lovegood and the Chamber of Secrets/ recommendation. It's delightful.
