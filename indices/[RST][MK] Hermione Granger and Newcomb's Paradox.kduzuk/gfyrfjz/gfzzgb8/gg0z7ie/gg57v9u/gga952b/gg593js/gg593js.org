So you basically assume that the predictor is perfectly deterministic and that's why it's perfect - it takes all inputs and simulates outputs with no error - while I'm just accepting it gets information from the future.

Thing is, in a perfectly deterministic world, what would even be the difference? If evolution is at all time unitary (so suppose wavefunction collapse is just an approximation or an illusion), then having information about the state of the universe at ANY time is the same as having information about all the future and all the past. And conversely, if the world is /not/ deterministic, then a 100% accurate predictor would be simply theoretically impossible.

Note that we know, by Bell's theorem, that QM implies either no locality, no realism (aka determinism), or superdeterminism. If the world is deterministic then it's either superdeterministic (and thus you never had a choice in the first place), or nonlocal (namely some information, hidden from us, travels FTL; and that's the same as saying that there is retrocausality).
