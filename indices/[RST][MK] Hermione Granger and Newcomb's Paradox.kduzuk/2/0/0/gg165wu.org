Closed timelike curves make actually a whole butt-load of sense when you consider time as just another dimension, but when you introduce a non-self consistent time loop it just doesn't make any sense; it becomes like a geometry problem of the scale of "give me a triangle with angles that add up to 190Â°" (and, extending the analogy, it's possible, but needs to exist on a different surface). You can't quite use the same analogy for 6 hour time limits, but I think of it as being a similar thing.

When you stop considering events as happening after one another, and as just being points in the time dimension, then there isn't in reality a question of "what will the universe do" because the universe already exists, and the universe as an object has all points in time mapped out already.

Something fun is that my analogy is well suited to notions of Superdeterminism, and all the non-local shenanigans that allows.
