Haven't thought about total domination, but I definitely have some ideas for easy improvements.

- Kill St. Paul before he invents Christianity, preventing the ensuing genocides it brought about. This is probably the one I'd do if I actually had a time machine.
- Kill Duncan Campbell Scott, who planned out most of the holocaust, preventing any of his copycats including Hitler.
- Kill Ferdinand and Isabella in the mid 1400s before they start any of their multiple genocides.
- Introduce Benamin Franklin (who would regiignize it as math ans not just superstition) to the fundamentals of Game Theory and Population dynamics so he can introduce those ideas to the English and French speaking parts of the world a few centuries early. To avoid a bootstrap paradox, don't teach him directly take but introduce him to someone in the Midewiwin Society, which has already discovered those branches of math.
