This is one of my favorite aspects of Haddix as an author (author of the /Shadow Children/ series). Even if she's not rational at all, or even particularly historically accurate, the protagonists in her time-travel series aren't the only time-travelers. In fact, there exist two competing factions of time travelers, that only recently diverged (but have, in effect, been competing throughout the whole of history).

I especially like the way it goes about paradoxes - the natural form of the universe /without/ time travel is predestined, and any changes from the norm will generally revert, unless they are too large. It's really weird and not too consistent, but it was a nice brain-bender for me as a young adult.
