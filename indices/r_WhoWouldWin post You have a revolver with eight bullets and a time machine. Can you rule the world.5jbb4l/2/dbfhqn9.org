Assuming this isn't parallel-worlds time travel where you venture to alternate timelines, and assuming that the machine isn't magically unique: /You are not the only person with a time machine/.

As soon as a time machine exists in a single-timeline universe then there is /already/ a secret society of time travelers with rules and traditions that have somehow sustained the history we know and love and protected it from looking any different than it does the moment you gain access to the theoretical opportunity to change it. Even if you've only just invented it.

Everybody who comes after you can still act before you... and have. You are already in opposition to them, and working against their entire society and millions of years of experience.

Being the theoretical first to come into possession only matters for relatively petty historical reasons. Otherwise it's an enormous disadvantage.
