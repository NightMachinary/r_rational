  Basically, only a timeline in which the time machine is never invented is a steady state condition. The timeline will keep changing until such a state is reached, and then stop changing.

This needs justifying. It seems to me that there could be stable states with time travel. Chaos theory / "for want of a nail" means it's ludicrously difficult to change the past without changing the circumstances that led to you changing the past, but not literally impossible. (Or things might infinitely converge towards a stable state, which amounts to the same thing.)
