  If you make any change in the past significantly before your birth, down to even scaring an animal near you when you appear, you will pretty much guarantee you're never going to be born.

True. But you can have a stable state over multiple loops. I.e. Kevin goes back in time and causes his mother to instead have a daughter named Laura, then Laura goes back in time and causes her mother to instead have a son named Kevin. (Add a billion steps to make this remotely plausible.)

Agree with the rest of your post.
