You don't necessarily need to get the same roll as the previous roll. You just need to get the same roll as /any one/ of the previous rolls you've made so far. The more rolls you make, the greater your chances (assuming nothing can stop you from rolling), unless the possible rolls are infinite and uniformly-distributed.

It's more likely to happen after a bajillion loops than after just one (and the resulting multi-loop stable state will be anywhere from one to one bajillion loops long.)
