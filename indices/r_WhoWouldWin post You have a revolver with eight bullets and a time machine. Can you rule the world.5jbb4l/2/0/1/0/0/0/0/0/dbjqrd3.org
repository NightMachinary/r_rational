Well, if you start with a completely contrafactual assumption, yeh, you can get predictions like this.

But you can't generalize from the finite to the infinite like that. Every loop has an infinite number of possible outcomes. Literally. And the most probable outcome is that no narratively close analog of the protagonist is ever born.
