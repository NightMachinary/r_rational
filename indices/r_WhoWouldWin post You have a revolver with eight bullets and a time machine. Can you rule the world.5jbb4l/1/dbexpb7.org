Seems almost too easy. Rule lawyering answer would be to teleport past the heat death of the universe, at which point you win by default. Other fun strategies include duplicating yourself, though this depends on the specific implementation of time travel, and automating your time travel device to go back in time by ɛ seconds every ɛ seconds, such that time is effectively frozen for everyone else, though again this depends on the limitations of the tool.
