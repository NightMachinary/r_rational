  other end of that is that if you've invented a time machine, then you'll have always invented a time machine.

That's not a stable state. The butterfly effect means that it is literally mathematically impossible, even with infinite time, to create a stable timeline that contains any loops. All You Zombies is great science fiction but it's not actually science.

You need something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Time][Leiber's]] law of conservation of history to damp out the entropy in the loops.
