  Assuming this isn't parallel-worlds time travel where you venture to alternate timelines, and assuming that the machine isn't magically unique: /You are not the only person with a time machine./
#+end_quote

If you're not the only person with a time machine, and it's possible to change the past, then the time machine will never be invented... because para-eventually someone will undo the invention of the time machine every time it's invented. This applies to any organization dedicated to maintaining the course of history, no matter how good they are.

Basically, only a timeline in which the time machine is never invented is a steady state condition. The timeline will keep changing until such a state is reached, and then stop changing. From the point of view of people anchored in the timeline, that's how it always was.

So this question kind of implies either that you're the only person with a time machine, or the time machine can't go back before its own creation.
