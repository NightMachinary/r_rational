The timeline is incredibly fragile once you insert actual physics into the analysis. If you make any change in the past significantly before your birth, down to even scaring an animal near you when you appear, you will pretty much guarantee you're never going to be born.

The reason is hydrodynamics of seminal fluid.

This is a massive amplifier of change. You scare an animal, it behaves slightly differently, a few animals nearby change THEIR behaviour very slightly as a result, and the next time one of them mates that happens slightly differently, even if it's just a fraction of a second later, and completely different sperm reach the egg.

SO in that area, a different set of animals is born in the next generation. Over their lives they behave differently, and the changes grow.

If this is before humanity evolved, if that even happens it'll happen completely differently. The new history will be completely different from the get go. If it's only a few centuries ago, maybe it'll take twenty or thirty years before a hunter catches or doesn't catch an animal, and ends up making out with her husband a fraction of a second later the next night, and now all their children are different.

And humans are an amplifier of entropy. Within a generation the very slight changes have spread all over the planet, completely different people are born, and the timeline is completely different. All from a snap of a twig as your time machine touched down.

MAYBE if it was before Lief Erikson, the new world gets a few generations repreive, but even then... migrating animals and fish also spread changes across the globe.

The idea of going back and making a deliberate, limited change is nonsense. It can't be done.

Converging on a stable state, sure, but the most likely stable state to converge on is one in which the time machine is never invented. There's no /mechanism/ directing the creation of almost closed loops that converge over multiple iterations. It would have to happen all at once, by sheer chance, and there still would have to be no time travel ever outside that one unlikely loop. SO even if there's a loop, it's one in which the time machine gets used once and prevents itself from ever being used again... and that is just so much less likely than it simply undoing itself I can't believe in any other result.
