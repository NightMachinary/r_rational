OK, then I'm confused.

Do you mean that it's not the next loop that's identical, but one bajillions of loops later? I'm not sure how that's any more likely than the next loop being identical.

I mean, you're literally rolling an infinite number of dice every time you use the machine. Getting the same roll any finite number of rolls later isn't any more likely than getting the same roll on the next roll.
