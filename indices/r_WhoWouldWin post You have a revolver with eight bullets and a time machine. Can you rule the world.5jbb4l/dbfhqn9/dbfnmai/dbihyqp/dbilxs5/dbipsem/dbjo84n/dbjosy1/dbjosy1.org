  A stable state over multiple loops is even less unlikely than a stable state over a single loop.

I don't disagree. But while a /specific/ multiple-loops stable state is highly unlikely, accounting for the possibility of multiple-loops stable states in general noticeably increases the probability of falling into a stable state.

As a toy example, let's say that the only thing time travel can change is the name of the protagonist.

First they're named Bob. If, after time travel, they're still Bob, we have a stable state.

But say instead that they become Laura. Now, after Laura time-travels, there are /two/ names that result in a stable state, Bob and Laura.

And so on and so forth. Assuming that names must have finite lengths, this actually /guarantees/ a stable state eventually, even if we can't predict its number of loops.

(In a non-toy example, as you said, there will be many more states in which time travel doesn't get discovered.)
