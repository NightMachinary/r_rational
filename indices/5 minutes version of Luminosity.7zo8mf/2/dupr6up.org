I haven't read it in several years---but, IIRC...

---Bella gets injected with vampire venom, becomes a vampire in record time, gets the mystical vampire bond of love with Edward, and has a daughter by him.\\
---For some reason (to gain allies against the Volturi, who eventually will discover the breach of secrecy and attack?), Bella decides to investigate the possibility of an alliance with werewolves, specifically female werewolves among the members of a particular USAian indigenous tribe. (Heretofore, all known werewolves have been male, but Bella hypothesizes that, because only males with the werewolf gene ever were exposed to vampires (in battle), the females just never had the gene triggered, despite carrying it.) She has lunch with an old female friend who is a member of the tribe in question. Her new vampiric status triggers the friend's werewolf gene after extended close contact.\\
---The friend blabs to her mother, who entices Bella to make /her/ a werewolf as well. However, the mother is pregnant, and she nearly dies when her fetus transforms within her.\\
---The Volturi find out about Bella's dealings with the werewolves and send a task force to eliminate everyone involved. Bella is the sole survivor (by some fluke like hiding under the ashes of her comrades), while all the Cullens are burned and all the tribe members (werewolves and not) are killed. Due to being a super-cool rationalist, Bella avoids suffering the standard fate of a vampire who loses her mystical mate (catatonia); instead, she forces herself to continue living for the sake of her daughter.

I personally found /Radiance/ significantly more interesting than /Luminosity/.
