A few things that are off: - The fetus transforming is not a thing. One of the new werewolves hurts her father in a fit of rage, forcing Bella to turn the father to save his life. Said father soul-bonds to his wife, and impregnates her while she is still human. The mother nearly dies due to giving birth to a half-vampire. - Bella doesn't survive due to a fluke; her mind-shield protects her to the point of reconstituting her body (it protects her mind, and her mind can't quite survive without a body, can it?) - The Cullens don't die. They break ties with Bella in order to be safe from the Volturi. Edward obviously can't (soul-bond), and gets killed (or at least, that's what Bella thinks). - The werewolves and their imprints don't get killed either. They just get mind-raped into serving the Volturi (except a few who manage to escape). The non-werewolves do get killed though.
