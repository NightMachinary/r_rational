This went really long but idk how i could have significantly shortened it. It's a long book and a lot happens.

So radiance opens five years later. Bella and Elspeth (her and Edward's child, who is effectively a teenager, because half vampires grow super fast) are constantly on the run, to avoid the anyone noticing elspeth's rapid growth, and the attention of the vulturi. Elspeth was originally living with her grandparents Carlisle and Esme, but Bella happened across her as a toddler and kidnapped her. Elspeth has a power to make her truthful statements very hard to disbelieve, as well as to project her memories by touch.

One day, bella smells a wolf, and they are subsequently ambushed. One of the wolves, Jacob, imprints on elspeth, and kidnaps her. they are shifted into a sort of Ethereal plane by a human witch named Pera. She, along with a handful of wolves and their imprints and children, live in pera's parallel dimension, also on the run from the vulturi. They are the only wolves that haven't been mindfucked by the vulturi into subservience. Cody Clearwater, Bella's childhood friend's half vampire little brother is there too. Jacob, who is the alpha of their little pack, won't let Elspeth leave the 'hiding place', but they make their way to her rendezvous point with her mother in New York City. They meet up, and Pera moves Bella to the hidinf place, but turns out, Pera is Bella's singer, and she loses it and attacks her. Pera sends her back but now Jacob doesn't trust her. Then everyone is ambushed by the vulturi, and taken prisoner, because Cody betrayed them for a shot at reconnecting with his siblings, both werewolves in the employ of the vulturi.

Elspeth wakes up in a vulturi prison cell, there's a half vampire girl there named Alliria, with the power to seem completely unimportant, but that's hardly relevant. Elspeth escapes somehow, but how is unimportant. She discovers that the vulturi are keeping uncooperative vampire witches (including the not dead Edward and Alice) imprisoned in pieces so that a new recruit, Adelaide, can steal their powers. They reform the witches and hold a mass breakout. Edward takes Elspeth to help find Bella, though after Chelsea snipped away all of his connections, he doesn't feel any affection for her any more. He does still feel some connection to alice, since he was always in telepathic contact, they couldn't completely kill that relationship. They all three go to Nashville where Alice's mate Jasper is living with a couple friends and eating people again. Then all of them head to Denali to rendezvous with family, but are again betrayed to the Vulturi.

This time, Elspeth ends up in a super friendly underground werewolf village. It's a much more effective prison, given that they already magically killed her connections to her mother and family, and the place is relatively pleasant, if you ignore the fact that everyone is magical cops for the evil vampire illuminati. She stays there for some time, and Addy, the power copying witch, trains her to extend her powers. She learns to send made-up memories, to send incomplete ones (such as only audio, for sending telepathy), and eventually, to compress them instead of sending in real time and she even develops range for her power.

During one training session, Alec, the sensory deprivation field witch, knocks them out. Presumably they weren't fond of the work Elspeth was putting into undoing Chelsea fake relationship building. She calls out to Jake, while Addy sends an undirected blast of all of her memories at everyone in range (i. e. basically the whole main vulturi compound). This includes all of /Aro's/ memories as well, up to the point they last touched, due to Aro's power and her's both working automatically by touch. Everyone is so overwhelmed that they're totally knocked out, except Jacob who is too focused on saving his imprint. Jacob, Elspeth, and Addy escape.

This is where things get real interesting. Part of Aro's memories is how he murdered one of his fellow vulturi lord's wife. When that guy recalls that memory, shit will definitely hit the fan, so our heroes head to ireland were Maggie (a vampire friend of the family) and her mate Gianna, the now also vampire who gave birth to Elspeth on behalf of Ed and Bella, and their daughter, Molly, live. One thing leads to another, and they call a big meeting of vampires from the british isles to discuss the vulturi problem. When Addy smells Siobahn (who it is said has a witchcraft of making her plans come true, though she argues she's just a good strategist), she immediately touches her and runs cackling off into the distance.

Anyway, much of the rest of the book is plotting and scheming. Eventually all the friends and allies of the Cullen Family end up in Denali, and are plotting to overthrow the Vulturi. The biggest threat is the vampirized Pera, who can hide /parts/ of people now. They use alice's vision projection power to show her single vampire dudes in hopes of sparking a mate bond. It works. The teleporter guy goes there, they go to the hiding place, and fuck their way back to alaska. With her on their side, prospects are much better, and their combined forces invade the vulturi compound. Elspeth runs through the werewolf village, deprogramming everyone as she goes. Yadda yadda yadda, lots of fighting and excellent strategy, bada bing bada boom, the vulturi lords are all in pieces.

Bella makes a new government from the ashes of the old, using Pera as an actually effective prison warden to enforce the 'no eating people' rule, and Alice to monitor it. She's basically untouchable on account of a body guard, who nobody can quite remember who it might be. Everybody who isn't dead and is useful gets fanciful titles.

We cut to years down the road to the Cullens ruling the world. Elspeth finally meets her human grandparents, though Charlie doesn't seem keen on immortality. The Golden Coven is trying to push vampirism as a desirable cure for, well, everything, and with the royal anesthetician Alec blocking out the pain, and Elspeth projecting movies for entertainment, the historically 'not fun' turning process is practically pleasant. The masquerade slowly falls since people aren't required to lie under pain of death any more. And everyone who wasn't killed lives happily ever after.
