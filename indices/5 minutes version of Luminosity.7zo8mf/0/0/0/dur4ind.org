Did you enjoy canon Twilight?

Luminosity was basically an AU of the whole Twilight series all in one, with Radiance being an entirely new story (a necessary one, since the end of Luminosity is a big cliffhanger). I liked them for different reasons. Luminosity has an interesting alternative take on Bella and Edward forming a relationship, and Radiance has the whole transhumanist angle going on. Actually, perhaps the biggest issue with Radiance was that the climax failed to follow the Unspoken Plan Guarantee; we see characters plan things out, and then things largely go according to plan. I still found it worth my time.
