(It's actually not that samey, I'm just being flippant because it so huge that anything would look samey at the necessary distance to see the whole, but it does have a LOT of anti-climactic resolutions with plots that die out or get fixed before they go much of anywhere. The good parts, and there ARE a lot of really good parts, like The Assault on the Alethian Afterlife, for example, are kind of buried.)
