I enjoyed it. It really brought out the sociopathy inherent in the character. It's an enjoyable read, because it featured some of the less-appealing factors of the character (as originally written) overlapped by the parts of the rational mindset that can be ... troublesome.

You get a Bella who doesn't spend a lot of time in self-doubt or wondering "is this the right thing to do?"
