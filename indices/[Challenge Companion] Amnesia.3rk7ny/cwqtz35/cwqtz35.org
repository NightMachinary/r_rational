When I was in my late teens I was in a bicycle accident that caused a concussion. For a few hours I couldn't remember anything that had happened since I'd woken up that morning. I knew /that/ I'd woken up, and that I'd had breakfast and a number of other incidental facts... but they were in discrete mental clumps rather than tied together into a narrative in my head. I'm not sure now whether I knew them experientially or just via logical deduction.

Over the course of a few hours the links reestablished themselves and I regained the lost time. I've always thought that a character in a similar situation would be interesting fodder for film or short fiction.
