It's also a short story, [[http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a1564/memento-mori-0301/][/Memento Mori/]] written by Christopher Nolan's brother, Nathan Nolan. I believe both are influenced by the non-fictional "Lost Mariner" (linked in the OP), a case study where the name given is "Jimmie G".
