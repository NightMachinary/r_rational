Feel like this is an obvious one, but, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)][Memento's]] a pretty clear example of Amnesia done well in fiction, I feel. I would never call it a rational movie, per se, but I think it does a good job of portraying what the experience may actually feel like, to understand that you're supposed to BE someone, but not having any of the requisite understanding of who that someone is.
