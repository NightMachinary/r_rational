Well, I will obviously try to keep any rules consistent, fixing Toriyama's most blatant mistakes like having Shenron change the number of wishes he can grant from one time to the other without logic. What I meant is, I can create some high-level rules and stick to them, but I don't think I can possibly make up anything that's clever enough to hold up under /serious/ scrutiny while being minimally faithful to the world, so I don't think I can afford to make the story itself merely about, say, Bulma trying to understand scientifically how ki works, or something like that - though it will be at least touched upon. So basically the puzzle-like aspect of scientific discovery, and the application of rationalist methods, can't really be the focus of the story.
