A nitpick about your post, both RT and RST (using the sidebars descriptions) require that "The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them."

Your world doesn't need to have "real world" physics, but it should have consistent rules even if it has magic (e.g. HPMOR), runs on game logic (e.g. The Two Year Emperor), etc..

If you create a consistent set of rules for your fic it can easily be rationalist (again using the sidebar description), you don't need to worry about using "our physics", but you should showcase rationality itself on the story.
