Since Dragonball has an afterlife where people are conscious and possess their own personality and intelligence with no physical brain whatsoever, wouldn't it be impossible for an injury to the brain to make him more intelligent?

(I interpret canon to be that Saiyans basically receive programming and that hitting his head made him lose his programming. His canon personality is his natural state, so it would make sense for him to retain that personality in the afterlife (or after being brought back to life in perfect health).)
