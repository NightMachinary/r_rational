Hmmm... good point. Clearly the whole relationship between brain and soul is a bit spiny. I haven't worked out the details yet but I imagine it works something like the two influence each other. The soul is still a physical phenomenon, and a brain /creates/ a soul (otherwise, artificial creatures like Cell would have no soul), but at the same time the soul needs the brain to be anchored to the material world. Something like that.
