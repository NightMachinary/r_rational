I like it, a lot. Much more than I expected; the characterizations are really fantastic.

My one major point of criticism is, as other people have said, Goku's spiel about the balls scattering. The deduction itself is totally fine, but the way it's brought up is so abrupt it took me out of the story - it feels more like 'Look at how smart my character is!!' than the rest of the text. I actually loved his intial musing about names; that feels like the start of an interesting character, in a way that 'It's pretty obvious' doesn't.

Regardless, I'm super ready to read more, awesome stuff.
