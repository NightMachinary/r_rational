Hypothesis 1: instant translocation used to be commonplace.

Hypothesis 2: the Saiyans are to Freeza's species as the Jaffa are to the Goa'uld in /Stargate/. In both cases: they took humans from Earth to use as slaves; genetically-engineered some of them to use as a warrior race; planted those genetically-engineered humans on new planets to create a renewable resource; and hid their origins from them. But Jaffa encounter humans all the time, so their origin has long since been deduced; while Saiyans had never encountered humans (until the beginning of DBZ), so they have no idea they share an ancestry.
