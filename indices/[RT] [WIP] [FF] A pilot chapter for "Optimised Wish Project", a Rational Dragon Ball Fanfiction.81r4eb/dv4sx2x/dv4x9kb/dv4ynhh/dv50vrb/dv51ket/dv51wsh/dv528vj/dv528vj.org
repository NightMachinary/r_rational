I have my own headcanon about that really. It ties with other ideas that I planned to use in a different fanfiction that I may never write, and it just came to me that if I DO get that far with this one, I may just use them here.

(but I like Frieza playing the Goa'uld game, one thing I want to do is go more into Frieza's empire politics and structure! The only problem with this hypothesis is that the timeline doesn't fit. Saiyans haven't served Frieza for long - in fact it was old king Vegeta, I believe, who both led the rising against the Tuffles, and stipulated the deal with Frieza. And Frieza certainly did not know or care much about the Earth until Goku & friends happened to unfortunately draw his attention to it. The way everyone speaks about it, it seems like the Earth is in the galactic boons from their perspective)
