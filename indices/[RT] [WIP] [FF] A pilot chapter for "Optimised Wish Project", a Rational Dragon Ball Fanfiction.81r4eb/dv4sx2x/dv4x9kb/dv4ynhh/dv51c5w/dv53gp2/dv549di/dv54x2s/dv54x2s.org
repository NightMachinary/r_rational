I'd agree that flying takes less ki than blowing up a planet, no question. I'd just argue that "energy blast" is a distinct technique that appears to take humans a certain period of time to learn.

Krillin, for example, has trouble using the kamehameha after three years of training with Master Roshi and entering the 22nd Budokai. Krillin is probably comparable to Roshi's power level at this point (Goku and Tienshinhan are stronger than Roshi), but Krillin still has problems using energy blasts. His fight with Chaotzu is a good illustration of this; he can barely get an energy ball out at all at first, and when he does manage to pull off the technique, it barely has any punch.
