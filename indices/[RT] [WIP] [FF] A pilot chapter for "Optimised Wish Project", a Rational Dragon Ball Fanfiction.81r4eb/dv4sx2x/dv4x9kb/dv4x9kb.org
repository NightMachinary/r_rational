Thanks for your criticism and suggestions! Point by point:

- about Bulma not finding intellectual peers, consider that she's not really not found any, she just hasn't bothered looking /that/ much after all. She's 16, and consistently with her original characterisation, occasionally a bit bratty. She's not the most patient person. For me, the boyfriend thing is balanced by the fact that, by this point, she does not /truly/ believe the Dragonballs will work. So the wish is really sort of half-hearted, more of a playing with the idea "what would I wish for if I had an all-powerful dragon listening to me?" than a serious thought. As I tried to imply, really, she's just on the run because she's bored and hopes to get some attention from her parents. This is also the reason why she's alone (there's no doubt that the Briefs are /very/ rich, this is canonical, Bulma throws around money like it's of no concern, especially lately in DB Super where she's basically sponsoring prizes for all ToP participants, and gave away a yacht in a lottery for her birthday). It's a rebellious phase thing. Maybe I could stress that a bit more (a good chance is when she's dealing with Goku's feelings for his dead grandpa). That's my answer to the incongruity of the "boyfriend" wish (also, I really liked the chance to make that Jane Austen reference). As for the wish not being verifiable, you're right, and that's a good idea for further future revisions of the wish itself. I think it makes sense for her to assume that, well, if a dragon appears, the Balls /are/ magical, but however contrived, the hypothesis "a dragon appears but really he can't actually do anything" still needs to be falsified. Good catch, thanks!

- about the Red Ribbon Army, I already have plans in store for them;

- Goku's initial dissertation may be too long, perhaps. I might shorten it, I'll see. Or perhaps make some of his other rants longer, introduce it as a quirk that occasionally kicks in as he loses control of his train of thought. I kind of like it as an introduction, its overbearing nature just hammers down to Bulma /who/ she's dealing with here.

- the strength issue is one of the big contradictions of Dragon Ball. On one hand, everyone is absolutely amazed at seeing Goku & friends and their strength. On the other, as you mentioned, the Tenkaichi is broadcast on live TV. By the time the Buu arc rolls around it's even worse, the tournament is rife with absolute jokes who would have been completely wiped out even just 20 years before (Mr. Satan isn't nearly as strong as Roshi! Roshi could destroy a mountain with a Kamehameha at the very beginning of the show, remember). This contradiction seems to stem from a contrast between a setting that tries to emulate that of the original Journey to the West - a mysterious ancient China where adventure and portents lie behind every corner - and one where instead modern technology shortens distances and speeds up communication. My take on this is that the high level martial arts world is somewhat more secretive. So I'll rather go for example for removing the Live TV element at Tenkaichi later than the other way around. Some people more in the know might be aware of this, but Bulma is finding out about ki and magic, and this stuff isn't found in books (not in reliable ones, at least). She's also pretty young. I guess I'm taking a bit of inspiration from the world of Nen in HXH here (a perfect example of very "rational" superpower system), where most people are on a need-to-know basis with it and knowledge is passed from master to disciple, by oral tradition.

- yes, Goku could think about asking Shenron about the afterlife. He may have already. He's just taking his time, since he has it, and Bulma isn't trying to fixate him on any specific option.

- re: magic, ki and technology, I have some ideas about how and why they work, and what makes them different, and why Bulma (and most humans) only know the last one. I won't spoil here. Let's just say that what surprises her of the Nyoibo is the lack of mechanisms of any kind. It is, superficially, just a stick of wood. Of course there are rules and a logic to these things, they are just not known by Bulma (yet). And since they mostly belong to this mystical world of rather secretive martial artists, masters, and gods, to most it's either unknown, or only known by hearsay, which makes the entire thing not sound very reliable. Basically, the competent people keep their mouth shut, the incompetents only sound like cranks and frauds, and thus reinforce the notion that magic really is just nonsense.

I will not try to "fix" anything too hard concerning the setting, as I would rather this be a Dragon Ball fanfiction than a rational one, and I will be more willing to sacrifice coherence occasionally for the sake of atmosphere rather than the other way around. However the plot /will/ significantly diverge from the original one, while keeping the initial premises similar (for example, out there there really is a Frieza conquering planets; Majin Buu really is sleeping somewhere on Earth; etc.).
