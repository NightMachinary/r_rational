Well, true - I wouldn't love the mess that Dragonball can be otherwise - but I mean, it's sort of what this subreddit is about :D. I definitely don't think that only "rationalist" fiction is /good/ fiction, but by writing here, I am setting that as an objective for myself, a self-imposed restriction if we want. Which makes it a fun challenge.
