During the Cell Saga, they grab Dende to recreate Shenron. He says that, using Namek techniques, he can have him grant three wishes. They ask him however if this way he'll end up being like Polunga, who can only resurrect one person at a time, and he says yes, so in order to have him be powerful enough to resurrect multiple ones, he has to downgrade him, and go down to only two wishes. When the Cell Games are over, they wish for two things: to resurrect all the victims of Cell, and to remove the bombs from #17 and #18.

Next thing you know, the Buu arc rolls around, and Shenron can grant three wishes like Polunga. It's not critically important because they only use one of them /during/ the actual arc, everything else is post-battle fixing shit, like erasing Majin Buu's memory from humanity, but Toriyama himself basically said he forgot.
