Yes, that could be it too. Dende is said to be a prodigy from a giften family. But then again, Kami is a weird example, as he split into a part that could do magic and a part that could fight (usually any Namekian is either one or the other), and Piccolo ended up becoming the strongest Namekian ever by far. Perhaps it just goes to show that fighting was his real vocation.
