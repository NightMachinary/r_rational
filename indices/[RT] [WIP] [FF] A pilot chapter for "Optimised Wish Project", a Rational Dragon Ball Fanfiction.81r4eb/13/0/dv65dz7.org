Shenron isn't all-powerful, so multiple wishes might be needed (one for immortality, one to become king, etc.). Even after getting what they want, a really determined overlord would either do like Piccolo did, and kill Shenron so it can't be used against them, or keep it under their own control in case of future needs.

Also I think that /was/ pretty obvious. I mean, it's why Toriyama made the "scattering" rule in the first place. Without it it would be unbelievable for the Dragon Balls to be all over the place, or not used repeatedly.
