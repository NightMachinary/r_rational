Kudos on translating anime visual type humor to book format, CONK!

I would definitely read more from this setting, even if it was just something until Pilaf arc, which has plenty of lore and interesting clashes of techo/magic incidents to keep you occupied. (how rabbit make people into carrots?)

Anyway, other than dropbox and few typos this reads nicely and it's easy to follow what is happening.
