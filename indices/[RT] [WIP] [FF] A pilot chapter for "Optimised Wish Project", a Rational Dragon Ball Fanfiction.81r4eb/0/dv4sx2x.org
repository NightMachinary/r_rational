I've considered writing some rational fic for Dragon Ball myself, but it's an immense challenge. Making it feel both rational and stylistically consistent with canon is difficult, since so many things about the original setting feel like they're either inconsistent, played for laughs, or never explored in detail. So, I commend your efforts at taking a stab at this, and I'll be interested to see how you handle it.

That said, I do have some initial feedback, mostly in regards to your characterization of Bulma.

This is tricky, because I realize you're trying to be consistent with Bulma's original goal in Dragon Ball (wish for a boyfriend), which is inherently problematic in a lot of regards.

I have a difficult time believing that Bulma has not been able to find intellectual equals. A portion of this comes down to how much you want to expand on the world of the original setting. They appear to have relatively modern levels of technology (with some schizo tech), and modern-style schools /probably/ exist, but I don't think we get a lot of detail about the education system as far as I can recall.

For example, are magnet programs and other forms of education designed for intelligent young students available? What sorts of college education are available?

If so, I'd expect her to be able to find intellectual peers through either a high school with a magnet program (maybe even a highly gifted magnet), a private school, or potentially even college if she's a few years ahead of schedule.

I feel like this is something I'd personally want more justification for. Maybe she had a boyfriend and he ran off to [[http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Android_16%27s_template][join the Red Ribbon Army]]?

A few comments on the wish itself:

- A portion of the wish says, "I, too, will fall in love with him". This appears to reference a portion of the wish that does not exist; there is no implication in the earlier portion of the wish that the person she meets will fall in love with her, merely that the person will be her "boyfriend". I would argue that there is no inherent need for a "boyfriend" to be in love with someone, nor should that be presumed to be automatically granted within the parameters of the wish.
- Toward the end of the wish, you say "hi must be" - this is a typo. It should say "he must be".
- Constructing a wish in such a way that the meeting could "appear to be a coincidence" means that she would have no way of knowing if the Dragon Balls actually served any function at all. That makes this a poor test case if she's attempting to validate the functionality of the Dragon Balls, and it also means that she could potentially meet this random person under circumstances in which she does not recognize them as a match.

I do like that she goes through multiple iterations of the wish and that we see her thought process - that's a good approach.

Goku's dialogue comes across as a little inconsistent. His dissertation on the uselessness of giving out his name doesn't feel like it matches the style of the rest of his dialogue, which is a little more brief (no pun intended).

Bulma's analysis that "human muscles should not be able to do that" seems a little iffy to me, but a part of that comes down to how well people understand peak human capabilities within the setting. Master Roshi would have already won at least one Tenkaichi Budōkai by this point, for example, and as far as I understand it those things are broadcast on television within the setting. While the average person doesn't seem to know about ki, there may be a general understanding that human capabilities have upper limits that are much higher than what we have on our Earth. For example, Master Roshi has a similar power level to Mr. Satan, who can [[https://youtu.be/U3xroTMVnRA][punch through a bus]]. So, I think beating up a car with a blunt object would be considered a high-end physical feat, but not necessarily impossible.

Also, if Bulma has fantastic resources at her disposal (e.g. enough money to "wipe out East City's public debt with pocket money", why is she traveling without bodyguards? Does she have anyone monitoring her location? Does she have some motivation to be "adventuring" without anyone else?

Your rational!Goku has (understandable) questions about the existence of heaven. Since they're in the middle of a conversation about wish-granting objects when this comes up, why not have him consider using the Dragon Balls to verify the existence of the afterlife in some way? Or even verify if that's the afterlife that Grandpa went to?

If this is supposed to be a rational!Bulma, I'd want her to (at least eventually) realize that she can do a lot more with a wish than get a boyfriend. That might help justify the /extreme/ risks she's taking.

I'd also take issue with Bulma's concept that science makes sense and magic doesn't. In a world where magic exists and has reliable and knowable rules, they're not really all that distinct. Magic is just another form of special technique at that point.

Actually, Goku's magic item - Nyoibō - is a great example of that. It's functionally very similar to Bulma's capsule technology; it expands and contracts on demand.

A couple more quick typos:

- Search for "concluded Goku". You're missing some punctuation there.
- Search for "sceptical". This should be "skeptical".

Overall, most of my concerns are related to the source material itself, and attempting to "fix" them means potentially deviating from that source material further. That's a tough call to make, which is part of why I never ended up writing any fanfics like this myself.

I hope this doesn't come across as too harsh, and I commend you for taking up the challenge of trying to do a rational fic for something as difficult as Dragon Ball.
