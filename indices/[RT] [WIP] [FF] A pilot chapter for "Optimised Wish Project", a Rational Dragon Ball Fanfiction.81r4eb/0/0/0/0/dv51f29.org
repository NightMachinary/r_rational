Exactly my thoughts. Which is why I believe it's perfectly normal to imagine Bulma at her age might feel a /little/ frustrated with them, and want to lash out and draw attention to herself.

(except I don't think they live outside the city. When Goku looks for Bulma in Dragonball, he founds her thanks to a cop, and they still seem to be at least in a residential area)
