Bulma's parents aren't just rich; they're also /absolute airheads/, the both of them. Her father is the epitome of an "absent professor", and her mom is, as far as I can tell, a trophy wife. Bulma may have learned mechanical engineering on her daddy's knee, but I doubt he was actually intending to raise her to be anything in particular.

Rather, I think they haven't given much consideration to Bulma's needs at all. IIRC, they live a ways out from the city, in a nice huge capsule-mansion with lab-domes and garden-domes and the like. It's likely perfect for /them/, but have they considered how isolating it is for Bulma? I expect not. (What do they think of their daughter taking a car-capsule and wandering off to god-knows-where at the age of 14 for months at a time? Maybe they trust her to know how to take care of herself? Even though she---at the beginning of Dragonball---obviously doesn't have any such skills?)

Likewise, they probably haven't stopped to think about the fact that Bulma is a technical genius. For the both of them, that level of skill is just... normal. They're used to it. So it never occurred to them that Bulma might be intellectually starved.
