In the manga and early series it's obvious the Tenkaichi is a popular event and the public is just composed of normal people. It's clear that, while some extraordinary feats /have/ been seen in the past, the arrival of Goku & co. heralds the beginning of a new escalation, that culminates in Piccolo and Goku's fight that destroys the ring completely, sends the spectators running for their lives in a panic, and brings forth the end of the Tenkaichi (for understandable safety reasons) for many years, until the Cell Games, that are inspired by it.

There's not a really coherent explanation. People have very short memories in this universe, as at the end of Dragon Ball they were saved by Goku from King Piccolo, saw him destroy a city with his bare hands, yet when Cell appears and Goku confronts him only the King recognizes him, and everyone seems to go along with Mr. Satan's explanation that it's "all tricks".

But yes, I think the general idea that it's just a more secluded world, and intellectuals and scientists just don't bother mixing enough to realise what's going on there is the only one that makes half sense. It's not super believable but it should be a good compromise between the setting and needs of the story.
