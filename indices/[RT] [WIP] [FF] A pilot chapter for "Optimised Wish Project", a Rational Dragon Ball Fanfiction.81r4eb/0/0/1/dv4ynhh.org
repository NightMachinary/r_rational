Thanks for the quick replies. I understand your reasoning for your decisions, and I agree that a lot of it comes down to the weirdness of the original setting.

Just a few quick replies.

  So the wish is really sort of half-hearted, more of a playing with the idea "what would I wish for if I had an all-powerful dragon listening to me?" than a serious thought.

That's part of my issue - I'd like to think that a more rational Bulma would have better goals than a boyfriend. Especially when considering the risk vs. reward that would go into something like "run off to find the dragon balls".

I think this might just be an area where you want to stick closer to canon than I would, though, which is fine.

  about the Red Ribbon Army, I already have plans in store for them;

I'm glad to hear that. A rational!DBZ really needs to explore the Androids more, imo. They're a huge deal technologically and that's barely touched on in canon.

  Mr. Satan isn't nearly as strong as Roshi! Roshi could destroy a mountain with a Kamehameha at the very beginning of the show, remember
#+end_quote

Budokai winners in general tend to be somewhere in the same ballpark range as Roshi, even if they don't have access to ki blasts.

Mr. Satan did survive a fight with Tao Pai Pai when he was just a student, and he's presumably considerably stronger as an adult.

It's tough to quantify his abilities in general since a lot of his "feats" are gags, like surviving getting hit by Cell or Buu.

  re: magic, ki and technology, I have some ideas about how and why they work, and what makes them different, and why Bulma (and most humans) only know the last one.

I guess the tricky thing for me is that she already has a device that measures the emissions of a specific type of magical item, so she understands that at least one category of magical item operates (to some degree) under principles she understands.

I'd be interested in seeing her explore that more. Can she study Nyoibo and learn how it works? Can she make something that detects items with similar signatures to Nyoibo? Once she learns about ki, can she make a measuring device before the saiyans arrive?
