  I'd like to think that a more rational Bulma would have better goals than a boyfriend.
#+end_quote

I guess my point is, she's not necessarily /more rational/. The necessary changes have been made mostly for Goku. I did tweak Bulma a bit, but that's mostly because I want her to be the base for a more enterprising character, and frankly, because I'm not interested in replicating Toriyama's brand of pervy humour. So this Bulma isn't the type to instantly offer to show Goku her panties in exchange for the Dragon Ball. But at the same time, I think most of these changes should boil down to /effects/ of Goku's differences -as their dynamic changes, her whole character evolves in a different direction. Anyway, my point is, Bulma may be smart and quite rational, but she's a human being, so she's not perfect. She has drives and emotions that /do/ blind her to a lot of things. And it's not like the last word on her wish has been said. As the prospect becomes more concrete, she might change her mind.

  I'm glad to hear that. A rational!DBZ really needs to explore the Androids more, imo. They're a huge deal technologically and that's barely touched on in canon.

I don't know if I can make that sound satisfying and believable - that's a bit of a tough call. But hopefully I'll make it at least more rounded out and fun, or at least progressive and not completely out-of-nowhere as it was in canon.

  Mr. Satan did survive a fight with Tao Pai Pai when he was just a student, and he's presumably considerably stronger as an adult.
#+end_quote

Oh, I just found out that's something Toriyama said, huh. Then again, I'm not sure about taking all the man said as canon (S-cells, anyone?). Satan certainly has a good track record taking blows and surviving, but I refuse to consider him as strong as Roshi, seriously. His daughter, Videl, is all but stated to be effectively stronger than him (Gohan thinks so at least), and she's barely got enough ki to summon a small energy ball and fly. She never uses ki to attack, even though she /can/ control it after being trained by Gohan. Roshi could blow up the freakin' Moon with it.

  I guess the tricky thing for me is that she already has a device that measures the emissions of a specific type of magical item, so she understands that at least one category of magical item operates (to some degree) under principles she understands.
#+end_quote

I stated that casually during the chapter, the Dragon Balls simply emit a regular electromagnetic signal. It's just radio waves at a specific frequency, nothing supernatural, which is why everyone and their sister (Pilaf, Red Ribbon) ends up having a radar sooner or later. It's not especially hard to build if you have one to study. Consider it a side effect of sorts, their magic interacting with regular physical laws in weird ways.

And yes, playing with those sort of ideas is definitely in my objectives! I really want Bulma to be a full fledged co-protagonist here. The cast overall will end up being quite different!
