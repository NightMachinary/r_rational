  I guess my point is, she's not necessarily more rational. The necessary changes have been made mostly for Goku. I did tweak Bulma a bit, but that's mostly because I want her to be the base for a more enterprising character, and frankly, because I'm not interested in replicating Toriyama's brand of pervy humour.

That makes sense, I may have simply misunderstood your original intent, since the OP made it sound like you were going for a more HPMOR style fic in general.

I certainly agree with trying to cut down on the pervy humor. That's a noble goal. =)

  Then again, I'm not sure about taking all the man said as canon (S-cells, anyone?).

Yeah, he's never been making and keeping rules for his own universe, I agree.

  His daughter, Videl, is all but stated to be effectively stronger than him (Gohan thinks so at least), and she's barely got enough ki to summon a small energy ball and fly. She never uses ki to attack, even though she can control it after being trained by Gohan. Roshi could blow up the freakin' Moon with it.

Master Roshi can throw powerful energy blasts, but he can't fly at all.

Different people learn different forms of ki control. Master Roshi is good at energy blasts because that's his signature technique.

It's also possible to be extremely powerful and not really use ki blasts at all - Hit and Jiren barely seem to bother with them, for example.

  And yes, playing with those sort of ideas is definitely in my objectives! I really want Bulma to be a full fledged co-protagonist here. The cast overall will end up being quite different!

Neat!
