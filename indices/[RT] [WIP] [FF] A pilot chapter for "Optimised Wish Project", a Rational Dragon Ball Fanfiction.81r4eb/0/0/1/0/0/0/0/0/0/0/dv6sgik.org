Ah, didn't think of it! To be fair, by that point I expect the plot will diverge so much from the one we know, the problem won't present itself... Goku simply will never get to fly over Penguin Village, so if I don't want to deal with Arale I just won't. It might be fun having a cameo but then it'd probably something as absurdist and ridiculous and then immediately forgotten as it is in the anime. Gag characters would break any story XD.
