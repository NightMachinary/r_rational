Well, yes, though as many things in DB it quickly goes "So Last Season", and Gohan for example learns it basically on his own when in the wilderness whereas it used to be a big deal. There's an impression that the more powerful you are, the easier these things come, probably because you can just afford to do them in a more wasteful way and technique isn't that important any more.

But I was referring to a specific scene. When Gohan teaches Videl to fly, the first thing he does is teach her to control her ki. This is illustrated by her keeping her hands in a cup shape and focusing, and when she succeeds, a faint glow appears. Basically, she is creating the equivalent of a ki blast. Except it's so weak it'd probably barely tickle. In order to make one big enough to blow up a mountain, you need to possess enough /energy/ to blow up a mountain.

My idea is that ki blasts overcome the physical limitations of muscle. In other words, even at amazing energy levels, there's only so much power muscle can output (though it's obviously stronger than the limit assumed by most humans). We've never seen anyone blow up a planet with a raw punch. So the strongest fighters have, potentially, a lot of energy stored inside them that they can only let off in small bursts with physical attacks. Enter ki attacks, that can project an arbitrary amount of energy out of the body - and therefore can be so tiring they exhaust a significant percentage, or all, of the fighter's strength. Something we've seen again and again.

Anyway, this was a good thing to discuss, but I guess I'll keep further thoughts to myself from here on, as it's good ideas for stuff that might need to be discussed in-universe :D.
