The way I see it, ki is some form of energy. There's a stored reserve, and there's a power output, that determines how strong an attack is, and how much it drains the user. Reasonably speaking, lifting a human from the ground requires less energy than destroying a mountain. When Roshi fights Tenshinan, he can't fly, and Tenshinan can. Tenshinan is only slightly stronger than him, the gap isn't huge. But both can destroy large objects with ki. My idea is that technique only determines how one manipulates and shapes ki. Something like flying might require low raw power, but a lot of fine control. Remember that even Goten could go SSJ, and thus be easily a planet-buster, but could not fly. On the other hand, as far as throwing ki goes, the technique only concerns the 'shape' of an attack. For example, the Kamehameha always looks pretty much the same. But when Roshi first uses it, it blows up a mountain; when Goku does it, it wrecks a car. Same technique, different power output. When Cell used the same attack at maximum power, he claimed it could blow up the entire Solar System.

Maybe having less technique means being less efficient, and wasting more energy. But still, I will work on the assumption that flying, done well, takes far less ki than destroying a planet.
