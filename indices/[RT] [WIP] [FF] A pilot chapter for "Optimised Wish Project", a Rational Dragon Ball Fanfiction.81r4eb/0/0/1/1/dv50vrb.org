I assume there's some sort of fan-created genotyping explanation for the power-levels of each generation of Saiyans increasing when increasingly mixed with human DNA, right? Something that can be turned into a formula that predicts the power level of generation N at a fixed age?

Well, let's pretend that---despite there being no justification for it beyond Toriyama's whims---the same formula applies to the Nth-generation /plain-old humans/ in the Dragonball universe. (I mean, it really does seem to!) So Videl would be as much stronger than Mr. Satan at a given age than Gohan is stronger than Goku at a given age.

Then, if you can figure out Videl's average power-level across any fights she appears in, you can run the formula backward to get Mr. Satan's power level.
