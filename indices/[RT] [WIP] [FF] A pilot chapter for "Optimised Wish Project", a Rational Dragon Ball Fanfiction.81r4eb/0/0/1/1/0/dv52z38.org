  I assume there's some sort of fan-created genotyping explanation for the power-levels of each generation of Saiyans increasing when increasingly mixed with human DNA, right? Something that can be turned into a formula that predicts the power level of generation N at a fixed age?

I'm sure there are people who have /tried/ to figure this out, but it doesn't even seem consistent within the same /character/, let alone the same generation.

Trunks is the easiest example of this.

Mirai Trunks has trouble getting to SSJ1 as a teenager, and it's a huge plot point when he actually gets there. This is with both training from someone who already has SSJ1 (Gohan) and combat experience against people of a comparable or higher level (the androids).

Chibi Trunks gets SSJ1 off-screen as a small child with virtually no training.

Future!Gohan is a similar example; a much older, battle-tested version of him isn't able to hit SSJ2, but the main timeline version of him does just shortly after hitting SSJ1 for the first time.

  Well, let's pretend that---despite there being no justification for it beyond Toriyama's whims---the same formula applies to the Nth-generation plain-old humans in the Dragonball universe. (I mean, it really does seem to!) So Videl would be as much stronger than Mr. Satan at a given age than Gohan is stronger than Goku at a given age.

Super invalidates this pretty badly; the pure Saiyans are far above the half-Saiyans pretty consistently, with the possible exception of Future Trunks, who has had to solo every threat in his timeline.

  Then, if you can figure out Videl's average power-level across any fights she appears in, you can run the formula backward to get Mr. Satan's power level.

Power levels fluctuate drastically within someone's lifetime, though.

Take Krillin as an example. He's listed at 206 in the beginning of Z. After training, he's at 1770 for the fight with Vegeta. By the end of the Frieza saga, he's listed at around 75,000.

With that much variation in an individual's power, we can't reasonably work backward from another person - people in this series sometimes go up in power by a factor of 50 or more in a single day.
