I don't think it's supposed to work exactly that way though. The Saiyan-human thing though is another one I really would like to explore. That these two species look so much alike and /can interbreed/, and have fertile (and stronger!) offspring, despite supposedly evolving on two planets light years away from each other without any contact, is a bit too much for my suspension of disbelief.
