Since they're both created by kaioshin, my presumption was that they got lazy in design and / or reuse parts of design as matter of course because why fix what isn't broken. Remember, the worlds in dragonball aren't natural evolution. They are (or should be, in a nonfunctioning DB universe such as future 7 since Shin is dead there) being constantly created to keep up with the removals by the god of destruction.
