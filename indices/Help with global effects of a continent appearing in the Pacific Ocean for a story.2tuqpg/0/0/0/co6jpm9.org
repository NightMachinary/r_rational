This [[http://m.pnas.org/content/95/24/14009.full.pdf&quot%3b&gt%3b][paper]] estimates that in 1994 1.88 billion people lived below 100m elevation. You could probably update that with todays population by taking the percent (about one third). It also has some nice images visualising the areas most likely to be effected unfortunately at the <500m rather than <100m level.

With at least a third of the worlds population killed (due simply to being underwater) and many more likely due to the mega-tsunami and complete breakdown of society our continents will be basically post-apocalyptic. Land invasions kill a smaller percentage of population. I read an article somewhere talking about Australia, where if 20% of truck drivers got sick at once it would be completely impossible to supply the country with adequate food. Remember also that in many places industry is located near ports, so most manufacturing capabilities will be wiped out. Currently it takes at least a couple of months for a new factory to be built, toolled and begin producing. In the post-apocalyptic devastation it will be years or decades to return to current capabilities.
