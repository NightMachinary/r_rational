I noticed a couple things on the XKCD map that I thought were worth sharing:

- The South American desert would probably be smaller, mostly confined to the east side of the continent, and further south (not bordering the ocean, but bordering the ice area). The polar desert would slowly turn into a taiga, like Siberia.
- The Himalayas are frozen. Much of the reason India and China have such huge populations is because of rivers fed by runoff from the Himalayas, and we have no new mountains that size moving into temperate zones to make up for it. This planet's population is ~2 billion less than ours.
