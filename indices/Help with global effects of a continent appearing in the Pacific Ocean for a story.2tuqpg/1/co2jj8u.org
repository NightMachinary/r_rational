I would try submitting this one to What If XKCD. Seems right up Randall's alley.

I don't know the effects, but some things I'd look for:

- Plagues resulting from the numerous dead bodies where you just killed most of the human race
- Total collapse of human civilization due to deaths and destruction of infrastructure.
- Disruption of ocean circulation leads to temperature changes in the ocean causing massive weather changes and die offs
- Reduced ocean area means less evaporation there, but other areas are now flooded. Total area to evaporate from has gone up, so the weather gets wetter
- Depending on [[http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/tectonic.gif][where it arrives]], the new continent could end up spanning the boundary of two continental plates. This could lead to more vulcanism and might, over geologic time, tear the new continent apart.
