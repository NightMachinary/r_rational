Putting a continent's worth of mass on the Pacific Plate would certainly impact tectonics. It could even be enough mass to break off the crust it lands on into a new, separate crust, surrounded by the Pacific Plate.

If a new plate is formed, that new plate would then settle into the Earth, slightly. It will displace magma. The entire planet would expand slightly due to the displacement of magma. Every active tectonic boundary on Earth would shift, opening up slightly as the crust of the Earth expanded.

Imagine every single active tectonic plate as a continuous volcano along its entire border.

EDIT: Actually the expansion of the Earth would probably happen anyway, no matter where the continent is placed, no matter if the plate under the new continent broke. The plates float on the Mantle. Literally float like boats. Added mass means added displacement no matter how you calculate it.
