Australia has bigger problems. 85% of the population lives within 50km of the coast and *all* the major cities are ports. (Yes, not all of those 85% will be below 95m but a heck of a lot will be).

On the bright side, the central Australian desert will become the central Australian sea, making the inland side of the Great Dividing Range much more pleasant for new settlers.
