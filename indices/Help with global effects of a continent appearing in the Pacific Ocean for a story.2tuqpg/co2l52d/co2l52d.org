[[http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/][Here's]] a map showing the results of rising sea levels, although it only reaches up to 60 meters rise. But on that point already you can see that America will lose a lot of land on its east coast, including New York city and most of florida. Europe will loses the netherlands and denmark first,. In the east, Bangladesh will disappear completely. And china will have its most populated area's flooded, losing both Beijing and Hong Kong. Australia might become a little more habitable, getting a nice inland sea, all they have to give up for it is Melbourne.

This is all ignoring the Massive Tsunami that would Ravage all the pacific coasts, probably taking out most of japan, indonesia, the Philippines and a bit of china, as well as the Americas Western coasts. As all this would happen pretty instantaneous. There will probably be no concentrated rescue efforts, because most countries will be too busy saving themselves.

Then there will probably be some long term effects as gulfstreams are altered and climate patterns with that. Causing rain and drought periods to change worldwide. And maybe some geologic changes too?
