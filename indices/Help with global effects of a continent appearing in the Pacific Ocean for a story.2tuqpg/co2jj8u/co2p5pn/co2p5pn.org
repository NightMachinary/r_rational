In order:

Oh yes water borne pathogens would be on the rise as a must. Airborne as well but probably not to the same extent. Also while a large portion of humanity lives by the coasts its no where near 75%. Probably closer to 20% if 2010 records are accurate.

Ehhhh probably not. It would be a *MASSIVE* shift, with a lot of nations probably devolving into smaller totalitarian states ruled by a harsh dictator. Not to mention technology would take a hit for a long while, but I don't think its the infrastructural that we have to worry about(well /yes/ worry about it, since seaborne travel would basically be gone for the next decade or so, but its only around 3rd or 4th place).

This combined with general weather change is rather high up on the list, though I'm not sure how it would effect farmed animals (cows, chickens etc.) probability not to the same extent as it would birds and other wildlife. Depending on just how intertwined the webs are it might be a while before coastal ecological systems begin to affect more inland ones.

And it should arrive smack dab in the center of the Pacific plate, which means I need to revise how this is going to affect Hawaii, but that where I run into trouble. I don't know just what that kind of pressure would do to the magma oceans. I mean ya it going to trigger volcanos, but what about earthquakes? Will it forces other plates to do... something? I've got next to no clue there.
