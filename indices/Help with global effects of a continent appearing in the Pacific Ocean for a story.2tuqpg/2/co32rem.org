Are you sure you want to displace the water instead of doing some sort of swap?

Without the sea level changes and massive tsunamis, you're still looking at a giant mess. The new continent will completely change pacific ocean currents. To get a sense of the scale of what ocean currents do to our climate - England and Siberia have the same latitude.

What the new currents would shake out to after adding a continent is beyond prediction for now. You can count on ending all the known effects (like the extreme mildness of US's west coast), but there's no telling what new ones we'll get. I'd bet on warming up Alaska (to England levels) and generally cooling down Australia, but that's a shot in the dark.

Places with sudden warming will experience flooding, and places with sudden cooling will have deaths due to exposure and wide-scaled infrastructure shutdowns (Australia does not have snow plows). Everyone who has crops will lose them, and so many plant species will die off that we might have to start importing ones appropriate to the new climates once things settle down.

But that's all post-change. It'll take a long time to settle all that water into a new cycle, and until it does you're going to have rapid temperature shifts, which means rapid changes in air currents, which means hurricanes and tornadoes. The eventual power of hurricanes (not tornadoes) will quickly go down since the new oceans will be smaller, but the big ones triggered by the sudden change in equatorial flow will suck.
