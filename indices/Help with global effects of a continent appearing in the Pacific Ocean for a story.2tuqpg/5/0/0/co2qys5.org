The political shifts in the world are going to be rather extreme, and should be considered. A new continent in the middle of the pacific with massive flooding... Whatever political entities survive sufficiently intact to continue to govern are going to almost certainly be up to some serious backroom politics, no matter what they tell the newcomers.

Developed countries who were able to preserve a lot of their population by moving them inland and to higher elevations are going to be looking for places to put those people. A lot of third world countries with higher elevation land are very likely to be, ah, encouraged to accept immigration.

If these mages are powerful enough to move a continent, they are almost certainly going to be asked if they can implement some sort of massive freeze at the poles, to suck water out of the oceans and restore land.
