If the archmages know the water's going to be displaced rather than destroyed or "swapped", they'll know that their own continent is going to see major flooding as well. Will they be able to calculate how much by? They could perhaps raise their continent by that amount when they make the transition.

How rapidly is the water displaced? If it's "instant" the resulting tsunami is going to be incredible, will probably kill billions. It'll also screw over the arriving continent, so again, the archmages will need to account for this.

Do they know the destination world is inhabited? If so, they're deliberately making a choice to kill billions to save their own skins. They're going to be seen as history's greatest monsters. Even if it's accidental, expect the whole world to hate their guts. How well does magic fare against nuclear weapons and so forth? Could get reeeal ugly unless they fall all over themselves trying to help fix the mess they made.

Does it overlap any islands in the Pacific? What happens to them and their inhabitants? Probably small potatoes compared to the flooding, but it'll probably matter if they wind up with Hawaii embedded in the middle of their land.
