In order:

Yes they do know that it would cause some flooding for their land mass, and the intimidate secondary spell that would be cast is one that would basically create large walls of force to create a flood wall around the continent (there will be some flooding because the universal tunneling spell would have to finish first before they could work on the second).

Not instantaneous, I would say about a three day period.

No they don't have a clue that its inhabited. They know that the world has a rich nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere and large bodies of water, and that its in the goldylocks zone. Everything else is a mystery to them.

Yes it would, for lack of a better term, swallow smaller landmasses, though if I'm positioning this thing right it wouldn't eat Hawaii. I think, need to run those numbers again.

And finally yes, what they are doing is going to be considered an atrocity by basically everyone. We're talking about wiping out nearly a billion or so individuals in just the initial floods, let alone what famine/oil scarcity/god knows what else.
