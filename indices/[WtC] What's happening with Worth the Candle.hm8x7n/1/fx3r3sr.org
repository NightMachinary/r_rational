Writing is a bit slower than usual. While the author has mentioned specific factors like being really stressed out by lockdown and protests, (not sure how much either of those apply at the moment in the area he lives) it's not really outside the normal variance for WtC, either in writing speed or batch delay, though it is on the slow/long end. The author continues to occasionally participate in casual conversation on the discord server, we have no indication that something in particular is amiss nor that an explicit hiatus would be in place.
