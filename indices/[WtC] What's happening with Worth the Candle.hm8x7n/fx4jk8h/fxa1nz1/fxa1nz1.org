  I was able to channel some of that stress in productive ways, but it's become harder as we've gone on, and stress-fueled writing isn't really sustainable (for me).

  I wish that I were writing something else, something that was happier and less complicated, less about hard choices and trauma and messy morality.

I am going through the exact same thing. My reading habits even changed too, stories I would otherwise enjoy for the complex morality and hard choices I have found hard to engage with, while I have found stupid simple power fantasies to be a lot more enjoyable lately.

I didn't actually realize how bad it was until I read this. Your thoughts are an exact articulation of my own. I can definitely empathize, thank you for responding.
