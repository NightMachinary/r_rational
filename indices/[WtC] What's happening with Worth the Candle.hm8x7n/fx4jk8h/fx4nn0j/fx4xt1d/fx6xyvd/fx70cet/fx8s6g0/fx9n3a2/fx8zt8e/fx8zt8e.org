[[https://www.patreon.com/davidstorrs][The Two Year Emperor]] is pretty darn funny, if not necessarily happy, though the main character does strive for good outcomes. It's a D&D3.5 self-insert, player who actually knows the rules munchkinizes the whole world. Broadly in the same genre as WtC, very different story though.
