That's perfectly fine and we completely support you no matter what you choose to do!

  I wish that I were writing something else, something that was happier and less complicated, less about hard choices and trauma and messy morality.

Is there a reason why you can't do that? Wouldn't it help you if you could take a break from WtC to write something short that's less emotionally taxing for you? If you are worried about Patreon supporters, the impression I got is that most of them support your writing in general instead of just WtC.

Just a suggestion for you to think about.

Good luck!
