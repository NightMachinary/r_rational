Aww I feel your AW, my own anxiety and depression have been quite the struggle the last few months. It's hard to not feel like the world isn't falling apart when it's actually kinda apart!

It sounds like you want to keep writing WtC, but are struggling with the heavier elements. Why not do some supplemental one-shot/slice of life chapters? Stuff where the characters are less hand-picked by the DM, so the stakes are a little bit lower :). That way you can fulfill your perceived Patreon obligation while still writing something not so... Intense.
