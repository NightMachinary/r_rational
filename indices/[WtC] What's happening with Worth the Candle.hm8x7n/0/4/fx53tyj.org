I've been a fan of [[/r/oots]] since 2003. I eagerly await every update. No serialized fiction that I'm aware of, with the possible exception of Game of Thrones, is comparably slow to OOTS. Any fans lost due to slowness are long gone, and his Patreon is half again the size of yours. Don't worry about it. (And on the subject of GoT, if HBO decides in its wisdom to make a WtC series before you've finished and catches up to you, that's a /good thing/.)

You're doing fine. Take as long as you want to make a better story. You won't lose any worthwhile fans, and even the complainers will probably just catch up with the story every few months.

Take care of yourself. I'm sure you already are, it's one of those social platitudes like "drive safe", but those platitudes are basically a way of communicating "I care what happens to you" so are worth doing anyway.

On the subject of HBO/Netflix/Amazon etc series - here's a suggested side project if you'd like a distraction: pitch Shadows of the Limelight, possibly via an agent. It's coherent and comprehensible, has a /great/ gimmick, and has potential for very very cool action sequences as well as thoughtful philosophical debate. "Game of Thrones crossed with The Boys!"

Dark Wizard of Donkerk would be similarly adaptable to the screen although it'd be better as a movie than a miniseries IMO.
