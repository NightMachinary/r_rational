Another Patreon supporter - everybody's on hard times right now, and mental health is more important than ever. About a third of americans are anxious or depressed in these times[1]! It sounds like you're in the early stages of burnout, and I'd really recommend avoiding going farther - who knows how long it will take for you to recover?!

I'm not supporting a specific work (Worth the Candle), and I'm not supporting writing in general. I'm supporting an author. Take all the time you need to be well.

In my opinion, you're the best author whos work I've had the pleasure of reading.
