Somebody else commented about Patreon supporters, speaking as a Patreon supporter it literally doesn't matter what you're writing. WtC is fantastic, but your writing style is really what gets me.

If WtC is hard to write and you want to throw some time into something happier/less complicated/more relaxing for you, you've got my support 1000% and I'm sure most if not all of your fans would agree with me.

Alternatively, if you need a break from writing in general, you still have my 1000% support. Your health and well-being is infinitely more important than something I get entertainment from. Take care of yourself, friend.
