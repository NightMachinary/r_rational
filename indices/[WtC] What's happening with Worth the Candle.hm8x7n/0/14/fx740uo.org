  I wish that I were writing something else, something that was happier and less complicated, less about hard choices and trauma and messy morality.

As a (very meager) patreon supporter, write something else for a bit? I'd very likely enjoy it.

One thing I note about fanfic is that using established settings and characters lets you ignore a lot of the set up that books typically have to do, and jump right to the interesting parts of the stories.

Also, there's plenty of room for interludes in the WtC world. It's a fascinating world with a /lot/ of people. Surely some of them are doing interesting things that aren't morally ambiguous or depressing.

Presuming you keep WtC as you main focus I think there's plenty of room for other stories to be told. If you didn't keep WtC as your main focus I'd be cool with that too, I think there's value in having a finished project but I'd be interested in exploring other themes.
