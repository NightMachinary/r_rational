As many have said, please write whatever helps you, and take your time, I'm here for the marathon of your writing, not just now. I'd read flesh.txt, even though I'd expect it to be awful, and not to my tastes to see what you are writing. I'm not sure if I'm dollar voting you but I wouldn't care if you gave several releases of asides to re-teaching Blood God Doris humanity playing Bunnies & Burrows to give yourself a lighter aside.
