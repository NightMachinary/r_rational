As a patreon supporter and long time reader, please, take your time.

I wish there was more I could say to make you feel better, but I don't have the words. What I do have is this delightful link to a relevant blog post: [[https://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/05/entitlement-issues.html]]

The relevant quote being:

"George R.R. Martin is not your bitch.

This is a useful thing to know, perhaps a useful thing to point out when you find yourself thinking that possibly George is, indeed, your bitch, and should be out there typing what you want to read right now.

People are not machines. Writers and artists aren't machines."

Be well, take care, we'll be here when you're ready.
