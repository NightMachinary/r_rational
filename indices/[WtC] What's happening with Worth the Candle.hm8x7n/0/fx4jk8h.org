Writing is just going slowly. I've been stressed and anxious, and with that comes depression rearing its ugly head. There have been more than a few "zero days" in the last two months, where I'll sit down to write and nothing comes out. I think for the first part of lockdown, I was able to channel some of that stress in productive ways, but it's become harder as we've gone on, and stress-fueled writing isn't really sustainable (for me).

I wish that I were writing something else, something that was happier and less complicated, less about hard choices and trauma and messy morality. The stuff going on in the United States right now just has me perpetually pissed off and worried, which hasn't really been helped by drastically cutting down my time on the internet and blocking certain sites where I would normally get my news or numbers. It would be nice to stick my head in the sand, but it's hard to do that, and I keep having to make choices about what an acceptable level of risk is for me and my family.

As Dr. Seuss says, un-slumping yourself is not easily done, and I've found that to be doubly true when the source of the slump has stayed basically untouched. I'm sorry for anyone who's been waiting on tenterhooks, I just haven't been in a great place recently.

(For reference, "par" is 1,000 words per day for me, and the counter is currently sitting at 682, which would probably be more dire if it was a seven day trailing average.)

In case it's not obvious, I don't really want to talk about any of these issues with anyone here, just offering up an explanation, and will probably write something longer about how life has been going for me when the chapters get posted, just for context.
