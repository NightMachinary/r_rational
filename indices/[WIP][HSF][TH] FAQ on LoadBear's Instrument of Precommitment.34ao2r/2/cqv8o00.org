Interesting.

I guess my viewpoint on mindstate proliferation has always been colored by the idea of 4chan getting their hands on me. The incentive to torture is sometimes solely the torture itself, and it doesn't matter that you wouldn't get cooperation out of it. By engaging in a proliferation scheme, you're dooming some percentage of your selves to extremely unpleasurable existences. I suppose it still makes sense if you think that the percentage of selves that don't get tortured is going to be high, or if you think that a life of being tortured and abused is better than not existing even if you have alternate instantiations out there.

Am I allowed to roll back LoadBear to a previous version? Is this considered the same as killing him? Does it require his consent in order to be within the Terms?
