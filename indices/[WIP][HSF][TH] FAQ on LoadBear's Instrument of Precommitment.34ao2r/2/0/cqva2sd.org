  I suppose it still makes sense if you think that the percentage of selves that don't get tortured is going to be high, or if you think that a life of being tortured and abused is better than not existing even if you have alternate instantiations out there.
#+end_quote

There's also a few interesting caveats about identity theory: If Random-Omnipotent-4channer builds a box with a copy of you from a few years ago, tortures it, then deletes the copy... how much effort would it be worth to go to to try to stop the RO4?

  Am I allowed to roll back LoadBear to a previous version? Is this considered the same as killing him?
#+end_quote

Given that any LoadBear that's rolled back all the way to the initial mindstate is, effectively, undone, as if they'd never computed at all... it seems safe to conclude that rolling back any LoadBear to a previously-stored state would be pretty much the same as deleting the active copy, "killing" it (for whatever definition of 'killing' applies to an entity with multiple instantiations).

  Does it require his consent in order to be within the Terms?
#+end_quote

Barring some extraordinary circumstances, which would likely require third-party verification to prove actually happen... then such rollbacks without prior consent would seem to be against the Terms.
