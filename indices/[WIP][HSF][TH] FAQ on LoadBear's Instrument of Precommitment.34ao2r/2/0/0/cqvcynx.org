  Given that any LoadBear that's rolled back all the way to the initial mindstate is, effectively, undone, as if they'd never computed at all... it seems safe to conclude that rolling back any LoadBear to a previously-stored state would be pretty much the same as deleting the active copy, "killing" it (for whatever definition of 'killing' applies to an entity with multiple instantiations).

But I could (for example) save a copy of my LoadBear on a monthly basis? And according to the terms there doesn't seem to be a set minimum amount of runspeed that I'm required to give to LoadBear. So if I thought that LoadBear was doing a poor job as my customer service rep, and that he'd been doing better a month ago before he got burnt out on dealing with our recall issues, could I simply slow LoadBear down until he was at 1sec/1000sec and using minimal processing power, then boot up the month old copy of LoadBear? Does this depend entirely on my jurisdiction's definition of death and murder? I mean, speaking to you I'm pretty sure that LoadBear cares, and wouldn't like this, but the Terms aren't really clear on this, and I don't know whether it would be a breach of contract.

Incidentally, what are my options if I instantiate LoadBear but then don't want him anymore?
