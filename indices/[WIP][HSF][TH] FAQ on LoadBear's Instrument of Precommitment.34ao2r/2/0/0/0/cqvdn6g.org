  could I simply slow LoadBear down until he was at 1sec/1000sec and using minimal processing power, then boot up the month old copy of LoadBear?
#+end_quote

Yes, that would be entirely within the Terms.

#+begin_quote
  what are my options if I instantiate LoadBear but then don't want him anymore?
#+end_quote

I can't believe I haven't already included this in the FAQ.

LoadBear's recommended procedure in such a case is to put the em on pause, and copy the current Mindstate onto longer-term storage media than RAM, such as a hard-drive. If you do not wish to store even that, then the recommended procedure is to find a third party willing to hold that copy, such as LoadBearNet Alpha, and transfer it to them. (Note that in such a case, it would be poor form to continue to demand that the LoadBear in question continues to owe you for the processing power you used to run him, as part of the Terms involve said LoadBear having the opportunity to pay you back. At the very least, you should stop charging interest on that debt, and not require any payments until that LoadBear is unpaused.)
