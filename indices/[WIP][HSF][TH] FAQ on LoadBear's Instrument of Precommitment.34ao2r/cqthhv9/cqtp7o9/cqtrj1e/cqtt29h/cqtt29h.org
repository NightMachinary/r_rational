How would you figure the decoding works?

Wouldn't it be more reliable to have your statement explicitly notarised (and present in your will, the institute's records, with family members and friends, etc)?

Also by current law you're a corpse that is either the property of your family or of the cryonics institute, so they don't need consent to copy you.
