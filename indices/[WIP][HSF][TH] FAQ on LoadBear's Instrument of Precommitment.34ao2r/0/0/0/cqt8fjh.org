Hum, if you ever wanted to work in something that has a bit more handwavium again It would actually fit in a setting I'm tentatively looking for collaborators for.

For me it's mostly out of a desire to really dig into a fantastical fantasy (something like rational alice and wonderland) setting instead of just more tolkeinesque gobbos.
