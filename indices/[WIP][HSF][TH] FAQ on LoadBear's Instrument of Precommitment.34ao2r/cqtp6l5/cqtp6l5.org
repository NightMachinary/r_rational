Has anyone got some tables and charts for increasing computer power, extending Moore's Law and its relatives into the future? I want to identify some interesting moments for my future history - eg, when running an em becomes cheaper than paying a human minimum wage, or when an em can be stuffed into a human-sized chassis - but I seem to have lost my references on the topic.
