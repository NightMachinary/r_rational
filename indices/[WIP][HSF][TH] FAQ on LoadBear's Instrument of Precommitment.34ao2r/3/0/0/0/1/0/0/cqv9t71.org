Another possibility: Running an em at faster than realtime speeds requires additional CPU power, but pretty much the same amount of RAM.

I just checked [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law]] , and have made a note to see if I can work out how many kWh per subjective year a nearbaseline would need, and then compare that to typical energy prices (and overall worldwide energy production); that may give me an upper bound on em population.

I'm also going to see if there's anything similar for increasing resolution in electron micrography, which might let me pinpoint the year in which LoadBear's initial mindstate was first digitized.
