Thank you /very/ much for those tables. Running your numbers back and forth, I get the following timeline for prices of a near-baseline's storage and realtime processing:

#+begin_example
  2015: RAM: $1B. CPU: $91M.
  2020: RAM: $115M. CPU: $5.2M.
  2025: RAM: $13.3M. CPU: $300k
  2030: RAM: $1.5M. CPU: $17k.
  2035: RAM: $177k. CPU: $1000.
  2040: RAM: $20k. CPU: $58
  2045: RAM: $2371. CPU: $3.31.
  2050: RAM: $274. CPU: $0.19.
  2055: RAM: $31.61. CPU: $0.011
#+end_example

... Now, that is a /fascinating/ timeline in the context of ems.
