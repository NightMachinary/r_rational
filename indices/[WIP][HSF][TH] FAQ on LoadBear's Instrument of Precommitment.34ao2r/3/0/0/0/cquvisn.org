Allright, using the following data

[[http://www.jcmit.com/memoryprice.htm]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS#Cost_of_computing]]

I got the following fits for linear trends of [[http://i.imgur.com/GmHXdkp.png][log10(USD/megabyte)]] and [[http://i.imgur.com/dS78Iw2.png][log10(USD/GFLOPS)]].

If you extrapolate that, you get 2013 $1000 per near-baseline human's worth of storage in ~2047, and 2013 $1000 per near-baseline human's worth of processing power in ~2035. This doesn't account for ongoing costs like power, maintenance and support.
