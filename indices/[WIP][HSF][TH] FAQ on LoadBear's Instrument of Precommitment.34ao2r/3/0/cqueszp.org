That would depend entirely on simulation fidelity, though - synapse/molecule-level simulation as opposed to emulating higher-level mental processes (and we don't have a good idea of how much computing either would require to begin with). Even assuming Moore's law continues to hold - not a particularly probable assumption - insufficient data for meaningful answer.
