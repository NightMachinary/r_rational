I've skimmed a blog a while ago that discussed dating, and in particular one post I remember was it analysed the consequences of choosing particular okcupid questions as either important or not. I couldn't find the post again, and since it was probably coming either from [[/r/rational]], rationalist-adjacent facebook friends, or rationalist tubmlr, I was hoping someone would know what I'm talking about and could find it.

The particular trick I remember was a way of compressing your 'matching %' range from 80-100 to 90+-100 (so that the relative order of matches is the same, but the numbers are higher), by treating some questions as less or more important. But I can't really remember the details.
