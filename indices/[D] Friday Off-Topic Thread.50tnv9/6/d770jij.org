Is anyone here watching Mr Robot? I haven't made a main post about it because it's not text fiction, but I think it meets all of the criteria for rational. And beside that, it's fucking awesome. Great writing, great story, great acting, great cinematography, great music, great message.

It's kinda hard to talk about it without spoilers though.
