It think it also bears noting, that I'm fairly sure that the lack of comforting lies like this never bothers someone who never had them to begin with. For instance I've heard some people who used to be religious bemoan the loss of their comforting beliefs, but people who never believed in such a thing never seem to have that.

I for one as someone who always implicitly assumed people were just a relatively insignificant part of a deterministic universe, always get confused when people (especially people were were never religious) bemoan these sorts of things.\\
I cannot really get what people would even mean when talking about life having meaning unless they're religious and they believe their life has a literal plan put down by some intelligence. In that case I can only imagine that would be comforting, if you think that that would guarantee your life's plan will turn out good long term.\\
Many other cases are even more confusing for me, for instance I can't imagine what a "belief in the goodness of humanity" would even mean unless you predict some difference in observed behavior. If a belief doesn't actually lead you to have different expectations I /literally/ cannot conceive of what it would mean.
