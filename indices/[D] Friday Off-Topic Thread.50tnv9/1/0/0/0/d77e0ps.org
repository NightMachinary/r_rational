Isn't that just growing up, though? Yes, people get a bit disillusioned as they learn more about the world; and it takes work to reestablish the emotional valence of some ideas that used to be simple. But you can definitely still do it.

Taking your example, if you think about it a bit more, the fact that there isn't one soulmate that you have to wait for means you have a chance to actually make a successful relationship happen. You can work at it, rather than wait for it to happen to you. This, to me, is a positive thought.

I find that many concepts work in the same way. You lose some naive positivity, but in trade you find out more about how things really work, and how to turn that to your advantage.

Successful relationships have grown more impressive to me, rather than less, once I learned that they actually take work. If that's not the case for you, try to figure out why?

Of course sometimes you'll find out about something that you can't help at all. And that sucks, and getting over it can often be difficult. I have no advice there other than with time I've grown numb to the impossible to solve problems (their impossibility actually helping here, I feel, because it means I don't feel responsible at all); while the ones where I have hope of success have grown more important to me.

If it's just the loss of simplicity, of naive optimism, that you're mourning, - rather than any subject that you were naive about in particular - then I'm afraid I can't help you there. Sure, being naively happy and childish is cute. In children. And fictional characters that always succeed due to Manic Pixie Dream Girl plot armor.

But I don't envy it in adults.
