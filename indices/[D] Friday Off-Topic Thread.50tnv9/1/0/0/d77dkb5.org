It's not a binary thing. It's not like something has value or it doesn't. It's just the mystical sheen surrounding certain concepts has been brutally torn away and I regret their loss.

For example, the concept of "the one". That used to be a comfort to me, when I was younger. "Oh, Becky doesn't like me. But that's ok, the one is out there!"

Ha. No. I'm not pessimistic. I know there's more than enough women out there that I could find one to be happy with. But it's also possible that I never find one to be happy with. I don't say that to whine or complain; but my innate knowledge of that possibility dims my view on relationships quite a bit.
