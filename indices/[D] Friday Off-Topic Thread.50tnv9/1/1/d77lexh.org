You are making sense!

You might not have heard of the [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Joy_in_the_Merely_Real][Sequence about that]].

Also, I have a relevant mini-rant regarding [[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/66591-all-right-said-susan-i-m-not-stupid-you-re-saying-humans][this Terry Pratchett quote]], which I'm going to test out:

Sure, there are no atoms of justice or molecules of mercy. But there are no atoms of chairs or computers either, yet anyone claiming either of those to be a lie would be seen as delusional. There are real /arrangements of matter in the universe/ that fit your concepts of chairs and computers, just like there are real arrangements of matter in the universe that fit your concepts of justice-recognizing-and-improving-thing and mercy-recognizing-and-improving-thing. What difference does it make to their reality that the latter sets happen to exist in people's brains instead of in visible external objects?
