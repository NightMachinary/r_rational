There are several (many?) stories I read that posit that the universe is cold and indifferent, or outright hostile and actively rooting against you, and that the only meaning that life has is the meaning you *choose* to give it.

Yes, we are shaped by our environment ... dashed to and fro, but we make the choices and we shape it (and the rest of us) in return.

As they say in the /African Queen/: Charlie Alnutt (trying to explain away his drinking): "... It's only human nature." Rose Sayer: "Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put in this world to rise above."

If the idea of an uncaring (or hostile) universe doesn't strike you as inspiring, I recommend the "Welcome to Nightvale" podcast, or "Awake in the Night Land." I'm sure there are others.
