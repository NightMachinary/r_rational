Rationalism actually /convinced/ me of the innate goodness of humanity. If, in general, people were not fundamentally gentle, kind, and caring society would fall apart fast. The temporary power gained by even small betrayals is so out-of-proportion with the amount of effort required that if people were even slightly more selfish and unforgiving they'd be stabbing each other in the back all the time.

Sure, there are rare exceptions... and the obvious damage they do (and the largely undamaged state of the social fabric) makes it obvious how rare they must be.

No individual necessarily has an innate goodness, but humanity absolutely does.
