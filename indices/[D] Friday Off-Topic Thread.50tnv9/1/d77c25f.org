Does anyone ever get tired of being a rationalist? Or, even less pretentiously, just having rationalist tendencies? Specifically I ask because of how some of the "magic" of life seems to be gone. I'm not talking depression or anything that severe but I feel like I've lost my belief in things like true love, the innate goodness of humanity, life having an overarching purpose, etc. because it seems so trivial and easy to break those concepts down into 1s and 0s (metaphorically speaking). Life has no purpose beyond the one we give it. Love is a series of biochemical reactions. Humans aren't innately good; we're innately nothing and shaped by our surroundings more than anything else.

I'm the type of person where I need to know the truth. It's almost compulsive. But I feel like I may have had an easier time being happy if I'd never stumbled across the rational path of thinking. But, even having come to that conclusion, I can't just turn it off. It's like someone pointing out a crack in a glass you thought was perfect. You just can't unsee it.

Am I making any sense or am I just being a classically whiny millennial?
