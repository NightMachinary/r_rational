Just because you know how those things work doesn't mean they have to lose meaning for you. The only thing that has changed is your knowledge, after all. The things themselves remained unchanged when you learned how they work. If empathy and helping a person in pain felt awesome before, it still should! If loving someone felt amazing, knowing that it's a chemical reaction shouldn't lessen the feeling because nothing about love changed. Only you did.
