That's sad. I corellate such feelings more with general depression, than with the rationalist tendencies.

You have to remember - just because you can explain love, take it apart, doesn't mean it's no longer a thing. A rainbow shouldn't stop being pretty just because you know it's the result of light hitting droplets of water in the air.

It seems like you have a tendency of only assigning value to mystical, unachievable things. I'd suggest trying to dig deeper into why that is. In the meantime; carpe diem!

p.s. sorry if this sounds condescending, or dismissive. I don't mean it so, but I spent 5 minutes on this and couldn't find a better way of conveying the idea.
