I've done some further tweaking to the spreadsheet you created, and have ended up with [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CZ565cTZh0upkiE3aeHqOVxybI38Fwn6zSpPT2YVGGY/edit#gid=0][this]]. It still has a few simplifying assumptions, such as that ems don't influence the manufacturing rate of CPUs, but I figured out how to set it up to handle a few basic tweakable parameters, such as the date ems become possible, how many CPU cycles an em requires, and such.

I'll admit that I'm not sure how to let anyone else toy with those parameters, short of making their own copy of the spreadsheet, but I feel it's been worth the time. :)

Anyone reading this have any thoughts on further possible improvements?
