I have some initial estimates of the number of em-years per year on page 37 of [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRSRWbAqtC48rPv5NG6kzggL3HXSJ1O93jFn3fgu0Rs/edit][this Gdoc]] ; I'm trying to get some intuitive feel for how long it would take for ems, in this scenario, to have lived through more person-years than, say, biological humanity has since 50,000 BC. (Or 1 AD, or some other distant-past moment.) And then how long it would take for that amount of mind-years to be gone through yet again.

Put another way, I'm trying to quantify just how weird em culture will get, and how quickly, from a bio-human point of view (or the PoV of a not-very-fast em). Maybe 'person-years' is a bad unit of measure here; but it's the most measurable approximation I can think of for 'amount of valuable contributions to society'.

Short version of the above - how ridiculous does the graph get if you alter the numbers to match the GDoc I linked? :)
