Oh, good point! I find myself making predictions on what happens next, detecting foreshadowings and interesting moments. Although I am not convinced that it's solvable. For instance, [[#s][eps2.6_succ3ss0r.p12 spoiler]] would be very hard to predict. On the one hand, we know from [[#s][season 1 spoiler]] and the general lifestyle of Elliot is suggestive. But on the other hand, there is other evidence [[#s][eps2.2_init_1.asec spoiler]] that makes it much less predictable.

Actually, now that you've mentioned it, I found [[/r/MrRobot/]], which seems to have all I want.
