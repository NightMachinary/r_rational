By that logic, you shouldn't care if something is illegal then. Laws aren't psychic shackles; they're rules with consequences. Truly, you can break any law you like, if you're comfortable with the potential consequences. Potentially going to prison is just as much a consequence as potentially killing yourself on an AI highway.

You're equating human laws to control over human autonomy, which isn't strictly the case. If you're going to stick to your guns and say that you're okay with this restriction and that risk, you eventually get to a point where the potential risks and repercussions of your valued autonomy are equivalent to ignoring the laws present and risking jail time.
