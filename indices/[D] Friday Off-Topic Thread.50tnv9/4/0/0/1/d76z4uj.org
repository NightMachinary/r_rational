Things individuals do with their own property aren't inviolate currently, though. They're subject to restrictions. Maybe your values dislike those restrictions too, but if it's not a universal absolute, that's not quite addressing the potential of status quo bias. Can you think of an exception that you're okay with? Something you agree humans shouldn't be allowed to do with their own property?

Also, what if people were still allowed to drive their own cars but had 100% liability for any accidents and harm they're involved in. Would you be okay with that?
