Maybe the robots are a red herring.

Suppose you don't like your house and want to build a nicer one on the same terrain, which is also yours. Are you allowed to just blow it up with your own explosives?

It's your property and your life on the line, but most people would agree you should hire a (human) professional. Do you agree with that? Is it the robot part or the freedom part that bothers you the most?
