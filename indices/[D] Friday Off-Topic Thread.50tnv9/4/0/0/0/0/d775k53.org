The freedom part. I love robotic drivers and will encourage people to use them at every opportunity, I just think it's wrong to force people to. In the example you give, I am completely okay with regulations surrounding how the demolition is carried out like permits, but I equate the banning of human drivers to forbidding the property owner to have any role in the demolition beyond requesting it.
