I still consider that a violation of a person's rights. Smoking zones work because the behavior it regulates is recreational and can be performed anywhere, but restrictions on roads means depriving someone of transportation infrastructure. I'm okay with regulating the behavior of people that use public infrastructure because the property is owned by the community, but cars are owned by their drivers.I will happily restrict how a person is allowed to use to use their property, but not what they're allowed to use it for (zoning laws are a different situation).

Using the example of the building demolition, I think it is entirely appropriate to require permits, licenses, and public notifications to perform the demolition, but you can still do it yourself if you choose to go through all that hassle. You are not legally required to place control of your property into someone else's hands, it's just easier if you do. It's poses risk to yourself and others and you are liable for anything that goes wrong, but I still believe you have a right to make that decision even if I disagree with it. I would discourage the decision, but never deny it.
