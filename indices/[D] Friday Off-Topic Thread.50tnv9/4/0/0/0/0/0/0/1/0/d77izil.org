I agree, but I don't want that to come at the cost of the individual's right to choose. I value human autonomy too much to deny it, even if someone may make a bad choice. I oppose smoking bans for the same reason, even if I think smoking is a horrible thing that I would never do and discourage everyone from doing.

Just because I think robots should replace human drivers doesn't mean I think they /must/. The impaired condition you speak of is the fact that the user is human. If a human is forced to surrender their freedom of choice without their permission, I consider that a violation of my rights even if they would grant that permission.
