No, it horrifies me because it applies universally. This isn't a matter of doing work better, like with automation or assistance in the workplace, but something individuals do of their own volition with their own property. Their actions effect other people, of course, but I value a person's control over their own property and would consider a law that forbids them from directly controlling their property as a consequence of owning it to conflict with that value.
