As I said, I don't think driving will ever be completely illegal.

Just like smoking it will only be legal in certain places where the danger to other people is minimal and/or mutually accepted.

I sincerely doubt there will ever be a ban on driving on private property, and I'm sure there will be lots of driving tracks which open up to accommodate people who still want to drive.

I don't think it will ever completely disappear simply because so many people treat cars as a hobby. But I do think roads where people are allowed to drive will become the exception, not the rule. And I think that's a good thing.
