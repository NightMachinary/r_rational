Correct, but smoking is also endangers people besides the person making the choice and we don't ban that. Instead, we restrict how a person is allowed to smoke to minimize the risk and discourage the activity. I believe smoking is an objectively bad thing, but I also believe I do not have the right to deny someone the choice of whether to smoke. It's a bad choice, but it's their choice. I feel the exact same way about self-driving cars.
