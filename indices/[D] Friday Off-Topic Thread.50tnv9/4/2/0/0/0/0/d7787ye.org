That's what I was asking earlier, though. Where do you draw the line?

Is it okay if people are only banned from driving on highways, now assigned as special high speed "autopilot-only"? Is it okay if people can only drive themselves at human walking speeds? Is it okay if people can only drive themselves if they wear special protective clothing and paint their car bright orange with hazard signs and lights on it?

Is it okay if the autopilot is allowed to override their driving when it notices an unsafe situation?
