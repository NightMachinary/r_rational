I think differentiating the ban based on geography would be economically inefficient and generally unfair. I would be okay with compulsory robot driving for people who already have legal restrictions on their license since those restrictions are based on personal ability or history of behavior.

While I suppose having separate laws for human and robot drivers would work, I would not prefer it since it seems discriminatory. I want individuals to choose to let robots drive because they're better drivers, or its just easier to do, not because the law directly encourages it.
