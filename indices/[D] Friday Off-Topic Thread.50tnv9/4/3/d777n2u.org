I can understand your sentiment, however at one point, the human has to leave the driver's seat behind and become a passenger. This is probably in the next 50-75 years, however, so I expect a much more effected Self-Driving car system by then than we have now.

My second concern, however, is people getting all hot-and-heavy with networking in cars, and their security. As someone who has followed Self-Driving cars steadily, as well as IT security, I am terrified of a rogue state or FBI guy not liking an activists opinion and then slamming the car into a tree or highway traffic at 70+ mph.
