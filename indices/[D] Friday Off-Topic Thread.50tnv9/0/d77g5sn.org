Is it just me, or does anyone else enjoy stories where they're fighting against nature/natural systems more than they enjoy character battles? As part of rational writing, gaming the system to 'munchkin' yourself to victory is awesome, but my favorite parts are always the training arcs where MC is fighting some mountain in their path (more literal than figurative) or whatever to gain their OP munchkin power.

A character exploring with no one watching, what they can do, getting into their heads, and seeing the way they think, what they think, et cetera, how they approach problems is fascinating for me. Then, the return to everyone they left behind in whatever situation with their newfound power, is really cool.

The sad thing is, I don't know of many stories where you have a good training arc where you really get into your character's head and the way they think.
