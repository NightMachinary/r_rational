Theory: when you have two agents fighting either one of them is evil, usually in a stupid way, or you have actual moral conflict, which can be pretty unenjoyable if you're just looking for a power fantasy.

Fighting against natural disasters etc works around that problem.

I think liking training / coming-into-power arcs is pretty common. It's easier to emphasise with a non-all-powerful character, and you still get the power fantasy once they actually get there.
