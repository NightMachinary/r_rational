*Any spreadsheet jockeys who can help?*

I've had a thought which might help with some of my writing, but I don't quite have the chops to work out the details. In short, I want to try comparing how long it takes for a billion person-years to pass, in various eras, and with various assumptions about ems and computing-capacity. Anyone here who might be able to help me draw a few graphs and charts?
