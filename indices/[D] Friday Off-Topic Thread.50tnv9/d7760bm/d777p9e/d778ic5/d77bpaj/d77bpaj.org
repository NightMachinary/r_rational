[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EUNyIGsNp4VfQgZiVAcygF-0PJJKYxRquoqevKITLs8/edit?usp=sharing][Here]] is a new spreadsheet, that compares Billion-Person-years accumulated over each five years, as well as a cumulative total. the human population numbers are a bit off because I was just eyeballing a graph, and the calculations aren't quite correct, but it should give a good idea.

Tl;DR: The Em population will have as much Em culture as human culture in their history by ~2062.
