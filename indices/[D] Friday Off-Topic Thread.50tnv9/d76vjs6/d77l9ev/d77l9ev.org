I read some of the replies. I will be the personal holdout. I machine some of the parts to the cars I have built. I will drive the cars I build and when someone decides to remove my ability to drive using a piece of paper. I will drive whichever car I still have into the people that agreed on the paper. I am irrational. I am human.
