This week, CPGrey released a video where he extolled the virtues of self-driving cars and how they'd make navigating traffic better for all of us. While I agree completely, at one point he suggested banning human drivers from the road, an idea to which I instinctively react to with horror. Not because I'm afraid of robots, but because my values include human autonomy.

I think that forcing a person to use an autopilot instead of giving them the option to do so is a violation of a person's rights. I'm all for incentivizing people to use autopilot, including making manual operation more difficult, but for human society to decide that humans cannot be trusted to do something for themselves horrifies me. Does anyone else feel this way?
