We're assuming a world in which robots are better at driving than people, yes? Would not restrictions on human's driving in that case be based on "personal ability"? All humans necessarily includes /each/ human.

Alternately, if it's not fair to ban humans from driving in order to save lives, improve efficiency, and save money... why is it fair to ban humans with significant vision impairment in order to do the same thing?

Would you also rather legally blind people choose voluntarily not to drive?

Or speed limits. Should people be allowed to choose voluntarily to remain below particular speeds in residential areas because they understand how much safer it is?
