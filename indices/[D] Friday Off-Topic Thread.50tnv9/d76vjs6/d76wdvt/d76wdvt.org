Where do you draw the line?

Is it okay to ban human driving on certain roads? In certain municipalities? For drivers with less than perfect vision or hearing? How about drivers above or below particular ages? Drivers with multiple DUIs?

Is it fair to ban human driving above particular speeds? Is autonomy restricted if drivers are made to stop rather than simply yield at red lights?
