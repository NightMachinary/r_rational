How about this argument, then:

By comparison to robodrivers, humans /are/ impaired. We get distracted. We sing to the radio and close our eyes. We pay too much attention to our phones. Humans just aren't good at driving! It's not something we're even close to optimized are.

So if you're ok with banning impaired drivers, why are you not ok with applying the same logic to objectively impaired (by comparison) humans?
