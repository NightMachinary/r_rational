The problem is that you're not only trading off your own life, but the lives of other people as well, and those people have a right to stay alive while in transit. Transport accidents are one of the major causes of death and it's hard to argue that people have a right to choose to drive on public roads when there is a much safer feasible alternative.

In the end, people will not be deprived of the ability to drive cars manually, it's just going to be confined to venues where all the participants are willing to take the risk, akin to track days.
