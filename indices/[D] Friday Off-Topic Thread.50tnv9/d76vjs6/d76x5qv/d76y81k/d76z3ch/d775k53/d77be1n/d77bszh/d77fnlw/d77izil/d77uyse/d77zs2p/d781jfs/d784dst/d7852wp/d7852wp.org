  Restrictions on roads means depriving someone of transportation infrastructure.

That's not necessarily true though. Hypothetically speaking, we could imagine some scheme that would subsidise the installation of self-driving hardware, in which case it would really come down to some people being stubborn and fucking things up for everyone else.

I don't think modern democratic governments will be capable of just outright banning people from driving on the public roads for long while yet. We'll be probably dealing with larger issues by the time your worry actually starts being relevant.
