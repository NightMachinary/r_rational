I predict that with the rise of self-driving cars, the requirements that one has to meet to get a driving license would dramatically rise, too. Even though a baseline human is impaired as a driver compared to a self-driving car, there /are/ extremely well-trained professionals. No need to ban /every/ human. Just the ones that are too dangerous.
