I really do agree that the world would be better if we only used self-driving cars, what I object to is forcing people to use them. Even if robots are better drivers than humans ever will be, the idea that humans should be forbidden to drive conflicts with my values. Not because of potential unintended consequences, but because I believe that humans have a right to choose to do it themselves even if a robot would do it better.
