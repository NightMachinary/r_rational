I imagine people will always be allowed to drive on private property and designated tracks.

But I don't think people should have the rights to drive their cars on public roads when there's clearly a superior system in place. It's a matter of public safety, not an inalienable right.

It's different when the only life you're endangering is your own, but on a public road one person driving recklessly can endanger the lives of a dozen others or more.
