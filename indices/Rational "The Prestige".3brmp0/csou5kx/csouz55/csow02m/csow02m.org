I assume you're refering to this:

#+begin_quote
  (This partly assumes a good sort of world where a single company doesn't have a complete monopoly on the matter replicator.)
#+end_quote

I don't mean that access to the replicators should be uncontrolled; just that if it were in the hands of a singular profit-motivated organization, the incentives might be skewed towards doing nothing to actually improve quality of life. Because this single company would have a monopoly, there would be no reason for them to do much more than act conservative and undercut their competitors.

The free market is already dead, at least for a few years. Metals can be replicated, and pretty much all of the countries of the time have a currency that's backed by gold or silver. Further, the advent of the replicator eliminates 90% of all jobs. So you have a period of mass unemployment with an inability for anyone to actually pay for things. In the capitalist version of the story, eventually the world settles back into the service/information economy of the modern day first world. In the socialist version, someone like Stalin distributes goods to the masses.
