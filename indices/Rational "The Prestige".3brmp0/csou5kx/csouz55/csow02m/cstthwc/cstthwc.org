I think his claim is more general as a weakness of that universe. If you could replicate anything then you take a replicator, some tools\weapons, a generator and fuel, and start replicating everything(yourself, generators, fuel, weapons\tools), in theory within a day or a week or a month you could have an infinite army, assuming you are the kind of person that would be willing to fight and die for yourself\your idea.

You could try to control the replicators, but in a world where all you need to replicate anything is a replicator all it would take is one(or two?) unauthorized replication of a replicator, and immediately -everyone- will have replicators.. So unless something is implemented the world could easily devolve into an infinite war..
