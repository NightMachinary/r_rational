It's going to be important to remember that Tesla tried to make wireless broadcast power, in part (or despite) it then being free for all... So he's definitely got a major altruistic streak that would greatly effect what he does with the technology. However, the timeline (end of the nineteenth century) occurs a bit before all that...

You should also consider that in this universe, Tesla himself is the first person of serious note to have access to this technology... and the idea of what an army of Teslas could accomplish boggles the mind. Aside from anything predictable (robots and drones, a century early, wireless broadcast power) based on the real world, you'd also want to consider technologies (such as the originally intended teleportation) derived from the machine and it's operation, and potentially any of the crazier ideas from later in his life (pulling power via solar resonance, particle beam cannons), as in this universe physics is both more permissible and/or Tesla is even more of a genius.

TL;DR - A universe in which Tesla invents a cloning machine has it socks rocked off in way more ways than just a "now there's a matter replicator".
