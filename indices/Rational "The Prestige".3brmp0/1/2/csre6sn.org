  Production focus is then on producing the highest quality of a single good, then replicating it

For an example of this in the real world (kinda), look at the software industry. All the costs are upfront, and once you have your software product, the actual production costs to make a copy are negligible. And if someone else has made a slightly better version of what you were both making, they get a vast proportion of the market and you go broke, unless you can out advertise them.

So, there will also be first to market, brand development and advertising. But a lot of manufacturing businesses would be out of business.
