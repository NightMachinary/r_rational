It's something that I've given a lot of thought. Not with The Prestige generally, but with matter replication that also works on people. If you're changing the characters around, then the biggest constant that you're bringing over from The Prestige is the setting, which limits us somewhat in terms of technology but I don't think substantially changes the outcomes of the technology.

Matter replication is by itself incredibly useful. Depending on energy considerations (which as you say, can't be too high given how we see it used) it now makes more sense to replicate most things instead of making a second copy of them. Mass production and replaceable parts are both made obsolete. Scarcity of goods is mostly eliminated; you only need a single chicken to feed a thousand people, you only need a single suit to clothe an entire city, etc. Production focus is then on producing the highest /quality/ of a single good, then replicating it. Aside from these artisans (the men and women who make the initial item for copying, or the ones who adapt existing templates into something more bespoke) the economy switches to a service/information economy. (This partly assumes a good sort of world where a single company doesn't have a complete monopoly on the matter replicator.)

People replication by itself is incredibly useful. Angier was the sort of person who would kill himself, but that comes down to fear or ego (or both). The governments of the world could use the people replicator to crew a ship with only their most skilled sailors. They could replicate scientists, engineers, and scholars. Generally speaking, the most useful people will be the ones replicated, and I would expect revolutions to follow (though it should also be said that the people most comfortable with replication also have an advantage here). Social standards need to change in order to allow for this, there are questions of what it means for marriage, what it means to have a contract, etc. but I don't think these concerns are insurmountable.
