I actually feel that this is one of those rare movies that's better than the book. The book feels a bit dry (like much sci-fi) just an exploration of a certain interesting concept, with a basic plot thrown on top. Like "Robinson Crusoe" or "Memoirs of an Invisible Man", or even much of Asimov. (Not that I that I don't enjoy that style, mind you). I felt the movie took the core idea and made a much more interesting and engaging tale with it from a narrative/dramatic point of view.

That said, I really like your alternative ending.
