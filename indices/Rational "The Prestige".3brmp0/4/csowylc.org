There's been a number of variants of this in SF, depending on how you deal with "the soul problem" and whether you can record a template. One of them let you stop the replication part way, giving you a partially finished mass that could be either replicated or brought to completion. Society broke down to strongholds manned by armies of soldiers copied at the peak of their physical ability...

Rationally, a lot of people are going to be irrational about this, treating replicated people as zombies or something and demanding a mechanism to tell replicas from reality.

I don't think it's going to be controllable unless there's something stopping you from replicating the key components of a replicator. Replicated pirate replicators are going to get out and once that happens it's game over for any kind of control of the technology.
