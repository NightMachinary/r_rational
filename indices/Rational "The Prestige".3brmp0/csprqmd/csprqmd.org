Damnit, just got my comment ate by Reddit.

You could write a story about the insane technological shift this device would create. It might even be a fun story. But it wouldn't be rational!/The Prestige/; it would be a clever, hard sci-fi tale about the social impact of physics-breaking matter-duplicators.

(Dear God, you can duplicate a battery using less energy than it supplies with this thing. It has literally nothing limiting it.)

But ... who says Angiers has to be a /good guy/? Who says he has to be altruistic, or even care about money very much? [[https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10153452168904228?pnref=story][Why can't he just want crazy selfish things?]]

I'd suggest a tale about a madman duplicating himself, working in shifts with his copies, all to outcompete a mere human and quietly live in infinite luxury on Mars. Maybe from the perspective of Edison, investigating Tesla's impossible murder.
