Characters are large; they contain multitudes. Given any one specific scenario, there are a number of ways for a character to act which are "in character".

So if you want to maintain the characters but you want the plot to be "implications of a duplication device at the end of the 19th century", you have to ask yourself what sort of bridge can possibly be made between the existing events and characterization, and what you want the outcome to be.

In this case, I don't think it's impossible that such a bridge exists, and that a clever enough author could make it work while not having to change the characters beyond what growth they experience over the course of the new story. You don't /start/ with Angier deciding to use the duplicator to revolutionize the world, you start with a moment of hesitation before he shoots that first clone.

(Which isn't to say that there's anything wrong with a story where Angier just decides to do something wildly out of character, I just agree with you that if an author is abandoning both plot and characterization, you're usually better off just writing something original.)
