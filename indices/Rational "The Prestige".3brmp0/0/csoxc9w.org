In terms of structuring a story for plot ...

I think the logical place to start is around when Angier clones himself for the first time. You have to sort of understand Angier's motivations if you want to write him. He comes from money, so the idea of material wealth is ... not /foreign/, but making money was never what his life was about. It was never something he had to concern himself with. He's also not a man with particularly much empathy for others, especially after the death of Julia.

So I think the story is about empathy. You start just before Angier shoots himself (so that the point of divergence is that he realizes that he's violating the Golden Rule, and that this reaction is a disordered one). I think you'd probably split them; both recognizing their ego in some way, one Angier goes back to stagecraft, while the other Angier goes to work on the machine. There will come a time when reconciliation is required, but for a moment both can pretend that the other doesn't exist, and that they'll find their own successes independent of each other. It's only later on that they come into conflict.
