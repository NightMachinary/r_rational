I think the heist film style would break down after the AIs become super-intelligent. Max probably has some ideas of how this all went down, but if he just wrote it all out it would inevitably be ridiculously simplistic compared to what should have been going on in a three-way hard take-off. Even as it is, he has me going, "come on, [[#s][spoiler]]". Keeping the clear exposition of the AIs' plans into the super-intelligent phase doesn't seem like it would have worked.
