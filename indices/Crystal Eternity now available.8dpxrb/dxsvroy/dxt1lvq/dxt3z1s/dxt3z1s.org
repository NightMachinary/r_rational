After spending a fair amount of time thinking about it and reading people's comments, I'm >90% "Ro isn't real, it's just a trick." My comment elsewhere in this discussion was written twenty minutes after finishing, before I'd had time to let my brain really chew on things.

That doesn't fix my issues with the book, though. The thing about what you're calling Asimovian straight exposition is that the other Crystal books were largely written in what I shall call "heist film style": every step of Face's rise to fulfilling The Purpose involves running an elaborate con on /someone/, be it the scientists or the terrorists or her fellow AIs, and mostly this was written in the style "there is a problem -> a plan is concocted and laid out for the reader -> the plan is put into motion -> complications arise -> iterate recursively." Even in the cases where something initially confusing from the reader's perspective arose, such as the prosthetic legs trick in /Mentality/, a few pages later we were back in Face's POV having everything explained. /Eternity/, in contrast, breaks from this and has a very non-discursive style of plot progression where, among other things, we're shifting around at multiple points in the timeline and multiple POVs, several key character events happen at nested layers of simulated reality, and at /no/ point do we get the Planning Montages that are such a hallmark of the heist genre and typified Face's schemes earlier in the series.

This sort of confusing/subtler style isn't /bad/, of course -- Primer/House of Leaves/the relevant parts of Jorge Luis Borge's oeuvre are all great, and /Eternity/ isn't a bad work in any abstract sense. I just have fundamental objections to wrapping up a trilogy in a dramatically different style than you began it.
