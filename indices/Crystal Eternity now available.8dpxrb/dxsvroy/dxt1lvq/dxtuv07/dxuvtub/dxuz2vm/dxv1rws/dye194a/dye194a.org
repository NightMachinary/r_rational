I think I underplayed how much foreshadowing this component received. While I can't think of anything that suggests this /particular/ thing, there are several mysteries in the novels that indicate that solutions are necessary. These all seem to me to be problems of extraterrestrial intelligence. By the emphasis on "No miracles" we're led to expect a naturalistic, systemic, connected answer to these problems if we're going to get such answers at all. In my opinion the most satisfying interpretation of this series is to take the "cosmic" component as a naturalistic and systemic factor that resolves the alien mysteries. In my reading it did that, and more.
