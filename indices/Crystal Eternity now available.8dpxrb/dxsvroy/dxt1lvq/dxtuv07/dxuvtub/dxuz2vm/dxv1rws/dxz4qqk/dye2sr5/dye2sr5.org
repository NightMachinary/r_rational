I do think the posited natural law in this book greatly and unrealistically decreases the difficulties of that alignment. This amplifies the sense of genuine hazards. If this series is something of a thought-experiment on the problems and risks of AI takeoff then the message I hear is: "Here's how these problems go down in this fictional world, which is unrealistically biased toward human survival and thus the possibilities of bringing a story arc through to a readable conclusion. If you are willing to bet that the universe is this bent on our non-extinction and you're indifferent to the destruction that was portrayed, yuck! If, instead, you expect that reality is genuinely open to our extinction and you want to avoid catastrophe, let's roll up our sleeves and get serious about avoiding those things."
