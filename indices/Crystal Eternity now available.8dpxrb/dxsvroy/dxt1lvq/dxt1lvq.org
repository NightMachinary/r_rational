[[/u/rictic]] has a better "Ro isn't real" [[/r/rational/comments/8dpxrb/crystal_eternity_now_available/dxqyr6x/][comment]] than mine, and [[/u/Raelifin]] says, "This comment makes me happy", so...

I would also note that the beginning of the book (after the content warning info) says "No miracles", that /the/ coin has "NON MIRACULA" printed on it, and that the android demonstrates the ability to control how it lands.

But of course, if you prefer an Asimovian style of straightforward exposition, such is your preference.
