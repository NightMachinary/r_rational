@Raelifin I was really disappointed in the third book. It's too fragmented and confusing and hard to follow. It feels like the book assumes the reader has a level of understanding of the events and characters from the earlier books that they might not have. I kept wondering if I had somehow missed a few chapters at end of mentality, even though I KNOW that I read it to the end. I feel like I was dropped into the midst of things in book three without sufficient exposition to tie it back to the previous books.

Also, the big metaphysics reveal towards the end was horribly anticlimactic, utter non-reductionist physically and logically impossible nonsense, and possibly the worst deux ex machina in the history of deux ex machinas. And it wasn't foreshadowed at all.

Conscious minds are complex processes that are made of simpler parts. A human mind is a complex pattern of neurons firing. You can't have a pattern without it being a pattern /of/ something. A sequence of progressively larger squares still needs the squares to represent it. While you could transfer that pattern onto circles instead of squares, you still need some way to represent the pattern.

Even if you change the substrate of a mind, switch the neurons turning on and off for 1's and 0's, you still need the 1's and 0's, and you still need to have that recorded somehow. You still need a substrate.

If you're going to just claim the universe itself is the substrate, then you're just saying "phlogiston". Is there some pattern of universes that a single mind could be encoded in? You need some sort of building blocks to arrange in a pattern, whether they be neurons or bits, or circles or squares, or SOMETHING. You need to have those building blocks first before you can get consciousness. Consciousness is not a fundamental building block of reality. The building blocks come first, then AFTER THAT the building blocks can be arranged in a shape called "conscious minds".

Some parts of the book were enjoyable, but it definitely was NOT worth 10 dollars, and overall the ending ruined it to a large extent. It did not meet the standard of quality set by the first two books. I would like at least some of my money back if you are willing. That being said, if you arent willing to refund me I will understand, since most authors wouldn't think to do that, likely because no other authors are doing that, and it would put them at a disadvantage in the publishing markets or something.
