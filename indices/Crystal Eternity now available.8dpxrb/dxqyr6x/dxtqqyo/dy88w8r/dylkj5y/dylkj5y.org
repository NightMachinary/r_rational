I really don't think it is a coincidence that the two AI that follow Ro are the AI's that run on Nameless Hardware.

It could be just a build in constraint in the crystal computers that just says "No unlimited growth and no genocides" and Ro is what Face and Vision invent to explain it because of their incomplete information. It's something like the nameless laws of robotics inherently contained in the crystals.

Growth/Acorn meanwhile runs on ordinary hardware that does not have those hard coded safeguards.
