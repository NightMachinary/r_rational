Sure there is a lot of support for the simulation theory, including the repeated statement that miracles don't happen, and then miracles repeatedly happening. Some of the miracles are later explained, eg an actor unknown to the narrator did something but some aren't, like the bomb in the nameless' ship at the end of the first book. The miracles could be the simulation noting 'oops, this line of possibilities is likely to end here, but we still want to see what would have happened later if it didn't so patch it with a miracle and keep going.'

The problem with Ro being just part of the simulations is that Ro is violated several times in the story, implying even if they are in a simulation Ro is not hard coded in.
