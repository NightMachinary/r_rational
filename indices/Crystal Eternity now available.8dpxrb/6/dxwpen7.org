Thanks for the fun read! And congrats on finishing the work, far too few amateur authors actually finish their stories, so it is good to see this great idea reached its conclusion.

I do have to echo the criticisms the other commenters wrote. By far the most enjoyable part of this trilogy has been reading the chapters from Face's POV. This book is sort of disappointing in that respect. I don't really understand the artistic decision to spend so much time in other POVs or to structure the book in this non-linear fashion as it for me personally, it took away from the story.

I like the idea of Ro being left ambiguous, but there's a lot of other mysteries/motivations/actions that aren't so clear in the book and I lack the motivation to do a close reread to find out because of the POV and timeline shifts. Ah well.
