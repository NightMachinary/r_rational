So far, I have mixed feelings about the book, as I am a bit frustrated that some of the answers weren't provided. My opinion that discovery of Ro was intended to be interpreted as real and not a mindhack. I think I would be okay with the ending if there is a logic explanation for the following questions:

[[#s][1.]] [[#s][2.]] [[#s][3.]]

I feel like these questions are all interrelated with Ro. If there is a logical answer to these questions, I'd enjoy the book much more then if they are intended to be open questions with out answer.
