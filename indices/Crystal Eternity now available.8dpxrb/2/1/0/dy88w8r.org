That's a really good point.

What if Ro is a latent virus in the larger chunks of crystal, put there by the nameless progenitor (or whatever entity created the crystal supercomputers) in order to limit the damage of any AIs that end up using them?

That's not a very satisfying answer though, as the progenitor would probably prefer an AI friendly to their values over an AI with alien values that's limited by Ro. Maybe the progenitor values diversity? Ro does, so that's moderate strength evidence, given that the progenitor created Ro.
