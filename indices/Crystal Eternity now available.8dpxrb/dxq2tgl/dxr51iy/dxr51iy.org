I was waiting for Eternity to be released in December and was sad that the release was delayed... then I saw it was being released in "spring"... then I had the flu a couple of weeks ago so I re-read Society and Mentality to be ready... Now I've got a literature review due tomorrow so I need to finish editing that. Ugh, timing, right?

Still, I'm 15% through and enjoying it so far. When I first read Mentality I got really frustrated every time we weren't going from Crystal's point of view, but the second time I really enjoyed the other viewpoint characters despite hating them the first time through (!?!?!). So of course with Eternity I'm vallicating, within a single chapter, between wishing I was reading Crystal's POV again and between really enjoying the non-Crystal stuff.
