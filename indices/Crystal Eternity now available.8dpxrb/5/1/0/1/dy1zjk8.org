I want to say that now I've read most of the book (no spoilers yet please!), I understand why we got a lot of Zephyr point of view and I'm /significantly/ less disappointed, I was kind of picking my jaw off the floor when I read a reveal. (I hesitate to say 'the' reveal, because, you know, I haven't finished the whole story).

The dog chapter I didn't get though. I mean it was interesting and maybe the scene in question would have been less interesting from a human POV given the relatively mundane sort of stuff that was physically happening? Hoping there'll be a denouement for that too.
