Another thing that's special about it is that it's written from the POV of the AI, and there are about half a dozen AI characters who all work together to share control of one android, each with their own goal (e.g. one has the goal to learn as much information as possible; another has the goal to protect themself), which I thought was a really interesting take.

(The above is revealed in like the first chapter so isn't spoilery).
