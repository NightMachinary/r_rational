I enjoyed this--it served /The Purpose/. It's too bad Ro is getting such flack, because I don't think it was real.

[[#s][Theorizing with spoilers]]

Open questions:

1. I find it difficult to credit that [[#s][name1]]'s gambit could succeed as well as it did and still leave [[#s][name2]] in control of so many humans. That's threading the needle very fine.

2. Was there some other gambit to cause [[#s][name3]] to pursue [[#s][name4]]? I feel name3 would have put more effort into a fleeing contingency if it knew what was coming.

3. In Mentality, why did Heart agree to deactivation in exchange for saving the heads? Myrodyn is sure as hell willing to trade off ethical values, so Heart should be as well. I assumed until relatively late in Eternity that Heart's sacrifice would somehow turn out to be part of a gambit for later control.
