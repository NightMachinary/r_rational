I think "Ro" is inspired by some posts by Stuart Armstrong about controlling an AI by futzing with how much it cares about worlds where a particular miracle hasn't happened: [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F8ck6xZMeDBkZFSpo/false-thermodynamic-miracles]]

For Face and Vision, the miracle is the survival of biological life. They fundamentally don't care about/don't believe in worlds where it doesn't survive.

I basically got nothing re: how this hack was supposed to have been delivered/implanted, other than, what if Growth stuck it into his siblings at the very start of things, and it didn't become fully elaborated as thoughts or woo-y belief systems until Vision, and then Face, got all smart.

It was fun to read! I didn't really buy the dog-perspective bits. That just isn't really how dog understanding/intelligence works, IME. Like the grammatical communication was the wrong direction to take it.

I'm opposed to post-story theorizing on a fundamental level. Even if you write some big explanation of the intended meaning, it will not matter because it's not part of the book.

In the end I enjoyed the different perspectives the different chapters took. Fun nuggets of humanity in each character. Xandra and Vision were most fun to read. Also I sensed that you had become quite frustrated with the whole thing by the end. Hang in there pal!
