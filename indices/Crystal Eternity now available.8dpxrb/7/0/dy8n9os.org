Why would the bomb from book one have violated Ro if it blew up? It wouldn't have killed many nameless in the area, and if killing all the humans would be a Ro violation then the historical deaths of Arctic explorers or long distance sailors should be a Ro violation.

Oh I see, destroying the Crystal would be a Ro violation? Good point, this shifts me a bit towards Ro being real. The other competing theory for the bomb in book one is that the nameless AI disabled it.
