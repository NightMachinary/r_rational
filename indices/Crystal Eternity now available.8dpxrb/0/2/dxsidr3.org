I had largely the same reaction. I interpreted the weird metaphysics as metatextual, though. Ro is a codeword for the author's whim, and the characters are living inside a simulation (actually just a book). At times, Dream and Vision seemed aware of this. I agree that this book was very different than the previous two. In a different context, I might have been more tolerant of the vignette style. But for this story, I wanted something clear.

Don't want a refund.
