Yup, on the plus side I only wasted a stormy Saturday, but it was wasted and the money I spent to order. /Edit: money was not wasted I just found the book too fragmented, but am glad to have paid for Raelifin's work and will probably buy the next one/

Lots of interesting characters poorly vignetted to death, too much time on the partially uplifted dog as the author trys to hint at that relationship between people and posthumans but never really achieves any symbolism or reality. The nameless's cavity never explained. The whole Rho thing being left plausibly as a mindhack or bad physics is annoying.

/Edit: My edit was prompted by Raelifin approaching me for a refund. I need to come back and rework my criticism better. I was not happy with the final book, but am more than happy to pay to find out, and I'll probably give it a second read to see if I can answer some of my own questions and or buy his next work. I mean I happily preordered it, got a direct email so It wasn't a preorder . . . Keep up the good work and doesn't let the bastards, myself included, keep you down./
