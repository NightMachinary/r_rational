This felt like a waste of my time. It was so different from the previous two books that I feel cheated: baited-and-switched. Being yanked from POV to POV at multiple points in the timeline was often confusing; furthermore, some of those POVs were abstracted and unreliable in ways that weren't present in earlier books. The big metaphysics reveal two-thirds in was so strange and unprecedented I was convinced until the very end that it was a weird lie. It's possible it /was/ in fact a weird lie, but if so I'm not getting the hints the author dropped and things should have been more discursive along the way. It's one thing to be the film Primer where its difficulty of understanding the flow of causality is the point, but it's another thing to turn into Primer in the third book of a previously fairly clearly-told story.

Really bummed out by this. After Mentality proved to be more enjoyable than Society, I was hoping Eternity would continue the trend, but now I wish I'd done something else with my time.
