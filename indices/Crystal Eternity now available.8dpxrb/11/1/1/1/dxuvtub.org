I also find it implausible that this could be a deception of some of the siblings by another. This, among many other features, turns me against the idea that this was a deception. It is far better read, imo, as a fact. The "somewhat crazy idea" of [[https://www.reddit.com/user/rictic][rictic]] is fun, and it's interesting to ponder for a bit, but it hasn't affected my confidence. What Vision and Face ponder and examine is a genuine discovery. It changes their understanding of the situation, and both pursue their aims differently once they have learned it.

Your idea that this "hack" was contrived at the end to propel the story to places that could not be reached in its premises is entirely wrong, imo. Against this idea I propose that this was very much in the author's mind during the writing of the first novel. It's not a miraculous salvation coming out of nowhere. (That idea is explicitly rejected from the get go.)

It does, of course, feature strongly in the resolution of the plot. In that manner I do see it as a vehicle. Is it the sort of SF premise-vehicle that disqualifies the Crystal Trilogy as hard SF? Not even close.
