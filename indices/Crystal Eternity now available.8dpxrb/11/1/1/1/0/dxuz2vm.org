I don't recall rho being foreshadowed in the first two books AT ALL. Please explain.

Also, whether or not it is self consistent in the rules of the story is not the issue, the issue is that the story tries to present itself as a realistic depiction of superintelligence takeoff, and it's NOT. And it's only compliant with physics in so far as some physicists believe in the whole "consciousness-triggered quantum collapse" thing, or in other words "i can make reality make up its mind just by looking at it!"

And realizing how ridiculous that is probably requires knowledge and skills from outside their area of expertise. After all, consciousness is not the specialty of quantum physicists.
