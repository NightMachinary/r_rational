I'm still not sure I understand what you're saying here. Do you or do you not agree that the existence of a law of physics that ensures "diversity of souls" and outright prevents human extinction would drastically and unrealistically decrease the difficulty of aligning AGI or ASI with human values?

Face wasn't even made by humans, it was made by the other AI's. They basically ended up with an at least somewhat friendly superintelligence because of luck and a weird metaphysics hack rather than because of humans actually solving the value alignment problem.
