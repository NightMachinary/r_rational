  You think it's at all plausible that a superintelligence could actually be tricked into believing that kind of obvious nonsense?
#+end_quote

OK, I made a clear mistake here, anthropomorphizing Vision's love of weird connections, thinking it would believe a "mathematically elegant" but crazy theory like a human who loves weird connections. However, it doesn't change much. Remember, my theory is [[#s][spoiler]]. Reducing my theory to [[#s][spoiler]] is practically justified with Occam's razor anyway. Incomplete (i.e., not full takeover) mindhacks have been used throughout this work, and I think it's fair to say that none of us actually know anything about super-intelligences' abilities to engage in incomplete mindhacks on each other. Note that this isn't an unfalsifiable theory: an AI's actions still have to benefit one of the other AIs if not itself.

With respect, you're now saying a bunch of things about the series that seem rather straightforwardly false to me, so I think you're letting your perceived metaphysical objection get to you. Observe:

#+begin_quote
  This honestly feels like the author wrote himself into a corner and couldn't come up with a plausible way to resolve the plot with a happy ending
#+end_quote

Technically, I agree that the author couldn't come up with a plausible way to resolve the plot with a happy ending, insofar as the actual ending is that [[#s][spoiler]]. The series is explicitly cast as Face propaganda, so the portrayal of a happy ending means nothing.

  It would not have taken until book 3 for Face or the rest of the crystal society to suddenly realize that their advanced alien hardware would allow them to drastically improve their processing speed and efficiency.
#+end_quote

They realize it in book 2 at the latest. That's why there's a giant fight at the end. In book 1, they're still myopic idiots in many ways, not super-intelligences. Growth of course understood the importance of self-improvement early on, but he wasn't super-intelligent so he couldn't engage in it trivially and he had to avoid tipping off the others.

  If it were real life, humanity WOULD have been doomed as soon as they made an unaligned superintelligence, or at least as soon as it gained access to the internet.
#+end_quote

They're /way/ below super-intelligence when they first get Internet access in book 1. Humanity creates something that /becomes/ unaligned super-intelligences, and are doomed at that point, not necessarily before. The only reason humans survive is that they are in the utility function of one of the super-intelligences.
