Are you familiar with the concept of a fair play whodunit? Readers can't read your mind. If you make any effort to hide the truth from your readers, whatsoever, they will not see it. Good clues are the ones left in plain sight. If you want to make it harder to solve the mystery, have characters try to obscure it, don't do the obscuration yourself.

Also, it looks like you didn't respond to my actual reasoning for saying Rho is non-reductionist nonsense. I explained WHY rho is like phlogiston, and your rebuttal was about how "just because some characters think it's phlogiston doesn't mean it is" which doesn't contradict anything I said about why rho is nonsense, and it isn't even related to the arguments I actually made against it. Whether or not some people think it's plausible isn't the right question, but rather, is it actually plausible? And even if it works in your story, it's a severe misrepresentation of real life, and considering that you basically promised your readers that the story would be realistic, this seems like a rather large mistake.

Have you read the lesswrong sequence on reductionism?

Also I sent you a pm since I wasn't sure if you'd see my comment since I couldn't figure out how to tag you here. That pm included my email address.
