Conscious minds have access to their own map of reality, but that's it. Features of the map can make it seem like the map must be generated by a consistent territory 'out there', since the map has representations of agents with brains and is viewed from the inside at the location of one of those brains. But the existence of a more fundamental territory doesn't seem strictly necessary. The standard way of presenting this idea is the simulation hypothesis, but I think Ro is an equally valid if not even more compelling thought experiment.

The simulation hypothesis requires that the perceived world is running inside of an even more complex world, which is unsatisfying for the same reason that 'God guides the motion of the planets' is less satisfying than 'F=G(m1*m2)/r^{2'}. With perhaps a smidge of artistic license, it seems reasonable to me that one could build a consistent model of a universe where thought (i.e. processing of information) is built out of math and is more fundamental than physics. Math is very general, but its consistency governs what types of physical laws are possible. With a bit of imagination, couldn't one consider the possibility of a universe where the way that information can be processed similarly restricts and builds a foundation for what laws of physics can be observed?
