  The reader is left behind, much like the other humans, and it's meant to hurt. It's meant to leave us scraping and yearning to be close to that again...That said, it's not meant to actually be unpleasant to read. It was meant to tantalize and invite speculation towards unravelling the mysteries rather than annoyance at the author.

I see what you're saying and on one level I really appreciate that kind of meta-level storytelling. I always think it's cool when the /structure/ of the story works along with its content to make me feel a certain way. And this book was definitely successful at making me feel like an out-of-the-loop baseline struggling to comprehend divinity.

I think where the second part fails for me and some of the other readers is that eventually, learned helplessness kicks in. The reader's curiosity about unraveling the mysteries fades as it becomes apparent that they can't be unraveled. And the more the reader is jerked around with respect to critical details of the world you're describing to them--what's really happening and what's a simulation or mindhack, which entities are alive or dead at any given point, what has or has not exploded, etc--the more they lose patience and give up on trying to grasp what's actually happening. Of course that technique has been used to great effect in many works of fiction, but I think there's an upper limit to how much you can do it in one story before the audience loses investment.
