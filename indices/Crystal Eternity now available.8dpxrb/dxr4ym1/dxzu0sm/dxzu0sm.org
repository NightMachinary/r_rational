I felt like it was weird, but not necessarily in a bad way. It reminded me a bit of echopraxia towards the end, where there are vast events going on in the background that the narrator only partially grasps, so the reader has to piece together.

It also had a lot of the stuff I liked about the previous books, especially in the first half, with the different factions moving on earth and the internal narratives of different characters.
