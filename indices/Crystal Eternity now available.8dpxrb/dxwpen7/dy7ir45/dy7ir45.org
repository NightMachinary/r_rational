I agree on the non-linear part, but I think the reveal about 2/3 the way through that Zephyr becomes Face had a really poetic impact on me: I realised that Zephyr /is/ face, so alternating Zephyr chapters was actually alternating /Face/ chapters like the second book did.

Maybe it was just me but I thought the reveal that Zephyr had uploaded and combined with Face was the big deep reveal of the story and it made me have the most feelings of anything.
