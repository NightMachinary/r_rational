It only took 90 chapters, but they're finally getting to the part where they have to ... *Delve*. Also, I think I finally understand where the story is going. Originally, I thought the story was meandering for the sake of it, but it actually seems like it's all coming together.

The story spent a long time in the city, setting up the players and how it functions, then finally threw a wrench into everthing with Velika and putting the whole city in a bottle. Now we've got all these dysfunctional elements who have to work together, because the Empire of Adamant is confident they can tear down the barrier, and the city has to be ready when they do.

So they've got to Delve beneath the city and hunt some blues. The Watch has to figure out how to work with Velika, because they need her able to fight the Empire. Velika has to figure out how to become a leader and give up (relative) power without getting killed, because she can't win alone. And Rain has to figure out how to work in a group that isn't his quirky friend team, since he's like 0/6 with authority figures.

Really looking forward to it.
