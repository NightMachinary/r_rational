Westbridge is characterized as a citizen who has restraint, and who cares about his people. If Lavarro does kill him, it's bad for pretty much everyone. This doesn't mean she won't kill him - just that the consequences for doing so are terrible, and that she's a bit of a monster for acting out despite this.
