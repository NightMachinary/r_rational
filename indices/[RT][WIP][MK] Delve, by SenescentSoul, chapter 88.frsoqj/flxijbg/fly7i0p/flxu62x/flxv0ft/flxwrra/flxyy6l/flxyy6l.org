As Talasa said, she expects it to kill them all. Maybe another city can handle a direct line to high level monsters that could kill everybody, but this city can barely keep slimes in check.

The whole reason the city is setup here is because they're a low ranked area. It makes them backwards, but it also means the people can live like humans instead of the City of Lights or whatever nightmare underground poison city Amelia lived in as a child.
