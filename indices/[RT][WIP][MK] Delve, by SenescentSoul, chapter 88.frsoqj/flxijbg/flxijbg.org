Lavarro may be powerful, but she has low impulse control. She forces some poor translocation specialist to teleport her, then treats him like trash because he can't teleport her all the way, despite admitting to not knowing anything about teleportation. She is generally aggressively ignorant and utterly selfish -- she's making Velika seem better and better by comparison. She also seems to believe in the transitive property of fighting. She beat Halgrave, Halgrave kinda looked like he was beating Westbridge, thus she must be able to beat Westbridge. Personally I expect and hope that she'll get crushed for attacking a wizard in his tower. More likely narratively their fight will be interrupted by the empire invasion (no doubt after their fight has crushed half the city and killed tons of civilians).

Velika is getting some reasonable points for ignoring Val when it became clear he hadn't killed the Blue. That's good because it seems everyone is going to have to work together (right when the Watch is pulling something stupid).

The empire thinks it can break down the barrier. This is surprising to me, because the whole seizing the teleport platform depends on speed. They can destroy it otherwise, or simply respond in force. Sure they think they can fight off 3-4 citizens, but the teleport platform means the moment the barrier drops 50 citizens could attack them. Just crush the expeditionary force in a couple minutes, then go back home.

I admit I was more interested in the Empire as representing the power of efficient builds for the group (aka fascism the MMO) instead of focusing on Feche as a personal badass.
