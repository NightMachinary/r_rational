Well, if the empire is any good at strategery then they're attacking from multiple fronts, so it's unclear to me that the DKE can afford to send all their resources to defend Fel Sadanis. In general, the author seems conservative in revealing big picture details (e.g. we're given dribs and drabs of the skill tree as they become relevant to the plot, Rain's endless list of questions are repeatedly lamp shaded, etc.), maybe to maintain the space of possible explanations for any plot holes that emerge.
