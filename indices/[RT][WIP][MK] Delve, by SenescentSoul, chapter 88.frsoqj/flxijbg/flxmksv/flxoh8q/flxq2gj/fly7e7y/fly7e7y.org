Yeah from Halgrave's perspective at the time: he's got some creepazoid foreign adventurer in his town who doesn't know how shit works. The man's clearly from far away so he probably traveled quite a bit to get here; he can almost certainly take care of himself in the wilderness. Kicking him out of town is a much safer and more humane approach than throwing him in jail.

It just turns out that Halgrave was wrong, and this weird foreigner managed to get to town without actually traversing any of the intervening distance (and thus developing any of the wilderness survival skills you'd expect a foreigner to have).
