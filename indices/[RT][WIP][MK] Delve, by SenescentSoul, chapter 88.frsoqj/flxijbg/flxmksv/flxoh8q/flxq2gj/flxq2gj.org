I kinda agree with Halgraves reaction. It sucks for Rain and it would've been best if Halgrave had followed up on Rain to check if he's fine, because Rain was obviously ignorant and didn't know what the heck he was doing, but taking swift and decisive action was definitely the right move with how (understandably) prickly the Watch is concerning adventurers blasting unidentified magic at full tilt in populated city centers.

Ignorance is not really an excuse, you have to admit. I think kicking Rain out of the city was a fair move, it just happened to be very harsh because Rain had basically no money to his name and was still pretty much lost in what to him was an alien world (something that Halgrave didn't know, and that you wouldn't expect of someone who is awakened). The overwhelming majority of adventurers would probably be fine if you kicked them out.
