Lavarro is by far the most self-absorbed piece of work in the entire story, to a point where all she sees are her immediate goals, everything else be damned. I hope her obliviousness will cost her.

No idea how someone like Halgrave who seems like a caring, well-spoken and responsible person, ended up with someone like Lavarro. It truly is a mystery. Must've been a heat of the moment thing.
