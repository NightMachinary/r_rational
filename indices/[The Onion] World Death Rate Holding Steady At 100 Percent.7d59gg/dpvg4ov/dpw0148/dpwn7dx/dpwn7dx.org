  At a bare minimum it's likely to be centuries away.

That seems really unlikely to me. Two centuries ago, physicians were describing mercury treatments and bloodletting as cures for just about every ailment. Slightly over a century ago we were starting to figure out that there are such things as viruses and that washing your hands before cutting into a living being might be a good idea. Antibiotics were only discovered 80ish years ago and 68 years ago they gave a Nobel prize for medicine to the guy that invented /the lobotomy/.

The future is hard to predict, especially over this kinds of timescales, but it seems to me that in terms of scientific progress we are a lot closer to meaningful life extension than the people of the early 20th century were to us (let alone the people of the 19th century or earlier).
