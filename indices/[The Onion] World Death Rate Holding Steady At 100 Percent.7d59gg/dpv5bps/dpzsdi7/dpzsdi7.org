? I heard numbers close to a trillion. The only source i got that had 100 billion only went back to 8000BC which makes no since.

I did more digging and seemed to have found the "math" that got this number.

  To calculate how many people have ever lived, Haub followed a minimalist approach, beginning with two people in 50000 B.C.---his Adam and Eve. Then, using his historical growth rates and population benchmarks, he estimated that slightly over 106 billion people had ever been born. Of those, people alive today comprise only 6 percent, nowhere near 75 percent. "[It is] almost surely true people alive today are some small fraction of [all] people," says Joel Cohen, a professor of populations at the Rockefeller and Columbia Universities in New York City.

Firstly their was never only 2 people and secondly humans have existed for about 200 thousand years ago (I got these numbers from wiki but know that this number has grown significantly from my anthropologist friend). if we include all homo species that is about 2 million years of death to add up.
