It seems that by the middle of the 21st century we might start getting the first superintelligence - lots of AI scientist predictions put AI there, and it's not implausible that something like [[http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2013/02/13/medethics-2012-101200.full?sid=e04fe105-6117-4c50-8902-0bbc6891dc30][in-vitro eugenics]], especially [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Iterated_embryo_selection][iterated embryo selection]] could give us some very smart biological humans if that doesn't pan out. At that point it's going to go a whole lot more smoothly, at least.
