  At a bare minimum it's likely to be centuries away.

Naw, one century if everything goes as poorly as possible from what I hear. I only have a BSc in Molecular Biology, so there are others with a better direct grasp of the issue and centuries is not at all the time frame prominent scientists in the field are giving. I highly recommend reading Ending Aging by Aubrey de Grey and check out the Methuselah Foundation's quarterly newsletter. We may not have everything mapped out perfectly yet, but we have a good idea what needs to be done which makes now completely incomparable to any other time in history. We definitely know enough to start making designing serious repair and maintenance therapies.
