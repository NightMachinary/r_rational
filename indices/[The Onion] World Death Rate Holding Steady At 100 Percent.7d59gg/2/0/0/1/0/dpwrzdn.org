That's hard to predict given the instability of the US healthcare system. The price isn't going to be steady either. Like most high technology it will be very expensive at first, but become more effective and cheaper over time--but probably won't ever be dirt cheap. And it's a thing you'll have to do repeatedly to stay healthy long term because they're /repairing/ age, not eliminating entropy, so there's that.

Aging isn't currently on the list of what the FDA considers to be "a disease" either, so it's likely that some or all of the things will need to be approved for a specific disease. For example approved for atherosclerosis sclerosis, and then used even for people who don't appear to have a disease symptoms from it yet.
