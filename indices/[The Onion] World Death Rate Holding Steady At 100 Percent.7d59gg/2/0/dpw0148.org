Nah. The extremely wealthy have been trying this for centuries. Possibly millennia. If you look at the state of medical science at the moment there is still such an enormous amount of things we don't know about, or have such limited information on, that it seems incredibly unlikely that we'd be able to significantly extend human lifetimes any time soon. At a bare minimum it's likely to be centuries away.
