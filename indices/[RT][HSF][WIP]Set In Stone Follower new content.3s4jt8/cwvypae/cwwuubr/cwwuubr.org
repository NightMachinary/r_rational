Replaced Oskar with Bernard (in my internal version - will update the blog later) I will move the flashbacks farther back in the story as well. I believe you are right that Act I up until the Countyrep delivers the draft notice will stand on it's own. There are better scenes later where flashbacks are more realistically triggered.
