I'm a bit rambly here, and not entirely certain what I'm going to do with the flashbacks. Lots to think about.

I will look at the first flashback introduction and see if I can figure out a more natural way to introduce it. Perhaps have one of Oskar's relatives ride by, and say something snide, or just stare. Failing that, I might just move it farther back in the story.

There were a lot of reasons I added the flashbacks. The primary reason was intensity. Additional reasons were, like you said, world-building.

Two things you didn't mention though: I wanted to establish that Allen was damaged by the encounter. He always had the potential to be good at violence, but it wasn't his nature to be violent until he was forced into it. He feels betrayed by the legal system. He understands that he's wrong by the moral and legal standards of society, but at the same time he's struggling against biological instincts.

Finally, I wanted to establish Marza as a strong character at the beginning, because I'm going to be working with her in future books in the series. One of the things that have been pointed out to me is that I tend to write very male-centric, and I am trying to address that with stronger female characters. While Marza does portray weakness, she also portrays strength and growth. Just like Allen does.

I changed Rikard's name because it was too close to Riko's. The French -ard suffix having negative connotations was something I didn't know. I'll think about possible alternate names.

In terms of when the flashbacks occur, I could introduce the second and third flashbacks during the trip to town when he's reporting for duty at the beginning of Act II (after he gets the draft letter). It would avoid interrupting the locust swarm scenes, and I could certainly introduce it more naturally if he actually ran into Oskar and Nelson. The town scenes were pretty dull, intensity-wise. After I cut down the Act I scenes, they might not drag so badly, but the first half of Act II definitely needs some life in it.

I really appreciate your response!
