Yes, I agree that it works well to establish that Allen was damaged by the encounter. That's why out of all the flashbacks, I felt that the jail scene when Marza showed Allen that he hurted her was powerful. It's when Allen and the reader realizes how deeply he has sunk and that he really has a problem. I'm just not sure it's useful to relate the actual rape intent?

I completely agree with you about Act 2, it might be a better moment to introduce it, I wonder if having those flashbacks come up once Allen realizes that Rikard is also drafted wouldn't also give them more emotional power? As I said before, I really enjoyed Set In Stone, it was one of my favorite stories appearing on this subreddit so I'm happy if I can be of help :-)
