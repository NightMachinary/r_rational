I felt that the introduction of the flashback felt a bit forced. I also think that it's maybe better left unsaid? In the previous drafts, it was clear that an attempted rape happened and the antagonism between Allen and Oskar was palpable and easily felt. The reader could easily imagine what happened. I'm not sure having the full story brings much to it...On the other hand the aftermaths of the incident does help shed some light on the attitude towards violence and the interventionism of Albert. Those parts could probably be used as a flashback later (the scene in the jail is strong and powerful).

Also, Chapter 2 is all about the Locusts and the consequences of the locust swarm. I think adding a story thread about Oskar, the attempted rape and the aftermaths dilutes the sense of urgency caused by the locuts. Introducing him later (like in the original drafts) is much better I think.

BTW, I really like the backstory extracts. My favorite so far is the one from Chapter 4.

Sidenote: I personally liked Rikard as a name because in my native language (French), the -ard suffix is usually used for words with a negative connotation.
