I don't know if enjoying is the right word, but I really appreciate your handling of the dissonance between a typical civilian's attitude toward death and mortality and the ninja's approach.

In a mixing of criticism and praise I do think you're occasionally veering into a bit of ham fisted-ness when conveying those dissonances, however. Hiashi's /extremely/ terse delivery of the decision to select Hanabi over Hinata as the Hyuga successor, delivered in front of Naruto seemed like the character had been replaced by a robot programmed only to care about the prestige of the clan, which effectively communicated that intra-clan politics should be expected to be a very real storyline factor, but seemed shoehorned in for that purpose. It felt somewhat artificial. I have to think that the "real" Hiashi would have felt a measure of compassion for Hinata, and tried to justify it to himself and possibly her that he was doing her a favor by shielding her from the demands that would be placed on a clan head, rather than the way it was delivered which seemed meant to shame her for failing the clan.

By comparison, at the beginning, when Sarutobi discusses Naruto's decision to play along with Mizuki's plot, I was expecting the typical "Naruto, that was very risky, and your life and human life is very precious and you shouldn't needlessly risk yourself, especially as a child, you should have come to an adult for help" narrative that's so common in fiction.

When Sarutobi instead commends Naruto for good ninja thinking in making sure that the village knew what he was up to and would have been able to follow up on what he was doing if he died, that was a great moment of "show, don't tell" even though it was accomplished through dialog. It alone was enough to make me come to grips with the inevitably expendable view the world has of genin and ninja in general.

I know it's a fine line of playing with a reader's expectation to get great moments of exposition by subverting expectations and an event which comes off as contrived, but if it's helpful, I think that what put the Hiashi example over the line was that we got the explanation of the pressure of clan politics first, and the example second, a sort of "tell-then-show", whereas with the expendable theme we're getting lots of examples of how it affects their lives without anyone having sat down and sort of explained it outright.
