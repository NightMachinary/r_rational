Can I vote for no more 4th wall breaking snark about canon? It really breaks my immersion when people go "wouldn't it be silly if (insert part of story that doesn't exist in universe)".

It has happened a few times now, and it is out of place even in crackfics. Outside of crackfics? Bleh.

Good chappie though. Looking forward to poop in rasenshuriken.
