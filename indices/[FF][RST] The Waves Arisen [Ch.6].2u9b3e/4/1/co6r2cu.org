He just likes to argue. See somebody holding one opinion, start holding a different opinion. It's a chaotic system. :)

Yeah, poor Hinata. I wonder if this is an effect of her insecurity, that she's effectively trying to make herself redundant.

Hey, there's [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows][this series]] where the protagonist is an expert in dating games, and his catchphrase when he realizes how to get the girlfriend of the current route is "I can already see the ending!" I sort of felt like that with Naruto in this chapter. Three sentences.

"Hinata, your eyes are amazing. I really like them. :grab hands, pause: But I like them a lot better on your face."
