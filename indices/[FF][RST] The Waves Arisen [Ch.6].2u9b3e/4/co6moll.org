Hinata has now branded Naruto as her own. :D I wonder when Naruto realizes she likes him this time.

On the other hand, I don't think Kakashi should buy the Uchiha secret technique thing. There is someone on the village with the cursed seal already... I think higher-ups should notice what happened immediately.

edit: I also loved the notion of byakugan being for long range and it being stupid to have to hit enemy so many times. It feels a bit weird when Hinata thinks she is not strong enough and that leading to making Naruto stronger.

edit2: And it feels weird when Naruto can't agree on things with himself. Instead of every clone having different opinion, I think it should really be about them understanding there is no single strongest technique, but there could be multiple for different purposes. Strongest for close combat, strongest for ranged combat, strongest for capturing, strongest for disabling, strongest for spying, strongest defence...

edit3: Not sure if I like Naruto practically reinventing rasengan on himself immediately. ESPECIALLY WHEN HE TOLD HINATA BYAKUGAN IS FOR RANGED COMBAT! :D His clones could be a damn artillery that never misses! Shit, now I might have to try some fanfiction myself...

edit4: Feels a bit bad though, that Hinata feels a bit useless to the team now. Best use for her might be tanking with her clan's ultimate defence jutsu thing while Naruto snipes everyone. Or actually maybe not, when clones can just tank for him with barrier too.
