This is shaping up into a very interesting story. I really enjoyed the interplay between the clones. It's almost exactly how I'd imagine I'd end up getting along with more of me. The munchkining is pretty good, but I just wonder how much low hanging fruit is really left for ninja when it comes to seals and stuff. I suppose it could be explained through the whole 'villages don't share well' though.
