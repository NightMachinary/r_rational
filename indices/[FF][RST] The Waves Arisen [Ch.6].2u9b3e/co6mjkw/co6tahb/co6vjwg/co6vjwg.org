It's mostly a matter of taste, since you can interpret canon a bunch of different ways. You can have the eyes which require user to focus on something. Just like normal human eyes, but with a huge peripheral vision. Then you can have eyes which give you the full 3d picture of everything all the time or eyes which must be consciously controlled to give tomographic view. There is plenty of possible combinations.

I think that the best interpretation is that the eyes give a full 3d scene of everything in the field of view all the time without any need to consciously focus on anything. This would require some impossible information processing in the brain (or somewhere else), but considering the powers of other doujutsu in naruto, I think it's only fair to give byakugan a useful interpretation. If we go with this interpretation, then one eye would ether work alright by itself with full depth perception, or be completely useless.

Personally, I would prefer the most useful interpretation possible.
