I'd argue that a well chosen explanation leads to more drama in the story. Not to mention it can be a useful lesson in testing. Why not have Hinata try to activate the byakugan in only one eye and estimate what the effects are beforehand?

This is one of the lessons that rational!Harry has trouble learning and an important one. Namely that some decisions are very hard to take back, and those need to be well thought out. 5 minutes, even a a day or two aren't enough.

Personally, really clever solutions or important objections to an action come to me randomly within about two weeks (the median is probably around a week) of first musing on the problem. It takes time for my unconscious mind to churn on things, and present something useful but non-obvious.

Not to mention a Byakugan without depth perception is far from useless. It'll take getting used to, but even people with one eye can learn to interpret distance from context and secondary factors like level of focus and change in size of objects.

It also helps reconcile the fact that an eye is still an eye, and space is still space, and you can't triangulate given only one ray in an inner product space. You need at least two to see how they intersect. This fic /seems/ to be going the Clarke's Law route for the explanations of chakra and other phenomena so a touch of realism would be nice.
