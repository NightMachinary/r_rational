hmm, I sorta expect it wouldn't give depth perception. My assumption (by way of my tendency to shoehorn things into reasonably "scientific" narratives) was that the entire interior of the eye is coated by "chakra photon" (maybe they're neutrinos? they need to pass through most matter anyway.) detecting cells.

Assuming they're directional then they'd get a full image in all directions but you'd need two to get depth perception. Issue with that is they'd lack depth perception on the line that goes through the center of both eyes, and in canon the "hole" in the byakugan is behind their head.

I should probably just give in and realize that the original authors of naruto have no clue about science, and pretty much just use "rule of cool" to decide everything.
