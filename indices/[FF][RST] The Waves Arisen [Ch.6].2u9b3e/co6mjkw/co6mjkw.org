Byakugan gives the full benefits even with one eye, doesn't it? This is one of the most brilliant ideas I've seen in naruto fanfiction.

As a side note, I very much appreciate how subtly you made the characters more rational. I think this approach is strictly superior to making one of the characters into HJPEV expy.
