I don't think I've ever seen [[#s][spoiler]] before--I was grinning widely for the entire second half of the chapter! Ah, so much nostalgia for my first read-through of /Time Braid/...

I appreciate the effort that you put into making Hinata's shy mannerisms more discernible. I don't mean to nitpick, but I do find it rather interesting that you chose to portray her shyness through repetition of whole words ("You always---you always say how useful it is, don't you?"), when I've always seen it in other stories as repetition of single consonants or vowels ("Y-you always say how useful i-it is, don't you?"). I think your approach is just as valid as the usual one, though, and quite novel to see.
