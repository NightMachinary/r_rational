As a counterbalance: I tend to enjoy it. Doesn't hurt that I really dislike the core naruto series. (All the chars are idiots, the world-building is mostly ad-hoc and badly thought out, and it wastes a lot of time when I try to go back to it after reading enjoyable fanfic only to find that it hasn't gotten better.)
