The first one might not really be one. Rinnegan just might be very famous. It could still have all those powers in this fic.

I guess the second one is, but I didn't myself like the idea of Naruto figuring out his rasengan alone and this fast. Also, ball... Why not a flat, wide surface like a sawblade? I'd bet it would make more damage, any hit would cause bleeding and a good hit cuts enemies in half. Enemies still live with a good hit in the anime...
