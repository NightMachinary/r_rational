  It also helps reconcile the fact that an eye is still an eye, and space is still space, and you can't triangulate given only one ray in an inner product space. You need at least two to see how they intersect. This fic seems to be going the Clarke's Law route for the explanations of chakra and other phenomena so a touch of realism would be nice.

The eye is not a point, you know. It has a pretty significant radius, so you can get convergence from several points on just one eyeball (though this requires parts of the eye to be able to perceive several directions individually). Or you could say that the eye is receptive to chakra and not photons (which it would pretty much have to be anyway to perceive chakra) and chakra has some property that depends on the distance travelled (otherwise the space of vision would not be limited to some sphere around the users head, though it may be not limited in this fic), then you could extract absolute distance information with just one eye. My point is that there is enough wiggle room to make any interpretation sound superficially plausible, so one might as well go with the one that's most convenient from the storytelling perspective.

It's pretty silly to cavil this much about physics of Byakugan vision anyway, when there is stuff like shadow clones going around.
