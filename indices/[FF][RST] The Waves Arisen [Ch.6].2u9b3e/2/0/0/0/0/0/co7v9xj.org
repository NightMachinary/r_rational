  It's pretty silly to cavil this much about physics of Byakugan vision anyway, when there is stuff like shadow clones going around.

Sure, but it is fun. ;)

  My point is that there is enough wiggle room to make any interpretation sound superficially plausible, so one might as well go with the one that's most convenient from the storytelling perspective.

I tend to like it when there's more than superficial plausibility. But that's obviously a personal preference. Likewise, I'm a fan of sanderson's laws, and in this case, such a straightforward munchkin is only interesting because others haven't written it before, rather than it being an interesting decision to make in its own right.

  The eye is not a point, you know. It has a pretty significant radius, so you can get convergence from several points on just one eyeball (though this requires parts of the eye to be able to perceive several directions individually).

Yes, but assuming that there's some reasonable biological pathway from normal eyes, to the magical versions (which is itself kinda silly given the sharingan and rinnegan) then a chakra sensitive version of rods and cones has a much higher probability than omnidirectional cameras evolving at a scale orders of magnitude smaller than the eye itself.

Not to mention that "/significant radius/" is directly proportional to the directional errors in the relevant sensor and the distance to the object you're triangulating against. As you scale down the sensor, noise tends to become significantly higher. (Both in biological and non-biological sensors)
