If you're taking suggestions, I felt the sentence "Probably for the first time since their struggle against Kakashi in the bell test, Naruto felt like he was actually part of a team." in the previous chapter shouldn't have been there. The preceding dialogue stood well on its own and didn't need this explanation.

A scene from the D-rank missions would also be nice. To establish characters and see some interaction between the four team members.
