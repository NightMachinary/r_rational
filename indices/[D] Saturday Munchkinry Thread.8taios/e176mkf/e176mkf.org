[[https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/06/what-if-sleep-was-a-commodity.html][Borrowing from Marginal Revolution]], what if sleep was a commodity that could be bought or sold?

e.g., I sleep for 15 hours and then sell 8 of those hours to you. You get all the benefits of having had 8 hours of sleep (and therefore get to go a full night without sleeping, without costs) while I get the benefits of having 7 hours of sleep.

Anyone can buy or sell sleep at any time; it's a fungible commodity. More details at the link.
