  Are you intending to just subserviently unite with South Korea?

I would have a massive portion of the population emigrate across the world, which is exactly what people would expect anyway after a major regime change.\\
However I would still have much of the population stick around with me making the remaining country appear like a semi-authoritarian state like China or Russia which nonetheless doesn't start shit. So given countries usually only care about blatant violations of human rights or international aggression other nations should be perfectly happy to work with me. Plus I would be able to make my government extremely opaque and accomplish my plans much better than pretending to be a democracy (plus it would be harder to fake being a democracy).

  This is a great idea. If you have one male part who has great genetics you can just have him go around impregnating all your female parts. You could even get your genome sequenced of likely candidates to make sure there's nothing lurking.

Exactly, however I would go further and rely pretty extensively on foreign genetics since that would let my people further infiltrate other parts of the world and I could get more genetic diversity. I wouldn't even be beyond secretly collecting genetic samples from geniuses then using them to create sperm cells.\\
Plus now that I think about it I would probably also use surrogacy such that only a small minority of my female population would be having their own genetic offspring. Not to mention I would also start using things like sperm selection and embryo selection as extensively as possible from day one. So effectively the first generation born after the formation of the hivemind would be constituted entirely of attractive (good for PR, and people would probably not imagine this was the result of a massive rapid eugenics program) geniuses with good health.

  By that do you mean a bunch of NK workers applying for management positions in McDonalds, and then before you know it they have the board of directors?

No I mean they would be earning scholarships at universities across the world and working their way into prestige that way. Plus we would be using our collective knowledge of social skills to work our way into high society through our extreme charisma.
