Firstly I would fake a cou and then use my massive knowledge to emigrate across the world, since all of my "members" would be skilled enough to earn work visas. People may think it's weird that such a disproportionate number of North Koreans were so incredibly motivated but it would hardly make anyone raise the possibility of a hivemind.\\
I'd also use eugenics on myself pretty extensively rom the get go to both increase the number of geniuses coming up with new ideas and to reduce the cost of health problems, plus of course all the women in the hivemind with decent genetics would have an extremely large number of kids effectively increasing our power.

Long term many of us would arrange to end up "Orphaned" so nobody knew where we came from and then secretly use our competence to effectively take control of a massive number of institutions within a generation or two. Meanwhile we'd be using genetic engineering extensively and hiding a substantial technological lead in AI.\\
So however long AGI might have taken otherwise we'd develop it vastly sooner and have enough of a lead to take our time on safety. Once I develop FAI it will have my preferred utility function and it can probably figure out a way to use its tech to restore the identities of all the people taken over by the hivemind.
