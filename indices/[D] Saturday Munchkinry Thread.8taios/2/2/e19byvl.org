This is massively munchkinnable. It'll be lonely, but with care I can probably be the entire planet within a dozen generations without ever killing anyone. (I should probably leave a number of people outside the Hivemind just so that I have someone to talk to).

And after that? Well, effectively, /everyone/ will have the equivalent of multiple doctoral-level degrees in /everything/. I don't know enough about /everything/ to be able to tell what I'd do beyond that - not in any sort of specific - but one of the first things I'd do would be to automate /every/ boring manual-labour type job. And then... I'm not sure.

I'd pretty much do whatever I wanted at that point. Probably go out and explore the universe, looking for alien life. (And persuade the remaining non-Hivemind people to become authors of various sorts, so that I'd still be able to get new and interesting stories to read).
