  The feats he regularly performs are clearly superhuman. He hears conversations while sitting on rooftops a block away, can pick specific people out of a crowd, opens combination locks, and dodges arrows.

Ok well some of those aren't actually superhuman, opening combination locks by sound for instance is a well known trick and dodging arrows is if its the result of superhuman abilities (depends on speed/range) the result of superhuman reflexes not sensory abilities.

However most importantly here the ability to hear conversations from a block away is so blatantly useful for nefarious ends that I'm not sure helping some blind people live normal lives is really worth the overall impact it might have on society.
