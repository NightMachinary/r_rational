I know I´m basing my opinions off the Netflix series, which naturally has less information then in the comics, but in the Netflix series the power was almost instantly useful, even before the training (which I don´t remember taking that long/being that big of a deal, but I may have skipped past that montage). And when Foggy asked Matt how he could have possibly not been able to overhear both sides of Foggy´s phone conversation, Matt said that he had to "focus" to activate his power, indicating that, unlike Superman, this was somehow something he could toggle at will. So even if it is debilitating without training, it wouldn´t be an instantly fatal flaw.
