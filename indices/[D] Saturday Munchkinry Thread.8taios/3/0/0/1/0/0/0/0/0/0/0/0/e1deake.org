I never learned how to do the whole quote thing on Reddit, so this may be hard to connect to the points you made, but I´ll try.

I have to just straight up disagree with you on the inborn privacy gauge thing. I just believe people would be able to adjust, and you don´t. Your point on the range for detecting conversations being farther than the range of people making noise has more merit, and I will concede the point that, when walking on the street, it would be pretty damn hard for people to judge whether they are being listened in to or not. So I will concede that point. However, in Daredevil Matt did state that his ability was something he had to "focus" to actively use, otherwise he was incapable of even hearing what the person talking to Foggy over the phone (when Foggy was in the same room as Matt) was saying. So at the very least people will be able to toggle the power on and off, and slowly get used to/overcome any discomfort. And while I do understand why you rejected my point against sciences, I don´t see how you can look at a power that directly increases our ability to process sensory information, then look at the arts, a medium that usually directly relies on the senses during it´s creation and it´s enjoyment, and say that stating that this power would benefit the arts is a cop out. As for how I think it would help the sciences; I´ve been on a couple field expeditions where enhanced senses could have been serious help. A lot of scientific fields that involve outdoor work, would be positively impacted. And this leads into my other point that you refuted; I could keep listing groups that would be affected positively by the power, and all the ways the power could benefit society, but that would just drag on and on and overpower anything else I wanted to say. With a power like this, there are so many ways to apply it that finding a group of people that wouldn´t be benefited is the greater challenge.

Almost every "improvement" to society has come with downsides. The spread of cars resulted in more pollution and vehicular crime. The invention of sites like Facebook hurt privacy. The rockets that got us to the moon also resulted in Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. I think the spread of superpowers would be improvement. And just like the other improvements, it would come with it´s own problems and risks and challenges. But I think people would adjust, just like they´ve adjusted to everything else, and in the end everything would work out for the better. Maybe having intimate conversations on the street stops being a thing, but that´s not so bad. Now we live under the threat of nuclear annihilation, but on the flip-side we also have a space program!
