but I feel like that instinctual estimate would adapt pretty quickly, once everybody has super-hearing, wouldn´t it? If the human brain can adapt to the extent that human echolocation is viable in real life, I don´t see why this also couldn´t be easily adjusted. So I don´t think that psychological effect is a problem worth halting a spread over; people would relearn how to gauge privacy pretty easily. It would only be a problem if only some people got super senses, which has so many other problems associated with it even I can´t defend it.

And from the way Daredevils "world on fire" speech was portray din the show, the benefits to humanity definitely can´t be replicated by tech. The way Daredevil perceives the world (as seen in the Netflix show) would be a qualitative expansion in the human experience that would impact everything from the science´s to the arts, in the same way giving deaf people hearing qualitatively changes their world. Daredevil´s power isn´t just super hearing, it´s also a superhuman ability to integrate and use sensory information to understand the world around him; "super senses" to such a degree that it basically becomes new "6th sense" all together. And that could have many, many positive benefits, from the arts to even maybe the sciences. I think empowering people naturally leads to improvements in any field where personal ability is important, to the outdoorsman who can now be unafraid of being snuck up on by wild animals, to athletes, whose performance would naturally skyrocket after such a change, to musicians, who would enjoy the same increase in ability. All in all, I think every negative listed so far is something most average people would be able to easily overcome, and that the benefits are still definitely worth it.
