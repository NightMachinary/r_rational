  Ideally any power to be munchkined should have consistent and clearly defined rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.

- from breaking and entering through walls, to making areas only accessible with earthbending

- finding minerals deposit

- using it to make electricity [[https://gravitylight.org/][(with a generator)]] maybe moving a generator wheel with your earthbending

- make sculptures (probably needs special earth)

- built tunnels

- farming

- earth bullets/spears instead of earth disks or bolders
