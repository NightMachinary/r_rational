So long as you're capable of levitating pieces of earth heavier than yourself, you could use smaller pieces of rock as platforms (or rock armor idk) for flight.

On a weirder note, vibrating the ground beneath someone's feet at specific frequencies could cause a number of symptoms (bone/joint damage, nausea, visual damage, basically anything sound weapons can do).

You might also be able to create something like a rail gun with a large group of Earth benders standing in formation.

Using grains of sand to scratch someone's cornea or other soft sensitive parts of the body like those within the ear.
