  Even an “around-the-clock” sleep-worker could only net 16 hours of saleable sleep per day. The other 8 hours would have to go to meeting their own sleep needs.

This implies some kind of "safe coma" which would be a pretty amazing trick on its own. And you could probably set up a 'dorm'-style living arrangement that's suitable for sleep-sellers.

One option might be a weight-loss spa. People could sign up for a 3 or 4 month stint. Then they'd spend 22 hours / day sleeping, with a couple hours for hygiene, food and exercise. University students might do this over the summer and get back to their university thin toned and rested. Depending on the costs, you might even have some extra spending money.

Something similar would be good for long-term care facilities. If I'm recovering from a car-accident, I'd be OK with a facility that let me sleep most of the day while i waited for my bones to knit.
