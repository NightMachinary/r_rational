Well, if you further suppose that we have the same work/play split of 8h/8h, then anyone making over 1.5x minimum wage will likely pay someone to sleep for them - that will effectively be their job full-time. If this can be performed at a distance, I foresee some low-income country like inda/china establishing a "sleep farm", providing the high income citizens with sleep surrogates.
