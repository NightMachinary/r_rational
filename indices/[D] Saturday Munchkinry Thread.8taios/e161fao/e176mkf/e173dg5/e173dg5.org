Munchkin a hive mind in human bodies

Say one day you become a North Korea hivemind. All current citizens of nk are a single entity, any new ones born from the womb of a current hive mind will also be hive mind

Do you hide this? What do you do? What are some things you can do that you wouldn't be able to otherwise (get rid of inefficiencies like multiple houses, everyone eats together, etc)
