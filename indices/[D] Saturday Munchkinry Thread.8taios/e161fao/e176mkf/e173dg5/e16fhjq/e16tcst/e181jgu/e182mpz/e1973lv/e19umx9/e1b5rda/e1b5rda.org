This isn´t like normal technology or other surveillance systems, this kind of thing enhances individual people. At worst it would result in a few elite super spies, but that wouldn´t be a major survilance concern in the same way wire tapping is.

Soundproofing against people like Matt should easily be within the grasp of any company capable of creating a soundproof room; again, hardly a threat whose potential risks outweigh the benefits.
