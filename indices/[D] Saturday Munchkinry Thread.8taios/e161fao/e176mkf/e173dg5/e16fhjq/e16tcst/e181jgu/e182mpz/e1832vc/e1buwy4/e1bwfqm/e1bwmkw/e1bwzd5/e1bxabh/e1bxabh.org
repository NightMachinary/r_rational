and you don't think that echolocation good enough to not only know someone is there (and far enough away that dodging the arrow is possible), but also knowing they are holding a bow and arrow AND when they fire it isn't superhuman hearing? Demonstrated human echolocation can, just barely, identify large objects close to people or the rough shape of rooms. Telling that someone at arrow firing range just fired an arrow is absolutely superhuman hearing. Completely ignoring the fact that Daredevil seemingly does not use echolocation (at least not that generates, he appears to use reflections from ambient noise).

-edit- you seem to be hung up on the dodging part. The superhuman part is even recognizing the arrow is there at all. That is well beyond any demonstrated human hearing abilities.
