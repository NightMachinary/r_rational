Well it's hardly easy but one could tell the arrow was about to be fired based on vague changes to body posture or the sounds made by people changing their stance (as in the steps) and these are quite plausibly the sort of bad guy goons who telegraph their attacks with pointless grunts.\\
Plus depending on range and conditions there might be a sweet spot where you could hear the bow being fired but still have enough time to react at least a little to it, this would be vastly easier if you already knew where to expect arrow fire coming from for instance if they'd already fired arrows and missed.
