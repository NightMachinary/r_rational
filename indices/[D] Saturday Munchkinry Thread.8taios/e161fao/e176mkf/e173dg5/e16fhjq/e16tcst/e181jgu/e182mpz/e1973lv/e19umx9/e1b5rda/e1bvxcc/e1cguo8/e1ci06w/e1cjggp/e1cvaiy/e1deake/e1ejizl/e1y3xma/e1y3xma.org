I went away, and gave this some further thought, and I came to the conclusion that, despite the fact that you make some extremely good and interesting points, and I find most of your arguments correct... I just don't think I can actually be convinced to change my mind.

I seem to just have this automatic response that sees any improvement to the abilities of capabilities of individual humans as "good", and the "right thing to do", which I guess probably comes from spending days and years arguing with my fairly Luddite grandparents, that even now, after reading all of your posts and thinking about the issue a lot, I think, if given the power, I would just make everyone Daredevil and damn the consequences. I think I'm beginning to understand how my grandparents felt when they would hear all my arguments about the benefits of some new technology, and were unable to refute them except to keep repeating that they felt "bad" about it, only in this case I just feel "good" about things.

I hate guns, and strongly believe that all they've really given us is the ability to slaughter animals and each other with even more impunity, and yet if I was given the chance to wipe guns from history, I wouldn't do it. Because even though I think guns only made life worse, for everyone, I also think they increased the individual power of a single person, and that just gives me that "good" feeling again. That sense that "this is the right thing to do", and I just can't see why yet. The closest I can come to expressing it is the idea that "guns may be bad now but one day aliens might invade and we'll wish we had guns then!" or "we aren't responsible enough to handle guns now, but one day we might evolve as a species to a place where guns really are a net positive, somehow!"

So while I don't agree with all of your arguments on the arts and sciences, or on who would or wouldn't benefit, you have made enough good points that I've realized I can't really be completely rational in this debate, and that maybe what I'm trying to communicate isn't something I can put into words yet.

Thanks, for such a productive discussion :)
