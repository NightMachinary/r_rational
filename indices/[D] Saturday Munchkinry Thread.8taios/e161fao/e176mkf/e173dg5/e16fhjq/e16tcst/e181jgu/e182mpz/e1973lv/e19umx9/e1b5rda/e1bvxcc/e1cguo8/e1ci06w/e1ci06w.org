See you seem to realize quite well that there's major downsides here that require society to adapt to the existence of these powers.\\
However I suspect the psychological effects would be greater than you're letting on since people likely evolved to gauge privacy based on an instinctual estimate of people's hearing ability which suddenly wouldn't work very well.

Ultimately the proportion of people who would benefit from this just isn't that great and you would be massively impacting society in a mostly negative way for everyone else. I mean daredevil doesn't have supernaturally good senses or anything so all the benefits of his senses can be gotten through tech so it's not clear civilization would gain much from this other than a loss of privacy for average people.
