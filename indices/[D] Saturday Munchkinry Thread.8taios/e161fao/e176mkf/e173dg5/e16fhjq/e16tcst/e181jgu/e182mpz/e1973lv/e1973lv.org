When he gives his "world on fire" speech, I feel like what he describes and "sees" goes beyond the normal human "echolocation" can do. What he describes is something beyond human, and so is what is shown; his brain literally creating a simulation of his environment that he actually "sees", using everything from touch to heat sense to hearing. Human echolocation, but taken to the next level. But I guess that even if IÂ´m wrong, the fact that he apparently gained this ability almost instantly after he was blinded could still be a great boon for medicine, worth looking into. The ability to induce Daredevil level sensory abilities in blind people (skipping the training period associated with human echolocation), or even sighted people, so quickly would still be worth a lot of money.
