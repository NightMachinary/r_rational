  but I feel like that instinctual estimate would adapt pretty quickly, once everybody has super-hearing, wouldn´t it? If the human brain can adapt to the extent that human echolocation is viable in real life, I don´t see why this also couldn´t be easily adjusted. So I don´t think that psychological effect is a problem worth halting a spread over; people would relearn how to gauge privacy pretty easily.

See I don't think you can assume that. It's entirely possible our privacy gauge is mostly inborn, which would explain why people often stupidly overshare online even when that ends up having real world consequences. However the bigger issue is that gauging privacy just won't be anywhere near as easy even in people more "adjusted" to dealing with these powers. When people can overhear your conversations from a block away the idea of any privacy when you're not in the middle of nowhere or in a soundproof room becomes absurd, since knowing whether there's somebody within audible range of you becomes /incredibly/ difficult.\\
You could do better detecting people with these super senses, however the range for detecting conversations is still going to be farther than the range for detecting people not making noise.

There's also the additional very serious possibility that for people who aren't blind the sheer amount of sensory feedback is uncomfortable, however enhanced senses are likely to be the kind of thing that ends up making itself somewhat mandatory for everyone once a critical mass of people start using it, since otherwise you have a vastly diminished ability to know if anybody's listening to you..

  The way Daredevil perceives the world (as seen in the Netflix show) would be a qualitative expansion in the human experience that would impact everything from the science´s to the arts, in the same way giving deaf people hearing qualitatively changes their world.

See there's no real reason to think it would benefit science and saying it would benefit the arts is a cop out because any change to society could be framed that way.

  I think empowering people naturally leads to improvements in any field where personal ability is important, to the outdoorsman who can now be unafraid of being snuck up on by wild animals, to athletes, whose performance would naturally skyrocket after such a change, to musicians, who would enjoy the same increase in ability.

The fact the groups of people you mention are a vanishingly small proportion of people illustrates my point; that some people would love these new powers but most people wouldn't receive any major benefit (and would suffer the drawbacks mentioned).
