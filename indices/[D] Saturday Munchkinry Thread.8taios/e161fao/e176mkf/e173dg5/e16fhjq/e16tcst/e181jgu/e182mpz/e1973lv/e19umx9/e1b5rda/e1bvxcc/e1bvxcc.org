Well firstly it may not be supernatural hearing but another comment mentioned him hearing conversations from a block away so that's certainly super/human/.

I think you're also really focusing too much on this sort of hearing being used for spying. The rather larger issue is that anyone who wants any privacy whatsoever will now have to soundproof everything to a massively greater extent and people listening to others conversations will become vastly more common due to it's incredible ease. So other than helping a proportionately small population of blind people, the main result of this is that everyone feels less comfortable talking anywhere that isn't soundproofed because privacy is suddenly much harder.
