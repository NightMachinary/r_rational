I think super strength and bulletproof invulnerability, at Luke Cage´s level, aren´t necessarily that powerful as munchkin tool in a modern society, even if Luke could make tons of money in private security.

The truly remarkable thing about Luke Cage´s powers, is that he was granted them by science, not natural mutation, and the man that gave him his abilities is dead. The science of giving normal people superpowers is still in it´s infancy because, as the Jessica Jones series shows us, it is really hard, the failures die, and the successes have a habit of breaking out and disappearing.

If I were Luke Cage, the way I would munchkin my ability would be to retrain in the biomedical sciences, and use the fact that I have unlimited access to one of the only successfully created superheroes (myself) to try and learn how to recreate the process in others. I would analyze my own tissue samples, run experiments, do anything and everything in order to try and find out how to make more people super, because selling that would make me very rich, and a little trans-humanism never hurt anybody.

Marvel in general has a problem of introducing technologies capable of creating super-humans, and then just kind of... ignoring them. By the time Captain America wakes up, the US government should have entire elite squadrons of super soldiers; the lead scientist dying does not mean the entire idea is suddenly irreproducible, that`s not how science works. It´s why I like the Marvel Netflix series, especially Jessica Jones season 2, because it explores a world where science can create superheroes (or Enhanced or Powereds), and companies and corporations are, quite rationally, trying to corner the market.

If I were Luke Cage, the best way to munchkin my power I can see, is to try and corner that market first.

But honestly this is the same answer I would give if the question was about Jessica Jones, or Daredevil. Especially Daredevil. Scientifically cracking the code of his ability could potentially give who knows how many disabled people access to an alternative mode of "sight", greatly boosting their autonomy; when it comes to get-rich-quick potential it doesn´t get much better than that.
