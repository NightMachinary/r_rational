  I have to just straight up disagree with you on the inborn privacy gauge thing. I just believe people would be able to adjust, and you don´t.
#+end_quote

The evidence for something like this does seem pretty good; after all how many people that rant about insane shit on their personal twitter would feel comfortable doing that in "public", despite /less/ people hearing them, and it being /less/ likely to personally affect them (since employers check people's social media)?

  Your point on the range for detecting conversations being farther than the range of people making noise has more merit, and I will concede the point that, when walking on the street, it would be pretty damn hard for people to judge whether they are being listened in to or not. So I will concede that point. However, in Daredevil Matt did state that his ability was something he had to "focus" to actively use, otherwise he was incapable of even hearing what the person talking to Foggy over the phone (when Foggy was in the same room as Matt) was saying. So at the very least people will be able to toggle the power on and off, and slowly get used to/overcome any discomfort.

Firstly I'm not sure what your point about people having to focus to pick out conversations is supposed to be, after all that's literally how hearing already works, if you're in a crowd you have to focus to listen to a particular conversation, and how this is supposed to remove the constant sense of being "watched" is unclear.\\
I think another point you're seriously underestimating is cost, since good soundproofing is expensive (if you've ever had it put in you know it's also always less effective than you thought it would be) and thus while people will be basically forced to get these powers they may not really be able to afford soundproofing. Additionally the soundproofing required to deal with these powers is likely to be incredibly expensive compared to normal soundproofing.

This is massively important because (well maybe less so for extraverts) knowing you're being potentially "watched" is mentally taxing and this ratchets that up by at least an order of magnitude. For instance that's a massive complaint of open offices which employees seem to mostly hate, so given businesses aren't likely to bother with soundproofing effectively every business might as well be extremely crowded.\\
Though I suspect it would be even worse than that because privacy is also based on perceived proximity and if you know everyone in the office can hear every single minute noise you can imagine why that's uncomfortable (for one farting becomes infinitely more embarrassing which actually a serious issue from a QOL perspective).\\
A metaphor would be that it would be like working in a open air office constantly surrounded by crowds of people.

Given this powers asymmetry when it comes to noticing other people who might hear you, as I said before you effectively end up with people only ever feeling alone if they're miles from civilization or in their expensively soundproofed house. Soundproofing elsewhere is unlikely to happen for the same reasons open offices become increasingly prevalent.

  I don´t see how you can look at a power that directly increases our ability to process sensory information, then look at the arts, a medium that usually directly relies on the senses during it´s creation and it´s enjoyment, and say that stating that this power would benefit the arts is a cop out.
#+end_quote

The issue here is just that it's not clear there's any actual reason to think the changes to art would result in any kind of long term QOL increase for people. It would certainly be very novel at first, however that wouldn't last and eventually this would just become the way things are and you need to consider what QOL looks like at that point because that's where it will end up and stay from then on.

  A lot of scientific fields that involve outdoor work, would be positively impacted.
#+end_quote

Again I seriously doubt that because if it were true I would expect people in those areas to spend a lot more money on equipment which lets you hear/record sounds you would otherwise never notice (say those dish microphone things). Technology seems to pretty clearly have already surpassed daredevils sensory abilities and will only continue to do so, so the best advantages sensory abilities grant is /maybe/ their immediacy.

  I could keep listing groups that would be affected positively by the power, and all the ways the power could benefit society, but that would just drag on and on and overpower anything else I wanted to say. With a power like this, there are so many ways to apply it that finding a group of people that wouldn´t be benefited is the greater challenge.
#+end_quote

Easy I can list literally the largest group of workers in countries that could afford these powers, white collar workers. If you job is working on a computer all day super senses don't help. Though of course as I said before they certainly suffer drawbacks from these powers.

  Almost every "improvement" to society has come with downsides. The spread of cars resulted in more pollution and vehicular crime. The invention of sites like Facebook hurt privacy. The rockets that got us to the moon also resulted in Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. I think the spread of superpowers would be improvement. And just like the other improvements, it would come with it´s own problems and risks and challenges. But I think people would adjust, just like they´ve adjusted to everything else, and in the end everything would work out for the better. Maybe having intimate conversations on the street stops being a thing, but that´s not so bad. Now we live under the threat of nuclear annihilation, but on the flip-side we also have a space program!

See only one of those things actually fundamentally changed the human experience in a way remotely comparable to this hypothetical change. And studies do seem to pretty consistently indicate that social media lowers people's QOL. It's hard to argue if twitter facebook and the like were no longer used there would be any downsides whatsoever.
