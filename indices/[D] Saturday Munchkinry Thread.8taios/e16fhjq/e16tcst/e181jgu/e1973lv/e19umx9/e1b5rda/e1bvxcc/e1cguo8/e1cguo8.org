but at the same time, that would just lead to more soundproofed houses, wouldn´t it? If everyone has a superhearing, then many of the rules havent actually changed; people will adapt and relearn how to gauge when people can hear them, houses will be better insulated, etc... Sure society would have to adapt, but society has always had to adapt. The invention of almost every surveillance technology made privacy that much harder, and we still found ways to preserve privacy (even if sometimes it has been a struggle). People will know when whispering is ok, just like how right now we can know when whispering is ok. Maybe we´ll all get really good at reading lips, or maybe schools would start teaching sign language? Or maybe people would just talk really, really quietly; I don´t remember seeing Daredevil being able to listen in to whispers from a block away (but who knows, maybe he did and I forgot). I understand where you´re coming from, but I think people would be able to adapt pretty quickly to the change, and that the benefits of such a spread of superpowers (especially superpowers that can´t be so easily used for mass destruction, like Daredevil´s), would far outweigh the costs. I think such a spread would be beneficial- not without risks and challenges, and maybe not entirely ok to introduce quickly- but ultimately beneficial. Seeing where how far we´ve come from being hunter gatherers, humans have already adapted to many, many things; why not super senses?
