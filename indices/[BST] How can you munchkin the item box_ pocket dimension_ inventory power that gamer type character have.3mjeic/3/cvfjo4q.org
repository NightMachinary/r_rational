  Reflections can increase line of sight with no adverse effects. For instance you can store something behind you by looking at it through a mirror and touching it.

Does it have to be a pure optical reflection, or can you (for example) point a smartphone's front-facing camera over your shoulder for what is pretty much the same effect?

When you take an item out, does it have to be touching your skin to be 'placed'? (Or can you 'dump' an item out without it having to touch you?)

Can you store an item and bring it back out in a different configuration? Examples: If you store clothes you are wearing while you are sitting down, can you bring them back out to a 'wearing' position while you are standing up, or do you have to extract them in their original position and then manually put them on? (Similarly, could you store a pair of glasses which had the earpieces folded down, but retrieve them directly onto your head with the earpieces folded out?)

I assume that if you have to be touching an item to retrieve/manifest it, you can make it appear at any point and orientation as long as it's touching you? For example, you could poke a pebble with your toe to store it, and retrieve that pebble into your hand?
