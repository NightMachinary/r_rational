It'd mess with your perception, and you mentioned in the original post that at least part of the power is based on the perception of the wielder. Normal human perception is anything up to a tenth of a second behind reality, with our brains filling in the gaps; a user of the storage power could try and store something that wasn't there any more or had been replaced by something else. A camera delay would make this time-gap larger; a storage attempt could be made on an object which had not been there for some time, or had been replaced over the course of minutes or hours.

So what happens when someone tries to store the backpack-shape they see in the camera, but it's been replaced by a 1000-pound cube of iron? Does the attempt fail completely? Is a backpack-shaped chunk gouged out of the iron? Is 500 pounds of iron stored and the rest left alone?

What if the backpack has been moved about half its width away? Is the entire backpack still stored? Is only half of it stored?

If the backpack has not moved at all or been tampered with, can you store it if you're looking at a camera screen which shows you the backpack from half a second ago? Half a minute ago? A month ago? What if it's a polaroid camera and you're looking at a physical photo of the backpack from a minute ago instead of an still image on a screen? What about a photorealistic /painting/ of the backpack? What if you happen to have a photographic memory and can recall to the tiniest detail what the backpack looked like five seconds ago when you checked it out in a mirror?
