Surely we can do better than that. Let's aim for a global paradigm shift... /googles/ the world uses 17.7 TW. Let's see what we can do. Gravitational potential energy is mass times height times gravitational acceleration. You've thought of the first two factors, but we could get more energy by operating in higher gravity. Of course it's not practical moving to Jupiter (although we can probably manage space travel pretty easy.), but science fiction reminds of a classic way to simulate higher gravity: Centrifuges.

Einstein says the big universe simulator stores objects under gravity and objects in an accelerating reference frame in the same format, so we can expect to be able to add/remove weight from a running centrifuge if we can respawn things from our inventory at a different elevation than we got them from.

I vaguely remember that the industrial process where "How hard can we get a centrifuge to spin?" is the bottleneck factor is refining uranium (the limiting factor is, iirc, when the centrifuge flies apart from the centrisomething force). Combining [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zippe-type_centrifuge][Wikipedia]] with [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=centrifuge&a=*C.centrifuge-_*Formula.dflt-&a=FSelect_**CentripetalAcceleration-.dflt-&a=*FS-_**CentripetalAcceleration.a-.*CentripetalAcceleration.r-.*CentripetalAcceleration.omega--&f4=20+cm&f=CentripetalAcceleration.r_20+cm&f5=4700+rad%2Fs&f=CentripetalAcceleration.omega_4700+rad%2Fs&a=*FVarOpt.1-_***CentripetalAcceleration.omega--.***CentripetalAcceleration.v---.*--][Wolfram Alpha]] nets us roughly 450000 g.

Of course, the 20 cm give us a disappointing... [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=450000+g+*+500+pounds+*+20+cm+in+kWh&a=UnitClash_*g.*StandardAccelerationOfGravity--&a=UnitClash_*pounds.*Pounds.dflt--][Wolfram Alpha]]... 55 kWh per operation, so we'd need to do on the order of 4 of those per hour to get what the parent post gets. (My calculations are riddled with ballparkings, for example the mgh formula doesn't work so well with centrifuges and their acceleration depending on distance from the center.)

Maybe use magnets?
