Bwahaha.

Ahem.

I propose a coil of extremely lightweight fishing line (or even lighter if you can get it), with a 500-pound weight on the end. The line is really long, but that's OK, you have a camera with a telescopic lens on it so you can see the whole thing. In fact, let's have two such cameras, one pointing up and the other pointing down. Assume for the sake of argument that the line is about, oh, half a mile long - you can make the weight the size of an apartment if you like; it's not too hard to see something that large.

You stand on a balcony of some kind, pointing out over the edge of a long, long drop. There is no roof over the balcony either; you can look up to the sky.

You tie the end of the fishing line which is not attached to the weight to the the end of your finger. Maybe you have a spring or some elastic in the line; either way it doesn't weigh that much.

Stick your finger out over the balcony and push the weight off. Watch it fall through the camera pointing downwards. When it gets to the limit of the line, store it. Now look into the camera pointing upwards. Retrieve the line-and-weight apparatus in a flipped configuration, with the unweighted end of the line still tied around your finger and the 500-pound weight half a mile in the air at the other end of the line.

Let the weight drop. I'll leave the details of energy generation to the imagination (maybe it slams into a kinetic generator at the end of its fall?), but 500 pounds repeatedly dropping for a mile under normal gravity is about two hundred kilowatts of potential energy.
