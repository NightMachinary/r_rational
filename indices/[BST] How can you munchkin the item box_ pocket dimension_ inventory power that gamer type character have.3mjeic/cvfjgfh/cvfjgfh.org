Well, it makes you pretty impossible to trap. If you're tied up or put in handcuffs, you can just stow them. If you can concentrate and change your perception, you should be able to 'store' person-shaped holes through any wall or locked door. If you're in a pit, you can use the same thing to dig out handholds and just climb out.

You could get a job as a near-perfect surgeon: If someone needs a kidney removed, you can just put a hand on them and take it right out.

An extra 500lbs of stuff for free with next to no volume restrictions is a pretty enticing offer to any space agency.

You could store up multiple small sub-critical pieces of radioactive material, and then deploy them all at once, for a nuclear suicide bomb as a last resort. Or just use it to work in nuclear power production.

You could make little fast-collapsing bubbles of vacuum in a water tank as a party trick? Or you might be able to strategically stow water around you to force yourself through water at tremendous speeds.

In a fight, keep your 'stowing' power going; bullets, knives, and fists (A fist itself is not a living thing, it's merely attached to one. It promptly becomes a dead thing when separated), will all just end up in your inventory, making you invincible until your space or weight limit runs out. Unless they have laser/plasma guns, anyway
