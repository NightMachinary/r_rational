Sounds like it kills (sterilizes) everything you put in it? or at least removes any living matter. Depending on how this works this could be useful. Perfect pasteurization without any denaturing of any proteins, plus obvious medical applications, and possibly an assassination technique that does not leave a body (at least until you get around to dealing with it). Otherwise there's no practical way to put anything in it at all in most situations because most stuff in the biosphere has life in or on it.

What happens when you put cheese in your item box?

Also, you are now very good at smuggling and stealing stuff.
