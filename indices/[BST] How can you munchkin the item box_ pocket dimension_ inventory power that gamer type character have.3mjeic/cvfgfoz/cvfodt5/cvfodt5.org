Since it's subjectively based on "what's an object" it's probably subjectively based on "what's alive". If you're one of those guys who looks at a forest scene with no animals or birds visible and thinks "there's no life there" you can probably put living plants in and take them out. So long as you can keep from realizing that bacteria are alive, you're probably OK.
