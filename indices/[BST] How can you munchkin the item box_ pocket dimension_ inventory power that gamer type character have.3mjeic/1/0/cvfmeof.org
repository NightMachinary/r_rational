A bit above my pay grade but I would say yes if you can reasonably think of something having a hilt you can store just the hilt. I think the clincher is you have to actually believe it's one item not just say so. This gets into shade of grey, is a fist alive? What part of a human is considered alive or not? I'd say there's a hard rule that anything that is made of living (as in replicating) cells that you can perceive with your own unaided eyes cannot be transported.

I'm not totally sure about the other things but I'll give a hesitant yes to anything that isn't directly against the rules, which I think are strict enough as is. Feel free to list any ways you think you can use the power effectively as is.
