  I know that there isn't any real difference between saying "this sword has a hilt and a blade" and "this apple has a top half and a bottom half", except that we don't have a single word that means "top half".

Except that the blade is a piece of steel and the hilt is wood, horn, or something similar nailed or bolted to the tang of the blade.
