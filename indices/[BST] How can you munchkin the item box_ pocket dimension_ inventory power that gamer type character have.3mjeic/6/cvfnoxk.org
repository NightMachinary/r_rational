I throw out fifty feet of rope with molecular glue on the end. It hits something and creates an intermolecular bond with whatever it lands on. The rope, glue, and bound item are now a single item far more than, for example, some parts just welded together. I store the whole item, including the /component/ which was fifty feet away, despite never having laid skin on it.

I build a device, perhaps about the size of a backpack, which, internally, accelerates a heavy weight downwards extremely rapidly (maybe magnetically?), shooting it out of the bottom of the device and correspondingly making the device itself spring upwards (equal and opposite reaction). The weight also has a long elastic string tied to it, with the string ending in a small loop. I strap myself to the outside of the device. I retrieve the weight-string object in the position of the weight being un-'fired' and the string looped around my finger. The device fires the weight downwards hard enough to jerk me off the ground - but before the weight can hit the ground, or I can start falling, I store the weight-string object, and immediately retrieve it in its original configuration. The device fires again, and again, and again, kicking me higher into the air with each shot. As long as I can keep concentrating on the storage and retrieval process, I can fly.

I source the world's most powerful mechanical spring weighing less than 500 pounds. I store it uncompressed, then retrieve it in its compressed configuration where its sudden decompression is used to generate power. I do this perhaps once per second. I either use the power directly to run a variety of devices, or store it for later use.

Perhaps I do the same for piezoelectric crystals.
