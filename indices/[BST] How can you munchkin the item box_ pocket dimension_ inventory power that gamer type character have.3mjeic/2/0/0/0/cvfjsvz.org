In which case, living things should be able to be stored timelessly and be retrieved the same way, unless there's something about the storage/retrieval process itself which severely disrupts life processes at the cellular or biochemical level.

I'd want to test what happens to a vial of a simple virus, as viruses don't exhibit many of the standard aspects of what we tend to think of as life. Are they simple enough to survive the process? If not, can we examine them under a powerful microscope and see if there was physical disruption of their molecular structure? Because if not, they should still function. But if so, it might give some insight into the storage/retrieval process, and possibly how the disruption might be minimized or countered.
