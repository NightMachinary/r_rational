I'm unsure (I'm basing this off things like the gamer and re:monster and these things are never really explored.) There's two ways to go about it I would guess. Some sort of magical sterilization field that effects items as long as they are in the storage space, or the killing of every living thing that finds it's way inside.

Let's assume it's more of a magical sterilization field, let's also say that you can transport living things that you cannot see that are attached to items you can see, like bacteria etc. Which makes sense since the entire power is based off line of sight, which also mean's that anything you cannot perceive cannot be transported.
