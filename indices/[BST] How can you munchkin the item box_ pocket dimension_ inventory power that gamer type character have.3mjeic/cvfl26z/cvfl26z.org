If items are stored based on what the user considers one item, can you store a piece of something that is physically connected? For instance, if I have a sword that is cast as a single piece of metal, but I think of it as having a "hilt" and a "blade", could I store only the blade? If so, it seems that I could cut any item in an arbitrary way just by changing what I think of as an object.

How do you determine what is living? If I am a reductionist, and I believe that living organisms operate by the same principles as other organisms, I presume I am still prohibited from storing a living thing, so exactly how is what is "living" determined? Can I store a virus? Self-replicating nanobots? Self-replicating biological nanobots? (And if yes, why can't I store cells?) A normal robot? A normal robot with an artificial intelligence?

If I send through a part of a cell, does it count as alive? If so, what parts of the cell count as the living part? (Clearly it can't be "all parts" or I couldn't even send through water molecules.)

The limitation on not transporting things I can't perceive seems like it can be munchkined around by the object rule. If I store a block of metal, I can't perceive its interior, yet the entire block is stored, including the interior. So I could store an "object" made of a tiny speck on the visible surface that is connected by a tiny thread of metal to a piece of the interior.

What happens if I try to store a long object, long enough that the far end of the object has changed in the time since the light was emitted from it? Even ignoring the possibility of the object changing, does the entire object get stored instantly from front to end or is there a speed of light limitation? (If it's instant, I can send a signal back through time.)
