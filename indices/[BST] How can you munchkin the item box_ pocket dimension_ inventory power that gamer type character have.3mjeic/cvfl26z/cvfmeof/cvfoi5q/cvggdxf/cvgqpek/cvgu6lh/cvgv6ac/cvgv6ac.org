Ah, I missed that because, well, that pretty much never happens. I won't say /absolutely/ never, because someone would be sure to dig one up, but for actual swords... I can't imagine that happening. Seriously. Even if the hilt is mostly metal, it's made as a separate piece and riveted, pinned, or glued to the tang.
