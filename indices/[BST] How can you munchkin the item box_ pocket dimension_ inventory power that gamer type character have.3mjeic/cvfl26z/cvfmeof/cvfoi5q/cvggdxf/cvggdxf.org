I don't actually think "item" is a well-defined concept. At most, it means "it's useful for humans to think of the referent as a single unit". But the fact that "item" is often a useful concept for humans doesn't mean that it's not arbitrary. I /know/ that there isn't any real difference between saying "this sword has a hilt and a blade" and "this apple has a top half and a bottom half", except that we don't have a single word that means "top half".

If I was the protagonist, it seems like I could chop up an arbitrary object in arbitrary way.

If your hero is one of those, can he store clams? There's a good chance that he doesn't realize that yogurt contains living bacteria. Can he store yogurt? Could he store an apple if he 1) forgets that the apple contains viable seeds or 2) forgets that the apple contains some living cells?
