If the Jedi Order does nothing violent to oppose me, they lose even more of those proactive jedi who can't stand to sit idly by. They grow even more passive and I win.

If they do try to...oh, say assassinate me or kidnap and mindwipe me, they will fail. The force is still with me, after all, as I'm not overreaching and trying to directly destroy either the Jedi Order or the Republic. I make their fumbling attempts public, losing them their moral high ground in the public and their own members' eyes. And then they splinter, hard. I pick up the pieces and win.

I see jedi like Kreia leaving fast in either case.
