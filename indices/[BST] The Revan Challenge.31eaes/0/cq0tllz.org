I go all religious schism, Buddhism-style. Yes, the Force is real and certain precautions must be taken when using it. But there is no requirement in the nature of reality for a single unified religious order.

I'll take my cause to the people, many of whom are already on my side, claiming the jedi are good people but the Jedi Order itself is engaged in active and deadly religious persecution. Their intolerance of any other group of Force-sensitives is a threat to galactic peace itself. I also question why they don't want a strong centralized military, given that their order is the only other major armed force in the Republic.

That all this is literally true, and the jedi know it, helps my case. A lot. As does the fact that I'm a cute, 5-foot-nothing red-headed war hero. What, isn't everyone's Revan?

In addition to rolling up my own sect patterned on a looser Jedi Order for those Force-sensitive masses still requiring their opiates on the rocks, I start my own public, secular training centers for Force-sensitives, with blackjack and hookers, and parent-teacher nights on every third Saturday. Both are run in accordance with the latest in medical and scientific knowledge of how the Force /actually works/ and how it physically and psychologically affects people. If there is some "ancient wisdom" that works, I use it, even if I don't know /why/ it works. Yet. It's super effective.

Then, while everyone is running around playing political games, I drop the bomb on Republic higher ups and show off all the stuff the Sith gave me to conquer the galaxy, telling the story of how I barely escaped their control. I hint this was made harder because the Order doesn't prepare people to actually fight against Sith, because of flaws in their training and basic philosophy. That this is literally true helps my case. This wins enough of the politicos to my side to matter.

I've already told Malak my plans. His task is to run the volunteer militia arm of Force-sensitives from my training centers while I run the Star Forge. He also gets the best psychological help the Republic has to offer. It works, because "evil" isn't an attribute people have in rational stories.

While he gets more sane, I make sure he understands that if he wants to run for a galactic senate position, even using...immoral and illegal means, I'll back him. The same for his inevitable political run at the whole shebang. With my status as a war hero and religious icon, this should be easy.

I keep him far, far away from the Forge, where I'm making unmanned drone fighters and bombers and the carriers task groups to run them. As few people as possible in my fleets to be affected by the Sith's own battle meditation techniques.

As this is a rational story, I intelligently manage my "going evil" with constant counseling, drugs, and medical monitoring. Since I don't literally "go evil" from using it, it is clearly just an imbalance of my brain chemistry causing me to think megalomaniac plans are a good idea. I'll baseline myself and my plans, and not allow myself to commit to anything without taking a long rest period after my last Star Forge session. I also offer to keep a jedi on hand to tell me if I'm going "dark". If my psychologist and the jedi agree on anything, I fucking listen.

If Malak betrays me somehow, I kill him with the bomb I implanted in his brain. Because /of course I did/.

By the time the Sith show up, the better armed and consolidated Republic is ready, and Forceology (as it has cringingly come to be known) is 300 years old. Jedi mostly stick to their temples, as they aren't needed to ensure peace or whatever garbage they were selling before. The /people themselves/ ensure their own peace. We win a bloody war -- though not that bloody, as most of our frontline soldiers are droids and people with absurd luck.

Malak is either still around secretly running shit, or /someone/ blew up his head because he was getting too crazy.

I am, of course, really good at not dying. Let's just say I never "lose the will to live". Whether through the Force, cybernetics, or just moving into a droid body, I'm still around. When 300 years old you reach, look as cute you will not. That's for fucking sure.
