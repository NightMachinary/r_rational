The only way to deal with inevitable prophecies is to make sure they happen in a way that is congruent with your goals. Maybe make an invisible task force that monitors potential Emperors and tries to keep them from being genocidal maniacs. Also, we do have cryonics in this universe (carbonite freezing), so Revan should be able to stick around for the event if he wants.
