Open up communications with the highest levels of the Jedi Order, explain where I'm coming from and that we're secretly on the same side.

Incapacitate Malak. Probably the best thing to use would be that mind-wiping thing. He's Dark, so presumably not too good a precog; short-term spidey-sense is one thing, but the risk of a full-blown vision is pretty much impossible to work around when designing a trap. Still, the Force is on my side, right?

Use the Star Forge to build robot miners and engineers, with attached security force and a few ships. Send them to an uninhabitable planet (Droids don't need to breathe and can endure extreme temperatures); have them make more until they have enough to colonize another planet. Exponential growth will make me the most powerful faction pretty quickly.

The Star Forge should be operated by my minions, who will preferably agree to be mind-wiped afterward if it's cheap enough. No point letting my brain get fried by the Dark Side.

How much do I know about the Emperor? Not much, right? Because the easiest way to deal with him would be to send some Terminators to kill his grandparents in the future.

Hmm, 300 years is well over the lifespan of a SW human ... Holocrons! Phew, I'm immortal even though death will cost me my force powers. Actually, can I just make a bunch of holocrons and make copies of myself in charge of everything important? That would be a huge timesaver.
