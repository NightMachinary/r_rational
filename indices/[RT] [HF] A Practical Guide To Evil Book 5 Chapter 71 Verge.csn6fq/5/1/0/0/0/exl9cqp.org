I think you're on to something. I think "aspect pulsing, breathing, pulsing" is almost definitely describing "mastery" and not "ruin." I think the shapeless bundle of power that is an unrealized Aspect was responding to the situation, growing and taking shape.

However, I would argue that it only crystallized into *Wrest* until his declaration in this chapter. For two reasons, this quote:

#+begin_quote
  The word sang, and the world with it, as my old friend found the truth of third aspect
#+end_quote

which seems to imply that this was new information even for Masego, and the fact that Aspects generally seem to crystallize at narratively weighty enough times: at the climax of a battle (see *Struggle*, *Stand*, *Ruin*), declarations of how a Named intends to use their power (see *Take*, *Witness*), etc. I don't think there was such a moment for Masego until this chapter, since he barely even had control over his own actions.
