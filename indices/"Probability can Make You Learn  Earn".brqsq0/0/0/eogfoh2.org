thank you very much for your comment well the whole blog of Incidental Incidents is about such incidents that happen in our lives which help us become wise and give us stories to remember. About probability well yes some people would consider it as luck some would consider it as precognition it depends on what people think when such incidents happen that is what my blog makes you think.

and about the girl initially she was not at all thinking about having a bet on the rain she was upset because the rain might spoil her game. The whole incident that happened was incidental.

Do follow my blog if you like the story and stay in touch. Have a nice day stay blessed.
