Thighs are quite awkward to strangle someone with compared with a rope, a tie or even bare hands. So it won't be the go-to solution for the amateur killer and I'll firstly suspect it to be assisted erotic asphyxiation into accidental murder if I read such a headline on the news.

The mechanics will likely involve more crushing the front of the victim's throat with the back of one's knee with the other thigh behind to keep the head in place, instead of the scissor where the neck may slip out if the victim just move towards the ankles. It'll certainly take a while especially while the victim is conscious and struggling and not sedated.

They'll have to stop the victim clawing and kicking at them if the rest of the body is not held down, and biting their thigh during the murder. The coroner should check under the fingernails of the victim for clues. Also, the scene of the crime probably wouldn't be the car given the cramped space.
