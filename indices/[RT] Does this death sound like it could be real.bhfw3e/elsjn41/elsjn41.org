there is a judo hold where you can compress the arteries in the neck, and holding that too long will kill someone. so yes, its a thing that can happen. however- was he struggling? how much room did they have, where this happened?

the implausible part, to me, is that he was strangled in a car, by someones legs. that implies either a very roomy car, or a gymnist strangler.

the conclusion i draw from this, is that we are missing information.
