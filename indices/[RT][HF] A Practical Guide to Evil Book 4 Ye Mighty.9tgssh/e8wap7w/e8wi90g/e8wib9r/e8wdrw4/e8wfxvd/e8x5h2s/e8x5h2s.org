I rather like Akua's new take on "Iron sharpens iron". Amadeus dislikes the saying because it implies constant internal strife leading to defeat.

Akua dismisses the saying because the greatest sin in her culture is not trying your best. Sharpening iron is accepting the base material's limits as your ceiling.
