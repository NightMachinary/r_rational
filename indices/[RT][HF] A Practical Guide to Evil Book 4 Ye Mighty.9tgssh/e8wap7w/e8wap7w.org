Oh damn, I was not expecting an Ivah POV.

Very interesting, so after acquiring winter and having the luxury of survival in order to think, Ivah has finally come face to face with what exactly she's gotten into. We also finally have a bit of knowledge on how the Miezan occupation happened. I remember that immediately after breaking the chains, the first dread empress was murdered by the Lady of Wolof at the time, basically returning Praesi culture back to the status quo instead of learning from 2 centuries of slavery. And that ripple extends up to modern day Praes, taken up to eleven.

I'm guessing the Drow conquest is sort of a test run, and since we now know Malicia has made herself very costly to kill, Cat will eventually have to chip away at her power.
