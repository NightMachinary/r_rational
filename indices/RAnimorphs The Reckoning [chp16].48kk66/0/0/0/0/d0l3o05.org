No. The morphing tech takes mental commands, remember---Andalites interface with a lot of their hardware telepathically. This is why their hair kept going, but their clothes didn't---they first saw Elfangor demorph from human to Andalite, shredding his clothes in the process, which set up (for them) a subtle subconscious belief that clothes simply weren't part of what gets morphed. Cassie challenged that, and voila---success.

There are two in-story phenomena that are explained by this; being able to morph away an AK-47 is one of them.
