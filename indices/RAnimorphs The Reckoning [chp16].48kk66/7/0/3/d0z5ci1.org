  what's going on with Marco
#+end_quote

Just finished reading all the available chapters. What /is/ going on with Marco I didn't even notice that there was something we should have deduced ourselves while reading. I though that private conversation that Cassie didn't let them have at that point in time would be happening in the next chapter instead or something.

Could you elaborate what I missed?
