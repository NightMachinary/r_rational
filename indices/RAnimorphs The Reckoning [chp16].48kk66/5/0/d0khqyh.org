Your video made me more interested in just what color is your hair, and how strong you are to be able to pull off some of those maneuvers, than supporting your fiction.

Unfiltered reaction breakdown, in case feedback in this form is something you value:\\
"Ah, a patreon. I'll see how they're doing. Video - watch it later. Two people so far, only one pledge level... fairly high... but no actual pledges there. Must be a way to pay a custom rate like on other patreons. Good way to generate random names; how diverse is the rational sphere name pool? Or those that are reading this, even further refined. Wonder if people will opt not to pick the 30 minute options so as not to waste his free time and get updates faster. Getting early chapters is a proofreading chore, don't want that. Basically the same blurb as in the reddit comment. Free time, coding - wonder what he does. Programmer of some sort. Artistic camera angle. I want to see him approach from afar down that white strip, strolling into focus. Video play. Unified naming policy across accounts. That was a parkour move! Nice attention grabber. This is really advanced! Is this just a parkour video? Red hair! Running form's a bit awkward. Seems fast, though. Must be strong to pull these moves off. Wonder how fit he is. Could be wearing a lot of layers. Can't get a good look - did his hair color just change? Nope, back to red. (Focusing on observing technique.) Perhaps a way to show his personality without giving a clear look at the face? Don't know how effective that'll be. Did his hair change style and color? Just color? Nope, it's red. Does it keep changing? Nice production value. Wonder if he did it all himself. I have to google his name now to see if I can find out his hair color. Two pictures. CFAR employee. CFAR doesn't pay him to make the middle school bootcamps? Wonder what he does. Github is also TK Studios. Same guy? Compare. Same noses, eyes, brow, glasses frame. Does his eyebrow match the red color slightly? Is it the same person? Must be. Dyed? Maybe. Can't tell for certain. Probably, but without knowing the brow color... is his facial hair red? Shadow looks a bit dark, but that doesn't say much. Complexion fits red hair. Can't tell."
