He could wear a bodysuit, kind of like Coil. I don't think he morphs that often, or that clothing is so expensive he needs to worry about ripping it when necessary. Maybe humans are the only species that wears clothes and it's still a novel concept. But you'd think they would have to understand the general concept through things like spacesuits or shields or heat insulators which they would almost definitely have already thought of.

Although clothes that a mutated horse centaur can put on itself might not be possible, come to think of it. It would be a ridiculous hassle unless the clothes involved fancy nanotechnology or something. Plus I assume it would be uncomfortable for a horse to wear a bodysuit, and the Visser would experience that discomfort (and distraction) as well. Makes more sense now.
