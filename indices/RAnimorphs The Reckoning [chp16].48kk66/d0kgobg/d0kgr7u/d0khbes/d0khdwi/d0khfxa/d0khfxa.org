Thanks for looking it up.

I think Esplin's countermeasures aren't very good. I had to look up what depilated means, and it just means removing hair from. But they could still get inside his skin. Also, I think a good way to assassinate someone would be to morph a tiny animal, enter someone, and then demorph into a human being. During the demorphing process the morpher arguably might be protected from breaking bones or dismemberment by the template of the Escafil device, but even if not a suicide attack on top Yeerk officials is worth dying for, especially if you can come back to life in someone else's head.

Also, I wonder if there will ever come a time when an Animorph literally sits on top of his head in his eye stalk blind spot.
