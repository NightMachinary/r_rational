Oh, oh, oh, that's horrible and I doomed the human race, but...

  What are V3's contingency plans?

I think everyone is assuming that the Yeerks biggest constraint is that they need to feed every three day, which means that the controllers are dependent on yeerk pools, and must go to one regularly at all costs, so they're screwed if their only pool is blown up, right ?

Well... not exactly. If we leave canon aside, there's not explicit rules saying you have to keep every human infested by the same yeerk. It's not like they have to keep track of continuity (like, one yeerk makes a promise, the second one doesn't know about it and blows his cover) since they can read their host's memory. So yeerks can keep operatives on missions away from a pool for weeks by supplying them a stream of replacement yeerks to be infested by. They can cut the time spent by the hosts at the pool to a few minutes by swapping yeerks instead of keeping the hosts in cages. And of course...

  What is the logically inevitable conclusion of the Yeerk pool being taken out?
#+end_quote

The yeerks can just set up their agents with multiple yeerks under stasis to keep in their homes. Instead of going to a pool every three days, they can just go to a warehouse to resupply every two weeks, the warehouse itself being resupplied by cloaked bug fighters. It might be a logistic challenge, but you can support a millions-strong invasion for however long it takes to build a new pool that way.
