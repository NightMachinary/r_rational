Oh, I agree. But if it came down to choosing explosives over poison, I think Cs would be a poor choice of explosive substance. A gas leak would be excellent. Sneaking in a propane gas tank (limiting my choices to cheap, easy and straightforward for teenagers) and shooting it with a Dracon beam would guarantee some serious damage. A gasoline slick on top of the pool lit aflame would create a lot of panic as well.

Actually, here's a fun consideration - they've got a stasis container now. Would it be possible for Ax to rewire it into a delayed explosive device, or to keep an explosive (about to go off) in stasis in the container, with a timed failure programmed in? Would be so innocuous if that were the case, stroll down and leave it on a table somewhere. Walk out, count to 60, boom.
