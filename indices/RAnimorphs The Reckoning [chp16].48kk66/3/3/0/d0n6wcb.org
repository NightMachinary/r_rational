Blowing up the pool feels like it would take longer to clean up than bleach.

Whether the best way to do that is Na or Cs or something else, I couldn't say. If you're willing to sacrifice an animorph, then sneaking into the pool in a morph that's hiding explosives seems sufficient. If you're not willing to sacrifice someone, it becomes a lot harder.
