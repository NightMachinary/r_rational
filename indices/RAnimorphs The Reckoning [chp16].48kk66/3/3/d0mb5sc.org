  How would you get your hands on 200lbs of Cesium?

Frankly, I wouldn't. Too much shit can go wrong, it needs to be stored in oil to prevent explosive reactions, it has a melting point of 28C, which means it'd probably be either very soft or a liquid if you were to carry it around on a regular California day. Not to mention, it will /ignite spontaenously in air/. Also, from Wikipedia: "...a caesium-water explosion is often less powerful than a sodium-water explosion with a similar amount of sodium."

Imo, using Cs is overall a bad idea. It's incredibly difficult to obtain and store, not to mention transport. You'd need special training to avoid seriously hurting yourself, and teenagers won't have that. Additionally, no one is crazy enough to store 200 lbs of it in one location, which means you'd have to raid multiple different places. Na on the other hand is way easier. You can get a fair amount of it (maybe anywhere from 10 to 20 kg in total) from school/university laboratories. Or chemical suppliers, but then you'd have to either get the funds, or steal it.

But if you're going to go that route of poisoning the Yeerk pool, why not use a fuckton of bleach? It kills fish (and everything else) very effectively, after all. It can do some nasty chemical burns even to human skin (speaking from experience). It's cheap. You could buy a whole grocery store's worth and then go buy more afterwards. It doesn't have much flash and dazzle, but that works great for a stealth mission. And people won't even think too much of the smell, they'd just think someone was doing some cleaning nearby. You put bleach in the Yeerk pool, they're going to lose a lot of Yeerks, and spend ages, fucking AGES, filtering it out. Or having to drain and refill the entire pool. Hell no.
