This is true. Thing is, putting Cs in the Yeerk pool should create CsOH, an extremely strong base. This is if we make the reasonable assumption that Cs will follow the trend of group 1 metals, which is to form a strong base upon reacting with water. According to Wikipedia, CsOH is one of the strongest bases, strong enough to /rapidly etch silicon semiconductors/. If the Animorphs were to put a large amount of Cs into the pool, this would result in an explosive reaction, and then form a large amount of CsOH, raising the pH of the pool into 'insanely alkaline' levels. I'd imagine the resulting Yeerk deaths would be on par with that of bleach.

Now granted, in canon, the Yeerk homeworld has crazy acid rain. I'd expect the natural (and therefore Yeerk-built) pools to be somewhat buffered against pH shifts, but it's still very possible to overcome a buffered solution with a strong enough or large amount of acid/base.

Also, I think Yeerk population currently is the bottleneck. Tons of hosts (actual people), but not enough Yeerks. Infrastructure is definitely valid though.
