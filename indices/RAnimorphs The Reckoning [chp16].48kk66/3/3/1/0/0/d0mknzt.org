Nah, the hosts are the bottleneck. Well, not the individual hosts, but the population centers. The Yeerks have plenty of humans available, geographically speaking, but none of these humans are "theirs" before they are regularly to the yeerk pool and staying there until reinfested.

Infesting any given human is trivial if you're ready to throw resources at it (send a bunch of cops arrest them), but infesting high numbers of human is a logistic problem, where you need to take into account variables like the risk of exposure, what to do if you capture someone who's passing by but lives far away from the yeerk pool, etc...
