An interesting way to play it would be to make the crayak and eliminist more blue and orange morality and less good and evil, which allows you to explain their game, and relatively subtle actions in the universe

One possibility is to make it that they both have alternative goals for the fate of intelligent life in the universe, and their ways of playing the game match with that philosophy.

E.g. the ellimist values diversity of different minds throughout the universe, even at the cost of those minds suffering, so makes a myriad of subtle changes, Crayak is more interested in maximising intelligence overall, so wants a single dominant form of life to assimilate everything, and takes fewer but more direct actions (e.g. the howlers)
