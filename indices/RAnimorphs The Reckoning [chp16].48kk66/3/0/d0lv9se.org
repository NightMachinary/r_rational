  What do the Yeerks actually want? What's their wincon?
#+end_quote

The removal of the Andalite military as a threat. It could be achieved through diplomacy or other subtle means, but is most likely to happen by actually destroying the Andalites military capacity, one way or another.

#+begin_quote
  What's the Animorphs' best next move?
#+end_quote

Recruiting. They have a power multiplier, the blue box, which does not seem to need fuel or other supplies to work, only time. Thus they need to use it as fast and often as possible. Also, getting actual people with resources and military experience on board.

#+begin_quote
  What's the Animorphs' best next move, given V3's attempts to model their thinking (turbocharged by a psychic glimpse into Rachel's mind)?
#+end_quote

Avoid tactics that can only work if Visser 3 is unaware of them. Focus autoimmune-style combat, where the cost of reliably protecting against you is higher than the damage you actually make. A lot of it depends on V3's goals, personality, and what Rachel saw of them when she was exposed to the psychic glimpse. Does she know he knows about Alloran's backdoor? What does she know about yeerk politics?

#+begin_quote
  What will V3's reaction to the Animorph's best next move be?
#+end_quote

Being evil. Otherwise, probably what he's already doing. His strategy seems to deviate from the optimal strategy of putting multiple infestations centers in India and capturing billions of people, so I would suggest switching to actually doing that.

#+begin_quote
  What would you do with the blue box?
#+end_quote

Take over the world with my supervillain army.

#+begin_quote
  What would you do with the one laser beam you stole from the Yeerk pool?
#+end_quote

Reverse engineer it as fast as possible. So far, the only thing that's keeping the military from destroying the yeerks is their aerial superiority. Bug fighters can destroy any explosive missiles shot at them, and dodge kinetic missiles, and the pool ship can do orbital bombings without ever being worried. Destroying it should be the opening move of, let's say, the NATO. Once the yeerks have lost their aerial support, they can be easily quarantined, and will start to negotiate for a surrender.

#+begin_quote
  Is V3 still accounting for the presence of real Andalites (i.e. Ax)?
#+end_quote

Depends on what he saw in Rachel's mind. He knows they acquired Elfangor, but he's proably too proud and not paranoid enough to assume that they know about the backdoor. He could know about Ax's distress signal, and make the appropriate deductions.

#+begin_quote
  How soon would the Yeerks spill over into another city?
#+end_quote

A month ago?

#+begin_quote
  Who would you recruit next, and how?
#+end_quote

Trained soldiers. By talking to their superior. In the meantime, non-captured cops from another city.

#+begin_quote
  Would you risk turning this into a shooting war?
#+end_quote

The question is not whether this will turn into a shooting war, it's when. Both sides have two objectives they want to complete before an open war: the yeerks want as many bodies as possible to be able to take prisoners after they win battles (that is, not just nuke the other side into oblivion), the humans want better technology to actually win said battles. If it became a shooting war right now, the yeerks would loose any fight because of their unsustainable logistics, but anihilate the other side anyway because they hold the high ground (mothership orbiting your planet).

#+begin_quote
  What is the logically inevitable conclusion of the Yeerk pool being taken out?
#+end_quote

A lot of people dying. Otherwise, it depends on several factors we don't know about. Are yeerks ready for diplomacy? What is the state of the war on other planets? In any case, if the yeerks loose their pool, they're not going to be able to install a new one in any strategic location without annihilating the entire local military first, so they're not going to nab their seven billion people.

#+begin_quote
  What is Rachel not telling everybody else?
#+end_quote

So, remember that time when *something* completely blew our surprise advantage and led to our parents being captured and any hope we had of not losing millions of people disappeared? Yeah, well, there's a funny story...

#+begin_quote
  Would you attempt to rescue your family, given the current situation?
#+end_quote

I'd probably mount an assassination attempt. If I weren't a 13 year old kid, that is. Well, Rachel and Tobias totally would.

#+begin_quote
  How would you get your hands on 200lbs of Cesium?
#+end_quote

/cough cough military/

#+begin_quote
  How would you go about interacting with adults, as a teenager with morphing power?
#+end_quote

I think they would be kind of distressed by the whole "child soldier" thing. Also, since the kids don't have much experience child soldiering, by opposition to canon where they had three years under their belt, I'd expect them to be (slightly) more willing to shut up and listen to the grown ups.

#+begin_quote
  Atlantis? Helmacrons? Explicit Ellimist sidequests? Ants morphing into humans? David? Rachel splitting into two? Rachel vomiting a crocodile? Rachel superpowered by an evil omnipotent being?
#+end_quote

No, no, maybe, nope, maybe, god no, no, only if she actually accepts and gets to take over the world.
