I'll elaborate later, when I'm not on a tablet, but I've got some initial ideas. First, though, there's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/30vbzw/ranimorphsthe_reckoning_theorizing/?][an idea I first proposed almost a year ago]], which seems still valid.

I can't theorize about Visser Three's plans in general, because I /know/ what they are. Dang it.

Right now, though? He's enjoying a nice book, and maybe looking forward to the Pool dance-off that's happening later tonight.

Please no helmacrons. Or Atlantis. Or similar stuff that I can't remember right now. Please.

Someone needs to interrogate that Yeerk they got. The Chee can take care of their Yeerks, so maybe something could be done to interrogate those as well (I doubt there'd be much help from a Yeerk who knows it's going to die no matter what).

I would try to abuse access to Elfangor's brain/knowledge.

I would totally risk turning this into a shooting war. Earth is not worth the galaxy. Elfangor and Tobias have the right idea.

The speed with which the Yeerks will spill over into another city will depend on their rate of reproduction. If I were them, I'd consider trying to inoculate the mainstream population against belief in Yeerks by taking a few major conspiracy theorists as hosts and spreading easily-debunked theories about parasite invasions which are, despite being false, still in the general area. The kids are still a problem, but it means that escaped hosts won't be believed (and escaped hosts may be worth thinking about) and the kids will have to work in person and reveal themselves to anyone they want to convince.

Try to get the government as quickly as possible. Set up Plan Bs in other countries.

Consider North Korea: Is government collusion there possible? If so, then go for it. Heck, if you could somehow nab the higher officials, you wouldn't have to worry about collusion, and then the rest of the country falls like dominoes.

Consider recruiting in war zones where people can easily disappear without anyone being surprised.
