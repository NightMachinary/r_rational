I think I misread that part of the story. I assumed that Macro morphed into someone holding bags full of stuff, not demorphing to base state with guns. My thought was that using morphs to store matter, such as acquiring a MarcoWithAGun morph. Since many of the Animorphs are using morphs of themselves as buffers, why not also have self morphs with weapons? Or as a means to quickly share limited resources.

I understand that the bags were meant to be an analog to the leotards and bike shorts of canon, but why couldn't it work in reverse. The argument that holds true, that nonliving things such as hair can be acquired and morph, could be applicable to acquiring morphs with nonliving parts.

We also show that morphers can acquire morphs from other morphers, without actually acquiring the original morph. Morphing into a bird does not poof the bird out of existence on Earth. Multiple people can morph the same morph acquired by only one person, albeit with feedback restrictions.

Basically, why can the following scenario not happen? Marco Morphs Self and picks up a Dracon Beam. Cassie acquires Marco's Morph, with a focus on the Dracon Beam. Marco demorphs sending the Dracon beam into Z- Space. Cassie morphs into MarcoWithADraconBeam.

In a scenario where matter conservation is somewhat moot, replication is the name of the game, and we have users storing inorganic material in Z-Space, why is it impossible to replicate a Dracon Beam?

Not trying to nitpick or pry, but the idea of sharing/storing weapons in Z-Space or reproducing inorganic material in Z-Space sounds really cool and fairly plausible.
