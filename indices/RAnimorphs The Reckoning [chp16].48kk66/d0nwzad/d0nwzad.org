I'm confused about why Tobias needed to put together that the morphing tech used yeerk biology to interface. That would be something Visser Three knew, so Rachel presumably should have known all of it already, along with several other things this chapter.

For that matter... I don't think any of what Rachel got was explored in this chapter. I assumed it would be of great importance. Is she keeping it to herself for some reason? I guess I can wait for her chapter to find out...
