Well I, for one, felt /extremely/ lost during this chapter, in a stark departure from previous ones. Most of my confusion was cleared up from reading the comments here, but I /still/ don't know what the hell was going on with the John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt or the three-fingered clawed hands. If it matters, I have zero knowledge of canon.
