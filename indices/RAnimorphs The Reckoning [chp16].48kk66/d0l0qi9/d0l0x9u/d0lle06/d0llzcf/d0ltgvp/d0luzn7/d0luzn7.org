My guess for the importance of the John Jacob bit is that they're trying to weaponise thought-speak to shut down Visser Three's ability to react. He can't plan if he can't think, and thought-speak is intrusive.

It's possible that Visser Three will have countermeasures for this (e.g. being able to shut out all thought-speak), but since he's the only one with an Andalite controller he might not have had any practice with it. It costs them little to try anyway; mentally yelling a song you know by rote doesn't require much concentration.

The three-fingered claw hands could be from a dinosaur or something (maybe the Jurassic Park staple velociraptor or [[http://dinopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Therizinosaurus][therizinosaurus]]?). I'm a little fuzzy on the rules about acquiring from dead animals and fossils, but it must have been difficult since only Cassie (who is preternaturally skilled at morphing) could acquire it.

I'm not sure how many dinosaurs would actually be superior to modern morphs for most purposes, but I'm sure there are a few that would be very effective if you could actually acquire them.
