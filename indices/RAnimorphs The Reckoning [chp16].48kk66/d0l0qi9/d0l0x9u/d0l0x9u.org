Yeah. I've been experimenting with being a lot more spare with my description in recent chapters, trusting readers to fill in the gaps (e.g. what's going on with Marco, the context for all of the short, swift scenes in the middle, how Rachel spent the previous three days). I'd be interested to hear people's opinions on whether the current balance of spelled-out vs. left-up-to-you is close to ideal or not.
