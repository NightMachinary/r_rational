So, was that caused by Garrett's fear? Maybe he panicked and thought of a scary movie he once saw, or something? Also, I am not sure what they are trying to do.

Part of me thinks they were trying to morph Garrett into a biological flesh coat a la the Terminator, going on the theory that living things inside other living things would be immune to the disintegration rays. This seems reasonable, otherwise the Yeerk hosts would get sick from losing all their gut bacteria. If wearing a living Chapman skin suit lets you through the scanner, that might be within the Animorph's capabilities.

However, this seems like an unnecessarily convoluted way to pull off this plan. Why not just morph into a tick or other parasite and hide underneath the real Chapman's skin? I think a dust mite on the hairs inside his nose would probably be safely unobtrusive. It would be simpler than whatever thing they were attempting to make Garrett become.

Alternatively, they might have been trying to morph Garrett into something entirely nonbiological, essentially the inverse of the Terminator's skinsuit. Again, that seems unnecessarily convoluted to me.

Logistically, it is surprising to me that the Yeerks do not have more K-ray generators and pools. They are spending billions on securing this one location, and nothing on redundancy or decentralization. It is explainable in terms of their psychology or the economics of K-ray generators, potentially, but it is hard not to notice that this is quite convenient for the Animorphs' plans.

I assume the Yeerks have backup plans along the lines of "what to do if the Andalite terrorists kill 95% of our forces in one fell swoop?" Maybe they have various leaders' aides infected already, even though they are too paranoid to dare yet go any further? Just hard to think that they wouldn't have redundancy of some kind, if they were indeed rational. Sorry for making the story harder to build, feel free to ignore any of this.

In a way, Yeerks are potentially the ultimate guerilla terrorists, if they are able to avoid the K-ray limitation, so in that sense they do have a lot of redundancy. If you think that counterinsurgency is difficult, you haven't seen anything yet. "Battle for the hearts and minds", literally, but they don't stay won. Mopping up stragglers in the aftermath of a Yeerk war would be totally impossible no matter how crushing your main victory was, so it's a good thing the K-ray limitation exists.

I liked the edit from the beta chapter I read, good job.
