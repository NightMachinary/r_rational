Pretty good chapter! The writing is solid, and I really like Cassie's reflections on morality.

Two nitpicks: the question of *why* they don't go to the military is getting more visible. Jake seems to have considered the idea and rejected it for some unspoken reason, but the only one I see is "so that the Animorphs can stay relevant to the story".

Also, I feel that the "morphing AK-47s" thing is getting a bit far from what the morphing power represented in canon. Morphing people, morphing away injuries, even reading thoughts and memories felt like logical extensions of the same base power. But if you can morph supplies and weapons, well, you've just become a superweapon in an inconveniently human-shaped package. Why would the andalites bother to put this technology in they soldiers, instead of directly in their guns and their tanks?
