It's not that you can morph INTO a nonliving thing. It's that you can SEND a nonliving thing along with your real body as you morph into an animal (just as you send along your nonliving hair and your nonliving clothes). While a frog, I cannot use any of that stuff, but if I morph INTO a frog, go out into a swamp, and demorph, then when my body comes back it will also bring with it my hair, my clothes, and my AK-47.

Also: Tobias is missing.
