And with the bleach suggestion - if you're going for massive collateral, add an equivalent amount of ammonia (also very cheap and easy to obtain). If the Yeerk pool happens to be quite basic or acidic in terms of chemistry, that may cause a decent amount of chlorine or other toxic gases to be produced.

From Wikipedia: "Mixing bleach with some household cleaners can be hazardous. For example, mixing an acid cleaner with sodium hypochlorite bleach generates toxic chlorine gas. Mixing with amines, for example, cleaning products containing ammonia or related compounds and *biological materials* [emphasis mine] such as urine produces trichloramine. This gaseous product can cause acute lung injury, and chronic exposure, for example, from the air at swimming pools where chlorine is used as the disinfectant, can lead to the development of atopic asthma."

I would imagine those gases to be potentially deadlier to Hork Bajir as they may have more sensitive lungs. In canon, the HB homeworld is of less-dense atmosphere especially at the treetops, so their lungs would be very efficient at gas exchange. Similar to how birds are easily poisoned by toxic gases before humans are seriously affected.
