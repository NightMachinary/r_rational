Based on what's been said in the story so far (I only read one animorphs book as a kid), the biggest potential strength for both sides in this war is also largely untapped by both parties: global human civilization. If the Yeerks have control of key influential people they should be working to leverage that into governmental and military control. The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is a heck of a lot more defensible than a public swimming pool.

For the kids, recruiting is strong, but it has a weakness. Only the ones that met Elfangor got the anti-yeerk defenses installed, and anyone who has used the cube is able to destroy it at will from any range. The self-morph armor might or might not work against Yeerk infestation. Given this, and the Yeerk's likelihood for exponential growth, this may suggest that the kids should do a single big recruitment push followed by an all or nothing strike against the earthbound aliens.

On reflection as a reader this is probably a bad idea because of what I infer about the games that the gods are playing, but from the kids' perspective I think it makes sense. I'm also not sure how the kids should react to the knowledge that they're pieces in a game of 5 dimensional hyperchess. Without more information it seems like the gods exist solely to justify the story staying at a human scale rather than escalating into global war.

I think intelligence is really needed as well. I'd try to leverage Ax to figure out the larger strategic situation of the war. Why are so few Andolites and Yeerks involved at this point if Earth will decide the fate of the galaxy?

The vulnerability of the Escafil device does not mean that it should not be used. It's just a powerful asset that's risky to deploy. But there's little difference in a destroyed asset and one that you never use at all.

Likewise, the kids need to militarize humanity against the Yeerks. Yes this should become a shooting war, a mind control torture parasite infestation that's on the verge of pandemic is one of the better casus belli of history. Cells of military trained humans working outside of a centralized command structure and minimal communication seems like a good option for fighting Yeerks if we assume that morph armor isn't a defense against mind control.
