If we can acquire the morphs of others, and store weapons with morphs, would there be a way to create multiple Dracon beams? What happens to morphed weapons when the user demorphs? Could the Animorphs attach the Dracon beam to a morph, hand the dracon beam off to another to another to morph it and thereby have dracon beam morphs?
