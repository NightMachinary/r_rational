Keep in mind that nonliving things like hair aren't acquired---they're generated according to a genetic template, with sculpting/double-checking against a particular recording of a given creature's physical state. This is hand-wavey (because the whole morphing tech is hand-wavey), but IMO, the primary limitation is /compression/. The tech is already storing a ridiculously large amount of information, in particular the complete brain-state of the acquired creature. There have to be SOME shortcuts, and DNA or other genetic maps are the key. The morphing tech generates a "wild template" from the DNA, and then makes small tweaks and corrections to bring it in line with the specific individual acquired.

In order to "acquire" a weapon or other piece of technology, the tech would essentially have to analyze it molecule by molecule. There's no information compression scheme like DNA that allows you to cheat, and there's no /fundamental/ categorizing like "everything in this cubic section is made of steel." It's just too much information to store and reproduce, imo.

That actually sounds like the true reason, to me, but I'll also add that from a narrative perspective, being able to store and smuggle matter is already super powerful, and being able to generate it on the fly puts you into Star Trek levels of completely ridiculous and why-isn't-this-universe-just-over-already.
