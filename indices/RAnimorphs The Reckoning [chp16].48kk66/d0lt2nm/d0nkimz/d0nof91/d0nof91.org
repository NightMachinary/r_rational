No way to create multiple Dracon beams using morph technology.

Alice has a Dracon beam. She morphs into a badger. Her real body, holding the Dracon beam, is off in Z-space somewhere; all that's in normal space is a badger body with some extra Yeerk tissue in its brain.

Bob acquires that badger. When Bob morphs it, he's morphing a badger with a little extra Alice-control tissue in it, with a little /more/ extra Bob-control tissue on top (the brain is getting crowded; you can't pass morphs along forever). But Bob hasn't acquired anything related to Alice herself, or the Dracon beam she's carrying with her off in her own little Z-space bubble.

Good question, though.
