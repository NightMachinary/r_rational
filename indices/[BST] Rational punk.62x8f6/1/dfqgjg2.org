Could you please give more details about your story? I can provide more concrete advice that way. Also, I am interested :)

In my opinion, -punk stories should give focus to the following points:

*Point(s) of divergence*

Why civilization in your world developed in a significantly different way? Is it because humanity had a different set of resources at its disposal? For example, [[http://mythcreants.com/blog/looking-under-your-worlds-skin/][this article]] details a world where Stone Age was followed by Helium and Uranium Ages.

*Technological progress*

Static -punk world, in my opinion, is even more strange than static medieval world. People start new projects, search for new applications of discovered technology. Your heroes might read the news and imagine how the world will change in 5-10 years (and give completely wrong predictions about that, possibly!).

*Revolutions*

Oppression is featured prominently in steampunk and cyberpunk (I am not so sure about clockpunk and rocketpunk). Just remember that there are more ways to change the corrupt system than assasination and reformation.

  Violence is the most common method of advancing a cause in most fantasy books. It need not be the only one. Teaching someone to read can be a revolutionary activity <...> So can sheltering refugees, providing people space to practice their religion, copying down or passing along information, remembering what someone else wants you to forget, making speeches, drawing cartoons, writing articles...
