Some other potential Cold War stories to take inspiration form:

- [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra][MK Ultra]]: It started with /"hey LSD is active in really small dosages, I bet we can dose people very clandestinely; let's see if we can find a use for it"/. It ended up creating the Unibomber, abusing the mentally ill, and kidnapping people from Brothels to interrogate them with LSD. This could be a great way to show the cruelty and irrationality on both sides, perhaps as an antagonistic force?

- [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Azorian][Project Azorian]], the time the CIA stole a sunken submarine with help from Howard Hughes. This really shows how crazy the CIA got with their planning and engineering capability. The USSR was more old school spycraft, where as the CIA was the new kid on the block.

- [[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2554/1][Salyut 7]], the time the CIA almost invaded a Societ Satellite except for some bad weather. This one is especially relevant because of space!
