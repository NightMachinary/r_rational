Thanks for the shout-out! I've been doing some more digging, so I'll update this as I find stuff:

*Staff:* Red Robe had a staff. LOTS of people have staffs, of course, but RR is an important person, so perhaps his staff is as well.

*Dagger:* I'm looking for items that could be considered daggers; bladed weapons, basically. The vampire (chapter 26) has a sword that is, quote:

#+begin_quote
  ...her sword (which was clearly magical, burning with strange purple fire that ate through forcefields)...
#+end_quote

My tinfoil went on when I read about the "strange purple fire," as Q-I's crown has purple gemstones, and purple is the traditional color of royalty (and these are imperial artifacts).

Once disarmed (heh, literally), she pulls out a knife:

#+begin_quote
  she promptly pulled out a knife with the other arm and returned to attacking people again.
#+end_quote

Also mentions that her blades (plural) can cut through forcefields. Which... actually probably discredits the idea that either is the dagger in question, since apparently forcefield-cutting blades aren't unique if at least two can do it. Back to it!

*Rings:* No luck looking for other rings than the one mentioned in my original thought (ring of trees). I mean, there ARE other actual rings. Haslush has one that converts alcohol to sugar. Zach gives Zorian one with Magic Missile on it. One of the random cultists had a ring of mind blank. And Zorian of course makes suicide rings. But no ancient imperial rings that I could find. Maybe I could look for "band" like "a band of silver around his finger" or something...

*Orb*: I don't recall any orbs of note. There are training orbs used to record mana signatures; Xvim has one and uses it to test Zorian and make sure he is who he claims to be. Which, assuming Xvim is DADA, would be kind of hilarious - what if it's an imperial artifact that records the mana signature of all who hold it?

But with the revelation about RR leaving the pocket dimension, it seems pretty unlikely that Xvim is a DADA trope; and both he and Zorian claim the orbs are used for training all the time.

Only other thought was maybe the soul well...? But that's not an orb, and almost certainly was created by Sudomir. No idea what else could be used.

*Predictions*

I'm pretty sure that Q-I's crown is a key item. It gets pointed out each time the lich appears. And a crown seems ridiculous to wear into battle, undead king or not. But none of the other possibilities I listed seem all that strong. It's quite possible none of the other artifacts have shown up yet. But I'd like to think that the author has put some hints as to where they could be to justify future moves. My guesses:

Tesen: As House Noveda's guardian, he likely has access to all of its treasures. We still don't know why Zach was chosen, but it was confirmed in this article that Tesen donated the Sovereign Gate to the crown (+literal+ governmental crown, not Q-I's). If the Noveda bloodline has the Gate as an inheritance, it stands to reason that they had at least one of the artifacts used to access it. Either Tesen himself may have one, or there may be one in Zach's vault, or the aforementioned "Ring of Trees" has to do with it.

Damien: If not RR himself, Damien is probably going to come into play during the treasure hunt. Leading expeditions into ancient ruins? Check. Has located something of interest? Check. I feel very confident that Damien will soon make an appearance in person, and will either have a key item, or will help find one.
