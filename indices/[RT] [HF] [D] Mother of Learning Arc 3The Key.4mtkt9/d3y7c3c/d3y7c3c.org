What's the purpose of these admin keys anyway? I mean, it seems like an awfully big security flaw to leave admin keys in a place where the time traveler can have unlimited attempts to access them.

Unless of course, the whole point is to leave an emergency out for the time traveler just in case something goes very wrong. (As it has in this case) While being inaccessible enough that the user doesn't run sudo rm -Rf --no-preserve-root by accident.
