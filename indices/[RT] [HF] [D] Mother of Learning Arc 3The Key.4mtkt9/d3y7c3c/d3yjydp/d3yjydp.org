I think that's the point, yeah. Since gathering all 5 keys in one month would be difficult for anyone that didn't have "true" looping, it basically serves as a backup plan.

Zorian and Zach can gain mana capacity, knowledge, and skill to eventually be able to recover them with ease. People brought in by them probably couldn't without assistance (e.g. Zorian or Zach saving their notes on the search), and would need to be sufficiently strong in the first place.

And obviously it would be vanishingly unlikely for somebody who wasn't looping at all to manage it, or for them to be gathered and used by accident.
