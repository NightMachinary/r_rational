  But why even have a key, much less have a key be a secondary function on something else?

I /think/ you're thinking about this from the point of view of someone designing the inside of the simulation first. I could be wrong. But.

If you're building an expensive magical artifact (The Gate) which can grant fantastic powers through its use, you want to lock it down. And we already know that it was built through the government, so it would stand to reason that the government would want to be in control of the artifact. And because it grants government-ending power, access controls should be multifactor: present in a secure location, with tons of mana to run the artifact (and therefore tons of mages), and with the consent of a high government official. What better symbols to show the government 's trust in whoever enters the simulation than to require the royal items?

And, once someone has entered the simulation with these items easily available (they will have the items with the at the time the snapshot was taken, in all likelihood), why not use those inside the simulation for other purposes? It's reusing a token that's already in use, for a similar purpose. The items let you in, so they should also let you out.

Then Red Robe comes along and brute-forces the entrance, and so the items have not been gathered in the room. Or Red Robe used them, and removed them from the simulation.
