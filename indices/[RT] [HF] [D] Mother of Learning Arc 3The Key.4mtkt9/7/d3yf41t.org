I'm going to throw speculation at the wall here. I'm assuming each artifact had some sort of stupid op power, that an idiot in the gate may need to use before they actually know what going on

The dragger presumably time travel kills, its how rr learned his "soul kill" and was his(/his cult?) before the time loop, it started glowing or something when the loop started causing pre-loop rr to research it heavily and one loop he met zach, tried to kill him with the dagger(an enemy who brags about coming back to life seems the sort of person to stab with a soul something or other dagger) when it didn't work he poked around with zachs soul

The crown probably gives general knowledge of how magic works form that "age of gods"(as finding teachers seem to be a pain) the fact "qi" wears it everywhere, suggests that it isn't the old necromancer, but a pawn rr gave it to whos masquerading as the lich.

the staff is a staff maybe a #hype long lost brother has it

The orb is for providing mana to continue the loop, its probably in the middle of the forest guarded by, oh I don't know an zombie ice dragon or something

The ring, is probably what imprinted zachs soul to start the loop; its looked boring so zach was allowed to keep it

/speculation

edit// even more wild speculation, what if while the scientists were poking around in the cube the saved a copy of the world and its decades after the war and zach actually entered the loop to meet dead friends and his compulsion to single handily win the war by himself is actually survivor guilt
