I agree that the key might be a some sort of weird backup feature, but I'm surprised that the key items are... part of normal continuity.

Clearly, the gate can recognize controller(s), and gives them pretty complete access during normal operation -- it's not like the controller needs the key to exit the loop.

Seems like if you wanted the extra functions of the gate to only be available to the controller in the event something went wrong, and the loop functions as specified here, the best way to prevent non-loopers from using it would be to create a part (or parts) of the copied world that varied from iteration to iteration, and somehow modified / branded memories in such a way that the key could only be used if a controller was exposed over the course of multiple loops.

These sorts of devices wouldn't be part of normal continuity, and therefore certainly wouldn't be part of legend.

Just putting 5 McGuffins in general circulation seems like a obviously poorly designed system, so I have to assume that they keys aren't really designed as a backup failsafe -- maybe they're specific pieces of equipment to help the controller modify the loop in individually useful ways, but are less useful outside the loop (e.g. however RR removed souls from the loop might do nothing in the real world), and they've just been scattered by time? If that's the case, even collecting them all may not really change the situation, though it might provide insight into the systems controlling the loop.
