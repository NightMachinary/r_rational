  Seems like if you wanted the extra functions of the gate to only be available to the controller in the event something went wrong
#+end_quote

...then you would put them on their soul marker.

  Just putting 5 McGuffins in general circulation seems like a obviously poorly designed system, so I have to assume that they keys aren't really designed as a backup failsafe -- maybe they're specific pieces of equipment to help the controller modify the loop in individually useful ways, but are less useful outside the loop (e.g. however RR removed souls from the loop might do nothing in the real world), and they've just been scattered by time?
#+end_quote

I think they are useful pieces of equipment alright, and useful outside of the loop too, but they have a secondary function of also beign the key.
