  This is hilarious and awesome. It also fits pretty well with the canon behavior of the ancients in terms of their irresponsiblity.

Yeah, as far as I know this should all be 100% canon compatible. I mean a lot of it is just completely made up (e.g. literally everything about the Furlings), but I tried not to violate anything established. Most of it started from attempts to explain completely ridiculous canon behaviour and the fact that observed stargate physics makes no sense.

I'd completely forgot about the anubis gate weapon. Your explanation for it sounds pretty plausible though.
