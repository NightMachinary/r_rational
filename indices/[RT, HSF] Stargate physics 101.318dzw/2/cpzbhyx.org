This is hilarious and awesome. It also fits pretty well with the canon behavior of the ancients in terms of their irresponsiblity.

Also, I thought of another device in canon in the context of your fic. The [[http://en.stargate-wiki.org/wiki/Stargate_destroyer][device]] Anubis used to overcharge the gate... what if it was actually meant to drain the excess power buildup you described... but because it is so rarely used and there are so many stargate it can't actually drain power fast enough, so it was re-purposed into a tool for destroying stargates.
