Yeah me too. Scott Alexander and I don't see eye to eye on a bunch of subjects but were we to ever interact I'm pretty sure the worst it's likely to go is polite disagreement and slight mutual incomprehension. I don't really get where the eye bleeding comment could be coming from, especially going just off this story.
