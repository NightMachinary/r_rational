This was awesome. What was Sam's reaction? What was the SGC's reaction to this info? The beginning had the main characters of the series for a very short time, and then it never went back to their POV. I imagine that knowing or having a good idea of all of the hazardous tech problems that can happen with the Stargate ahead of time would have a big impact on the plot of the series. Some episodes just wouldn't happen the same way since the SGC would be more prepared. They might even (eventually) be able to make their own stargates, or at least fix the current stargate system or take advantage of their knowledge of how it works to get an upper hand on the Goauld. Although this would make the Ori a lot scarier, admittedly.
