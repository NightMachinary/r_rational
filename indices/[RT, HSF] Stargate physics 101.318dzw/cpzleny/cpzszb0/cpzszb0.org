  This was awesome. What was Sam's reaction? What was the SGC's reaction to this info? The beginning had the main characters of the series for a very short time, and then it never went back to their POV.

Yeah, they're mostly there for set up. I don't actually want to write main character Stargate fanfic because that would lead me inevitably to the unbounded time sink that is writing my Competent!SG1 AU and I already have an unbounded time sink of a project that is actually useful. :-)

In terms of Sam's reaction, I'm not sure. She's going to have to rethink a lot of what she thought was fundamental physics. I think the main actually useful take home from this is the fact that giant space gates and extremely compact long range communicators are things that you could potentially reverse engineer from Stargate tech, because the things you think are fundamental physical limitations constraining how the gates work are actually just part of the project spec.

I guess the other useful thing is knowing that you should be really a lot more cautious when doing irresponsible shit like dialling out to a black hole and dropping a gate into a star because basically these are only potentially non-catastrophic in the scenario that the gate designers were afraid of being eaten by a giant werewolf who was upset by them not handling that edge case.
