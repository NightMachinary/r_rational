  I'd completely forgot about the anubis gate weapon. Your explanation for it sounds pretty plausible though.

Huh, I almost thought you were trying to obliquely hint at it and was expecting it to be name-dropped or something towards the end.

  Most of it started from attempts to explain completely ridiculous canon behaviour and the fact that observed stargate physics makes no sense.

Well... if someone from several hundred years ago had access to modern technology with no instructions, a lot of it would seem counter intuitive and weird I bet. But yeah, the stargates' and other tech's weird behavior doesn't make sense as a result of basic physics. Using your style reasoning, I bet one could come up with a technological explanation though.
