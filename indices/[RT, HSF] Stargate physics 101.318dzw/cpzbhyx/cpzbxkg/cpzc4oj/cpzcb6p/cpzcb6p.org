Yeah, it could be that there actually /is/ some clever advanced physics reason for a lot of the behaviour, but given the weird edge cases, the observably terrible safety and security design principles, and the in-series description, "strap a ring transporter onto a wormhole and sort the rest out in software" seemed like a pretty good explanation. :-)
