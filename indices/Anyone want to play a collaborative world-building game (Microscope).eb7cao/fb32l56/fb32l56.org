I'd definitely be down, as long as being an experienced writer isn't a requirement. I've done worldbuilding for fun before but I've done very little fiction writing that was actually meant to be READ by anyone since high school. I do have TTRPG experience, but only as a player so far, I'm still planning my first campaign as a GM.

One day per week sounds like a time investment I can make as long as it's not a big deal if I occasionally end up busy on a day and can't post much (or even at all, as long as that doesn't happen /too/ often). I don't actually anticipate this being a huge problem, I just can't promise my schedule won't change.

I wonder if there's a way we can make the "scenes" aspect work? Probably not with ALL the players, but maybe we could have a discord where players can coordinate to do scenes between two or more of us? Eg, we might not stop normal play to do a scene with all of us, but if someone creates a scene on their turn they might reach out on discord, see who's available and interested in that scene and play it out when possible, not necessarily even still on the player who created the Scene's turn.
