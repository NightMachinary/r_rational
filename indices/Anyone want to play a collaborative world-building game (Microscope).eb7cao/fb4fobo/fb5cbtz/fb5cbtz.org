Unless someone in the current group leaves, we're all full up for this game. But as DrFretNot has commented, a second group is definitely possible if someone takes the initiative to set it up. It's not like you need to get up to 7 players. None of the rules I've set up have been tested, and it may be that more or fewer players is better.
