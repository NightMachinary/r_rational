Reddit has sitewide rules against piracy, which this subreddit follows, not that it comes up very often. You can [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b28d9q/rpiracy_has_received_a_notice_of_multiple/][see this thread on /r/piracy]] which shows what a message from Reddit Legal looks like. I don't want this sub to be on the receiving end of one of those, and will comply (via removal) with any reports pointing out something that constitutes distribution of pirated material as I understand Reddit sees it. If you want to pirate, do it on your own time, with your own resources.
