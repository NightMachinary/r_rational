I'm interested in setting up a group, but I'm going to wait because it sounds like (1) this is the first time you're running Microscope online and (2) you're adapting it yourself rather than using anyone else's tried-and-true methods, and I'd like to see what works/doesn't work before I move forward.

If your group doesn't want to make the game public, for whatever reason, could you PM me in a couple of months to say "This, this, and this worked; that and that didn't work; and this other thing sooort of worked but in retrospect I'd do it differently"?
