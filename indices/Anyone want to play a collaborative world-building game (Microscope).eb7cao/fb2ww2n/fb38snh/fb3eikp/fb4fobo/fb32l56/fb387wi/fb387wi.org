Don't worry, I'm far from an experienced fiction writer myself, so any game I'm in will necessarily have a low bar for writing skills, as long as it's not actively hard to read.

I have exactly the same qualifiers on my schedule, so there shouldn't be any problems there.

And as far as scenes go, I'm definitely not opposed to having that option open for players, although I'm skeptical that it would get much use, especially if the player then has to summarize and publish the result. Of course, there's no downside to allowing it, so I'm on board.
