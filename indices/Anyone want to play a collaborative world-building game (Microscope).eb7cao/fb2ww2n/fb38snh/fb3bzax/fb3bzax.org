The rulebook is on library genesis. Obviously "microscope" has way too many results to comb through, but searching the author's name will return it quickly. I can't post a link publicly (for reasons detailed in edit), but PM me if you need one. Or just search libgen like I said.

EDIT: Can't give a link publicly, sub is forced by reddit to stop the free distribution of information. Not the sub's fault (Although subs that aren't focused on piracy specifically aren't hit very often AFAIK, and even piracy specific subs can usually live for awhile before needing to migrate, so actually enforcing it actively beyond the most brazen stuff is probably overkill, especially when it's piracy of books which is less actively fought against than music, movies and TV. Still, I understand the caution. Down with intellectual property, and down with capitalism!), but it sucks. If you need one you'll have to PM me, or just search libgen like I said.
