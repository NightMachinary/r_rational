The rule book definitely doesn't need to be bought, though it may help if one of us does want to buy it. I won't have access to my rule book until after the holidays, so we'll probably just be going by ear with the rules as I remember them. I've also got some ideas for a few rule changes to better accommodate an online, long-form game.

I'm currently testing out a very simple google site, which I'll share for editing with all the players. Entries will take the form of pages on the site, and with links to any nested entries. It won't be the most convenient possible medium for this game, but I think it'll still be pretty easy to use.
