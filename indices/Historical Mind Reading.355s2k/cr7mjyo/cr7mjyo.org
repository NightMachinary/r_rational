Seems to me it's the most useful for the shortest time displacement.

I can be a perfect spy by visiting some expansive hotels day after important meetings were held. I can probably get rich quickly on stock exchange.

If time stops when I'm in the past - I'm effectively immortal, and can probably abuse this to win in some sports (also chess) - I will have more time to think.
