Sure, I'll take a stab at this ...

If I were working in Hollywood, I would pitch this as a police procedural (/she can read minds in the past and use it to solve crimes!/). Then you add in a cast of side characters (/she works with her ex-husband! her colleagues are socially-inept geeks! in the season finale we find out that her captain is a killer but she can't prove it! there's another mind reader out there/ */but he's evil - and sexy!/*) and run it for however many seasons you can justify.

** Personal Gain

It would be a useful power for grabbing personal passwords, assuming that people are actually thinking those and not entering them through muscle memory (or using LastPass). Easy enough to just sit in a coffee shop and get log-in information for everyone that was in there yesterday. Same goes for a combination to a safe - just standing next to one would be enough, unless there was some biometric component.

** Government Work

If the range is a single day, you can interrogate someone and then sit in the room alone the next day - that's not doable with a year range, unless you want really old information (though that would still probably be useful for some purposes). The single largest benefactor for your historical mind-reading would be the government, since it would allow them access to a lot of strategic information that they would want to know. Obviously it would make sense to start giving you language training as quickly as possible.

If you can read thoughts in the present as well, you become very dangerous to keep around. Maybe working for the government would still happen, but they'd have to use intermediaries and video communication so that you're not privy to an overabundance of classified intelligence.

If you can substantiate your claims in some way, you might be able to insert yourself into the legal system somewhere, but the power is better when it's kept secret from people - otherwise they'll deliberately think misleading thoughts.

Edit: Oh, and if you make the determination that it's better to be public about it, and think that's a safe thing to do, claim the Randi prize and then go into reality television.
