Nothing, with respect to the observer who's observing it.

Think of it this way: there's no observation that can distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation (decoherence is the collapse of the wave function) from the many-world interpretation (decoherence is the entanglement of the observer with the experiment). So there's no reason to treat the collapse of the wave function as a real thing. So there's no reason to assume that a second observer completely uncoupled from the environment will change what the first observer observes.

You could argue that it's impossible for there to be a completely uncoupled observer, and they must be interacting with the past to extract information from it... but in that case that interaction would in principle be measurable directly, and it would be that interaction that would be entangling the state of the two experimenters.
