You can investigate crimes. You could investigate historical stuff, which you could probably get a lot of money for. Although you should probably avoid anything too religious. You don't want to make enemies of the people who trust Jesus more than you.

What exactly constitutes a "location"? Could you stand on a space shuttle and view space? It would be pretty convenient for people to just have to bring you a surface from something for you to use your ability.

You could send messages to the past by messing around with double slit experiments and the like. If you can observe, you're not epiphenomenal.
