At this point im stuck between believing its a stylistic point or the lack of an overarching plan for the story. The story has a lot of qualities that mirror real life, including the lack of a main conflict and story threads constantly starting and stopping. While it may be a stylistic choice, it's always irked me and I hope the author decides to focus the story a little more.
