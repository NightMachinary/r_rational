I do love that in this story, sometimes a plan does go off without the worst possible thing happening solely because it might be more interesting to, for instance, have to fight the dragon. Like the opposite of the Unspoken Plan Guarantee. It feels more real and like the characters are actually learning the rules of this place, which is more interesting to me.

But I also get the feeling that later on they might have to fight or negotiate with the dragon since it's now a Chekov's gun unfired. Maybe something they discover when they finally explore the bathrooms forces them into it. Or maybe after they find another dungeon (the Apartment or the Restaurant or the Hospital are my current frontrunners as far as expectations go) and they have to make friends with this one and use some of its assets/aspects to fight the next one that turns out to be much darker or more dangerous. Or this might be straying into fanfic territory.
