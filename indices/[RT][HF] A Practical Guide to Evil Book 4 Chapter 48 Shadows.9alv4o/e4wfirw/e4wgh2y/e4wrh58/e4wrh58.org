The populations probably not as high as you might think, given that food from Callow is limited by the terrible farming practices the gnomes keep people using, and also how they have to feed Praes and Praes' armies. There was that slight issue of a hundred thousand people plus being wiped out at Liesse, which is generally just not great for the entire south of Callow, or it's economic and agricultural situation. and then all the people Praes has killed over the years of its occupation (which, IIRC, is /also/ in the six digits).

This becomes an issue when Callow routinely does things like get its soldiers stranded in hell, or explicitly use the Callowan soldiers as meat shields to keep the Praesi alive. They've lost half their army several times in a row now.

And now there are new mouths being sent by Malicia for Callow to feed. And the southern farms were essentially bombed.

But even ignoring that, think about what Ratface (may he rest in peace) says:

  "I understand the Hellhound is riding you about funding for the army, but another thousand men will make no difference if we can't pay those soldiers.‚Äù

Callow is, as we've been told over and over again is all but broke. There were concerns about just maintaining the army as it was, let alone rebuilding one, or making an army that can "shake the continent". Like, it's all well and good for Cat to order the treasury emptied, but we've been told many times that it already /is/ empty. And Callow has no trade, no one it can borrow money from. How are they going to pay and provision soldiers?

This is something of a huge deal. I'm hoping that this is the main focus of the next book, and not something glossed over while Cat runs around stabbing people.
