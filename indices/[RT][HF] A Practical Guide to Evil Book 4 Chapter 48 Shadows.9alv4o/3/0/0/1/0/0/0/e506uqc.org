I'm not about to advocate for killing all of the refugees. I'd really like it if someone could find some compassion in themselves. But in looking at the consequences here, I think it's important to Malicia is sending them specifically to disrupt and destabilize Callow, and Malicia is competent enough that we can assume that it's a plan that should work.

If Cat send them down towards Liesse, there's going to be issues, almost definitely in the short term and potentially in the longer term if enough damage is done to the already very damaged Callow.

Liesse itself is a literal hell hole, and the lands around it are apparently no good for farming, courtesy of Summer. It'd be a drain on resources that are already questionable.
