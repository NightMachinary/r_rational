Don't the Legions wear chain and/or plate? Don't their enemies use inferior metal armors? This strikes me as a problem that needs to be addressed. I don't think peasants have chain or plate lying around.

But sure, Callow could melt down all of their spare metal. Kind of like Mao Zedong during the Great Leap Forward.

A maximum of 7,000 invaders dead before Cat wakes up from her lake induced coma. Scavenge armaments? Maybe. We don't have granular details on the treaty, but assuming Cat retained ownership of leftovers then you're still counting on a salvage operation that involves some degree of lake.

That's stretching it a bit.
