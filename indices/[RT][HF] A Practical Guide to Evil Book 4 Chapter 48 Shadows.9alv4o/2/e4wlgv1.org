People in story make a bit of Catherine being reactive instead of proactive as the source of her problems, but everytime she tries to be proactive something stomps along to kick her teeth in. She's always going to be on the backfoot purely from being in the same arena as people who were moving years before she started. Every attempt to build something that might survive her is smothered in the crib. Hell, in interlude chapters people like Warlock and Malicia look on her as an incipient corpse. Or maybe this is just the start of the purification process the dead king talked about.

And despite her stroke against Callow, Malicia seems to have abandoned her original objective with Black and moved away from calcifying Praes into something less obscene and more into a functional nation. The truebloods are gone, but far from forgotten. Those institutions are beholden to the calamities, who are loyal to Black - who has lost faith in her. She's riding a tiger that's trying to buck her and short all the tools she had before, with new threats to replace the old ones.
