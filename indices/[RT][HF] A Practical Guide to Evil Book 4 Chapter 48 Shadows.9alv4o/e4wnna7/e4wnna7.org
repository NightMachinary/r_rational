So if Juniper could build an army within six months, why do they need the drow? Pull back to Callow, reinforce and recruit, and invade Praes in half a year. Sure, Procer's gonna be brutalized, but they have their entire army + 30,000 Levantines to stall The Dead King for months. And with his invasion of Procer, the need for an army immediately disappears, no? Ashur will keep Praesi forces divided on defense and unable to invade Callow. Hell, the best plan might be for Cat to try and recruit and extract Black. She already knows him, his spies stopped Malicia from gutting Cat's officers, and I doubt he'll be too thrilled with TDK joining Malicia. He knows the narrative implications of such an act, after all.
