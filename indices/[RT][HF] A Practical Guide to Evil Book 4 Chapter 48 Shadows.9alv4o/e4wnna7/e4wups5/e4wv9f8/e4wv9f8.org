  Also, strictly speaking, didn't Cat get just about everything she set out to gain from the Dead King?

That's just what I was thinking. She needed an army to stop Procer from invading again, and now that Procer is going to be invaded instead, Cat doesn't have an immediate need for an army. The only real danger is TDK and Praes turning on her after Procer is destroyed. Or, y'know, TDK taking over the world. Which is a legitimate concern, but I'm not sure if trying to get the drow on board is going to be much better, if it's even possible.
