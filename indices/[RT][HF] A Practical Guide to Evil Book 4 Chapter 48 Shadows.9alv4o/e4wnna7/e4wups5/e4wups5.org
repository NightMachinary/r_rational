Also, strictly speaking, didn't Cat get just about everything she set out to gain from the Dead King? Her goal was to use his invasion to take the threat off of Callow, while maintaining plausible deniability. This is exactly what she currently has, save that she was not able to negotiate a delay that would let civilians.

On the other hand, scrying is not necessarily secure. We've been told this on any number of occasions, and explicitly in this chapter. Whether or not she is headed for the drow lands, I suspect that she said this meaning for it to be overheard. Just as likely, it's a bit of misdirection before she heads somewhere else. Or maybe even the whole gang will go to Thalassina to see Warlock.
