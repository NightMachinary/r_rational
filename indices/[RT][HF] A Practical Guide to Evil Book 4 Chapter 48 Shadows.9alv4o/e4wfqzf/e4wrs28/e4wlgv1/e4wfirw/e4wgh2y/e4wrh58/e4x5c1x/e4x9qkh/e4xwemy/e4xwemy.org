  I think there was an argument about Callow minting their own currency, which fell on the side of not because it would be seen as antagonistic to the Tower. I can't find that tidbit at the moment. I think it involved Ratface.

As Werafdsaew pointed out, this is something they're already trying to do, with already existing issues. And Ratface is gone, unfortunately for Cat and Callow.

  As for provisioning soldiers? If by "the southern farms were essentially bombed" you mean the Summer Fae incursion, then that was not explicitly stated, was it? The Fae were targeting people, presumably in population centers like small towns or cities, not torching land. Land doesn't scream. The Fae can't hunt land. >So, the crops in the south were not necessarily lost. And rural farmers probably avoided death by dint of being too sparse to bother with.

Not so, unfortunately for Callow. Back in between Summer and the Diabolist, and before the latest round of slaughter (and before Malicia started sending refugees specifically to be a problem) Cat said:

  Ahead of us lay plains that had once been green, before Summer came to own them. Now half the land was scorched black and the rest lusher than was possible in Creation. Orchards bore fruits regardless of the season, fields already harvested grew again tall and golden wheat. *There would be food shortages, in the coming months.* My homeland had seen war twice in three years, this one even more devastating than the last. *Even if the blackened earth was made cultivable again, how many of those fields would lack men to till them?* Summer had killed many, harmed more and I knew Akua would bring deeper wounds still.

/Chapter 39 Exposition/

And now they've pulled out farmers from Fields.

  As you've mentioned, Callow does not have any foreign trade now that the Tower has cut them off, so they can pull all sorts of monetary shenanigans without making themselves worse off right off the bat. If they can manage the transition between foreign coin and Callowan coin then avoid military induced inflation in the local prices of necessities, they're golden.

I'm sure there are lots of clever options available, but the book has stressed many times how difficult this is going to be for Callow, and now most of the experts who would have dealt with these problems are dead, and there are major issues with replacing them.

This is a storm of critical issues that Cat needs to deal with, and I think she needs to do it on screen.
