As for armaments, I remember it being mentioned that everyone in Callow kept weapons, swords and such, they've inherited hidden solely for occasions just like this. It's a tradition. Whenever things get bad enough in Callow the common folk grab their family's sword and go fight back.

And presumably they've scavenged a lot of armaments from their battle against the crusade as well.
