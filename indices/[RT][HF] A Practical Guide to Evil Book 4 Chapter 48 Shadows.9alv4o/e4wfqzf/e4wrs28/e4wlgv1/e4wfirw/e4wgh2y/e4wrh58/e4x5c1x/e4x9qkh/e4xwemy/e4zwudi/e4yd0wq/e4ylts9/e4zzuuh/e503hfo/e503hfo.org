Maybe? A magical solution would probably be the neater than a complicated socio-economic policy that takes years or decades. But I'm also not sure if human sacrifices can actually help?

The best description we have of Prasei field sacrifices, afaik, is the one from book 3 chapter 66 Refrain:

#+begin_quote
  “On the third month of the year I found myself on the outskirts of the city of Okoro, and stumbled upon one of the famous Praesi field rituals. The throats of ten and three men were slit on dusty ground, and from the lifeblood spilled the earth turned from yellow to black. Granted audience with the lord presiding, I asked him the meaning of the ceremony. ‘Everywhere men bleed,' he told me. ‘In Praes we get the full worth of it.'”

If the best human sacrifices just increase the fertility of the soil.. I don't think that helps too much? Best case scenario is that it helps clean up some of the south.

Maybe there are other rituals or spells? I really can't make guesses at the limits of the magic system, tbh, or what problend it can and can't trivially solve.
