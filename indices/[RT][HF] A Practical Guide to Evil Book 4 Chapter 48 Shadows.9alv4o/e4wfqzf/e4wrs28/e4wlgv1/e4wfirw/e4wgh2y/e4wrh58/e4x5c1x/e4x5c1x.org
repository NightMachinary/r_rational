  How are they going to pay and provision soldiers?
#+end_quote

I think there was an argument about Callow minting their own currency, which fell on the side of not because it would be seen as antagonistic to the Tower. I can't find that tidbit at the moment. I think it involved Ratface.

As for provisioning soldiers? If by "the southern farms were essentially bombed" you mean the Summer Fae incursion, then that was not explicitly stated, was it? The Fae were targeting people, presumably in population centers like small towns or cities, not torching land. Land doesn't scream. The Fae can't hunt land. So, the crops in the south were not necessarily lost. And rural farmers probably avoided death by dint of being too sparse to bother with.

Money is the most immediate problem for Callow's war machine. If the army doesn't pay, people desert, but Callowan patriotism might mitigate desertion. Anyway, the money problem can be addressed by Callow minting their own currency, then pushing the problem on into the future where spoils of war or land grants or militarily enforced foreign trade could make up the difference. As you've mentioned, Callow does not have any foreign trade now that the Tower has cut them off, so they can pull all sorts of monetary shenanigans without making themselves worse off right off the bat. If they can manage the transition between foreign coin and Callowan coin then avoid military induced inflation in the local prices of necessities, they're golden.

Hell, without foreign trade siphoning it away, Callow probably has a surplus of food.

The less immediate problem for Callow's war machine is acquiring the materials with which to wage war, which off the top of my head I classify as: 1) food, 2) shelter, 3) armaments, 4) supply train, 5) siege machines, 6) goblin munitions.

1. Food is something that Callow has in abundance, this is cannon from the Black Knight's little black book.

2. Shelter is presumably not a today problem, because it's not winter and they're still in Callow--so they may rely on existing garrison infrastructure.

3. *Armaments are a problem.* Gotta get that good steel. Probably from the Goblins or the Deoraithe. I don't remember Callow proper being described as having mines. This is doubly important for the Drow plan Cat is going with, since the Drow were described as low tech. This needs to be addressed in-universe in my opinion.

4. Expanding supply trains is not a today problem either. Callow is raising armies, likely near garrisons and cities. This only becomes an issue for new mobilization, which occurs after training.

5. Siege machines! Pickler's were nuked. This is a concern for the next armed conflict, but that next conflict might still be a ways off. There's nothing to suggest that these require anything scarcer than time to build--timber and rope are common.

6. Goblin munitions are being addressed, re: the envoy mentioned in this chapter.

I think it would have been better had Cat said 'Well, time to print our own currency' than 'Empty the treasury'. And also addressed armaments as well as munitions with the emissary. Otherwise we're on point for a huge army... and Callow as a failed state if that army is not successful enough.
