Calling it /solved/ is somewhat hasty. They don't have food to spare for refugees, that's for certain. The farmland in the south is still all but gone, and there's apparently no one to work it. Plenty of other land has been torched in the various other wars callow's fought in recently. Now they're pulling everyone away from the Fields of Streges - This is all obviously going to limit their production quite significantly, especially if even more men are taken from the fields elsewhere into the Army of Callow.

The last we heard about Denier and Summerholm's food supplies, their granaries had been "all but emptied". Now Laure is apparently out of wine.

I've been searching backwards and forwards through the story, and I can't find one instance of where food in Callow has been plentiful recently. What there have been is mentions of food running out and the concern that people are going to go hungry soon. Maybe they can hold out for a while. But eventually "soon" becomes "now", especially if all the policies we see Cat taking are ones that exacerbate the problem.
