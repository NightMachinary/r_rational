  I remember it being mentioned that everyone in Callow kept weapons, swords and such, they've inherited hidden solely for occasions just like this.

And even if those aren't enough, Catherine could simply decree "Everyone who isn't going to war, give your weapons to your neighbor who is!", and melt the surplus equipment.

  And presumably they've scavenged a lot of armaments from their battle against the crusade as well.

I'm not quite sure. Most of the crusaders either drowned in a lake that became a marsh, or ran away. I don't think there was much lootable gear to be found, especially since most of the crusaders were under-equipped. I guess Catherine should have requested for all their weapons to be confiscated when she made the ceasefire treaty. (although if she'd done that, now they'd be defenseless against the Dead King)
