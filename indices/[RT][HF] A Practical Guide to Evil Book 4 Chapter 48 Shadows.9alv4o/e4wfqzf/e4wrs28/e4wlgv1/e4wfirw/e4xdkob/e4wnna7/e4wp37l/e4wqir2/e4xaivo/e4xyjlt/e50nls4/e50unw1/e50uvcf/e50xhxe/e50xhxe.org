I'm not totally wedded to the concept, but I would be surprised if the foreshadowing about the Drow here turned out to not be a significant element (whether it's fulfilled or subverted).

Interestingly, searching for prior mentions of the Drow in the story I found a mention in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/12/28/interlude-precipitation/][Interlude - Precipitation]], said by Cordelia Hasenbach to prospective Good allies (emphasis mine):

  We have been looking south all those years, and *now Evil wakes*. Do you think the Tower will stand alone, when their Legions spill out onto the continent? The Dead King will rise from his slumber and drown the world in death. *The Everdark will band under a single banner and etch the Tenets of Night in blood across our cities.* The Chain of Hunger grows larger and bolder every spring, and when they come it will not be in warbands -- their hordes will blot out the horizon.

And this is contrasted with an earlier mention in Akua's interlude [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/villainous-interlude-coup-de-theatre/][Villainous Interlude - Coup de Theatre]]:

  /We are the last of our breed, Malicia. The last great villains of Calernia, perhaps in all of Creation./

  *The drow of the Everdark had collapsed into bickering tribes unworthy of the ruins they haunted.* The Chain of Hunger was nothing more than a horde of starving rats, as incapable of villainy as any other animal. The Dead King, that famed monster who'd turned his entire kingdom into undead and invaded the very devils who'd thought to trick him, had not stirred from beyond his borders in centuries. Stygia and Bellerophon had been muzzled by the other cities in the League, reduced to petty border disputes, and the same city of Helike that had broken the Principate's back under the Unconquered now flinched in the face of Procer's displeasure.

I'm getting the feeling that this is all going to turn into a Good vs. Evil (and Evil vs. Evil, and especially Callow vs. Almost Everyone) showdown sooner rather than later, especially since the only Evil faction in Akua's monologue that are not now gaining in power is the Chain of Hunger.
