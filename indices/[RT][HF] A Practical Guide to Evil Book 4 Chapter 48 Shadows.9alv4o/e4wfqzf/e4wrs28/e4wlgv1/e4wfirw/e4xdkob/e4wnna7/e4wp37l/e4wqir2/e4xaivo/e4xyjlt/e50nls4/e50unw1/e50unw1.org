Right, I'm just saying that the Black Queen, bearing the mantle of Moonless Nights, is likely to end up taking over the Dark Elves, a matriarchal society that follows the Tenets of Night and lives underground (where there is no visible moon).

Maybe the point is for that expectation to be subverted, but if so this whole excursion to the Drow is a bizarre arc to include in the story (especially right off the back of another failure to get help for Callow).
