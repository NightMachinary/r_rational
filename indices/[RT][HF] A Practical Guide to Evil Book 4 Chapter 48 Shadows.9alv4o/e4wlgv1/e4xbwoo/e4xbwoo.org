I think Catherine still has a fighting chance to build a lasting nation, even with the latest setbacks.

Her court was decapitated, but the assassins targeting her army were intercepted, which shows that the Jacks (and Black's men) are a match for Malicia's spies. She just needs to get better at defensive warfare: covering all fronts, hunting harder for enemy spies, making examples of anyone she finds, etc.
