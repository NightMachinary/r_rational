I loved this chapter and this style of writing (which isn't surprising given the subreddit). Its rare to see a character explicitly modelling another characters thought process and rarer still to see it done well (both the modelling and the writing of it). Its strange that it is so, I feel like it implicitly undergirds a good majority of human interaction.
