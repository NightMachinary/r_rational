That was also a reaction to the whole "people keep looking at it" thing. Maybe like a month ago I decided to add a line that said "this is a draft," and then I updated the chapter and saw all that extra stuff. Apparently, a month or four prior to that, I had an idea and decided to jot it down in the document itself and then forgot about it (not the idea, mind you, but the fact that I jotted it down in the doc on ff dot net; I'd had that idea bouncing around in my head for a few weeks at that point, and I was lying down in bed and my brain just started running through that scenario so I got up afterwards and wrote it out to make my brain shut up). Now that it's there, I'm not going out of my way to remove it, not when the entire chapter's already been rewritten multiple times. Everything between "And standing behind the cauldron" and the line break is a sneak peak at what my vomit drafts look like, but the entirety of the rest of it is a rough draft anyway.

  Action beat. "Draco?"

  "Why do /you/ think he's here, Mr. Potter?"

  Harry spun around to face the voice behind him and saw Quirrell.

  "/You/. Maybe more words." Action beat.

  An expression with Quirrell's face. "Mr. Potter, you failed. We're not moving on until I've made you understand everything you did wrong." Action beat.

"/You/. Maybe more words." Action beat.

That's pretty blatantly "rough draft material" LOL

And this one:

  I cannot cast magic on you directly, and I needed a way to implant the False Memory Charm without the readers bitching about the Resonance.

I got a good chuckle out of that one.
