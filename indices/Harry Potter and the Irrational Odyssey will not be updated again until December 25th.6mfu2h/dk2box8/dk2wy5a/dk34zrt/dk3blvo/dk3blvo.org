It just kinda comes naturally. You really shouldn't focus on the mechanics of writing while you're trying to get things plotted, that's how people end up getting stuck, but I still want to have the "whens" roughly blocked even if the "whats" are still fuzzy.

"You. Maybe more words." Action beat.

That action beat could be "Harry clenched his fists" or "Harry furrowed his brow" or "Harry dramatically collapsed to the ground and pretended to have a heart attack" or "Harry took a deep breath" or "Harry closed his eyes briefly" or "Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing" or literally /anything/. If I tried to do that part while drafting, then I'd end up with a bunch of floating heads furrowing their brows at each other.
