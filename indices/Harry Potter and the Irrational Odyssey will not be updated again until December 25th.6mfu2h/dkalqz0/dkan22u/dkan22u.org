I could've replaced the chapter with a new document and there would've been no notification, but you're quite right, I was lightly buzzed and I wanted to tease people, so I thought to delete the chapter outright and upload this draft as a new chapter, but it wouldn't let me because every story has to have at least one chapter, so I uploaded the new(er) draft as a new chapter and then deleted the first chapter.

The draft currently at ff.net is about 85% polished (I never completed that draft). The draft that used to be there was about 60% polished. The draft currently on my computer is probably 97% polished (and it's the draft I started on after I abandoned the one currently on ff.net, and I've decided that it's the final draft). I have a 75% polished draft of Chapter 2, I have a 60% polished draft of Chapter 3, and I have a vomit draft of Chapter 4. Chapter 5 is probably 95% finished (the title of that chapter is Omake Files 1, 2, and 3: Alternate Trajectories), I have vomit drafts of Chapters 6 and 7, I have an outline of Chapter 8, and Chapters 9 and 10 are at about 85% polished.

Make of all that what you will.
