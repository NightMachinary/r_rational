That's why I asked if there were any limitations on what you could copy. In any case, I don't think it's too hard to convince myself that air is an object. Object = thing = anything. If it's a noun, it's an object. "The air in this room" is an object. "The air within 10cm of me" is an object. "The universe, including all of its gases and vacuums" is an object. Though I wouldn't be able to make a copy of the last one since there's no anchor with enough mass to use for the universe other than the universe itself, which would be in the same position as the universe itself and contain plenty of solids, preventing me from manifesting a copy of the universe in the same space as itself. So if there are no limitations, I could really copy anything.
