  Almost no limitations. You can get extremely specific with memorization (for example, memorize only copper from bronze) but this procedure is much more exhausting and requires long rest.

Hmmm...

Other really horrible potential abuses:

1) Gas compression:

You can't manifest copies in solids, but you can in gases, so... get a sealed container of air, copy the air in the container, anchor it to the container (or something nearby), mass manifest. Now the inside of the container becomes super pressurized, allowing you to do all kinds of horrible things. For example, you could also add a bunch of small metal thumbtacks to the container before pressurizing it. Then you can pressurize it to the limit, and use the container as a frag grenade.

2) World destruction: Memorize the atmosphere (it's an object you are most certainly touching), use the Earth as the anchor (go outdoors, now it's an object you are touching). Then manifest. Since the atmosphere is a gas, you can manifest another copy of the atmosphere in itself. That takes a massive amount of heat and mass, but luckily, the Earth is surrounded by outer space, which has barely any heat or mass, so the heat and mass won't come from your own body. The amount of gas in the atmosphere doubles, while the Earth's solid mass decreases by the same amount. Whatever happens next can't possibly be good for anyone on the planet.

On the other hand, there are some good uses:

1) Improved rockets:

Currently, one of the worst problems with rockets is that rockets need fuel to push themselves out of the Earth, so they have to carry that fuel, which in turn means they need more fuel to push themselves more, which in turn means they need to carry more fuel, which in turn... ad infinitum. So currently what happens is that rockets carry huge containers of fuel up with them. With your ability, this problem is somewhat mitigated: you still need to carry a lot of mass up, since your ability needs to drain mass from an anchor to produce fuel, but you no longer need the huge containers. Just carry up some kind of really dense material and you can use that as an anchor to produce large amounts of fuel. (Don't make any oxygen though, since we don't want to kill everyone on Earth when the copies dissolve.)

It also makes the rockets much much safer, since the fuel containers you replace are actually extremely dangerous: a small leak in the fuel tank can and has caused entire rockets to explode.

2) Constant sea levels:

Climate Change is melting the ice caps, which will cause sea levels to rise and submerge many cities. With your ability, you can use an ocean as an anchor, and manifest copies of large objects, draining the mass of the oceans to keep the sea levels constant. You may want to check with a bunch of scientists to make sure that this is safe though.

3) Exoplanet colonization:

If you live long enough, you may be vital to the colonization of exoplanets. Making habitable zones on other planets presents many challenges, but most of them we can currently fix. Food, water, air can be brought over from Earth. Temperature can be controlled, using vacuums to insulate colonies from the outside. With technology not too far in the future, it wouldn't be surprising if much of a planet's surface can even be terraformed. But gravity? Gravity is going to be hard. In order to reduce gravity on super large planets, you need to reduce mass. The only semi-realistic way to achieve that is to carry tons of material out of a planet's gravity well and off into space. Which is of course, insanely expensive and inefficient, and it would probably be easier to just find another planet.

With your ability though, you can just make that mass disappear. Use the planet as an anchor, and spam manifest copies of large objects. The mass of the planet will be converted into the copies, then converted into harmless gas, and finally flow into another dimension, effectively reducing the mass of the planet and reducing it's gravity.
