Amazing ideas, although Earth destruction doesn't seem to be feasible. You have 200 meter limitation, thus you can only memorize a small part of the atmosphere.

You will still be able to slowly increase atmospheric pressure, but it will be fairly slow process, so concerned terrestrials might be able to stop you.
