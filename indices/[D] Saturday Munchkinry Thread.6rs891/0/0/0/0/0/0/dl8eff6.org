  You have 200 meter limitation, thus you can only memorize a small part of the atmosphere.

Oh, I misunderstood. I thought the objects just had to be within 200 meters of you, as in, if any part of the object was near you, you could copy the whole thing. If the entire object (or the entire part of the object that you are copying) has to be within 200 meters of you, then yeah, that wouldn't work. At 10 copies per second, and only about a 200 meter radius sphere of matter per manifestation, you wouldn't be converting mass fast enough for planet-scale changes unless you found something *really* dense, both for the anchor and for the copy to manifest.
