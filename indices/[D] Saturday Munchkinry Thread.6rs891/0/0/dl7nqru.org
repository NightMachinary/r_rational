Are there any limitations on what kinds of "objects" you can copy? For instance, can you copy humans? Or yourself for that matter? Can copies of yourself then also produce more object copies? Can object copies also be anchors, and thus allow you to mass produce copies of yourself at an exponential rate by having copies make copies of other copies that are anchored to other copies?

Does the anchor have to be willing? Can you anchor an unwilling subject and thus rob it of mass/heat?

  Will you be able to escape from heavily guarded prison if nobody knows about your ability? If everyone knows about it?

Well first, walls and bars will mean nothing. Use them as anchors and produce copies of anything to rob the anchors of mass until they disappear.

Depending on how fast you can use your ability, bullets may also be useless: You can dynamically create and destroy walls around yourself, blocking any bullets fired at you.

Suffocation, Dehydration, and Starvation will also mean nothing, since you can produce copies of oxygen, water, and food, from your own lungs/blood/flesh if you have to. Though I wonder what happens if the memory of oxygen dissolves while still in your body. Huh. Sounds dangerous. Change of plans, copy oxygen to mass murder any prison guards when the oxygen copies dissolve.

If everyone knows about my ability, escape becomes impossible: they would simply put me in permanent cryogenic sleep, rendering me unconscious and unable to use my ability.
