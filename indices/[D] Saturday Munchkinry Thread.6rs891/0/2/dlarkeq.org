I have 3 objects called A B and C. I make a memory of C anchored to B, then make a memory of B anchored to A. If I manifest the memory of B, does the manifested copy have a memory of C? (not sure if there's an exploit there...)

When manifested memories expire, where does the mass/energy go? Back into the anchor? What if the energy has been transferred to/from another object in the meantime? What if the manifested object is more than 200 meters away? What if the manifested object has acted as an anchor itself for a new memory and spent it's heat on that?

Manifested memories displace can't appear inside people or solid objects, but if liquids or gas are okay, do they displace the fluid on appearance? What if the memory is itself less dense than the fluid (say, a helium balloon underwater or a vacuum thermos)?

Manifested objects' kinetic energy (including heat presumably) is taken from the anchor, but not potential chemical energy. Anchor is a spent battery, memory is a full one, when manifested it takes all the mass from the anchor and turns it into the memory.

What happens when a manifested memory is dramatically colder than the anchor but slightly smaller in mass? Say, a 100.1 g anchor heated to 1000 degrees Kelvin manifesting a 100g memory at room temperature. Does the excess heat in the anchor go into the tiny .1g of matter remaining? What if the masses are reversed and there is no remaining mass for the energy to go into?

Pretty sure the rules don't allow directly storing the memory of an object inside itself, but you can get around that with an additional object. Call them A and B. B anchors the memory of A, then manifests it as A/. A anchors A/. Presto, an object stored inside itself.
