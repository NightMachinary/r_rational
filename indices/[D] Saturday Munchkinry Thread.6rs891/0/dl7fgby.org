You possess the ability to capture an object copy (a /Memory/) and attach it to /Anchor/. Anchor can later be activated to manifest a stored Memory at the same position relative to Anchor, with the same relative speed.

- Objects can be "memorized" from ~200 m distance.
- You can "memorize" bullets (and other rapidly moving objects), if you roughly now where the original bullet will fly.
- Memory will dissolve and evaporate few hours after its creation.
- You have to be near Anchor to use it (in ~1 m radius). Memory can be manifested as long as Anchor is mostly intact.
- Memory can't be manifested inside living beings and solid bodies.
- Mass is uniformly lost from an Anchor to restore a Memory.
- If Memory has kinetic energy, it is taken from Anchor's heat energy.
- If there is not enough mass in Anchor or if Anchor temperature is lower than temperature of the surroundings, your body mass and heat are taken (this can harm internal organs and induce hypothermia).

How would you munchkin this ability?

Will you be able to escape from heavily guarded prison if nobody knows about your ability? If everyone knows about it?
