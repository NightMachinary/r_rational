Use memory on a block of frozen oxygen. Vaporize it. A few hours later everyone drops dead in a medically incomprehensible way as 79% of the oxygen atoms that they breathed in turn into Anchor atoms (or just disappear with the Anchor regaining mass, depending on how this works).

You can also burn the Memory and a few hours later it vanishes and you have a cloud of free oxygen atoms (lots of applications for this, not necessarily bombs).

Also, abuse the "taken from Anchor's heat energy" part for free cryogenics.
