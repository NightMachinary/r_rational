#+begin_quote
  Do I need to be within a metre of the anchor to memorize, manifest or both?
#+end_quote

Both.

#+begin_quote
  Will an hour undo the memorization, manifestation or both?
#+end_quote

Only manifestation.

#+begin_quote
  Will manifestations of myself have a copy of this power?
#+end_quote

This is really cool idea. Let's say that living manifestations almost immediately die from one of a hundred different causes. If you can prepare the necessary equipment (and get lucky with death cause), you can keep your manifestation alive for an hour and they will be able to use this power.

Manifestations has your memories at the moment of memorization to anchor. Their manifestations dissolve after an hour, no additional limits imposed.

  How quickly can I transform matter?
#+end_quote

You mean restore memories? Extremely quickly, about 10 times per second. Just be careful not to kill yourself accidentally.
