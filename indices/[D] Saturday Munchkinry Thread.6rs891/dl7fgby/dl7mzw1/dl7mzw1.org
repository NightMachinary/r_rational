#+begin_quote
  Objects can be "memorized" from ~200 m distance.
#+end_quote

Scrying? Can you get a memory of "whatever's on the desk next door"?

#+begin_quote
  Memory will dissolve and evaporate few hours after its creation.
#+end_quote

Temporary matter would be /amazing/ for working with toxic chemicals. Does it disappear into gas/liquid, into nothing, or back into the anchor?

#+begin_quote
  Mass is uniformly lost from an Anchor to restore a Memory.
#+end_quote

Mass only, or matter in general? Making objects massless would be quite useful in a lot of situations.

#+begin_quote
  If Memory has kinetic energy, it is taken from Anchor's heat energy.
#+end_quote

Free supercooling?

So, you maybe have scrying, matter creation and banishment, massless objects, and cold powers. All five of those powers have side effects and limitations. What do you do now?
