Thanks, scrying and toxic chemicals would work perfectly.

  Does it disappear into gas/liquid, into nothing, or back into the anchor?
#+end_quote

Memory disappears into harmless gas that slowly drifts into another dimension. You can contact this dimension and travel there but it is very costly process (and it is mostly a lifeless desert that slowly kills you).

#+begin_quote
  Mass only, or matter in general?
#+end_quote

I made a mistake in the description. It's better to say 'matter is lost from anchor in such a way that loss of its mass is equal to mass of a restored memory'.

#+begin_quote
  Free supercooling?
#+end_quote

Great idea. However the anchor surroundings should also be supercooled, otherwise you will quickly lose body heat and most likely die. But the setup with multiple anchors in an airproof box seems feasible.

  What do you do now?
#+end_quote

Prepare huge amount of anchors with explosives and toxic chemicals. Probably make some of my teeth into anchors.

And then, mentally switch sides and panic that armed group of 10 individuals with this powers is coming to town.
