  Are there any limitations on what kinds of "objects" you can copy?
#+end_quote

Almost no limitations. You can get extremely specific with memorization (for example, memorize only copper from bronze) but this procedure is much more exhausting and requires long rest.

  For instance, can you copy humans? Or yourself for that matter?

(This idea is so cool I just can't refuse it. Below is a more detailed answer I copied from my response to [[/u/Gurkenglas]])

Let's say that living manifestations almost immediately die from one of a hundred different causes. If you can prepare the necessary equipment (and get lucky with death cause), you can keep your manifestation alive for an hour and they will be able to use this power.

In this case, you can go exponential but the process will become increasingly expensive.

  Copy oxygen to mass murder any prison guards when the oxygen copies dissolve.

This is awesome. You don't even need toxic chemicals to kill people.

  If everyone knows about my ability, escape becomes impossible: they would simply put me in permanent cryogenic sleep, rendering me unconscious and unable to use my ability.

Well, someone might be tempted to wake you up for interrogation. Just for a few minutes, surely nothing dangerous will happen...
