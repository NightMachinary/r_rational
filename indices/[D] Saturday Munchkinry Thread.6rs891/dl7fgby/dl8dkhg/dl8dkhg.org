I use a spinning flywheel (3600 RPM) as an anchor for the memory of a ball bearing (200 m away, perpendicular to the axis of rotation).

I stop the motor, superheat the flywheel, reattach it to the motor backwards, and manifest the ball bearing. It starts off rotating around the flywheel at 3600 RPM at a distance of 200 m, giving an initial speed of 75 km/s relative to the flywheel. Since I flipped the flywheel around and spun it the opposite direction it gets speeds of 150 km/s relative to the earth.

0.5 * 0.001 kg * 150 000 m/s * 150 000 m/s = 1.1e7 J (Kinetic energy of a 1/4" diameter steel ball bearing, weighing 1 gram)

500 J/kg K * 25 kg * 900 K = 1.1e7 J (Thermal energy lost by a 25 kg mass of carbon steel cooled by 900 degrees)

EDIT: This is approximately 10 pounds of TNT-equivalent energy.

The only problem is that you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with it.
