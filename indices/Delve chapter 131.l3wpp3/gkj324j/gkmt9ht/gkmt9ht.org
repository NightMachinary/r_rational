If you want actual patreon spoilers:

The crew has decided that Tallheart, Ameliah, and Rain will delve with the goal of raising Rain's cap. That has not yet happened, but if patterns hold I suspect we'll get the first chapter of actual delving next week. I'm guessing it'll be at least a month of real-world time before Rain actually levels up again.
