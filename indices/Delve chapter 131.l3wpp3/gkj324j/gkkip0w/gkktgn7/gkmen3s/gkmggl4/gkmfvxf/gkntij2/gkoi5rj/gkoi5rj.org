There also is literally nothing rational about this story, yet here it is, posted in the rational subreddit every week. I can see the tie in, when the story talks about rain and company min/maxing the system, but the VAST majority of the last 70 chapters had been flat, boring, one dimensional character interaction with cringey real world memes, and the author is frankly terrible at character writing.

The system is so interesting and the author steadfastly refuses to write about it.
