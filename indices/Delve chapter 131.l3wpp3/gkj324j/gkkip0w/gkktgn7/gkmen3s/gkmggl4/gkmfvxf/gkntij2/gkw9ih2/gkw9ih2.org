I dunno. I didn't mind when the story went slowly, but at this point it's just getting boring. It's not even that there's no progression. There's just nothing interesting happening with the plot or characters or anything, really. There's easily 4 filler chapters in a row of random meetings, and jumps to other character viewpoints and whatnot. I don't give a shit about the other characters, and it's not interesting seeing Rain mismanage meetings. The story itself just isn't going anywhere in particular at this point. It has nothing to do with a lack of numbers going up, at least for me.
