No. You saying 90% of the problem being update speed is personal preference. I'm saying that this story has multiple full chapters, as well as large chunks within chapters, that do not contribute anything to the story.

Slice of life chapters can be great. They can expand the world building, give insight into character development, foreshadow plot points, anything.

This chapter, for example, does nothing. The characters are flat, their interactions full of actual real world cringey memes. Nothing is expanded on or developed. Except what i mentioned earlier about the Dozer thing moving forward a micrometer, possibly.

With good character writing, these types of chapters can be sprinkled into a story to great effect. With bad character writing they are worse than useless. They are a chore to get through.

It seems like you consider your reading speed fast, so your argument sounds like you don't mind useless chapters because you don't spend a bunch of time on it. That's the definition of subjective criticism.
