Pretty slow chapter with the usual padding, but it was more enjoyable than usual and there were some interesting new bits of info.

The situation with Dozer is really interesting. Despite being a monster that is assumed to be stupid or even lacking sentience, he is rapidly getting smarter and smarter. He can even sort of mind-talk with Rain through their connection, and is able to understand, carry out, and even verbalize orders. Very interesting. He's even targetable by monsters when Crystal Slimes normally aren't. The author is definitely setting something up big with Dozer, spending dozens of chapters on him and the mysteriousness of it all, just like with the soul-fuckery. I just wonder what's going to happen with it all. It would be disappointing if we get 50+ chapters of set up for these two elements just for them to be rather inconsequential. Either way, I do consider Dozer one of the more interesting and amusing parts of the story.

Brovose is surprisingly a good person despite his teammates. Hegar is a paranoid, violent, and selfish man, about to go off on Lana and the militia and laborers from just suspicions. Anton is a sociopath that loves killing and is clearly unhinged. Brovose seems to always be trying to defuse the two and protecting others from them, and he doesn't even get aggressive or tell Hegar when he notices Val spying. I wonder what's the deal with him, he definitely has a reason for hanging out with such people despite not being like them. Too bad he's probably going to die with them in their inevitable conflict and death against Ascension.

Do any Patreon readers know if the story is going to shift to actual Delving and uncapping, grinding, and leveling up in the Crack after they inevitably defeat the Crimson Gar? I'd love to get some more of that back.
