I disagree. This story could use 50-60% word count reduction, and become much better for it. For example, this entire chapter was flat, bland, and useless. If the character writing wasn't so bad, these chapters wouldn't be such a chore. If you can skip an entire massive chapter of a story and not even notice the difference, that chapter should not exist.
