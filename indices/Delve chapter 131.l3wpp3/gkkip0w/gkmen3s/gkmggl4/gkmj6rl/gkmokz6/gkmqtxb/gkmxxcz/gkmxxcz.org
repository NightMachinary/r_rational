Practical guide to evil.

Tightly written, amazing character writing,

And I absolutely agree that the character writing in delve is cringe and always has been, from the start. But the thing is, in the early chapters there was more than just cringe character interaction, and the system in the story is interesting, well thought out, and fun to read about. When the only thing going in in the story is 40+ chapters of cringe character interaction, it's just bad story writing.
