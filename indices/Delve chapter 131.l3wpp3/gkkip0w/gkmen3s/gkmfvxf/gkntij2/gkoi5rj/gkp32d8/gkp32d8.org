I agree 100% with what you said. The problem is not so much with how it was written because is litRPG and this genre sucks, but the refusal of the author to not improve in what it is objectively the weak point of his story. In APGtE anyone can see how the author improves his (already decent) writing abilities and it took 3 books to reach his peak. Dont know how much word count delve has but the improvement is almost 0.
