What? This chapter:

- Furthers the Hegar/Lena conflict plotline by establishing that Rain's promise of protection to Lena is public knowledge among Ascension; that Ascension's plans for the Crack have been recognized by the Hegar's men; and that Hegar himself is aware of Rain's class, level and approximate capabilities. All of this sets the stage for the eventual confrontation between the two, both in terms of Rain not being able to back down (or appear to) without losing the trust of his followers and in terms of Hegar plausibly having a plan for taking down Rain in particular.

- Also establishes that the Rain/Ameliah relationship has become common knowledge among Ascension, laying the ground for future possibilities for Rain having to grapple with differing cultural expectations regarding of favoritism by leaders and relationship power disparities. Rain might have to deal with assumptions that he'd obviously manipulate the ledger system in his girl's favour, or get accused of hiding behind her power rather than being powerful in his own right, as local expectations of leadership expect he ought to be.

- Advances the Dozer plotline, like you said. But in the same scene, it also shows that even Ameliah (who is experienced with the ins and outs of a wide variety of skills) finds Rain's precise control and the interactions between Dozer and other monsters weird. Which reinforces a prior theme of the story, where rampant coordination problems have placed some pretty severe blinders on what even the more open-minded people in the setting think can be possible. Also shows us that this sort of system-manipulation isn't unique to Rain, as Jamus is also shown having disabled an automatic system message, calling back to a prior conversation between the two in which Rain gives Jamus the idea that this sort of thing is possible.

- Speaking of Jamus, it shows us what a normal Ascension patrol looks like, how said patrols normally interact with the militia, and how Jamus in particular is doing with regards to his family issues. I'm confident that all of these are going to come up again somewhere down the line, if only to show why the militia members (who clearly have mixed feelings about Ascension) might not be willing to involve themselves in a confrontation between Hegar and Rain, or why they might be willing to believe (like Val and Jamus believe of the Bank) that Ascension moving in on the Crack might represent them 'cutting and running' like the Mayor would be incentivized to spread rumours about after their conflict in the last chapter.

Yeah, it's all fuzzy and implicit. And yeah, in a serial like a Practical Guide to Evil, all of these plotlines would have been pared down to some gossip that Rain overhears rather than fully played out for the reader. But that's a stylistic choice and I honestly prefer this way of writing things - it's one of the reasons I check this out every Saturday but couldn't get into PGtE personally. Different strokes for different folks.
