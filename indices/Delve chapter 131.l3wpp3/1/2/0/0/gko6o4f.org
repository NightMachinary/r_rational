yeah I haven't even read the chapter yet and, except for the monster taming stuff, none of this is anything I didn't already know.

I get that "show don't tell" is something every author tries to do, but Delve just suffers way too much from the author trying to show every single goddamn thing. There's zero trust that the audience will pick up on subtext /at all/, so everything is just text. A hell of a lot of text.
