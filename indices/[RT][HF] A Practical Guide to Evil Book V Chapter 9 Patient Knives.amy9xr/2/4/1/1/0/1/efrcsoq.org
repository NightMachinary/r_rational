Cat is basically mortal without night, Hierarch's very presence interferes with the Goddesses empowering her, he has two unknown aspects, and is surrounded by 12 thousand soldiers and the population of a small city, all of which are basically being passively mind controlled by him, along with one of the most cagey named characters in the story, who has already helped cause the death of one of the calamities and thwarted Black. Yes, let's have the wicked foreign oligarch approach alone under a banner of truce and try to stab him. I'm sure that'll work well, on both a narrative and practical level.
