??? Cat got her ass kicked by Sve Nok or however you spell it and only survived by /not fighting/. She never once beat the Gray Pilgrim or Saint of Swords in a fight, only by outmaneuvering them politically and with her army.

Also: "make up a new power to make the plot more interesting"

Are you referring to Night? The stuff that we talked about during half of the last book? Or Hierarch? The guy who's been foreshadowed and talked about for the last /two/?
