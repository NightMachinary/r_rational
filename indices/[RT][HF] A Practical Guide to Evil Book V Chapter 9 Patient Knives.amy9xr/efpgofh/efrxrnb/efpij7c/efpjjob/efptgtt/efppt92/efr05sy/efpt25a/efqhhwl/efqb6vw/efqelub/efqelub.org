"Hmm... we're here months after a lot of shit went down, with an army, trying to gather forces to fight against the Dead King so that we can get the drow to live on his land. We have almost zero contemporary information, no ideas on the full capabilities of /any/ side in this war, and no idea what Hierarch or Tyrant want, so lets go talk to them.

Oh and we only have a hunch that this crowd control thingey is one of his aspects, we will have to consult with Akua to confirm that. We also don't have any idea about his other two aspects, nor what exactly the Tyrant has for aspects, nor how he knew all the things he did.

LET'S JUST KILL THE HIERARCH LMAO"
