  I like the Hierarch, I'm glad he's alive and relevant, but for the life of me I do not understand the mechanics of Cat's inability to knife the homeless man. Mind voodoo powers do not provide defensive bonuses!!

Inability? No, she is very well aware that she could kill him right then. If you deign to read the passage, however, you'll notice she thinks 'it won't end well for me'.

It'd be the exact opposite of rational for Cat to stab the Hierarch while surrounded by thousands of people in the throes of 'enact trials for crimes committed'-flavored madness. This isn't counting the enemy soldiers watching the proceedings, any one of which could punch a hole in Cat's freshly-mortal frame.
