#+begin_quote
  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Check.

#+begin_quote
  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

Mostly. If hidden, it's only to add a setup for a later reveal. Unspoken plan guarantee and all.

#+begin_quote
  Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
#+end_quote

Hard to say what constitutes an "intelligent" solution, but most of the book endings have taken characters in situations to their logical conclusion, which is pretty rational.

#+begin_quote
  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

This applies more to /rationalist/ fiction which, yeah this story is not (though we do spend a majority of the story in Catherine's headspace).

#+begin_quote
  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
#+end_quote

Check.

Why do you think the story is irrational? How do you think it was rational before and not anymore?
