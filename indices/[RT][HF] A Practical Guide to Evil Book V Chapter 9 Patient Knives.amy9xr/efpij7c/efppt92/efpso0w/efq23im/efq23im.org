  ignoring evidence/facts is.

What evidence/facts do you think are being ignored? Genuinely curious here. I feel like the characters are making plans that are logical based on the information they know. Catherine's working with stale info, but that doesn't mean her planning isn't rational. She doesn't know Warlock is dead or Masego is missing. But her building a well at the end seems like it'll be used to scry, which will likely let her find these things out.
