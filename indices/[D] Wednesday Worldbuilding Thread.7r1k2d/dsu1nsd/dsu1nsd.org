[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade][The Masquerade]] is trope that I've always found interesting and sought to rationalize despite how increasingly implausible the Information Age has made it, but now that fake news, conspiracy theories, and anti-intellectualism have become social problems I can't ignore I've been thinking it's time to retire the trope altogether from fiction that isn't horror or social commentary.

However, I did manage to find an interesting take on it while listening to /The Orpheus Protocol/ RPG Podcast. The game takes place in a world of Lovecraftian horror, where the explanation for why no one knows about the Mythos is because some psychics ascended into the collective consciousness and are erasing knowledge of the supernatural to protect humanity from memetic hazards. That doesn't stop evil cults from forming to summon alien monsters, but it keeps them a secret.

The only other example I've seen of something like this is the information-consuming Voidfish from the more lighthearted /The Adventure Zone/, which also just happens to be an RPG Actual Play podcast, that created a global mental block to keep people from fighting over the Macguffins. I think this is an idea that has untapped potential and want to hear about other interesting things can be done with it, without making me feel uncomfortable in ways the story doesn't intend.
