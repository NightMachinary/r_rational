That Enlightenment spell sounds really evil then. Not necessarily for destroying magic or whatever, but for basically committing magical genocide. All these nonhuman races are basically brainwashed into forgetting their culture and transformed into humans. If I were a magical creature I would be totally pissed.

It would be a great idea for the protagonist to be one of those magical creatures (perhaps a troll to be original) who recently regained his nonhuman heritage. Then the story could follow him trying to tear down the masquerade and destroy the Enlightenment spell to bring back his people.
