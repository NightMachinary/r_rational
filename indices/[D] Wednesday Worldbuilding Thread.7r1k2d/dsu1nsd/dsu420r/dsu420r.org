Personally, I'm still looking for works about the time directly after the masquerade finally shatters. Where the world is uneasily coming to terms with the mystical and bizzare, when magic can finally be put under the microscope, when everyday life is rapidly, irrevocably changed.

I wrote Horizon Breach (see: my flair) as a partial exploration of that concept (Earth learns about Log Horizon magic) but as a novice author, I made sure the "shock" of the event was intentionally blunted, both by my own conceits (very few magical people on the planet at one time, confined to a specific geographic region, with clear-cut goals), and the established setting (the "magic society", so to speak, already knew all about the non-magical society, so only one had to adjust).

I'm also reading [[https://shouldthesun.wordpress.com/2017/09/03/prologue/][Should the Sun not Rise]] which, aside from being good on its own merits, has a magic society that is imminently expecting the masquerade to break and therefore not stringently enforcing it as much as they used to, but still operate under it for now. It's fairly close to what I want, but still not quite on target.

If anyone has any rec's, please reply with them!
