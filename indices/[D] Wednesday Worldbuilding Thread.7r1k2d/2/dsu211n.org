Given at least a few people here seem to actually have a good understanding of quantum physics hopefully someone answers this question. Anyway the question is, in a universe with physics is the same except parity (and only parity) is flipped how would things be different?

The one thing I do know from research is that the weak force is the only force [[https://goo.gl/igJ89r][which breaks parity]] however the effect the weak force behaving slightly differently would have on the rest of the universe I can't begin to guess at.

Still even if the effect is small common sense would tell me you can't change /even one seemingly tiny thing in physics/ without it drastically altering phenomenon at the macroscopic level. After all even if the difference in the weak force due to different parity is tiny it's still going to be vastly greater an effect in size than say /gravity/.
