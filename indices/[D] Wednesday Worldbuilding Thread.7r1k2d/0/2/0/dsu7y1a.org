  Completely irrelevant thought: as a woman I don't use pockets, I use a handbag. Does the "whatever's usually in your pockets" concept extend to handbags?

Unfortunately no. I had banned backpacks in the previous thread, and the ban still holds. You wouldn't be too far behind-- wallet-phone-keys are all that most men carry anyways, and you do get a multitool, but it still is a disadvantage you'd need to take account of in your personal story. (If you want to cheat a little, though, "pockets" includes stuff like coat and sweater pockets.)
