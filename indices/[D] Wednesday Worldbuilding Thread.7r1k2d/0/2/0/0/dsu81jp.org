I don't even have wallet-phone-keys in my pockets so I'd get the multitool and that's it.

I feel oddly and unreasonably excluded by this; the fashion industry has declared women don't get pockets large enough to hold a phone (for real), and the nerd industry declares that pockets are the gold standard for portal fantasy equipment :(.
