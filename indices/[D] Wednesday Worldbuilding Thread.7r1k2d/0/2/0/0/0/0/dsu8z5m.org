Fitbit, extremely cheap earrings (but maybe they don't know the difference between cubic zirconia and diamonds?), and three rings. Two plain silver ones are probably not overly valuable but my "main" one has three small black diamonds and a dinosaur bone / onyx inlay. So those little diamonds might be helpful.

Remember that person who years ago posted that he'd become the king of Europe by bringing pasta to England? I'd probably end up doing that with a sewing pattern reverse engineered from my bra.
