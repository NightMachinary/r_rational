Completely irrelevant thought: as a woman I don't use pockets, I use a handbag. Does the "whatever's usually in your pockets" concept extend to handbags? Because I usually have all sorts of things in my handbags that people probably don't usually have in their pockets.

(... like, I have some modafinil in there. And it's not because I'm a cool rationalist who takes nootropics: it's because my partner has a prescription for it that he's always forgetting to fill so me having an "emergency stash" for him gives him some time to fill a prescription in the meantime)
