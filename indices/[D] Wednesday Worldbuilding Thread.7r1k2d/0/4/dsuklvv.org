I think that Mother of Learning's setting solves this fairly elegantly, although most fantasy worlds that are at least semi-rational seem to handle it as well.

I think it's sufficient to make a world with self-serving adventure with only 3 rules -

- Dungeons naturally generate or attract monsters (eg in MoL, mana wells both draw and evolve monsters with ambient magic).\\
- Dungeons/Monsters are a source for valuable resources (eg, mana crystals or monster parts)
- Dungeons are inhospitable enough to sapients that they cannot be tamed. (eg, the lowest levels constantly draw/spawn deadly enough monsters to push out homesteaders)

IIRC, many universes have this. Mother of Learning, Recettear, Danmachi, Made in Abyss, any of the MMO Isekais like Sword Art Online or Log Horizon, and lots more. It seems like any world with these sort of dungeons would end up creating permanent gold rush towns, except instead of mining things you're stabbing monsters. To link TV tropes, any world with a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBasedEconomy][dungeon based economy]] seems to roughly follow this pattern if it's at all rational.
