... For most fantasy worlds, the average first worlder gated in is going to very rapidly turn into a 12th century communist rabble rouser, because the entire social structure is anathema to everything you believe in. Yes, even if you are very conservative. That is a potent plot engine, and also very hard to survive doing.

Heck, one of my favorite plot-hooks is that your main character is not such a portal victim... but a native who finds the /writings/ of one, who had enough grasp of the risks involved to realize they were almost certainly going to die before they managed to overthrow feudalism. "The comprehensive manual of Syndicalism and the industrial mode of Production." or something similar.
