I recommend the [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/][Wandering Inn]], which does this really well. The main character, Erin, arrives in another world, with just the items she had on herself (no multitool). She barely manages to stumble into an abandoned building, and becomes an [Innkeeper]. That would be in brackets because it's a class; the story has a leveling system which also handled really well. As in, not only the main character has this but everybody in the world, and grinding doesn't really work since you mainly seem to level when you go beyond your normal limits somehow. You get levels based on what you are doing.

And there are monsters, which she fights to survive. Or invites into her inn, in the case of goblins. Her inn is close to a city populated by Gnoll (hyena-people), Drakes and Antinium (ant-people), so those make up most of her other customers. Well, that and a [Necromancer].

There is still plenty of adventure. Some of it she goes looking for (sometimes because she has to in order to find food), and some of it finds her and is really more of an attack than an adventure.

And she isn't the only one from our world who has been transported there. All over the world, people are appearing. Depending on where they are, some do follow more traditional tropes, but a lot go off the traditional rails for Isekai, such as becoming a [Runner], delivering items between cities on foot.

There is a lot more to this story, because it is very long, and I can't really talk about much of the really awesome things because spoilers. Anyway, to answer your question... make the world dangerous, and there will be adventure to find. Make it even more dangerous, and it will find people regardless of whether or not they are looking.
