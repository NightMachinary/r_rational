You need a few key factors for adventure:

- *Low population density:* When there aren't many people around, the odds that you're the right person for the job tend to go way up. Additionally, the odds of there being threats to people (wolves, bears, big cats, etc.) tend to increase when there's fewer people to deal with said threats.

- *Young civilization/new world:* An area of unexplored wilderness is an area of untapped resources. You might literally discover a gold mine in your travels if the area hasn't been previously explored.

- *Disaster aftermath:* Following some massive apocalypse (disease, climate, war, etc.), many places may be left abandoned, potentially with valuables left unclaimed.

- *Equality or low tech/magic level:* Technology and magic tend to accumulate in the hands of the wealthy, creating a caste of elites who solve the world's problems - for a price. With low tech/magic, the world's elites don't have much more to offer than anyone else. Alternatively, if the elites are kept relatively equal with everyone else (perhaps by law, or by culture), they still won't be able to offer more than an average person can.

A good historical example would be the American pioneers following the revolutionary war. The New World had relatively untapped resources and the combination of disease and war had wiped out large swaths of the population. The tech level was comparatively low, equality was comparatively high, and the frontier was virtually uninhabited. There was hardly a better time and place for adventuring.
