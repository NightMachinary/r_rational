  I don't even have wallet-phone-keys in my pockets so I'd get the multitool and that's it.

My point was that you're at a disadvantage, but hopefully not too much of one. (phones are a brick after eight hours, currency is valueless, probably the most useful thing is your ID.)

  and the nerd industry declares that pockets are the gold standard for portal fantasy equipment :(.

It's mainly just me in this case :P You'll find Isekai protagonists taking along all sorts of random shit. But my restriction basically comes down to what people have on their persons for the majority of the day. I carry my backpack around a lot, but only wear it for probably an hour total each day. Meanwhile, my pockets have my wallet-keys-phone combo from when I wake up to when I go to bed. You probably have your purse near you a very high proportion of the time, but don't literally wear for the majority of that time.

There's one potential bonus you have-- if you wear any jewelry consistently, it would probably fetch a fair price.
