First, killing monsters doesn't need to be dangerous on an absolute scale in order to be profitable. It only needs to be marginally more difficult or uncomfortable than baking bread for a living (for example) in order for it to be a profitable job.

As a real world comparison, remember back to the Iraq war when security consultants could pull >$1000 a day. Closer to home, oil field work in North Dakota averaged $100k a year with low education requirements, yet the median working Americans ($35k) didn't go drive those wages down. Monster killing is both unsafe and uncomfortable, so it would have high wages.

Second, killing monsters can be 'Isekai easy' while still being really /really/ dangerous comparatively.

In a story, a 20% yearly death rate would be dramatically low for active adventurers. In real life, a 20% casualty rate job would 1) result in 999/1000 workers dying during a 30 year career, 2) be multiple orders of magnitude more dangerous than the most dangerous jobs in America, and 3) be 5-10x more lethal than being an active soldier in Rome during wartime.

Seriously, there would have to be insane rates for adventurers. If skilled consultancies could pay $150-300k a year in Iraq, then adventurers could easily pull the gold equivalent to >$1,000,000 a year.
