The main problem isn't simply making an adventurous world, however. It's making an adventurous world that [protagonist] can have adventurers in, without giving them gimmes like most isekais. Because people are still going to need to work for their daily bread, and if killing monsters is easy, then it's not going to make a whole lot of "money." (gold dropped from corpses, being in such high supply, couldn't really be used as a useful currency.)
