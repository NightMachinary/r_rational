So a while back, I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4etflz/d_what_do_you_do_in_a_foreign_world/][this]] thread. tl;dr, it proposes a portal fantasy scenario where you have a few gimmes (you speak/read/write the language, you get a free multitool plus whatever's usually in your pockets, and existing debilitating injuries/sicknesses/syndromes are cured), but where you notably /don't/ get the gimme of immediately having something to do and people to do it with; there's no grand destiny, no mission from the king, no summoned-hero shenanigans, no coincidental run-in into loyal companions, no easy-entry adventurer's guild, no chance to save a mysterious woman from being assaulted, no farmer immediately willing to take in some random stranger, etcetera.

Basically, a sandbox Isekai set to <Homeless> difficulty.

But this is the worldbuilding thread, so I'm going to go in a slightly different direction. Namely, *How can a world be created such that, despite the previous constraints, people looking for adventure are still likely to find it?*

That is to say, how can a world be set up where the protagonist can achieve most of the trappings of Isekai (adventure, companions, abilities, waifus) through character action, rather than narrative fiat?

This is of course a very broad question, so if you want, you can think up a specific example of an Isekai setting having those qualities.

As an additional gimme (the previous thread was just /slightly/ too hard) the Isekai process also makes you pretty fit. Not like, bench press 500 pounds fit (unless you could already do that), but like, "run a seven minute mile" or "work all day in construction" fit.
