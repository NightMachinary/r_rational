I was thinking of a way to justify this for a story of mind. The basic premise is that humanity only has psychic abilities when they have a corresponding madness. Most forms of magic take the form of creatures like werewolves and vampires, infectious mimetic structures. The other primary way to gain powers is to be exposed to the use of psychic abilities for a while which causes damage to the soul. That is where hunters came from. They were people who survived being attacked. Anyway, a while back in history it was decided that these spread too easily so the veil of Lethe was created to slow it down. This is inside the human collective conscience and thus affects every human from childhood. The effect has multiple parts. This encourages monsters to avoid humans most protected by it and go after the humans least protected. This means those who are isolated from the rest of humanity. The corresponding madness is that any memory containing true supernatural events is thrown out as a corrupted file. This is not perfect but most people who encounter monsters will be unable to remember it and will accept the official explanation. The second option is that the person will remember and be brought into the secret. This is the state that children of monsters exist in even if they never become one themselves(This relies on them being raised around magic so doesn't always). This tends to happen with people becoming monsters but there is not a perfect overlap. Some people survive monster attacks and become hunters, and some people become monsters and don't remember so they become things like traditional werewolves. This can persist even after they find out about the truth, which splinters their mind. Thirdly they might retain the memory but suppress it becoming a antipsychic who suppresses magic in their area. It also introduces a slight effect which counts as a glitch in every video software on the planet crashing and deleting all footage. This was added when computers became a thing so while not technically inherent is based on some pretty fundamental code. The final effect of the veil of Lethe is that it cribs note from a previous secret keeping system which I based off the fidelius charm but with a different principle. Basically any systemic attempt to break the veil on a large scale( or any knowledge of the other secrets they keep) will call the guardians of Lethe. These are knowledge eaters. and will devour knowledge of the secret and how to breech it based on a variety of factors. A number of people a found with no memories after each attack. Some of them will leave soon after and it is said they went to fill the void by devouring the memories of others, becoming a Guardian. No one is quite sure what specifically calls them but no one wants to experiment. no one is sure how to stop them either as all notes on them are erased in the event of an attack. It was originally designed to prevent runaway infection scenarios and large scale group minds such as the tower of Babel. That was a mental virus that lived in the language centres of brain that persuaded the infected to build a tower to rope in construction workers. At least that's what the head of the hunters guild says happened through no one knows how they know details of events that happened thousands of years ago. The Church claims they're the angel of death sent down to protect humanity. They refuse to confirm or deny this question. In summary, the veil of Lethe reduces attacks on humans, directs attacks to people that no one cares about, reduces infections that result from those attacks by the sanitation of mental inputs to the point where the werewolf packs mostly grow by their own children and has a final unpredictable defensive measure in case someone tries to experiment with it. It however doesn't affect nonhumans such as dogs. So what do you think.
