Not rational at all, but /True Blood/ starts with the concept of synthetic blood being easily available, so vampires start "coming out of the coffin" and become known to and "accepted" in wider society.

That said... there's more supernatural creatures than just vampires and we eventually get to incestuous werepanthers, so I'm not about to say that it doesn't jump the shark quite spectacularly.
