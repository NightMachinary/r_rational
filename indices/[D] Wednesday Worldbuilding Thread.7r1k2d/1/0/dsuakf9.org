Some of the most thoughtful examples I've seen of supernatural masquerades actually come from semi-comedic urban fantasy novels, oddly enough. In [[https://smile.amazon.com/Monster-A-Novel/dp/B004W5KGXU/][Monster]] and [[https://smile.amazon.com/Chasing-the-Moon/dp/B0052HLPZU][Chasing the Moon]] by A. Lee Martinez, and in the [[https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0787845MC][Freelance Familiar series]] by Daniel Potter, magic in the modern world exists in the open and is incredibly common, but most people hallucinate natural explanations for supernatural experiences, and can't form long-term memories of anything that contradicts the hallucinations. So, for example, you might have a friend who's an elvish wizard, but think of them as just slightly odd and new-agey. And if the wizard accidentally summons a demon, you might run away or call the police, but remember it afterward as "that time a bear wondered into the neighborhood".

A couple of ideas I've had in this vein:

- Before the year 1666, nobody doubted the existence of the supernatural. Every town had a hedge witch and pixie grove, dwarves ruled most of Scandinavia, and the devastation of the 30 Years War was the product of a rapidly escalating magical arms race. When the hellish legions of the Black Death broke into our reality through a London portal in 1665, a cabal of wizards including Isaac Newton barely managed to hold them off. This event, however, convinced Newton that the only hope for humanity would be fundamentally alter the nature of reality- to make it predictable, systematic, and unresponsive to the whims of individuals.

  So, the Royal Society captured and dissipated the energy of a dark god to cast a spell over the entire solar system- a spell that rippled both forward and backward in time, which they called The Enlightenment. The world and it's history became far simpler; dwarves and elves became human, wizards became doctors and scholars, and the dragons fled to hidden dimensions. For three centuries, the suddenly predictable nature of reality has led to an incredible flourishing of technology. Recent experiments in quantum physics, however, have begun to find cracks in the spell, and threaten to shatter it entirely.

- Magic is an integral part of modern civilization. Computers and cellphones work through a combination of circuitry and tame spirits, vampire rights are a hot-button issue in every election, and the annual hippogriff migration draws huge crowds.

  However, there's a rare psychological condition that causes sufferers to be unable to consciously perceive or accept the paranormal. They may avoid running into the horse half of a centaur, but if you ask them to describe what they see, they'll always describe the centaur as a member of their own species.

  With the right luck charms, these unfortunate people can live full and independent lives, but until recently, there hasn't been a treatment. Now, however, a new drug has entered pan-human trials that may offer hope...
