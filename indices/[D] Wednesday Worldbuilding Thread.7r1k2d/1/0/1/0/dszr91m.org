Not exactly. The idea is that the spell fundamentally transformed reality to make it more amenable to science. So, for example, Newton didn't so much discover the laws of motion as take something that had been incredibly malleable and unreliable and make it universal, certain, and part of a greater system.

Magic can still exist in this setting, but only in places and for people out of reach of the spell. A wizard powerful enough to shield themselves from the spell might break the laws of physics in public, and ordinary people will be able to see it- but the laws of physics would push back, gradually altering both memories and physical objects to conform to the Royal Society's grand paradigm.

An elf living in a sacred grove might be terrified to ever visit civilization, since they'd risk not only becoming human, but remembering the grove as nothing more than a backwoods cult. And in some sense, that cult might really exist- an alternate universe, somehow brought into superposition by the spell. A universe that perhaps intrudes into the dreams of the elves, some of whom spend their days researching entanglement and wave functions in the desperate hope of destroying science.
