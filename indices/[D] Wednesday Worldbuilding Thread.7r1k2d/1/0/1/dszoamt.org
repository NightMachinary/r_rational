This setting is intriguing but I'm confused on how this enlightenment spell works. Is it some kind of perception filter that overlays the real magical reality with a matieralistic mundane one? What about the fantasy races who I'm assuming appear as human. Do they know they're nonhuman or has the perception filter also changed how they view themselves?

It sounds a bit like the Mist from Percy Jackson which is also a weird perception filter/layer of reality that obscures the real one.
