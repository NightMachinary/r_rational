I'd hardly consider being fully aware of the stakes him going to a super special inescapable hell that didn't even exist before, especially when there had never been any indication that new hells could even come into existence.

Even the game being over is stretching it, because the tooltip on the Helldiver mode specifically said it superseded the “Character Death Is Permanent” rule, which implies there is in fact some way to escape the hells and revive, at least for him.
