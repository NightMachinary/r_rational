I'm convinced the DM did not actually pull Juniper from the class, I think instead, the cutoff happened later (possibly MUCH later) and Joon's memory was simply rolled back to that innocuous instant because of how significant, spoilerific and possibly traumatic the rest of what truly happened after that class was. Or because it exposes important truths about the nature of Aerb and Earth. IMO some of that left-out bit was even part of the prior staging done with the DM.
