I'm sorry for the confusion, I'm very new at this (that's the most "literary" thing I've written in 20 years).

  Is the implication that June-Earth is one of the hells?

No, that was not my intention. The last four lines (after the break) are supposed to be stuff that Joon just remembers: the DM provides him the uncensored version of what he got in Chapter 79.

The intended meaning is that Joon is going to an hell that is worst than every previously-existing others, that there is no way out, and that he knowingly consented to all of this (even on an opt-in basis).
