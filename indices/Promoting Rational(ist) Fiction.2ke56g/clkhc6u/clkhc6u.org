[[https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/343-how-do-books-get-discovered-a-guide-for-publishers-and-authors-who-want][See this blog post.]] That's just for Goodreads, but I think a lot of what that data shows has wider application.

If you want people to read the stuff that gets posted to this sub, the biggest problem is that so much of it is fanfiction, and so much of what's /not/ fanfiction isn't traditionally published. If you go look at the recommendation graph from that blog post, a whole lot of discovery methods aren't available: these books aren't in libraries, aren't on Amazon, and aren't in bookstores.

So if you want people to read the stuff that's already been written, put up reviews on Goodreads, make recommendations on Reddit, and tell the people that you personally know to read what you want them to. If you want to go bigger, find a blog with a large readership and get them to make a recommendation.

But ... I don't think that's the way to do it if you want to increase readership of rational fiction. I think what you'd want to do is write something original, get it published, get at least some token legitimacy and the support of a publishing company, and go from there. Ideally, get that book to have a free ebook version so that people have instant, free access (one of the only benefits to most of the current rational stories - and not entirely unheard of for traditional publishers to do, if they have some coaxing).

Until that point, rational fiction is going to be fighting for legitimacy, and a decent chunk of the audience is cut out before you've even begun.
