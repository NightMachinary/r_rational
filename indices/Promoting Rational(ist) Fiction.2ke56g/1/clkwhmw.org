The scientific method is about doing experiments in a reliable and repeatable manner and then communing with fellow scientists to see if they get the same results.

The best way to do this with authors is to find good ones who are popular and who explain their method and promote them to other authors.

[[/u/mistborn]] is a famous example. Many here have heard of his laws of magic. A lot of aspiring authors have followed in his footsteps. One way you can promote it is by linking authors to the teachings of rational authors. You can help them be rational at the source.

Reviews are important as are sales, but what you really need is some sort of force multiplier. A good author needs a lot of reviews and sales and publicity to do well.

You need a strong fanbase. They can do all of the reviews and wiking and such together to take the strain off any one person.

They need lots of random converts.

To do this you need to promote the author in various venues. This requires good selling skills and diplomacy to make the book seem exciting at an appropriate social context dependant time.
