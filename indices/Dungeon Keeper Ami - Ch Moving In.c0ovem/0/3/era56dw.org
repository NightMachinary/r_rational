I don't think the quality of the writing changes significantly. If your original problem was with the writing, it probably won't go away.

If your problem was with the characters, it's a harder question to answer. As the plot progresses, new characters are introduced. I have found some of them more vivid than the original cast while some other new additions were interchangeable.

The plot mostly sticks to the same formula as Ami desperately tries to stay one step ahead of increasingly powerful enemies. However, it becomes more varied as more and more factions and powers are dragged in. Some battle scenes are elaborately choreographed as multiple factions and actors interact in multiple locations and at multiple levels.

The most recent 20%+ of the serial put more emphasis on the "adolescent embarrassment" angle, which I find somewhat distracting and repetitive.
