How is it similar? Kat is a street kid trying to survive when she meets up with a villain who is very personable but also genocidal. She goes in with her eyes open, fully aware of the atrocities she's committing at each step. She has chances to back down and doesn't take any of them. The outcomes may or may not be superior, but it would be a hard stretch to call her anything more than an antihero. Personally, she is a brawler who isn't comfortable with science, magic, or politics. This isn't my interpretation, she's said almost those exact words multiple times. She has tremendous force of personality and wins by overpowering her opponents. Through the large majority of the work, her minions are all humans and most of them are generally good people who are loyal to her.

Compare that to Ami. She's a teenager from a loving family who has been fighting as a hero against literal monsters. She's the smart one on the team -- science, analysis, and support, without the power to actually make a difference in combat. (Again, her words and not mine.) She becomes a Dungeon Keeper purely by accident, without making a deliberate choice or understanding the consequences. The mere fact that she is a Keeper means that she has a kill on sight order against her from all the Good kingdoms. She lacks the raw power to outfight her enemies, so she relies on science and trickery. Her closest advisers are humans and relatively good people, but her minions are literally monsters that enjoy torturing and killing humans. They are only loyal to her because of a desire for power and/or gold and would turn on her in a second if they discovered who she really is.

Personally, I enjoy DKA more than PGtE. Both are good stories, but PGtE becomes a depressing grind after a while. I wish that DKA would drop the "embarrassed teenager" bit and be a little less free with the fanservice in some places, but it's a fun story with a smart, inventive, and likable heroine.
