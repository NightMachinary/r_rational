I read 3 books of PGtE and the way you talk down the main character is pretty much spot on. The reason I kept reading in the past is I was hoping the every-dudette Foundling will soon grow up resembling Black or Malicia. Both are awesome characters, more worthy as the main.

I gotta ask around whether Cat had manifested her own awesomeness by book 5. Awesomeness according to [[/r/rational][r/rational]] frequenters taste of course: more wit than brawn, more hardwork than luck, more exploit than grind. I /kinda/ running out light-reading material.
