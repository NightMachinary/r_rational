These are the questions that people ask in-universe. Obviously, it's making /someone/ sin, because Thamiel's doing it. Either that or he's just devoted to doing as much evil as possible, which isn't out of the question. I can see a revalation like "oh, all that? We get about the same number of sinners regardless of circumstances, because Heaven adjusts for relative goodness and culpability. I just enjoy making people hate, hurt, and sin. It's nothing like a sex thing, but I'll suggest it is, and the possibility that maybe all the suffering of Hell is essentially me getting off on my sadism will give some small fraction of you nightmares filled with fear and disgust."
