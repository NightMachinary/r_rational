How is that a grand child? I could see the plan failing and sohu needing help form Sarah who doesn't want it to happen and for some reason Sarah helps anyway, then one of the comet spawn marry sarah(why?)(it says "they" not "him" so it can't be only one person enslaving a grand child). But that seems a bit far fetched. Ana is down playing her marriage and Sarah isn't trying to be a child.

The foresaddow is weak in a world where "OMEN" likes to show up before space accidents, this would be at least equal to that.
