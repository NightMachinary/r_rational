The lead poisoning one seems like a stretch to me. I haven't kept up with the rules for getting into Heaven/Hell (and I recall them being intentionally vague at one point). If someone roofies me and drags me into a scenario where I sin, does that count against me? How is that difference from poisoning me for 30 years in a way that changes my judgment?
