Exactly what it does is left undefined. It's some sort of attempt at a self-replicating world/humanity optimizer. But the author didn't spell out exactly what it does to leave it open ended.

Maybe Santa played it cautiously and just went with basic disease/malnutrition/aging protection, which should be safe. Maybe he gambled on cognitive upgrades or something a little riskier: there's a greater chance of unintended side effects, but the elves seem pretty on top of things now and he's only got one shot at this.

Really I think part of it is that now that the elves are wiser than the author, he's wise enough not to put words in their mouths. They'll help Santa figure out the right thing to do.
