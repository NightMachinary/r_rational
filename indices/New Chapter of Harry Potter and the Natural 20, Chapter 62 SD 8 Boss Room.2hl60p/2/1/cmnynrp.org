I think to go head-to-head with Milo, Bellatrix is also a Munchkin. Therefore she, like Milo, has a tendency to adhere to the "text" of the rules of the HP universe rather than the "intent". Bellatrix, alone among HP wizards and witches, tries to push HP magic to the extent of what a "DM" would allow as legal. That includes duplicating wands.

Note that Lucius did not do this with magic; he paid a fortune to have spare wands made for him. This shows that Bellatrix is a Munchkin and Lucius is not.
