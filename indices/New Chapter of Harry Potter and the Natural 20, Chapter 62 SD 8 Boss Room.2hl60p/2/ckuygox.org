How is it that Bellatrix has multiple wands? I thought Ollivander basically never made duplicates?

She mentioned something about a Geminio charm, which probably duplicates your wand, but that seems like a total authorial cheat -- Milo found an overpowered way to beat an HP wizard, so Sir Poley had to come up with something that defeated that specific tactic. In HP canon, no one ever targeted their opponent's wand, so why does this charm exist?

Actually, I guess Expelliarmus counts as targeting your opponent's wand, but there's still no point in having multiple wands. Given the spells at their disposal, HP wizards are glass cannons -- whoever lands the first hit wins, so the duel consists of not getting hit. i.e., if someone can hit you with a Expelliarmus, they can also hit you with an Avada Kedavra / Cutting Charm / Blasting Charm / whatever, all of which kill you.

If you can duplicate wands for basically nothing, why not go into business for yourself selling wands at ridiculously low prices? Ollivander's would be superior, but poor people would happily pay a few Knuts for a wand that worked "ok" as opposed to "great". You could make it up on volume, since your only cost would be rent on the storefront, and that could be just a lemonade stand in the market place.
