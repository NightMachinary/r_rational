The Geminio charm is from the original Harry Potter universe, and allows you to either duplicate an object arbitrarily or cause an object to duplicate on touch. Duplicates made in this way rust, tarnish or otherwise disintegrate much more rapidly than the original. +This means that buyers of Geminio'd wands would have to buy many of them over the course of their lifetime as opposed to a single Ollivander wand, and each Geminio'd wand they buy will perform worse and worse over its duration.+

As for why Bellatrix had cast it--well, she's smart, and the majority of her power comes from a single object. Even in her own universe, Protego shields come in multiple variations (Protego Horribilis, for example, only deflects magic classified as Dark) so it's concievable that an Expelliarmus could succeed where another spell would fail.
