After looking into it a little more, Geminio falls under Conjuration, and even fairly simple Conjured objects tend to last only a couple hours. As the complexity of the object increases, the duration decreases correspondingly. For magical or living objects, I suspect the duration would be in the neighborhood of 15 minutes (although there seems to be no strict documentation as such). Either way, that rules out the Lemonade Wand Stand entirely, as a wand conjured this way wouldn't last out the day. Similarly, leaving your main wand at home is not useful for more than a brief outing along the lines of apparate in, kill target, apparate out again. More likely, I expect that Bellatrix was using wordless wandless magic to duplicate her wand during the conversation with Milo, then used only the copies while keeping the main wand hidden or invisible.
