Limited options for reviving him. Also as per the Spell True Resurrection you don't generate with your stuff. All his items are currently sitting with his body over on the HP side of the multiverse. Baccob is True Neutral so he would be well within His right to only just revive Milo and not give him his equipment. He did however give him the equipment of another wizard.
