I always thought that Link tended to make smart decisions, at least in the original game -- I've never played this twilight princess version. He made decisions based on all the knowledge available to him at any particular time. It's not like the NPC's were wordy, after all. Most of them barely had more than a handful of words to say to Link, period, and of course you couldn't try to engage them in a conversation or anything. I started writing some fanfiction about someone from our modern world thrust into the game as "Link". Since the original game allowed you to choose your own name, after I started writing with a character named Link, I changed it to Bart because that's the name I usually put in when I was asked to choose a name. This may make for some errors on the first page, for instance the word "blinked" changed to "bBarted". Here it is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10130275/1/The-Legend-of-Bart]]
