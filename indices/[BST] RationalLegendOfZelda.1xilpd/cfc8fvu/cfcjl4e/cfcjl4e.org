Zelda would be more active, but this can't be a story about plotting. There's simply too much high magic thrown around in the series for me to focus on it without building an actual system for it to work in, which would destroy continuity.

And this is where rantional fanfiction hits its wall; I will never have complete knowledge of the intricacies of the LoZ universe. How do I work around that?
