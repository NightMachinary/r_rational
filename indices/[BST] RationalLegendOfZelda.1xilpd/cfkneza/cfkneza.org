I started writing this type of a Zelda story, based on the very first Legend of Zelda. Where's a good place to post it? I tried fanfiction.net but even though it's been a long time since I registered there, I don't seem to have a left-hand navigation bar that's apparently required to be able to post anything there. Any other quick and easy suggestions?
