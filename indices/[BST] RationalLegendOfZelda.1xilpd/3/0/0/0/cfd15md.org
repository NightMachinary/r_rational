I was going to start with describing how magic is a force of nature that tends to collect and pool like anything else, and how dungeons get infested with monsters as a result of years of neglect and magical pollution/filth/mold/rust/etc. settles in. I was also thinking of an adaptive "lens" of sorts which assists with interpreting data as the primary device of the story. Not quite the Lens of Truth from OoT, but similar.
