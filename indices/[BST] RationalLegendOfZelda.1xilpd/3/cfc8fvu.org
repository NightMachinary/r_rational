Have you considered making /Zelda/ the protagonist rather than Link? I mean, she already has the right triforce. Plus, you know, female protagonist are way to rare.

I'm thinking the funny route; Zela constantly has to save link via indirect plotting, while using herself more or less as bait to direct him towards more long term sensible goals.
