It could work. I personally prefer less radical departures from canon - perhaps just giving Link the Triforce of Wisdom.

At any rate, you need a plot, rather than just ideas - a conflict and its resolution. Breaking the eternal cycle of history is a good plot, and there are lots of "rationalist" places that you can take that; kickstarting an industrial revolution, preventing the stagnation and decline of civilization, setting up things so that the next iteration of yourself has a better chance than you did, going to space and escaping the bounds of the repetitious earth, etc.

I'd personally like /Ocarina of Time/ or /Majora's Mask/ better as a base, but maybe that's only because I'm a sucker for time travel.

Alternately, you can make over the whole dungeon structure so that each is a puzzle all its own that's more complicated than the ones in the game (which largely come down to simple cause and effect with some physics thrown in). Make each be an intellectual parable - the dungeon of philosophical zombies, the dungeon of the Ship of Theseus, the dungeon of extra dimensions, the dungeon of reversed cause and effect, etc. I think I'd like that, just in order to get the same sense of exploration that the original games have.

Maybe start the story out with Link building a dungeon for Ganondorf and/or the king? The inciting event of the story would be when someone tries to use the Triforce, and it splits into its pieces, one of which finds its way to Link and makes him a nice and juicy target.

Alright, those are all my disorganized thoughts on the matter.
