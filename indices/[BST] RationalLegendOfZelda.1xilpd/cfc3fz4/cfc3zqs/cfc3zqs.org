The concept of just "giving" Link the ToW to make him rational doesn't sit well with me.

I do like your idea for theming the dungeons a lot, though. That has limitless potential.

As for starting with designing a dungeon, that could work. The fly is that the dungeons on the LoZ universe have been consistently /very, very old/. But putting an in-progress structure under a Cursed Zone (pun intended) might be enough.
