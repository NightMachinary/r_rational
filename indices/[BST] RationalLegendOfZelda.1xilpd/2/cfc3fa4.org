Neat! The idea of a rational!LoZ is one of the things that inspired my current video game project.

I agree that there's so much that's just utterly broken about LoZ:

- The repeating Zelda/Link/Ganon cycle makes no sense. It stinks of predestination and prophecy, two things that should have no place in any rational universe or well-written fiction. (Caveats apply.)
- Why does Link alone fight? There are many people in Hyrule, so why is he the only one to resist? He's just a farm boy, right? What's his motivation?
- Where do the hearts you find in bushes come from? Or the rupees that monsters drop? What effect would all those rupees have on the Hyrule economy?
- Why does Ganon want power so badly? Well-written villains (and presumably their IRL counterparts) never see themselves as evil, so what greater good does Ganon think he can achieve?

I'm not a fantastic writer, or rationalist for that matter, but I'm trying to make the story for my game as rational as I can. Feel free to use these ideas below. Having a fanfic of my game, or even just inspiring some aspects of your fic, would let me cross something off my bucket list! ^_^

- There are prophecies but they're all false. The Chosen One / Hero character Lance dies in his first fight.
- Lenna, the protagonist, is a teacher of math and logic. After the kidnapping of her pupils, she seeks out the 'archangel' monster responsible for it. That is the basis of both (a) an explanation of why she might be uniquely well-placed to be rational; and (b) the motivation for her actions in the story.
- I have no explanation for the hearts or coins. But related to the currency issue, the economy is going through some hard times. After the appearance of the archangels people are staying inside rather than going out killing monsters and the banks can't rely on new deposits to pay off their debts.
- There are a few villains in my story; all have good motives. The chairman of the bankers' guild is one. He hatches a plan to save the economy, but by using an ancient high-tech device to manufacture an army of monsters to force the townsfolk to fight and collect more coins. [[#s][The kidnapper archangel is another:]]

There's more about /Lenna's Inception/ [[http://bytten.net/devlog/lennas-inception/][on my website]]. It's playable most of the way through at the moment, albeit without ending, story or external locations yet. But you can at least use keys multiple times. ;)

Back on the topic of rational!LoZ, I think your fic would work well as a "what if": what if Link got the Triforce of Wisdom instead of courage, and that is what made him rational?
