I personally dislike just giving Link the Triforce of Wisdom for a couple of reasons. First, Zelda has had it every time; why has she never managed to do something significant with it? In every single game she's a plot-damsel, practically a non-entity.

Second, I think it's poor taste to say the "Triforce of Wisdom makes you rational" because... well, the Triforce was always distributed by the gods along bloodlines, right? That's a double clich√© of determinism, and /just giving/ Link his rationality is not something I want to do.

Edit: not gonna lie, that Archangel Heart looks a lot like a vegetable.
