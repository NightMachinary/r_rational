If you want some resolutions to this, perhaps Zelda has seen through the cycle of history and specifically set up Link to do something big and important with the Triforce of Wisdom - he's her pawn through time. (I'd also argue that Zelda-as-Sheik is definitely not a plot-damsel.)

Alternately, the Triforce of Wisdom doesn't make you rational, it comes to you /because you're rational/. Link gets the Triforce of Courage because he's courageous, right?
