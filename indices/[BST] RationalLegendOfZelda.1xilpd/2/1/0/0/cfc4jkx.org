Zelda-as-Sheik only happened once. Her angency fluctuates wildly, but always goes deep in the depths of damselation.

Link doesn't get it because he's courageous. Link has always had the ToC because he was the last descendant of the bloodline of Ancient Hylian Knights. He holds it since birth, with no one act of courage promting it manifestation until Ganon starts using his. Link does get the Master Sword because he's courageous, but I don't know how much of this "worthy hero" nonsense comes from him or from the ToC (which is certainly another thing to explore).

The other reason I don't want to give the ToW to the story's rationalist is because of the exponential intelligence growth. Use the device which makes you smarter to make you even smarter, repeat until god. I don't want to make Link Contessa Ganondorf.
