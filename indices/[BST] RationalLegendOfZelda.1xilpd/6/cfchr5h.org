A thing from Skyward Sword: The Master Sword was Fi, an AI-like living sword. You could start the story at the moment Link gets the Master Sword, and have some plot reason why this time, Fi is awake (and smarter) and giving him rationality lessons.

Also, I approve of your choice of base game. Twilight Princess was the shit.
