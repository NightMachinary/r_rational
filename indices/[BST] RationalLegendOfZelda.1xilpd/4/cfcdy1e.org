Rational!Zelda doesn't need much change to the core story structure. Even though sealing things behind plot trinkets is cartoony, it's a great idea if that's what your magic system allows. Ganon generally achieves his aims efficiently, by applying a small amount of sorcery through political channels (in LttP he does this especially well) and Link's strategy of gathering artifacts while hunting down the trinkets sounds completely reasonable given the problems he faces.

The only folly here is that Ganon sits on his thumbs for the meat of the plot: a rational Ganon would be proactive about shoring up his defenses and attempting to intercept Link. A more intelligent Link would be able to handle this. There is room to portray a game of cat and mouse here, which gives you new narrative opportunities while still hitting the same major plot points.

OT's theme of time travel has lots of room for a rational look, although you might want to replace the core time loop with something that makes actual sense. LttP's Dark World's theme of showing people as they are on the inside could be made into a theme of the Dark World bringing out the flaws in your personal utility function.

But the best rationalist Zelda is of course Link's Awakening, as exploring the nature of rationality, the mind, and perception from within what is eventually acknowledged to be a dream screams of possibility.
