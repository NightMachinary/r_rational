Over three upvotes in less than half an hour? I sense lurkers.

You make a good point with the opening. The magic academy was more of an excuse to get over the initial worldbuilding hump; little if any of the story would take place there past the first chapter or two.

I don't think I'd directly make it an actual Twilight Princess fanfic. Everything would, more-or-less, have to be original content.

Unless...

Maybe the fic could, true to the series, introduce a new magic mechanic along with the new plot. Something to quickly travel between existing dungeons, and their continuities? A planeswalking Link could turn very interesting indeed.
