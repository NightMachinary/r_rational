It's all handwaved in the ending of Skyward Sword so that there's an excuse for her to be 'asleep' and the potential for her to be awakened.

One thing that occurred to me as a natural point of departure: Start with Ocarina of Time, and have everything be the same up to the Temple of Time (including irrational!Link). For a reason to be determined, Ganondorf keeps the Triforce of Wisdom, and here that actually means something: He gets much smarter. Instead of putting Link to sleep for seven years until he becomes an adult, the Sages wake up Fi and have her teach Link x-rationality. After seven years, he is old enough to take up the sword directly; open curtain.
