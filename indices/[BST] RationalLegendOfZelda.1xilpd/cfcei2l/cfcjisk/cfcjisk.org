I'm not sure. The utiliy of a combat AI which is constantly aware and calculating all the various possibilities of a fight is, in the hands of Rational!Link, unbeatable. My bigger concern is continuity; Fi /does not appear in any other games./ There is no mention of the Master Sword being intelligent anywhere else.
