On your point where you say the temples designed for only one man to navigate are odd: I was always under the impression the temples were designed specifically that way so ONLY the hero (Link) could go through them to retrieve objects, interact with the sages, etc. As in they were designed that way in universe.

Also, on your point of the dungeons having some kind of ecosystem, since they are so old it would be possible that the life inside of it is from small life forms or different life forms evolving to survive better in that environment. Also later on most of the humanoid enemies are undead skeletons, so there is that.
