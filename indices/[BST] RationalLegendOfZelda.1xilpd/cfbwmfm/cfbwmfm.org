I like the concept and appreciate the insight in your planning/creative process, but... trying to attend a magic academy? I know ration!lovedStoryFromChildhood usually diverges pretty fast, but they usually start similarly. If your using Twilight Princes as your reference, then why not have Link start off living in a ranching town out in the boonies. He could be studying with an old architect who decided he wanted to retire away from the busy city. Then he can be thrown in to the adventure in typical LoZ fashion and rationalize his way from there. I feel he needs to start in the same place he would in any other LoZ game.

As far as companion characters, TP comes with one. And if your not looking to follow any game to closely, between Minda and Navi we get a model for how to design a LoZ style companion (twist, Links not the rationalist, it's Navi (oh please no)). Someone small that and follow him around easily would be a good someone to have for Link to explain things to or bounce ideas off of. Fairies are used many times in the games. See [[http://zeldawiki.org/Link's_Partners]] and [[http://zeldawiki.org/Fairy_Companion]]

As you pointed out, Link tends to spend most of his stories alone in dungeons, so how you handle that is something I am interested in.
