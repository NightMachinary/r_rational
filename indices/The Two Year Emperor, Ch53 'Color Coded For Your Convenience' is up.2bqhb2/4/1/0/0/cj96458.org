Argh. He should definitely specify that the set of numbers be ordered from most important to least important so that if he does blow all the answers, he at least gets something useful.

Better yet, he could request /only/ the most important true answer. For example: "Of the claims written on these 100 pieces of paper, which of the true ones is the most important (to us) for us to know about?" That way, if he blows the answers (on the grounds that information about the other claims is contained in the answer, i.e. that they are not as important, whether true or not) he at least doesn't sound like he has been taking stupid pills.
