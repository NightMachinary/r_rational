There is one way to bypass mind blank that I can think of.

Miracle can teleport you to a location without any divination or information gathering, or any need to know where you are going. It's an evocation spell, so it's not blocked by mind blank. As such you could teleport directly to the phylactery or assuming they have teleport wards teleport several hundred feet above, drop several tons of antiosmium, and teleport away. It's like a greater greater form of greater teleport which has some sort of omniscient location finder.

If your god is unwilling to aid you you can just convert to the cause of good and let the power of goodness power you so your request is mediated just by their alignment and nature. You are killing undead who are evil so many gods of good would likely support you, and the request is explicitly one that miracle can grant.
