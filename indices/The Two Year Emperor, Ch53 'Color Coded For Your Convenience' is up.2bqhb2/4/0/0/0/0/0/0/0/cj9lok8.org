/sigh/

Some of your points are absolutely correct and you're right. Some of them I don't agree that RAW supports them. If we ever end up at a table together, we can play it by either set of rules, depending on who's the DM. In the meantime, I don't feel like debating this further. This is the way it works in 2YE. If you think it's house rules, fine, whatever. As far as I'm concerned, I'm still running RAW on this.
