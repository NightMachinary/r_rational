  Objects are not covered by the alter other creature spell as they are creatures, so the inherited limitations (e.g. must be average member of form) don't apply therefore you can create any object that's not magical or made of valuable materials such as a lich map.

Yes, that's exactly how I understand it. And please stop saying that I'm "changing the rules". I am not changing the rules; I feel that your interpretation of RAW is incorrect, and I am playing by the RAW as I understand it. Clearly, neither one of us is going to convince the other, so please drop it.

The ironic part is that the entire discussion is utterly moot. We both agree that you can't create a lich map in the 2YE-verse. We simply disagree on why.

As to not being able to use Mind Blank on an object, that is absolutely correct. However, my understanding is that attended objects are covered by Mind Blank, so the solution is to tie the thing to a cat, put Mind Blank on the cat, and then put the cat under Temporal Stasis. Or, if you don't feel that you can Mind Blank a cat, insert whatever creature you like.

Edit: you can also set a spell engine to constantly recast the MB so it doesn't run out.
