  Alter Self affects people, not objects, so it isn't relevant when creating a map.
#+end_quote

It is relevant in that it explains the limitations of your magic. In saying "I believe this spell as written allows me to create a map of an enemy's magical objects" you are saying that there are no limitations that prevent you from doing so. Since polymorph any object is dependent on the powers of polymorph, which is dependent on alter self your ability to alter the physical appearance of an object is dependent on the wording of alter self, which details what you can do. You lack the ability to alter the writing on an object so it's a house rule that would let you do so.

#+begin_quote
  Some people read Alter Self to say that you can't so that because of the "average member" clause. I disagree with that reading -- in context, I rule that "average member" means "within the norms of", as used above. It would be useless if you couldn't disguise yourself as an emaciated beggar or a weightlifter just because those aren't average builds.

That would be RAI/ a house rule. The disguise skill requires you to spend more skill to overcome a significant weight/ height difference, 50 skill points. You're essentially allowing them to have a 60+ bonus to disguise (the normal stuff plus 50+ for an abnormal physique) from alter self, allowing you to bypass most disguise checks. That's normally a third level sort of spell effect, doing epic effects of skills, not a second level sort of effect. Like fly at level 3 making climb useless vs spider climb at level 2, invisibility at level 2 vs invisibility sphere at level 3 (hide others) making hide useless.
