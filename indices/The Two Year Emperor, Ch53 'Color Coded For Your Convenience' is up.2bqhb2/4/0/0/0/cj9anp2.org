Alter Self affects people, not objects, so it isn't relevant when creating a map. PAO may be similar to AS, but it is enormously different as well, and ultimately the differences will usually outweigh the similarities. For example, at my table I would allow PAOing into a weightlifter. Some people read Alter Self to say that you can't so that because of the "average member" clause. I disagree with that reading -- in context, I rule that "average member" means "within the norms of", as used above. It would be useless if you couldn't disguise yourself as an emaciated beggar or a weightlifter just because those aren't average builds.
