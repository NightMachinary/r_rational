Whoa, heavy edit there. And I thought I had responded, but I don't see it.

Anyway:

Congrats on writing GrÇ«fhamr properly -- I think you may be the first one who bothered to render the o-with-caudata. :)

PAO is extremely broken, but it does have limits. It turns /one/ thing into /one/ other thing. So, ant to elf, sure. Anthill to elf city? Nope. There's also some limits about creating information -- e.g., if you say "Polymorph Any Object: rock to map showing the locations of every lich's phylactery!"...yeah, no. Won't work. (And yes, this is actually a deviation from RAW. As written, PAO would allow you to do that, so I'm bringing down the "gods of knowledge don't allow that crap" hammer. (It gets kinda tiresome how often I have to do that, actually...D&D 3.5 is *sooooo broken!!!!*))

I like your "set of numbers" technique. Expect it to get an appropriate treatment in the next chapter.
