According to the [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Polymorph_Any_Object][wiki]]:

#+begin_quote
  This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.

Does the no gold creation rule not apply in 2YE?

Also, if you were to create an elf, could you create an elf mage capable of casting, say, PAO twice? To create two more identical elf mages, with similar abilities? And so on, until you have an infinite elf army

Would Jake's Hourglass of Permanency work on PAO? What are the exact terms of that, anyway.

Incidentally, given how insanely useful wishes are, why hasn't Jake tried to get any more? He didn't seem to have much trouble finding a Candle of Invocation last time, and while he can't use it to wish for infinite wishes, he could still get something out of it. Such as a magic item capable of casting PAO with caster level 1000
