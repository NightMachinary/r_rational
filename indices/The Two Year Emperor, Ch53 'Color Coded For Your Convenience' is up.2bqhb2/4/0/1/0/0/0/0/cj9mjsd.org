Would a group of elves tied together, or otherwise connected count as a single object?

Also, would these elves be created as a blank slate, or can they be given (false) memories? And would Herrun accept their secrets, or would they be considered inferior to those of regular people? Also, had Jake created them with his insanely powerful secret that caused an explosion, could they all have sacrificed it too? Or would that have just detracted from it's power, as it is now recoverable?

What does make something valuable for Herrun, anyway? The impact the secret's loss has on people? The potential the secret had to change things? It's importance? It's impact on the life of the sacrificer?
