We know that Loki is playng both sides. He is probably thick with Afi (just like Jake), given Afi's apparent penchant for munchkinry and Loki's Neutral alignment. The trick with destroying Herrún's temple to kill her off, then getting Grǫfhamr to sacrifice their secrets to bring her back is probably something they worked out together.

Afi could be a pretty good ally, if they could get a Helm of Opposite Alignment on him enough times to get past his will save. Could Loki be planning to do this to Shailos?

The black flames are most easily explained by lots of evil undead making sacrifices. The only way to prevent Herrun from being predisposed to evil would be to either compensate with more sacrifices from good people, or find the undead and HoOA them all. Or maybe HoOA the evil Herrun, if that is possible. To incapacitate the undead long enough, I'm thinking polymorph them into tree sloths, or something else that is slow moving.

How broken is Polymorph Any Object, anyway? Can one turn an anthill into a secret city containing billions of virtuous elves with all kinds of secret magic arts, say, to sacrifice to Herrun? On the other hand, maybe actually use their secret arts for the war effort directly.

The truthful-mandatory questions could be phrased in a way so as for the honest answer to be a set of numbers, with each one corresponding to a numbered piece of paper with a scenario written on it. There could be hundreds of them. By asking "what is the complete set of numbers corresponding to claims regarding this reality", the truthful answer would be a simple set of numbers with no room for deviation.

The complete-honest questions could be more open-ended, e.g. asking for the 100 most likely plans to work, sorted from most likely to work to least likely to work, with percentages indicating probability in the event that the plan were attempted with no new information.
