Afi can scry on the /room/ they were in. But that room wasn't in Grǫfhamr proper, it was in a Mage's Magnificent Mansion which was inside Grǫfhamr. An MMM is its own extradimensional space, i.e. its own demiplane. When it ceases to exist, they will put up a new MMM, which will be a brand new demiplane with no relation to the first except that it might have the same floorplan.
