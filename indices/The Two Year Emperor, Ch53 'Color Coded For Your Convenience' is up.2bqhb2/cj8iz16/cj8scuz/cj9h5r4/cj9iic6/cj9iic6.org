PAO has size limits on the source object, but not on the output. You could PAO a gain of sand into a billion tons of gold if you wanted. It would even be permanent. ( +5/same kingdom, +2/same class, +2/same intelligence = 9 = permanent)

D20 doesn't define object, which is a cause for many issues. Nonetheless, a city is pretty clearly not included. At least not at my table. Nice try, though. :) I heartily approve of your munchkinry.
