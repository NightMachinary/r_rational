Tied together = one: no. Not with creatures, certainly. With objects it's a bit fuzzier, and I would have to rule case-by-case. In general, if you're tying things together just to hack PAO then the answer is probably no. If you're tying things together to form a new object (eg a net with floats attached) then I would say yes, that is a single object.

PAO'd critters would be blank slates with no active memories of their own, although they would have basic autonomic functionality -- treat them as a person with total amnesia.

Yes, you can use Programmed Amnesia to put memories into a PAO'd creature. You could not add character levels that way, though. You might be able to add knowledge skills, but not physical skills.

The elves are regular people after the PAO so, yes, Herr√∫n would accept their sacrifices. Interesting point.

As to the rest of your questions...spoilers! :)
