In Chapter 50 Herrun says

  rather large secrets, considering the impact they would have had on those people's lives.

So presumably the strength of the secret is the impact it would have on people's lives. Although it doesn't say whether its on the person in question or people in general. Which explains why Jake's nuke from orbit secret was so powerful and implies that his Loki deduction could have had a massive impact on things. In which case, creating elves which are not permanent and then programming them with the information that they aren't permanent would have a pretty big impact on their short lives. So that should be a powerful secret for Herrun, if my guess is correct. Unless the length of the lives they have left would matter?

Presumably programmable amnesia suffers from the same information creation constraints as PAO, so an elf couldn't be given the memory of the lich's phylactery locations. Sadly.
