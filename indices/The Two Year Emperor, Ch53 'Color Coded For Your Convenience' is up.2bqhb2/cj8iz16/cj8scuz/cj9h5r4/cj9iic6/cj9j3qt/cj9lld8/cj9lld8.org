My mistake, I forgot about that clause. Yes, that rule applies. You could still PAO up a billion tons of osmium, since that has no cost on any equipment list.

Re: elf mage. Erm...good question. You can definitely create an elf. Running down the chain of base spells, I don't think RAW supports creating something with character levels.

The Hourglass doesn't "make spells permanent" it "casts a Permanency spell", which can only affect certain spells, PAO not among them. It's not an issue though; you can PAO a pebble into a human, which has a 20 minute duration, then you PAO that human into itself, permanent duration.

As to not trying to get more Wishes...Jake is a little jumpy about using Wish again. Having a goddess show up to twist your head off makes an impression.
