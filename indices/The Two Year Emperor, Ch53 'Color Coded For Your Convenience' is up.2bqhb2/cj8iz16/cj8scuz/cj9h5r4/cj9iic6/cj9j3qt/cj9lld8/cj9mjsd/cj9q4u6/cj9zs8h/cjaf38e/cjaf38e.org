In theory you could do the elf thing, but Programmable Amnesia has a 10 minute casting time, so it wouldn't scale very well. There is a spell called Mindrape, which does pretty much exactly what PA does but has a 1 round casting time so in theory you could use that and have good throughput. (I think; I don't remember all the details on PA and MR). Problem is, that spell doesn't exist in 2YE because I dislike the name. Also, it's got the Evil descriptor, so the Deorsi / Flobovians wouldn't be using it anyway.
