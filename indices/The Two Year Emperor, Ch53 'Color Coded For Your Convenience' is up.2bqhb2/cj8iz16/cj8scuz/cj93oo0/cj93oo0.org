I'm not entirely sure PAO RAW would allow a map showing the location of every lich's phylactery.

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/alterSelf.htm]]

The polymorph spell appearance alteration is based on alter spell.

"You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check. "

So you have a limited ability to alter the appearance of things you polymorph. By Raw, you can only alter the minor physical characteristics and physical qualities, and they must be within the norms for that race, they provide, at most, a 10+ disguise bonus.

I'd argue that a document showing the locations of every lich's phylactery would not be within the norms for the race of pieces of paper. In fact, you're going somewhat beyond RAW if you alter anything bar height, weight, hair color, gender, hair texture, and skin color. The spell doesn't provide any bonus to forge document, writing on a document isn't really covered by the spell.
