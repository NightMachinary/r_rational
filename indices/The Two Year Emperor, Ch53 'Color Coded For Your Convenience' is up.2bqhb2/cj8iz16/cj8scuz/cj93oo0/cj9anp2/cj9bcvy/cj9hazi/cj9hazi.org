  [The details of Alter Self are] relevant [to PAO] in that it explains the limitations of your magic.

No, it really isn't. Objects are not creatures. Alter Self talks only about what you can do vis a vis a creature. It makes no mention of objects, because it /isn't about objects./ You are taking the details of a spell about creatures and extrapolating what it should therefore allow you to do vis a vis objecs. That is the very essence of RAI.

[disguise issue]

You are misunderstanding my point. Granted, I was unclear because I used the word 'disguise' ambiguously. Let's try that again:

Alert Self has two uses:

- Make yourself look like a person who isn't you [general appearance change]
- Make yourself look like a specific person [disguise]

If you are using the 'disguise' function then sure, fine, you get a +10 bonus and overcoming a huge body difference is hard.

If you are using the 'general appearance change' function, then you are limited to 'the norms of the race'. This includes both very strong / fat people and very weak / skinny people. It probably doesn't include Mr Universe or a supermodel, but it would cover, e.g a random gym rat or a marathon runner.

This is a stupid and contradictory way for a spell to work, but it's the only way I can read it that is internally consistent.
