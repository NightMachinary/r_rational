  I am not changing the rules; I feel that your interpretation of RAW is incorrect.

It's somewhat frustrating you ordering me to stop it and arguing with me. Sigh. PAO doesn't define the properties of objects beyond size, class, and kingdom, hence why it's rewritting. You have to make up new fluff text and rules for how it works beyond the existing stuff to fit your new definition that doesn't inherit polymorph stuff. Even if we assume it is RAW, it still needs houseruling and such because it no longer has any rules explaining what it does.

  The ironic part is that the entire discussion is utterly moot. We both agree that you can't create a lich map in the 2YE-verse. We simply disagree on why.

A lot of the fun of reading a fanfiction or story within an established universe is seeing the existing rules manipulated and used. Deviation from them is somewhat frustrating.

  As to not being able to use Mind Blank on an object, that is absolutely correct. However, my understanding is that attended objects are covered by Mind Blank, so the solution is to tie the thing to a cat, put Mind Blank on the cat, and then put the cat under Temporal Stasis. Or, if you don't feel that you can Mind Blank a cat, insert whatever creature you like.

Yeah, I guess you can evade it like that.
