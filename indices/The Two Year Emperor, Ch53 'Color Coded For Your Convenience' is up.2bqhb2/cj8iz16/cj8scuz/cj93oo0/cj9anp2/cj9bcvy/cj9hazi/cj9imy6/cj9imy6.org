Most of the alter self rules use the term form, not the term creature, and the polymorph any object implies that the term form refers to both objects and creatures. Besides which, it would be a very quirky interpretation of the rules to say that "This spell functions like polymorph, except that it changes one object or creature into another." Meant that you could ignore polymorph rules because you were now making an object. The clear meaning of the words is that polymorph rules apply, except in that you can now make objects, which are also subject to polymorph rules about forms, not that objects can ignore the rules of polymorph about forms.

  Alert Self has two uses: Make yourself look like a person who isn't you [general appearance change] Make yourself look like a specific person [disguise]
#+end_quote

It doesn't have a specific person disguise mechanic, it just provides a bonus to a disguise skill check, where you do specific things to set up a disguise. Until you put in the 1d3x10 minutes your alter self does nothing to make you look like a specific person by RAW. It could improve bluffs by dm choice, but nothing else.

  If you are using the 'general appearance change' function, then you are limited to 'the norms of the race'. This includes both very strong / fat people and very weak / skinny people.

What humans possible range by chance is defined. 124-260 pounds. Personally I'd argue that somewhere in the middle would be closer to the meaning of average, but a, say, 6 stone beggar weighing 84 pounds is clearly not in the norms, since it's impossible to be that just with rolling given the normal human stats. A body builder is more possible, there's a good chance you could fake that with alter self.
