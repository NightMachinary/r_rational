I don't mind playing by either set of rules, my annoyance was that you called PAO broken in RAW after changing the rules of the spell. Your argument was something like "Objects are not covered by the alter other creature spell as they are creatures, so the inherited limitations (e.g. must be average member of form) don't apply therefore you can create any object that's not magical or made of valuable materials such as a lich map."

While the DnD creators made many obscenely broken spells they did at least try to stop some things, and their efforts deserve respect.

Edit. Besides which, there's a spell that can locate the phylacteries anyway, Discern Location. It's unblockable except by mind blank or deity intervention, and phylacteries aren't creatures and so can't be mind blanked.
