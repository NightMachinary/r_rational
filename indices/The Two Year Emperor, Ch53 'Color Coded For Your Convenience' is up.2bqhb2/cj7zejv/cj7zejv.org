This seems like interesting wording. Given that this is a resurrection ritual, I don't think that the people participating in the ritual could count as her creators. Does a god even have creators?

  We can manifest in our temples, or in places where someone is threatening ascencion or otherwise poses a danger to the world or to the gods themselves.

Hasn't Loki and many other gods manifested to Jake without fulfilling these conditions? Arros and Ilara could perhaps count under a danger to the world, but not Shailos or Loki. Unless what they're doing doesn't count as manifesting

Also, Jake's Orbital Bombardment trick appears to have curried favour with 2 gods, Loki and Arros. I think that it would clearly be in his best interests to come up with more creative uses of munchkinry such as that. Not that I have an ulterior motive here or anything. Would other acts of munchkinry such as the commoner railgun or celestial brilliance cannons also impress the gods?
