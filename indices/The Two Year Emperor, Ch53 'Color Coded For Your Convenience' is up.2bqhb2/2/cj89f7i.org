Waidaminute....

Afi can scry on the town until it moves. But the town's in an extradimensional space. Only its entrance technically /moves./ Doesn't that mean that Afi can spy on 90% of the town any time no matter how far they run, unless they completely tear down and rebuild the town?

Also, if I'm inferring right, either Jake doesn't fit into the world's alignment system or.... /Jake is eeeeevillll!/ Bwahaha! His pally pallies are gonna have a fun time with that one. I wonder if their protocol allows for evil overlords, or if they have to hogtie him and put a helm of opposite alignment on him 'for the land.'
