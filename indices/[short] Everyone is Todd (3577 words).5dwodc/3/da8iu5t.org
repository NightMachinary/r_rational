I'm not sure which is more upsetting, the homogeneity, or the modernity. How badly would you have to screw up the volition extrapolation to decide the happiest possible human life is set in this liminal world of washcloths, snow, monogamy, jobs, recitals and white people. For most of our history, we were not these things. And in our future, if we're allowed to stray freely, I'm fairly certain we won't remain these things. It even mentioned labor pains. How fucked up would an AI have to be to decide that the pain during childbirth is central to human happiness??
