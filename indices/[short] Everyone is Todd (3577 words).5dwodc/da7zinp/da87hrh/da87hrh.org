Your are not exactly uncontroversial views of identity.\\
For instance if you think multiple instances of the same simulation only count as one simulation, then people can't die, because there will always be a Everett branch in which they live (or insert some other multiverse/massive universe model). The idea that copies of something existing elsewhere somehow makes something not real has a great deal of immediately obvious problems..

Secondly you are assuming a view of death pretty synonymous with maintaining personality and memory which is immediately tricky. The most obvious problem is that since you don't expect to cease experience if you had some brain damage that caused amnesia or a personality change; then to compare it to death in the same league as oblivion is disingenuous.
