  Not necessarily. Unretrievable copies are extremely similar to non-existent copies. It doesn't really matter if there's a trillion trillion other versions of me, because I could never be recreated from them.

See this seems like this is moving the goalposts. So suddenly what matters is whether the information exists to recreate a version of you within your general area? Why is the distance of any importance here? And in what sense could you not be recreated from them if the distance was to far, that would be difference of the distance were less?\\
They are /exactly/ identical to you, so I can't fathom in what way you can justify caring so much about distance. If it's recreating you after your death, then you're /dead, you don't exist anywhere/, so why should you treat the light cone of the universe you used to exist in as somehow special?

  Actually, I think that being unable to retrieve memories would be a temporary oblivion. This is a difference of models that probably can't be reconciled.

Ok see I have a problem with just assuming these sort of things. One might expect to be confused for the duration of the drug, but the inability to remember stuff doesn't mean you're /unconscious/. You would still experience the period of disorientation, then when you got you memories back you would remember that period.\\
I just can't think of any remotely consistent reason why the internal process of your mind would continue functioning, but for some undefined reason turn into a P-zombie, just because it can't access memories. Effectively I don't see any reason, why changing the memories of a wetware processor, would for some /inexplicable/ reason shut off the bits in charge of experiencing.\\
Also you have mental processes /other/ than remembering things, and it's not really oblivion if you remember it afterwards, so I can't really parse how you came to that conclusion.

  This may be the sticking point: I think that subjective experience is an illusion of memory, not a real phenomenon. We think that time is continuous because we literally cannot experience it any other way, but it's entirely possible that time is running in reverse, or that it skips from point to point, or that it only began a microsecond ago, or even that it isn't moving at all. We cannot know we have experienced anything unless we assume that our memories are authoritative.

Ok see this sort of thing annoys me because you're clearly changing the definition of subjective experience. It's like claiming nothing exists, what would that even mean? You clearly feel things, regardless of whether they're in /any/ way a meaningful reflection of any external reality, so to say you /don't/, doesn't have any clear meaning.

As for it being continous, yeah sure there you can come up with plenty of scenarios where subjective continuity doesn't match up to /actual/ continuity, but most of them are more complicated than current models. For instance if the universe only /appeared/ to be as old as it is, then that would raise quite a few problems, same thing for time skipping around. As for time going backwards.. That wouldn't mean anything, the direction of time is purely a subjective reference frame, another universe going the other way would say that /we're/ the one's going back in time, there's no absolute reference frame here.

Ok so for the rest of the comment, yeah my position doesn't consider the things that contribute to the standard things people think of as being you as being important for determining subjective experience. It's kind of more eastern than western ideas of identity, for instance the idea of reincarnation wouldn't be /logically incoherent/ within my view, just extremely undesirable and also you'know probably not actually real.

*One intuition pump for my position that just occurred to me is this:* You're meditating, and we're assuming you're good enough at it that you don't have the occasional stray thought. Now during that period, pretty much all of your memories could be cut off from you and /you wouldn't notice/ because you're not remembering anything. Right before you start thinking again those memories are then quickly returned.\\
Now in your concept of identity, you would have experienced some sort of death/oblivion during that period. However from one's own perspective, you /couldn't even tell/ that you didn't have your memories. So doesn't that mean that memories can't be a very good predictor of subjective experience?\\
I would be curious to know what you think of this pump, as I do seek to make my positions better defended and coherent. Plus I don't know that I've ever encountered anyone who actually shares my position so making it easier to explain is useful.
