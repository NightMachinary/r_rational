The first is that it's entirely possible that you live in some sort of constructed reality. The second (which I prefer) is that our observable reality is more likely to be correct than a hypothetical fictional reality (occam's razor), and that an almost-real simulation makes for good stories.

Whichever one seems more likely to you depends on how grounded you are in our observable reality.
