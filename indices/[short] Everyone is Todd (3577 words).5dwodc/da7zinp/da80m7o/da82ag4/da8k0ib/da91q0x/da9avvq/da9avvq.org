  The second (which I prefer) is that our observable reality is more likely to be correct than a hypothetical fictional reality (occam's razor), and that an almost-real simulation makes for good stories.

Hypothesis: As soon as humans are able to do so, we will run simulations of our past. This will have scientific and historical value.

Hypothesis: As out simulations improve, they will get asymptotically closer and closer to some theoretical best possible simulation.

Hypothesis: At some point, well before the theoretical best possible simulation, we will likely be able to run a simulation good enough that the simulation itself attempts to run a (presumably worse) simulation.

Conclusion, part one: Assuming the above hypotheses, there will be a vast number of possible simulated universes for every real universe.

Conclusion, part two: Therefore, assuming the above hypotheses, you are far more likely to be living in a simulation than not.
