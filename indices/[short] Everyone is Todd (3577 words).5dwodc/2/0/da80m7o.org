Check out the Upload Prison from Quantum Thief (it's literally the first thing). Basically, instead of doing anything fancy to rehab people, you split them N times, add a nonce factor, send each through M prisoner's dilemmas, take the high-scorer and restart the cycle.

Gladys could do the same; make N instances of reality, introduce a nonce, and take the highest scoring version of each individual with which to make the next loop.

On that note: Is it just me, or do these kinds of suggestions always end up with realities that could look a lot like the one we have?
