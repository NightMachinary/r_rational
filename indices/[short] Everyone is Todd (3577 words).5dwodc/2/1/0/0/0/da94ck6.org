  This seemed to imply that you held that identical simulations only count as one simulation, which seems to be a relatively common position.
#+end_quote

It's not that they only count as one, but Gladys' utility function should have been designed to discount the value of extra identical simulations so as to preserve diversity.

  Also we don't really know that at the end the simulation is replaced or anything, maybe they just suddenly change the person's memories so it's continuous.
#+end_quote

But the memories aren't continuous though. All the memories of the loop are erased. The /hardware/ is continuous, but then you might as well say that two songs are the same if you overwrite one with the other.

  Ok see the problem with this sentiment is that it doesn't seem to recognize that there are bad things other than death. So since Blake basically becomes Todd he is clearly having his desires and autonomy totally disregarded, but he's still alive as a iteration of Todd.
#+end_quote

But he's not conscious while the simulation is running Todd. If he were, Gladys would recognise the suffering it was causing him and abort the simulation. His desires and autonomy /were/ disregarded, but he no longer has desires anymore, and the Todd simulation would emphatically prefer to continue existing over Blake's return.

That means that Gladys can justify the pain she causes Blake as a small sacrifice to achieve everlasting happiness. Over any significant timescale, the new satisfaction will overwhelm the temporary dip.

Of course we're horrified at the idea, but if you believe that Blake is Todd then you must also believe that Blake is now as happy as he possibly could be. So what's the problem? It's like a parent giving their child a painful vaccination, "It's for your own good."

  Given the main character transitions from Todd to Blake it's kind of obvious that in the actual sense of personal continuity of experience "Blake" (the consciousness not the personality) still exists.
#+end_quote

I'd argue that continuity of experience cannot exist without at least partial continuity of memory.

For example, I would say that if I move Blake's simulation from computer A to computer B, then A!Blake = B!Blake due to continuity of experience. If I simultaneously install Todd on computer A, are you saying that A!Todd = A!Blake because they share the hardware, while A!Blake â‰  B!Blake?

Or are you saying that A!Todd = A!Blake because of the continuity /and/ A!Blake = B!Blake because of the continuity there, meaning that if you shifted every human's simulation through every computer then everybody would be everybody else at the same time?
