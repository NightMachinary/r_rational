  N instances of the same simulation is not the same as N distinct simulations.

This seemed to imply that you held that identical simulations only count as one simulation, which seems to be a relatively common position. Also we don't really know that at the end the simulation is replaced or anything, maybe they just suddenly change the person's memories so it's continuous.

  If overwriting somebody's personality and memories doesn't constitute a death, then what's the problem with the "Everyone is Todd" scenario? Gladys has made every living human immortal and happy, end of story?

Ok see the problem with this sentiment is that /it doesn't seem to recognize that there are bad things other than death/. So since Blake basically becomes Todd he is clearly having his desires and autonomy totally disregarded, but he's still alive as a iteration of Todd.\\
Given the main character transitions from Todd to Blake it's kind of obvious that in the actual sense of personal continuity of experience "Blake" (the consciousness not the personality) still exists.\\
/However pretty much everyone agrees that he's having his freedoms and human rights horribly violated./
