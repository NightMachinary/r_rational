People absolutely still can die. The fact that other versions of you live doesn't mean that you aren't dead. I don't know how you got that from my comment, because I said pretty much the opposite (that overwriting end-loop!Todd with start-loop!Todd constitutes a murder, even though there are billions of duplicates).

My point was that a simulation of Blake that is locked into the thoughts and behaviours of Todd is not in any meaningful sense a simulation of Blake. The only way it could be is if Blake was a silent, terrified passenger in the Todd simulation, which would mean Gladys was optimising for Blake's horror, not his happiness.

If overwriting somebody's personality and memories /doesn't/ constitute a death, then what's the problem with the "Everyone is Todd" scenario? Gladys has made every living human immortal and happy, end of story?
