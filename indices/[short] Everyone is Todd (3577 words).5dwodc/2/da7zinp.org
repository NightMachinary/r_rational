Whoever designed Gladys' utility function must have been having an off day. It doesn't matter who, since they're all Todd now anyway.

=N= instances of the same simulation is not the same as =N= distinct simulations. Even if it was, the simulations don't have anything in common with the originals; Gladys may as well just create =N= Todds ex nihilo instead of overwriting all the minds.

Functionally speaking, Gladys is just killing non-Todds and creating Todds. Even Blake isn't meaningfully the same mind as "his" Todd, just a corruption of a Todd-simulation with data from the Blake backup. He was briefly alive, and is now dead again, probably permanently.

The flaw in Gladys' utility function is that she doesn't recognise the Todd-overwriting as equivalent to murder (and the same is true of Todd-looping, for that matter). What she /should/ have done is subtly manipulated their simulated environment so that they would all gradually converge to a Todd-like mindset.
