Equivalent exchange seems like a bundle of conservation principles. Mass, sure, but not only - there are some alchemical properties (Al mentions not being able to transmute iron from something that has the qualities of water). They don't seem to have a fixed school of thought regarding this but they adhere to some sort of "element" school as well, so it's probably something along the lines of "earthy" things becoming other "earthy" things (e.g. stone => iron), "watery" and so on. Though they also explicitly mention atomic elements (oxygen, carbon), molecules (ammonia, dissociated from explosives) and even crystalline structures (diamond/graphite) so it doesn't really look like their chemistry is too different from ours.

Energy is conserved too: they just draw it from tectonic movements.

I always thought the true nature of alchemy was to ignore the 2nd principle of thermodynamics. Everything is conserved, but for example you can gather high-entropy energy to make things happen (like, using thermal energy to propel a pillar with high kinetic energy) and rearrange disordered matter into ordered structures. You can make iron out of rock and not water because rock is more likely to contain high quantities of iron atoms in its minerals.
