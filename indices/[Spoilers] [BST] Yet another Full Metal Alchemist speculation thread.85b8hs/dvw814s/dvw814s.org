What I believe is that emotions aren't inherently the same, rather they differ from person to person. Father wasn't very lustful, so lust wasn't as well.

Greed was father's true intentions and desires, father only really wanted friends and too be loved.

Equivalent exchange, to my understanding is that an equal amount of matter must be present, and if the alchemist did not provide the "information" necessary, then there would be a rebound. Think about it, to transmute a spear, Edward needs to:

1. Have the material.

2. Have the knowledge of the components.

3. Know what to do with the material/put in the information that is present in the spear.

I believe that the sheet complexity and amount of information in a human body is what caused it to backfire. There's no way ed and al have a complete and perfect understanding of how a human body works, they didn't have the knowledge necessary to create a human.
