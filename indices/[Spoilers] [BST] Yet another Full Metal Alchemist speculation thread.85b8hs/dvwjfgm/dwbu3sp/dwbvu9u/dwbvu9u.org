Eh, whenever you try to link to FFnet, try to link it like this:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7536065/1/Anything-but-Normal]].

The difference is so that readers go to the first chapter. I'm using the Android app, which can act a bit odd if you try to open a fic in the middle of a chapter instead of at the beginning. In any case, it's good practice.

This is mostly just as a reference to anyone else reading the thread.

In any case, thanks! I'm checking it out right now.
