In the manga energy is provided by tectonic movements. Which is indeed a nearly inexhaustible source; the problem is, you can't gather that energy and use it so efficiently because it's very degraded, high-entropy stuff. That's the miracle of alchemy, it basically subverts only the 2nd principle of thermodynamics. Everything else more or less makes sense in terms of conservation laws.
