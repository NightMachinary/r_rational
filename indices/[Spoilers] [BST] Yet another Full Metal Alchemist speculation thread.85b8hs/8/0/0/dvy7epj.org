Two things:

1: Carbon dioxide dissolves in the oceans and is utilised by phytoplankton in photosynthesis for growth and reproduction, entering the food web. Eventually the dead organisms sink to the seabed and become part of the the sedimentary rock. Without the subduction of the oceanic crust and the return of its carbon to the atmosphere by volcanoes, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would be gradually leeched out and the temperatures would drop, encasing the planet in ice.

2: The magnetic field would weaken and dissipate, leaving the unprotected atmosphere to be stripped away by the solar wind.
