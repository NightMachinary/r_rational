  who is the prince of what I think is FMA!Japan?

I think it's pretty transparent it's FMA!China really. Most of their naming patterns and culture are Chinese, and heck, Xing was an actual vassal state of China: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xing_(state)]]. The Xing emperor also appears to be modeled after Shi Huangdi, first emperor of China, the terracotta army dude, who is alleged to have died by drinking mercury, as he thought it would make him immortal (this story is even mentioned in FMA, I don't remember who is it attributed to though).

  The idea that the power of friendship is somehow universal enough to move even him, that "all he really wanted/needed was friends" strikes me as really dumb.

It's still a shounen series, but I didn't see it as completely out of left field. Basically, to Greed, his companions too are "possessions". He's greedy for power, money, but also followers. So when he kills his own former henchman, and then realises it, it triggers his rebellion /again/, because he realises he's been manipulated into doing the thing he hates the most, destroying his own possessions.

Anyway remember that, his name aside, he's not literally an incarnation of a Biblical sin, but a part of the Homunculus' former personality. And what was that Homunculus' most human trait that eventually caused his downfall? The desire for human connection that had led him to befriend Hohenheim, and eventually give him half the souls from Xerxes, something that he had absolutely no reason to do if not some twisted sort of genuine gratitude.

Personally I would not dare a rewrite of FMA, nor suggest it needs one. I think it's "rational" enough as it stands. Its characters all have their own flaws and desires, but ultimately their behaviour generally always makes sense. Just because they don't pursue transhumanist goals (Ed and Al /did/, but the beating they got out of it is a believable reason for them to have thought it wiser to give up) does not mean they are not rational. Alchemy is a limited form of science in their world, and they are approximately at the level of technology of the early XX century, save a few oddities like automail. At that point, they might reasonably conclude that even if transhumanism was possible, it would be beyond their reach for their lifetime. Every experiment in that direction seems to hit a wall where you either don't proceed, or need more human lives to fuel the extension of just one.
