Could actually be going the other way around: maybe they're /cooling/ down the core of the planet way too fast. We could run a quick calculation of how much energy expenditure that would take. And I think tectonic and geothermal activity do play a role in keeping the planet the way it is. Not sure what would happen if the Earth finally solidified all the way through.
