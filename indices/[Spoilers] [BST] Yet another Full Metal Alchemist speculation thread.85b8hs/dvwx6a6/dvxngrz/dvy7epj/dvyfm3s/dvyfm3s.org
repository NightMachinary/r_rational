The CO2 cycle with subduction is pretty slow, and if they've got an industrial civilisation, they probably have CO2 release in droves. They already had cars in FMA. But the magnetic field thing hits fast and hard - plus you could have that before even switching off you may trigger a pole reversal. That's a pretty cool idea for an FMA sequel fanfiction!
