Here's a thought about a "rational" bent on a FMA fanfic -

It has been a thousand years since the entity known as "Father" was defeated at the hands of the Fullmetal Alchemist, and since then State Alchemy has grown by leaps and bounds. The State Academies and a formalization of alchemical education have increased the number of qualified alchemists per generation by factors of ten. However, what nobody was able to foresee is the effects of so many people drawing on the Earth's tectonic energy. Thus, a thousand years later, Emmeline Elric, direct descendent of Fullmetal, notices something /off/ about the global temperature...

(okay maybe not temperature, but there's surely /something/ interesting you could do with a far future/energy draining situation?)
