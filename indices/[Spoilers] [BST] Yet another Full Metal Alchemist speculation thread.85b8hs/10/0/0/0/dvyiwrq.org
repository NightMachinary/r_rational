Alchemy is much harder than that, though. Notice that Edward cannot repair or replace his automail (and not just because he needs the arm to do it). Understanding automail likely requires as much work as understanding alchemy, by the time you have the comprehension to start making them alchemically you already know how to do so manually.

Most alchemists need circles, and different transmutations usually need different circles, which increase in complexity with the complexity of the transmutation. Notice that military alchemists bring their circles into battle with them, and that limits their versatility. Those few who don't need circles are the most effective and versatile of them all, but the price of that versatility is as terrible as it is secret.

Note also that there appears to be little tradition of alchemy education and publishing. The books either only cover the basics (and remain almost impenetrable for all that) or are encrypted and secret. After that, the most useful books on alchemy are controlled by the state and only available to alchemists in their employ, which tends to filter up-and-coming alchemists into the state and thus military. The Elrics had to beg and grovel to get a teacher, and Izumi had the same problem when she was learning.

While we do see non-military alchemists, they are extremely rare. There seem to be whole towns who don't see an alchemist until one from elsewhere shows up, and they're usually military when they do. Liore, for instance. When you count Father Cornello, there's still only one. The 2003 series had more about than Brotherhood, and even then the Elric's had to seek them out. [[#s][Spoilers]] There appears to be a significant barrier to entry when it comes to learning the science, both in ability and accessibility.

It appears to be that labour is cheap but powerful human weapons are not. It should also be noted that Amestran leadership is not interested in conquering people by offering a tasty carrot [[#s][spoilers]]
