Wait... what?

/Alphonse/ is an unintentional transhumanist already, from the very beginning of the series.

There are shown to be not one but at /least/ three ways to cheat death.

Also, I think it was GameTheory or FilmTheory (same people) who did a piece and figured out one reason the Elrics (and everyone else's) human transmutation didn't work--the elements and measures they listed for a human were flat out *wrong*, and its entirely possible that whatever they create would either not be alive or die in horrible pain as its body was unable to sustain itself.

Also, the Panda was a subtle clue that the nation they borrowed from was China, but others seem to have made this point.

I find it surprising that you're totally OK with the series up until that point involving Greed. If it were actually /rational/, things would have diverged quite a bit before that point. For that matter, their world would look quite a bit... different. For all the cool bits about Alchemy we see during the series, it seems to be monopolized solely for military purposes. The main question there is... /why/?

If I were doing some rational re-write, there would have to be a lot of baseline rules covered first, things that would need to be explained. For instance... can anyone do Alchemy with just a bit of study, or is there some necessary "spark" to be able to do so? (Somewhat spoilery, the end of Brotherhood shows that it is indeed possible for a human to have zero potential for Alchemy.) Why is it that the Elrics start with this rare collection of books and never think about it when they get older, including the fact that both can do Alchemy? Do common people know of the concept of Equivalent Exchange, or just low tier Alchemists? Is it a thing they use to explain it whilst it is being wrong, or is it simply the outmost 'layer' of knowledge that is safe to share? Why do some Alchemical constructs have those weird 'strips' in them while others don't? (I have a theory here) Who came up with the "arrays" and how do they work, what is the significance of the 'points', etc? What /is/ the gate, really, and why is it inscribed with the Sefirot?

FMA is a great series, but due to the 'fuzzy' softness of its system, a lot of the plot can be confusing at times, and there are a /lot/ of unanswered questions.
