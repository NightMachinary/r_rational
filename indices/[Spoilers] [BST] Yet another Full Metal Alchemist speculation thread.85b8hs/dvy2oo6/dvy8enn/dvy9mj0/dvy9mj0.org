I'd be totally OK with the *huge spoiler block info you posted* were it not for the fact that it's shown there are /non-military/ Alchemists in the world, too.

The State Alchemists aren't all military. Shou Tucker was an example--while he became a State Alchemists, he never was military, but worked to create Chimeras. Other non-affiliated Alchemists exist, such as Father Cornello from the initial episodes, who are not under State control. Plus, some like Alphonse, are tolerated to exist due to being related to others who are a part of the military or government.

But a single person who focused on making things out of a single substance wouldn't have to study nearly as much, and could be very focused as a result. Blacksmiths who use Alchemy to form tools and horseshoes and the like. Road workers who make tessellated cobblestones as far as they need. Architects who create buildings or entire cities out of stone or clay bricks, etc.

This is somehow absent from the military as well. Oh, you want trenches? We can do trenches with little berms on the side in /minutes/ as opposed to hours. The Amestrian army would be like a supercharged version of the Romans... wherever they march, small outposts and castles are left in their wake where they garrison their troops. Conquering other people is a lot easier if they are willing to submit, and being able to build new homes, instantly dig wells, provide irrigation to fields, etc, makes them a lot more accepting of your rule, especially if all you want from them is food and the willingness to shelter your troops when they are passing through (in the barracks your army creates itself).

If you're worried that people couldn't be raised under good enough situations to develop even this basic level, remember that real-world militaries have technical specialists too.

Clearly the Elrics had a great head start. That's something they don't seem to really recognize in the series.
