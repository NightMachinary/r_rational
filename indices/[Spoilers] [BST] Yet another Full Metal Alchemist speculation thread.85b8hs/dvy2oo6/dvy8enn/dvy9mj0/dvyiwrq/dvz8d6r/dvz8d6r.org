We don't /know/ how hard it is, because it's never /shown/ how hard it is. We see a couple of 8(?) year olds do it, though, so it can't be /that/ difficult.

Edward transforms his automail all the time, at least for the blade and back again. He also turns it into a solid piece if it gets too damaged. I contend he doesn't modify it because he would have to know all the details. Even so, making them manually takes a /very long time/. Making things Alchemically takes a /very short time/. If nothing else, Edward should teach Winry the most basic of Transmutation principles so that she can turn her steel screwdriver into one of another size when necessary.

We don't know the complexity of the circles or even /how/ they work, aside from the points mean something. This is never touched on, and is one way in which the system is 'soft' magic. We just have to take it on faith that such is how it works.

I did notice that military Alchemists take their circles into battle with them. It's /irrational/ to complain that it limits their versatility when all they need to do is carry an extra set of gloves with new circles, or a /book made of sheets of metal with imprinted circles on it/ and flip to the page they need.

The "most useful" books are the kind that make killing attacks. However, knowing how to move a large mass of earth, sculpt stone, or spin wires from a lump of metal all have very practical uses and are much simpler than turning a human into a bomb.

The Elrics had to beg and grovel as a teacher because /very few other people could teach them/. They were sufficiently powerful that they were easily in the top 10% of Alchemists in the entire country. There were /lots/ of books, but that's a /lot/ of information to get through, and none of it is practical. But when you have someone with real-life experience with different techniques you learn a /lot/ more. Indeed, as that person knows what you /don't/ know and even things you don't know to /ask/, they can be invaluable. Plus, Izumi isn't part of the military, which means she /knows techniques that they don't/ because she didn't specialize in killing people.

Thank you for mentioning the rare non-military Alchemists. That is, indeed, an irrational thing within the setting, and something that should be adjusted on any /rational/ re-writes. It would profit the kingdom greatly to be able to indulge in large-scale public works or crafting useful to their military objectives, but we rarely see it in favor of "new ways to kill people creatively".

If the leaders don't understand the use of the /carrot/, then they are stupid leaders. If the people of your country /are a useful resource/, it behooves you to have /as much of that resource as possible/. Randomly killing off all your own dudes is bad, but so is being forced to slaughter your enemies where each life lost is one less person to help you achieve your goal.

I must say, though, that I appreciate your responses. With each new 'defense' of the original, I see new flaws that I did not see before, and the mental image of what an actual /rationa/ Amestris would look like becomes ever more clear.
