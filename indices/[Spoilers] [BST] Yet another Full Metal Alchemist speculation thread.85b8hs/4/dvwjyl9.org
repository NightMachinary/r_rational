Father was really just a pathetic creature who just wanted to chase his desires and understand the world outside the Gate.

In Envy we see that his underlying motivation was envy of humanity and what makes people special. Envy wasn't just the emotion, he was Fathers envy and Father was most envious of humans. In the same way, Greed wasn't just someone who wanted power over everything, what he wanted most of all was what Father wanted. Fathers dealings with Hohenheim, his adoption of the name "Father" and his envy of humans show that Greeds main desire makes total sense.

Remember, Father isn't incapable of wanting. He still wants power and to become a god even after excising Greed, he only excised his most human emotions that could hinder his goal.
