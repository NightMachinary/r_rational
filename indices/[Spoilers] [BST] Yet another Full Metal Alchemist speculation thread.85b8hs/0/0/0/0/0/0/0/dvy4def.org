Eastern Alchemy seems more powerful than Amestrian one in fact. I don't know how far Father's power extends, but it's said that Amestris is one of the most advanced countries in terms of alchemy knowledge-wise, so perhaps that offsets the lack of raw power.

As for the source, it's clearly stated in the manga. The wiki reports it too:

#+begin_quote
  He uses the pipes to spread the Philosopher's Stone beneath the nation of Amestris. The purpose behind this is to act as a barrier between the tectonic energy of the earth's crust, where Amestrian Alchemy gets its energy from, so that he can stop others from using Alchemy at any time. Doing this, however, has aged his body slightly more than Van Hohenheim, who still looks identical from the time of Xerxes. This process, however, can be countered by a "Reverse Transmutation Circle" , which is a concept Scar's brother had figured out by combining Xingese Alkahestry and Alchemy practices. Alkahestry was unaffected by Father's barrier because Alkahestry uses energy from the Earth's chi instead, which allows Scar and Mei Chang to continue using their alchemy even when Father blocks Amestrian Alchemy.

So this makes it sound like his only purpose is to be ready to stop it at any time. But when the Reverse Transmutation Circle activates, Edward says something about his alchemy being now /more/ powerful. It's explained at the beginning of chapter 106:

At page 10 Edward says:

  Incredible! I'm barely even trying and I'm making these awesome attacks!
#+end_quote

suggesting he's in fact stronger now that the "cushion" has been removed. May as well be that his higher ability is what allows him to tap deeper into the new source of energy though, and common alchemists would not be able to.
