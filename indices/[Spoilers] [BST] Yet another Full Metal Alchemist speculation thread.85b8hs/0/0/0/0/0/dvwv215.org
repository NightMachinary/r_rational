No, sorry, this is not how it actually works, check it out. Even more spoilers: Father's Philospher Stone acts as a /dampener/: it does not fuel alchemy, rather, it restricts the flow of energy they can access. He can increase the output to stop it altogether. But when the final battle happens, there are two reverse giant alchemic circles that get activated. One, designed by Hohenheim, cancels the process of Philosopher Stone creation and revives all the Amestrians sacrificed during Father's ritual. And the other, designed by Scar's brother, disrupts Father's energy and allows alchemists to access freely the true source, which means that their alchemy actually becomes far more powerful.
