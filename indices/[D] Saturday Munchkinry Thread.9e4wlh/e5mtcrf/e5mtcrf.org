Consider a DnD game with a theme similar to rocks fall, everyone dies, of DM vs the player. Here it's a simulationist world and the DM is not allowed to contradict themself or they lose. On the other hand, if there is any fact about the world that the players haven't searched for, then the DM is free to change it however they wish. Players must counteract this by collecting information (in-world) and putting the DM on the spot to demand information and prevent the DM from later adding threats Ad-hoc.

challenges:

1. There must be some other limitation on the DM so they can't start the game with an inbound meteor, etc, etc. What limitations can we put that will maintain the spirit of the game? Some variation of 'all problems can be solved'?

2. What strategies will each side employ? Eg. players could keep a checklist of things to confirm before a mission, what would be on it?
