I think this is a matter of one person cuts the cake, the other chooses the slice.

/First challenge/ - Only one limitation: Do the players consider the death fair?

This is deliberately flexible. The softer the rules the weaker the lawyers and the stronger the juries.

Not is it fun, not is it logical... is it /fair/? This was always what jostled around in my head while I was plotting to do something to one or another of my players that they were really going to hate. The best way is to have it be their own faults, to trick them into making a choice that led to the things they would hate. But if it had to happen outside their control? Match backstory they've created, match it as an echo of something they've already experienced in-game... and as disaster develops, make them perfectly aware that /they should know better/.

The players decide if it's fair. The cake is cut as best the DM can.

/Second challenge/ - Assuming the above system: Pay attention.

The DM pays attention to holes in the players' defenses, launches light warnings and luring them into false senses of security. Lots of false senses of security. The DM lobs some softballs in order to make them think they're dodging bullets. Some of these are giant softballs, and they are set on fire. Wow that was fair, but we survived it, the players say. The DM learns what each player thinks "fair" means. The DM learns what each player tends to pay attention to. Then the DM kills them all at once so nobody feels especially self-righteous and singled-out.

Easier to accept "We're all dead, let's play something else" than "I'm dead, good luck guys."

Players need to be be on the lookout for clues, because the DM will be dropping clues. When there are clues, the players must REACT to them. Also, give the DM as little information as possible while demanding as much information as possible. Each player only has to think of one character, the DM has to keep track of everything. Push that imbalance hard.

...

Eh, doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me if that's all there is. Still, it works reasonably well as a small scale way to implement interesting story beats and stakes when players know the all the D&D rules.
