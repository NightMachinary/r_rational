  There must be some other limitation on the DM so they can't start the game with an inbound meteor, etc, etc. What limitations can we put that will maintain the spirit of the game?

The game designer has provided an introductory paragraph that the DM has to read aloud at the start (and thus they can't contradict it). This sets the scene and establishes a normal setting where the air isn't made of acid or anything. A normal, completely mundane bird is chirping nearby, and it will definitely not die within the next week (ruling out a lot of large scale catastrophes). (Maybe you want a clause in there that makes the players not want to kill the bird to contradict the DM, but maybe not.)
