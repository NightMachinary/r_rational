.. Time does not progress much at all beyond the earliest reset point of the oldest people with the power? Seriously, that seems the obvious consequence. Nothing much happens, because time does not get to move forward beyond the earliest someone rewinds it, so earth gets to relive the first couple of years of the twentieth century a whole lot. Interesting way to end the world. If it is a quantum thing where the timelines split.. uhm. Do people who travel back disappear from the timeline they leave?
