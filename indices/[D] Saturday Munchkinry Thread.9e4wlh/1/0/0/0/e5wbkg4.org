Which means anyone even slightly older than you is an ancient burnout - or a corpse. (because you do not get to keep any memories until you are the oldest person still willing to use the power), and if you are doing long loops, then just about /everyone/ except you is a burnout or corpse. - If you commit to only resetting at your death, then you only reach reset once everyone willing to pull the trigger earlier than that is done with life.
