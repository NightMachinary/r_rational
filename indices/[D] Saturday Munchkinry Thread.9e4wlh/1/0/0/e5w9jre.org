Well, I thought in terms of there being one timeline that is rewrited forward from rewind point, but even if there are a lot of them, it matters not, because people don't physically travel anywhere - only their memory travels, much like in Steins;Gate (funny thing - when I imagined this mechanic, I did not think of Steins;Gate).

I suppose that whatever personality any person have, they cannot live through infinite rewinds, because like in 10^8th lifetime they get bored and either allow the world to progress or allow themselves to expire by not rewinding when they die.
