My answer to challenge 1: Any threat the DM throws at the player must take *at least one turn after being introduced* to kill the players - they cannot be 100% blindsided. For instance, the DM cannot say, "A meteor hits you and you die", but they /can/ say, "A meteor will hit you in one turn! You have to do something!"

In addition, any threat the DM creates must have a *reasonable solution given the time frame*. So, if the meteor is approaching, the party must, given what's available to them, have a way to stop the meteor before it hits them that has already been introduced. This would allow for serial escalation of threats (maybe something the players already saw and overcame can be used in some fashion, like using a giant monster to block the meteor) or anything they've already found like a shield spell can be used.

What makes it reasonable? Well, the DM could in theory come up with a meteor which they decide can only be stopped if one member of the party stands on one foot, licks a kitten, and then quotes the entirety of the DM's favorite song, but that's obviously not something they could ever come up with in time unless very blatant hints were dropped earlier.

Challenge 2:

How would the party take on this challenge? They'd come up with anything they can think of that would help against basically any threat, and start demanding answers of the DM about it. The more they know about the setting, the better, after all! It would be especially helpful to ask about absolutes, such as, "Does this spell block all attacks?" It would help lead the DM to contradict themselves if they accidentally say, "The monster has a special attack which bypasses the spell!" because now it no longer blocks all attacks and the players win.

The DM, on the other hand, would be best served by coming up with as many obscure exceptions as possible. They can change anything the players don't ask about, to be sure, but having a contingency in place before the game even starts would likely serve them even better. In the case of the monster with a special attack, the DM can respond to their question with, "It can block nearly any kind of attack" - emphasis on /nearly/. The more loopholes and exceptions to the rule the DM has on hand, the better.
