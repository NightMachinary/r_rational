All people in the world (two variants - either currently living or born after some point, like 1950, even if they are dead now) gain the power to return their current consciousness and memory to any point of their life up to current moment, overwriting their previous state. They all become aware of this power, and can use it instantaneously, including the moment of death, however sudden it might be. After that point on your "individual timeline" where you become aware you can always use it, but you can't teach it to other people if you go back. Unless they are already a time-traveled future version, in which case they will already know it. Going to the future is not possible, you'll need to age with normal speed again. You'll need to specify either the date or event you remember to go back. If you change anything in your life (and you most likely will, because you won't remember all the details if you don't have perfect memory (your memory degrades with "normal" speed depending on your current brain state)), the "history" changes. Everyone can change history absolutely independently, noone remembers whatever was in other people futures if they were affected by changes. For example, if you return to the point before you meet someone with whom you had relationship, and don't go to the place where you met, they won't remember you at all.

It could be imagined as this: we have some state of the world. It develops from the this state until someone decides to go back. After this the world develops from the moment that person returned to, but with them making possibly different choices. If someone wants to live an endless hedgehog day, noone will notice that, because as long as they let go of it in less than infinite number of loops, the world will move on.

I'm interested in how the world would change and what kind of society it would stabilize on, and also how you could exploit that power. The mundane uses are pretty obvious - you can rectify any mistake, if you want to spend time aging again. Looking deeper, you can have pretty much endless life experiences, if you are okay with becoming young again and again, though eventually you'll forget most of them.

The most difficult thing is the conflict between individuals. If someone shoots you, you can go back for a couple seconds and dodge, but then they will go back and adjust their aim, and so on. Someone old could go back and try to take over the world, but when the time will catch to the "moment of awareness", someone will immediately go back and try to stop them, unless they've build the perfect totalitarian society with mind control. The only way to prevent someone from messing with your plans is to change their mind on the problem before they wanted to oppose you, or to kill them before they get the power for the first time, but then you will deal with consequences of your crime.

I suppose at first some people will instantly go far back and become millionaires with future knowledge and technologies, but then more and more people will do that, so it should balance out somewhere. Also every possible technology and knowledge will eventually drift back to the time of conscious age of the oldest person.

How the world will look eventually, when everyone is content with state of things?
