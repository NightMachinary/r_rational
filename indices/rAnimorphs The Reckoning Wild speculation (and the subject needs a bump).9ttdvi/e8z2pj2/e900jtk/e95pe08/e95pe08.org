Very rushed? You bet. It was a long day, and the speculation happened over a lawn mower, and didn't get posted for three or six hours or so.

Re: Aftran, I didn't read the core series, but I wanted to -- but that was an *expensive* proposition. The outrage over Aftran's murder in R!Animorphs and their progressive leanings here make it sound like a thing that you could sell.

Day labor: Correct-ish. $20 an hour will convince plenty of people that hosting an alien brain-slug is a good side hustle or a good way to keep a roof overhead.

Nurses: My father has said schedule. It's grueling, but hosts don't have to be worked as hard as nurses, and Yeerk health care plans can be rather more generous.

Yes!

It's not, but I can see a trajectory where this ends up in a United Federation of Planets, with a little good fortune.

I don't expect it to go there, 'cause of certain agents whose actions are contrary to the goal of a happy coexistence, but I have a lot of fun in the what-ifs.
