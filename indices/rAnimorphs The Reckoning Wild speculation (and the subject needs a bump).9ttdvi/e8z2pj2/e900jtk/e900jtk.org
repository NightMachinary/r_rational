Just taking a wild guess at what the poster is thinking, but I think they were very rushed and posted their thoughts about what the Yeerks should do to make themselves appealing to the humans.

[[http://animorphs.wikia.com/wiki/Aftran_942][Aftran]] is the Yeerk who convinced Cassie in the original series that Yeerks were individuals instead of faceless crowds. Naming a university after Aftran is probably something about researching ways to help Yeerks integrate into human society.

Day labor is a reference about how there are already people who can be hired for only a day at a time and how they can simply host Yeerks for just a day instead of the full three days.

Nurses are people who often work for 12 hours for three days and get the other four days in the week off and Yeerk hosts can have a similar work week.

The rest is about what Yeerks can teach and help humanity in return for having available hosts.

Basically this post is a very compressed stream of thoughts about how Yeerks and humans can join as one social group, but I don't really see how this post is relevant to the latest chapters in Reckoning since the two races aren't anywhere near to peace talks.
