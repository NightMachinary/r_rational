Does anyone else think it's odd that he wants to evacuate the village before further farming the crack? The logic that it's all in the middle of nowhere would seem to suggest the villagers are in little danger anyway, and if they leave the crack it'd be easy for it to get claimed by some other group or something.

It feels more like a narrative choice to prevent powerleveling with a buffed Rain than anything else.
