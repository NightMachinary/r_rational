Good question. Related questions: "Why not use the 'dark arts' to persuade others and further my agenda?" and "Why not give absolute power to someone you know will use it for good?"

For the dark arts, I'm going to use persuasive lying as an example that stands in for the whole.

In the case of lies, lying damages your credibility when you are caught and damages discourse in general when you aren't. Lies have a cost even when they are believed. That cost is making the image of the world less clear to all, and making anything that improves ones understanding of the world a threat. Choosing the truth as an enemy is a poor move, especially since the truth becomes stronger over time.

For absolute power, the inability to take back the consequences of the decision are potentially very costly. You have to be very, very certain that you can trust someone before you give them absolute power. Probably more certain than your own ability to judge things permits you to be. Absolute certainty isn't possible and you might be wrong.

The reasons we don't do those things are also reasons to not join a cult, even if you think they are otherwise good.
