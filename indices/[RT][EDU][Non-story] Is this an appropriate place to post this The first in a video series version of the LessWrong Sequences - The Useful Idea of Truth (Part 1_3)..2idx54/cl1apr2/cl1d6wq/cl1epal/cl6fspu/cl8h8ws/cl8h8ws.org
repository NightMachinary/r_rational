  Originally, The Useful Idea of Truth had even better art. Then someone noticed that the human figures were all male and instead of changing some to female, we got those ugly stick fiures :(

+Is there a source for this, and do the original images exist somewhere?+ ([[http://lesswrong.com/lw/eqn/the_useful_idea_of_truth/7jwy][Source found before posting,]] though I wish I could still see the originals.)

Then you'll be happy to know that the most consistent criticism of the video has been in regards to the text, so that is what I'll be thinking most about moving forward. I do worry that fans of this style of text are merely being quiet, because disliking specific things is more comfortably talked about than liking specific things, but not so much I wont tone down or even remove the text in future videos.
