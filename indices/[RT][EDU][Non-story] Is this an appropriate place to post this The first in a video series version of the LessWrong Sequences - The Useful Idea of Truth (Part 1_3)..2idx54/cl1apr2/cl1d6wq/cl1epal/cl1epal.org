I didn't have the skill. It's not a flattering answer, but it's the most true answer.

The Useful Idea of Truth has a lot of great art, and reusing the ideas (and in some case the images themselves) from that post really helped me make my initial progress in the video. I've learned a lot from doing that, and am now more comfortable with Photoshop, After Effects, and my own artistic ability. Future video will likely feature much more visual assets completely original to me, and will be prioritized more so by importance, than by difficulty.
