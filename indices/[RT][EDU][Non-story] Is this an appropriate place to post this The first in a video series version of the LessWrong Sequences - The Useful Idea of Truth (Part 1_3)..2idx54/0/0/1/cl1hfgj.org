Generally speaking, the recommended reading order for the Sequences starts with /Map and Territory/, since it introduces a lot of the concepts taken for granted in /Mysterious Answers for Mysterious Questions/. The first post of /Map and Territory/ is "The Simple Truth", but, since that's a long-winded story that kinda beats around the bush, a lot of people recommend Eliezer's more recent "The Useful Idea of Truth" to get the same point across. It also has the added benefit of coming prepackaged with nice visuals that can be used for animations.

OP is following this route through the Sequences.
