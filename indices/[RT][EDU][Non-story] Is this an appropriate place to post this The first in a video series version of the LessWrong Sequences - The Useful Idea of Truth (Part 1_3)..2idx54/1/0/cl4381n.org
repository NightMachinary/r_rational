Thank you for the feedback. I expect my voice to come through more naturally as I gain experience, and is something I'll be sure to maintain awareness of. I only hope to one day have a spoken voice as beautiful and compelling as Stephen Fry's.

I used a combination of Photoshop CS and After Effects CS4, and [[http://vimeo.com/26079113][this tutorial]] is essentially comprehensive information of everything I knew when I started. Specific stuff, like keyboard shortcuts, how to organize my workflow and work area, specific plugin settings, and render options are things I learned and looked up as I went. If you're making something like this I'd be happy to answer specific questions as they arise and I'm available to do so.
