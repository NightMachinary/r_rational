So I'm a bit late, but I just had a really neat idea: "everyone is now able to fly."

I know, I know, not /tha/ original. Here's the crunch:

- flight speed is just about 30mph (not exactly, but close enough)
- people fly in a non-aerodynamic fashion. It's like everyone has gimballed thrusters pointing them where they want to go, although g forces are applied evenly across the body.
- people accelerate based off of how badly they want to go in some direction, with a maximum acceleration of 3 g's. This acceleration is rarely reached without extreme willpower, however.
- people know how to fly reflexively, so it's impossible to accidentally injure themselves by flying (i.e. by accelerating too hard and blacking out)
- flying follows the laws of thermodynamics (it takes energy) but requires minimal energy expenditure beyond what's directly spent performing work (in a physics sense).
- flying feels like a relatively mild form of exertion, and exercises muscles in much the same way as swimming.

I do have a reason in mind for why everyone can fly, but while important, it's not germane to this post.

Now, I'm sure there are ways to munchkin individuals flyings (for example, most individuals can hold up their own body weight by their arms, so upside down people can transport stuff that weights quite a bit if they accelerate slowly). But what I'm more interested in are what you think could be potential societal fallout from this happening, from the immediate (a lot of uber drivers just lost their job) to the mid term (the military needs to reevaluate its tactics) to the long term (imagine a company with the slogan "park here, go anywhere." Cars are still useful on highways, but not as much in the city, so they have massive parking garages right after highway exits where people drop off cars, so they can fly the final leg of their trips)

What do you guys think?
