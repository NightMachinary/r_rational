Skirt and kilts become a very risky option, and are hardly ever worn. Some religions decide flying is wrong, or wrong for women and/or children, at least. Toddler reins become very important :-) Turns out children can go way faster than most adults because they just WANT things more Everyone with upstairs windows suddenly needs more security Can you stay still in mid air? If so lot of 'dead' space in tall buildings become useable Lots of no-fly zones, including military and commercial airspace, but also over nature reserves (don't want to upset real birds) Many fewer people want to live in city centres, whereas previously hard to reach suburbs become more attractive How far can you fly without tiring? You could cross the English Channel, which would create interesting immigration issues, but not cross an ocean, probably, so there would be a LOT of jobs guarding that airspace, at least short to mid term, before governments maybe learnt to relax a bit (or not) I guess Trump's wall is no use now...
