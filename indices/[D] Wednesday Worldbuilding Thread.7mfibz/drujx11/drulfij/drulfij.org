There are probably new types of clothing, from shoes that are guaranteed to not fall off your feet while in flight, to jackets that insulate against the winds present at 30mph, to full-body raincoats, to packs that people put on to transport materials, to clothes that preserve modesty.

There will be a new set of norms around flying, along with a new set of laws to enforce those norms in the cases where they're about safety, privacy, trespass, etc. Unfortunately for the legal systems of the world, these new laws will probably be grafted onto the old laws in ways that aren't quite what you'd choose if you were making laws from scratch.

It's hard to get precise data on commute times, but my guess is that housing prices drop in major metropolitan areas and rise in the suburbs, since you're removing one of the sources of rush hour gridlock and consequently shortening commute times. (By the laws of traffic, this will not actually cause there to be less traffic, since lowering the disincentive to drive will cause more people to drive until you've reached capacity again.)
