Barring severe mishaps, Patreon amounts don't tend to go /down/ on a 3-month rolling average, not until a work is completed. So in fact, that makes the comparison to AlexanderWales, e.g., worse.

As far as I know, nobody is claiming that Delve is better than Worth The Candle or Worm/Twig/Pale. Nor is anybody claiming that RoyalRoad rankings calculate quality. I would summarize much of this thread as "Delve may not be good, but it's an amateur's work" - "Delve is overrated and should be held to the standard of other Webfiction" - "Delve isn't really making that much money" - and now what I've contributed "Delve is making a lot of money compared to high quality web fiction".

My synthesis: Delve is making significantly more than it "should" as a measure of its quality, and criticizing it's quality along those lines is not unfair.

I will agree that you can explain the mechanism's by looking at its position on Royalroad etc., but excusing the quality by "you get what you paid for" fails badly.
