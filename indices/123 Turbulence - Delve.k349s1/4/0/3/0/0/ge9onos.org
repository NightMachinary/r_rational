It's specifically about relationships between humans. Usually about partner flirting with someone else and feeling threatened and other negative feelings by that or something similar. It does not translate that simply. Not just romantic stuff though, a kid can feel a brother being a favorite so he gets like that.

Feelings when your lizardbrain thinks someone is replacing you in your relationship.
