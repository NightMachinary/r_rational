On the Patreon /there could/ be a blue in 3-4 chapters. (last Chapter was 131) If it doesn't happen in December, I think a /very high/ likelihood it happens in January for Patreon. I think the prices are reasonable. I typically give $20 to support a novel for the year for whatever it gets me...for Delve that is 8 months, lol.
