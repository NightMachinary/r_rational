It's really not a good money making formula, I don't know how it works. You get a one-time advantage so you'd expect people to just pay once and then stop. They fall back from where they got by paying, and I guess since the people paying are the most devoted it makes some sense that they don't want to stop being ahead for any time. I don't know, the model annoys me either way.
