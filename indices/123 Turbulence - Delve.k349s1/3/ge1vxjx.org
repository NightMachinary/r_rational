Can I get a blue-watch going on the posts? Like can someone who subs to the advance chapters give me a 1-10 on the “blueness” of the most recent patreon chapter?

I *really* can't wait for the chapter that is 8 before he gets a lie to just have a random 300 comments. And just every week after that it's the same.

Also I just checked the patreon and the author is pulling $4k per month on this lmao. The definition of a cash cow with the pace this novel is at. Dude is living his best life 😂😂😂
