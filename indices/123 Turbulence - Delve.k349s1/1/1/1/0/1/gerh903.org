I agree- the whole democracy thing is actually from his selfish motivation to feel better about being the leader. But he set it up badly- Democracy without checks is just Populism. I agree with user Ternal's pirateship comment, and it's not going to be good for a long term Guild, but he'll work on it.

I'm expecting to see pushback from his brand new ideas that go against 'common knowledge' and him getting voted out for some traditionalist charismatic newcomer on the first roadblock type thing he hits. Maybe he makes a big mistake and even wants to not be in charge- but that will change when he sees that the super sure 'leaders' are way worse than his worst.
