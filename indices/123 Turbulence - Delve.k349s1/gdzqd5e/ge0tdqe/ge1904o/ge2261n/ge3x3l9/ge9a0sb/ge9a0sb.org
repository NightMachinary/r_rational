<self-plug> May I recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30636/the-patchwork-realms-arrival][The Patchwork Realms]] </self-plug>? The protagonist is a good dog who gets isekai'd into a fantasy world where he immediately lucks into a Skill that gives him sapience and some enormous physical bonuses. He promptly finds some people and protects them on their way to a city filled with demons, aliens, and neighborhoods that wandered in from another reality.
