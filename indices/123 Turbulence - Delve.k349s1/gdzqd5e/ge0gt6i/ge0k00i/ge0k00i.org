Actually I think having Rain learn the language was a really neat part of the early portion of the story. It added some extra struggle and his quick learning was a good demonstration of the effects of Clarity. Also it's just not something you see in isekai, it was a nice variation.

From an in-universe perspective, since he kinda cheated at learning the language it makes some sense he keeps adding English to it. But out-of-universe it really is annoying at this point.
