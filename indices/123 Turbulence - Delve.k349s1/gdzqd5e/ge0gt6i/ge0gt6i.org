To some extent people try to translate idioms word for word (i used to do this myself), but that's mostly a thing with very new speakers who just don't know any of the new expressions and are translating word for word mentally anyway. Rain is supposed to be at the level of native speaker, much beyond that.

I don't even understand why the author bothered to have a separate language in the first place. Just have everyone in the new universe speak English, it's not any weirder than it being full of humans.
