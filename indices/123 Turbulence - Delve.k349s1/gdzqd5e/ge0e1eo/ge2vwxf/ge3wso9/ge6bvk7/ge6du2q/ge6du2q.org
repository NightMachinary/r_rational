I would be fine with the number crunching if we actually got a lot of information about the system. Like I could look at a bunch of classes and think about what I would do with that system. Half of all time spent on real RPGs is in character creation after all. But we actually /don't/ get a lot of information.

And yeah the key issue with Delve is the time it takes to put out what is essentially a tiny amount of overall content. I think of it from a Patreon angle personally. Like perhaps the story has an end date and the author doesn't have anything else in the pipe for Patreon so they have to string out the existing story over as long a time as possible to keep that sweet, sweet 4k$ a month coming in.

There's nothing in the story that is so difficult to write well, especially since the author is not a great writer, that justifies the pace of the release.
