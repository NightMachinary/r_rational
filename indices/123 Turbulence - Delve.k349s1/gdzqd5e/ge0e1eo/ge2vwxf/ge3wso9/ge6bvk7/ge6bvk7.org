Yup, I think you made me realize what my actual main problem with this story is.

I've read stuff with worse prose, equally bad characters, more boring worlds, etc etc. But those stories at last feel honest about what they are. I like turning my brain off sometimes and binge-reading fast paced, fun, lower quality stuff. But not even that is possible with Delve because, 1. It isn't a fun story, and 2. The author only puts out a few thousand words per week, and half of those words are the same repetitive number crunching we've seen from the start.

The author of the Wandering Inn for example puts out 40k-50k+ words per week consistently, at much higher quality while always being a fun read. Delve puts out what...like 10% of that? So the story is not only poorly written and extremely slow, the content releases are so tiny that I can't even read it as a guilty pleasure.
