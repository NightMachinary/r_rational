Ok, I'm cancelling my patreon for this fic. Why? I realized I hate Rain. I detest this wacky, zany little fucker, still throwing out nonsensical idioms, expressions, analogies, metaphors and proverbs *months* after traveling to another dimension and while /speaking another fucking language/.

(As an aside, I'm convinced the author is one of those monolingual cretins who can't even fathom what it's like to speak another language. Never even paused to think about it, assumes it's like using Google translate in your brain.)

I've never seen an asshole use so many expressions in common speech before! Imagine Rain going through the trouble to pick out words in another language to form sentences that are tantamount to gibberish to every other person around him. AND WHEN THERE'S NO TRANSLATION HE USES AN ENGLISH WORD, I GUESS??

And for what? So that every other POV character will roll his eyes indulgently and ignore what is in effect an imposition of his rank on his subordinates, because they can't actually call him out? Rains like, "fuck prima noche, I won't fuck your wife on your wedding day, instead I'll exploit our disparity in rank to fuck with your understanding of language as a vehicle for mutually coherent communication."

tl;dr: fuck Rain, fuck the author, and fuck me for not just putting up with this shitty character writing, but */paying for it./*
