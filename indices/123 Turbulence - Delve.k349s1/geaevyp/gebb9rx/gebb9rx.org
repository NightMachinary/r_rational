I suspect Delve posts here are hostile because this sub is offsite and patreon exists. Everyone who really likes/cares about Delve is already months ahead and discussing it on Patreon or discord. Everyone who doesn't care comments on RR.

This skews the people here more towards those who both care and don't like it, which results in a hostile atmosphere.
