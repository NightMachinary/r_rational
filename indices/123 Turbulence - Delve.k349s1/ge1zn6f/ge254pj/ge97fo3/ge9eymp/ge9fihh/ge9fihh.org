Maybe it is easier to write an uberman stomping everything than good dialogue that would be absolutely necessary on this?

But Delve's success shows nothing of the kind. Isn't this recent development? Did you expect a lot of party optimization going in? Maybe when he got a support build, but this far we have had basically none of that until nosw. It has been people that have been available, and they haven't really told anyone their build.
