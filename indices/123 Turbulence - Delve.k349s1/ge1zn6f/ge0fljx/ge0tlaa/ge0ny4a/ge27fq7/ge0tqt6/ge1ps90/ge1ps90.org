Because in the last few months he has been the ignored, abused outcast and has encountered 3 different leaders that abused everyone under them just because they can, and when taking the leader mantle he is trying hard to signal to others and especially to himself he's not going for the same thing, even if the situation is pushing him hard towards autocracy?

If you think educating for democracy in theory while actually falling into telling everyone what to do is hypocrisy, I'm not sure you appreciate that letting people under your leadership find their way (while still coordinating with the larger group) is /much harder/ and a totally separate set of skills than either education or basic "go there now" leadership.
