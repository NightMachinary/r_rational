I think part of the problem is that it has been a few months for rain but nearly 2 /years/ for the readers. Because not only does the author write mediocre prose and less than mediocre characterization but he takes years to do it. Like almost makes me want to read exclusively translated light novel inspired smut because at least those guys put out /content/ while writing mediocrely.
