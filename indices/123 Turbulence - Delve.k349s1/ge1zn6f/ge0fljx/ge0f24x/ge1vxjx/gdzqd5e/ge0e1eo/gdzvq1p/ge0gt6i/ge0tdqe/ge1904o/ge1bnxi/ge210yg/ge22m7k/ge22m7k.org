If we dive into this, it gets worse. Delve has been out 17 months, at 615,302 words that's *36,194* words per month. Worth The Candle comes out in varying batch sizes, but for the past 9 months has averaged *30,337* words per month (note that 9 months was chosen because that's how far back I can easily find data, but the long-term word/month average is /significantly/ faster.)
