So would you like writers to be paid by some central authority by their quality, instead of people paying for stuff they like?

Every paying customer has been earned with these things where you can see the work for free to see if you like it and want to pay or not.

Stuff that helps with getting money is mostly marketing. That is why match 3 games can be top tier in earnings vs what I consider "quality" games.

Ohh yea, and wanna list what is an authoritative list of quality in writing, and how to score it, so that the money could be shared right?
