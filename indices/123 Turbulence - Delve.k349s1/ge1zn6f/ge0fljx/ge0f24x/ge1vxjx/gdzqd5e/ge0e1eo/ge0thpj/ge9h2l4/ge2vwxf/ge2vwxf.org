Overmana mostly improves memory, so Rain has a native level vocabulary, but I don't think the text has claimed he would be a native level speaker. Besides, my dad moved across the country 30 years ago and his old dialect still pops up often. It's silly to be angry at Rain for not abandoning a lifetime of idioms in a few months. I don't even think he should. Dialects are fun. Making people hear idioms for the first time is not a horrible act of cruelty.
