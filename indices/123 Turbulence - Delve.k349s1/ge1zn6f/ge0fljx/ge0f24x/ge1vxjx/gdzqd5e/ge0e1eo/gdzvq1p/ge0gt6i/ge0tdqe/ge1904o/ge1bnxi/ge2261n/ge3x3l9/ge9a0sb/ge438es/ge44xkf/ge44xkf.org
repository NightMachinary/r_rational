Oh, okay.

Lackey is still "good" even if someone else is great. Personally don't like NKJ and also her genre isn't really the same as Lackey. Delve is liked literally only because there are so few crunchy litrpgs with good systems. Delve is not good. But people are starved for options of that particular story type. Also a lot of people got hooked on the early section which was quite different from the arcs people hate.

To borrow some jargon from Sanderson, Lackey and Jemisin both deliver on their promises. Regardless of if which one you like. Delve is/was not delivering on its promises. It is bad because of that. The reason it still has a big following is that people want what it promised and can't get it in many other places. Conversely you can pretty easily get high quality stories that have the same promises as Lackey if you don't like her.
