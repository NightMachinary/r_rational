It's Finnish, and it refers to being jealous.

The etymology for it is unknown, but apparently it traces a convoluted way from archaic English to Norse to Swedish and finally to Finnish. There is some speculation about it referring to pantomime theater plays where certain outfit colors broadcast specific moods.
