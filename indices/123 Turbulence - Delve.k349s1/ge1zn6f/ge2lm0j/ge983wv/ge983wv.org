I disagree with... almost everything in your comment. I think SS is a fine, if unexceptional, writer who is exploring different areas with his story, which is ok and even expected in a serial novel. There's a large cast of side characters who we haven't seen enough of to differentiate, but Rain is nerdy and experimental, Ameliah is calm and competent, Tallheart is grim and terse, Val is impulsive and ambitious, Staavo is inventive and crotchety, Carten is loud and jolly, that swordsman from the last chapter is quiet and dedicated, Velika was rash and bullheaded... that's a solid cast of easily-distinguished characters right there. And then we have the fun and clearly individual side characters of Myth & Reason with their rhyming riddler schtick, Mollo who curses a lot, Dozer who is just adorable, whatever-her-name-is the terrifying Force-magic goldplate, the other whatever-her-name-is the terrifying Mind-magic gold- or platinum-plate...

It seems like you share the opinion of a lot of folks in this sub, which is "Delve stopped being interesting when Rain's numbers stopped going up." Yeah, it's not a story about the protag leveling up anymore, that's become very clear. It's a story about the development of an adventuring company now. Your second-to-last paragraph says "there's been 0... fresh sytems," when we just this chapter got a glimpse of like, 12 new classes, plus the entirely novel mechanic of crafting classes' medium/augment/discipline combinations.

It also seems from your last paragraph that you haven't been reading Delve lately. So can I infer that you just dropped in to shit on the story and air your grievances? I guess that's technically a /valid/ use of the comments section, but it's sure not a /productive/ one.

EDIT: The downvote button is not a "disagree" button, folks. State your issues if you have them.
