Oh, they really dragged their feet about going there. I also misremembered that that we were talking about their first dungeon, but this is Rain's third o(or fourth?) already. I thought they were already at the dungeon at that point. Ok, I'll give that they did notice they need a tank after trying to make Rain go first.

That Rain did not want to go in first to die, is not what I'd call "party management". In fact it looks very mismanaged, without any leadership or competence. And they mentioned "preparation" after that, which is funny.

Val, on the other hand, just was there when they mentioned about going to a dungeon, and said his magic would be perfect. That's not optimization.

If you get your party optimization kicks about writer explaining what a "tank" is and noticing that mages are kinda squishy, great. These are supposed to be like professional adventurers? Ofc author needs to tell readers what the terms mean.

I don't mean to bash this story, I like it a lot. But definitely not for the party optimization. :D
