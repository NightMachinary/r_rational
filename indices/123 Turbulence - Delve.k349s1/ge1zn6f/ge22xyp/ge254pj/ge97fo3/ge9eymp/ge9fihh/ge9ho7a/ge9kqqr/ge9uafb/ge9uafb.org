You're mistaken. Go back to chapter 28 when Rain, Jamus and Val first start making their plans to raid the lair. Jamus and Rain are both insisting they need a proper tank in the face of Val's typical overconfidence. So they did in fact plan out a party composition despite Rain being over three times the lair's level.

And then of course there's the fact they're bringing a light mage to counter a dark lair. The way the mages adapt their strategy to mana abundance. It's not the level of optimisation Rain is doing with Ascension, but even back there it was clear that bringing a balanced party matters.
