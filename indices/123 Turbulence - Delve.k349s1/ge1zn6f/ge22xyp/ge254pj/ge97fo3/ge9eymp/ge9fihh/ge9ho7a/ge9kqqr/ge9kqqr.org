It is teamwork, but did you see any optimization happening? Did they have many choices to choose different classes? Or did they already have a group again and then asked Rain to come too? I checked and it is the second one. They did what they did, haooened to find Rain, and took him with them. They were gonna go anyway. That is not optimization.
