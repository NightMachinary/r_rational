I don't know why, but this novel feels now very different from the beginning. Maybe because at the start it was about learning a new language, figuring out the leveling system and the cultural clash of our world and the delve world.

And I completly loath this democracy company leader shtick that Rain has going."Hur dur, Democracy good, Monarchy bad" while no real democracy is involved in the company and it just works because he has some of the strongest people in the region as friends.

Wacky, funny company leader Rain says funny thing got old really fast.
