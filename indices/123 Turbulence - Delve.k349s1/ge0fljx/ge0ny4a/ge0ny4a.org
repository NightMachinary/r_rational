And honestly, Democracy isn't really the optimal choice if you're an isekai'd person from a modern world. People don't tend to flow with big changes, as our long history can surely attest to.

Especially this, what Rain has is essentially a mockery of democracy anyways, and he brute forces everything he suggests. Might as well just admit that he's the brain and will call the shots right now, as there's nobody else in the group competent and ambitious enough as an alternative. He can change the leadership to a democracy and guide them through that later anyways, having one or two terms to guide the company through the process at the start.

Nobody there even cared about democracy anyways as that world is used to monarchy, so why did Rain even bother with the farce? Now that I think about it, this whole setup feels super contrived and unnecessary.
