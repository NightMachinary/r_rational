Think of ascension as a pirate or mercenary band. It is a pretty close historical parallel - they are a group of professional practitioners of violence only vaguely answerable to anything like a state authority. Lots of these orgs were, historically, quite heavily democratic internally, because conflicts about authority needed a non-violent resolution mechanism very, very badly if the band were to persist. Also, of course, iron discipline while in actual battle.
