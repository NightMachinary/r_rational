I'd say you could see it as far back as the first time Rain went into a dungeon. You had a tank, two DPS mages, a dedicated support. That already puts it above most litRPG in terms of teamwork.

I remember at the time, when rain was knocked off a bridge, everyone was talking about the inevitable cliche of the MC getting separated and coming back stronger. But nope, it's handled sensibly with Ameliah instantly jumping down to get him.
