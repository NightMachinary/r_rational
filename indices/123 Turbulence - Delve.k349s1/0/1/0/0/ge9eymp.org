It is weird how uncommon it is to see party optimisation, which is weird since it's such a fundamental part of MMOs. (Though admittedly no MMO will make, say, an ice build unviable for fire dungeons or anything like that).

And I think Delve's success shows there's a big gap in the market for it too.
