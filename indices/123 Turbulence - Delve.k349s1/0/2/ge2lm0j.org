I think it's mostly the fact that the author is trying to write a more real, fleshed out, slow burner of a story compared to other litrpg's but like... He's just not a good enough writer. The world-building is generic, the entire cast of characters are completely flat and literally everyone speaks in the same voice (you could basically switch around the names of characters in most dialogue at random and no one would notice.), and the main character has one of the most bland and generic personalities I've ever read. Actually I wouldn't even call Rain generic, because that word implies he has traits common to other protagonists. Rain basically has no consistent character traits, he just walks around and acts seemingly at random depending on what the story needs, usually in an eye-rolling, cringey way.

People enjoyed Delve for the cool systems and munchkinry and powers. It was always a slow-burn, but we got to see Rain consistently progress while also getting glimpses of higher power characters in action. But for like...60 chapters now, there's been 0 progression or fresh systems or anything. Just a slow, boring, poorly written story with no signs of improvement.

I decided to drop this series for good when I read a ~20ish chapter batch at once, and at the end of it I looked back and couldn't remember a single moment of enjoyment from reading basically 1/5th of the total story.
