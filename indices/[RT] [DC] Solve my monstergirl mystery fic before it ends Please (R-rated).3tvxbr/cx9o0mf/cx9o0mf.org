My detective is almost at the end of her mystery novel quest, but my readers haven't solved the clues! I don't want to make my detective have unfair insights, but I think her puzzles are solvable. Can the veterans of the Final Exam help her?

You can submit your solutions directly into the current open poll inside the story (as, "Suddenly realize something something") or post them here.
