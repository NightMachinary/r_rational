Sorry about Reimu-immersion issues. Illustrating a story as you go, writing in realtime, requires a character who has /so/ many pictures of her online that you can find her dressed as a detective, or hugging a cat, or watching from the rooftops, or anywhere else the story goes. Touhou characters are good for that.
