Okay, [[#s][but]]

As for the puzzle: [[#s][let's do traditional analysis.]]

In conclusion: no, there is not enough evidence to make strong decision. Everything is shaky, world is insufficiently fleshed out, full extent of various characters' powers is unclear, so it's not clear what is or isn't possible. I have no clear answer. I can give some unsubstantiated guesses, though. [[#s][Here]]
