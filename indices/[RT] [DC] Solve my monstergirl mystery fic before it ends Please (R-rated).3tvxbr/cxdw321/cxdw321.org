[[#s][...Am I the only one who wants to throw in with the Mind Flayer?]]

(Edit: actually, screw it--I'm adding a "Suddenly Realize" choice to this effect.)

Also, have you /been/ to this subreddit before? /Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'./ No, not even if you have a Fourth Wall Observer lampshading it, and no, /not even/ if said character did the same thing in the story from which they originate (I wouldn't know; I've never read it). That's the Nuremberg defense!

I admit, however, that when you revealed what "Ace" stood for, I had to stop reading and /literally yell out loud for a full minute/ in response to the *WEAPONS-GRADE LEVELS OF WIN* in that idea. You combined this with good use of crossover characters, resulting in a story that's got a lot going for it despite being pretty minimalist.
