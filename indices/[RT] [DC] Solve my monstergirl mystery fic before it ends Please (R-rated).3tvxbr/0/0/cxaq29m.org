I started reading it, so far it's okay.

There is a lot of things that irritate me, though. Reimu as a main character most of all. Every time I see picture of Reimu-as-detective, my immersion shatters. Very irritating.

Also, I hope the story starts to advance soon, first two chapters were, while not exactly slow, bland and a little boring.

I find main character boring as well. She reminds me of Spock-style Hollywood Rationalist stereotype.

So, I can only promise this: I will give my honest effort to read this and solve your puzzle, but I cannot promise to not stop reading if I don't find plot engaging. So far it is tolerable, but not great.

I would probably liked it better without asexuality theme. It is hard to relate to main character, so it's hard to enjoy reading.
