  Green Lanterns are forbidden from killing; if you kill someone with a Green Lantern ring, it will immediately shut down. I haven't read it, but I've heard this restriction was removed during one plotline (Sinestro Corps War)

If I recall correctly, Sinestro's aim with said war (or at least one of his aims) was specifically to drive the Corps to a point where the Oans would remove the restriction and thereby be more effective.
