  If "Deals with the Devil" are a thing, nobody will ever use them for altruistic purposes. You can summon demons for altruistic purposes, sometimes, but the traditional Deal is a purely selfish thing.

That happens in Polish legend about Mr. Twardowski. He asked devil for knowledge and magic powers, but then used them to help people. In one version of story thats what saves him from hell.
