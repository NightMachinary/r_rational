  Science-based superheroes can't deliberately attempt to create other superheroes. No replicating freak lab accidents, no sharing powered armour with other people. Mundanes can steal your tech, or attempt to copy your origin; but if they become a hero, they'll never do it again to anyone else.

  If "Deals with the Devil" are a thing, nobody will ever use them for altruistic purposes. You can summon demons for altruistic purposes, sometimes, but the traditional Deal is a purely selfish thing.

Would the Devil accept an altruistic deal? Doing so seems counter to his goals.
