Of course, but they're often so ingrained in the characters it's rare to see them until you really sit down and think about it. I wanted to make a thread dedicated to that element, noting the weird meaningless restricts characters obey beyond the traditional "No immortality", "No ambition", etc. etc.

So another example might be the implicit rule /everyone/ in the X-men unvierse has that the mutant issue can only be addressed monolithically. The guy whose entire power is growing spikes is utterly irrelevant in the discussion about what to do with the kind of person whose brainfarts can exterminate mankind. Yet they're always lumped in together like it's the same category of problem.
