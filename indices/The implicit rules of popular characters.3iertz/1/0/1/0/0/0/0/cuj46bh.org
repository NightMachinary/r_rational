In xmen, mutant children often have related powers. Though all of the main characters are exceptions to this rule.

A shapechanget has a child that can teleport.

A magnetic field controller has a speedster and a demigod(can manipulate reality at will, though frequency is related to effect).

This demigod is scarlet witch, and at one point she simply rewrites reality to fit her whims, and then falls into a coma.
