Oh, yes. I misunderstood you.

However if I knew there was a "mutant /gene/" that was heritable, and caused /unpredictable/ levels of /unknown/ existential destructive capacity ranging from planetary scale mind control to the ability to call colony drops to reality manipulation, I might try to find a way to remove all copies of that gene from the gene pool. After all, it's not like just because Spike is weak, the offspring of him and some other apparently weak mutant would also be weak. The power level is unpredictable and uncontrollable.
