I agree on all points. When I said 'you', I was referring to the poster specifically.

I fully expect that if this happened in real life, politicians would point to the most or least harmless mutants, and use this to support their political positions towards all mutants. And considering how a 'mere' terror attack like 9/11 went down, the first time a mutant DID cause large-scale destruction, it wouldn't go well politically for the mutants, even the ones who wouldn't or couldn't do such things.

I mean, we went to war against Iraq, an entire country, because we thought they MIGHT have WMD's. There are mutants who walk around with that kind of power in their back pocket. (I think. I am not familiar with X-Men, but if we're talking about people on the level of Brainfart, we can turn that down a couple of notches for Pocket Nuke.)
