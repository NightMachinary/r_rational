  Star Trek's Federation implicitly has a rule banning elective cybernetics and beaming enemy crews into space ... the Green Lantern has an implicit rule against creating any construct whose effect would be too brutal (no turning his enemy's brains to mush via razor wire up the nose, no blinding his enemies with retina-destroying brightness, no railgun constructs launching pebbles at mach 3 at the enemy's skull).

The Federation explicitly has laws, albeit unclear ones, against human enhancement - this was a major plot point on DS9 at one point, and is usually strongly implied to be related to the Eugenics Wars.

Green Lanterns are forbidden from killing; if you kill someone with a Green Lantern ring, it will immediately shut down. I haven't read it, but I've heard this restriction was removed during one plotline (Sinestro Corps War) and they began sniping people at superluminal distances and whatnot.
