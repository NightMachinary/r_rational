I think this is from the point of view of non-mutants. If you had to decide what to do about mutants, you would probably treat existential risks (like Brainfart) very differently to someone whose only power is countered by an assault rifle. (like Spike)

What you would likely not do is entangle Brainfart's fate with Spike's, so that if Brainfart was too dangerous to live, Spike needs to be killed too, or if Spike can be set free, so can Brainfart.
