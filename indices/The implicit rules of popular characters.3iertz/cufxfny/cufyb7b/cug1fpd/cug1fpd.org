  they're often so ingrained in the characters it's rare to see them until you really sit down and think about it.

Sometimes, it only becomes clear after you think "If there was a /completely different/ character starting from scratch with the same powers/resources/setup, who thought about things rationally, what might they do with those resources?" It can help with not subconsciously filtering the resulting answers so they fit the personality/MO/backstory of the canon character.

(It can also help to cycle a number of previously existing characters, including ones who tend to use resources to hand in unexpected ways, through the starting position. The result may not be comprehensive, but it can often generate a larger starting set of ideas and lead to some interesting directions of thought.)
