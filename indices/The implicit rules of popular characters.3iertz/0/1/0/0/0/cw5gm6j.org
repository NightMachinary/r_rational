In order to mass produce it yes, but in order to make it in the first place no. In any case, I was being flippant. Duplication rays are such a common plot device in comics that it seemed the obvious solution.

"devalue" in the sense that the price in dollars would go down, but not in the sense that people would derive less value from using it. Computers are hugely cheaper now than they were thirty years ago, but they're also more useful. Keeping the duplication ray private would admittedly allow you to capture a much larger portion of the value created for society, but it wouldn't change the amount of value so created.

While there are potentially dangerous or harmful uses of a duplication ray, I'm much less worried about them than I am about the harmful uses of, say, a nuclear warhead.
