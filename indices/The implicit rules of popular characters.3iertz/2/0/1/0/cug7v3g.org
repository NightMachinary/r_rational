I'm sure I remember someone talking about "The dark days", and how terrible it was to not know who you could trust because they could be under Imperius...

Maybe Moody in the 4th film (can't remember if the same scene occurs in the book) when he was demonstrating the Unforgivables to the class, although saying that he would have been Barty Crouch Jr at the time so maybe not quite as reliable a source as if it had come from actual-Moody.
