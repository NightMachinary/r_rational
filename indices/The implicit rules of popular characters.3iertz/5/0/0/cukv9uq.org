Honestly, a lot of the new introduced characters in that second series felt so superfluous. They were just retooled Percy Jackson with inferior powers-- Jason, Frank, even Leo to some extent, felt redundant. Though Leo could build things, so he was pretty cool.

But so many moments in that series I just wanted to shout ""Percy you have split a Glacier in half, cracked a bridge in half, held up the sky, and fought armies of monsters. There's nothing to fear here (except in Tartarus.)"

My favorite moments of that series were in Tartarus, with Percy and Annabeth, because they were by far the best characters in that series.
