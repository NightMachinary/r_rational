Yeah that's why Tartarus rocked. Percy and Annabeth were both constantly at edge, they were always weakened but still had some great showings, Percy controls poison and other Rivers of Underworld and shows off his dark side, and their relationship is really shown in a great light.

Another thing that bothered me about the second series was Calypso's story-line. I mean, its true that Percy forgot about her, but he had: lost his memory, been killing giants and titans, and had ZERO time off from his mission to save the world. Also, at some point, we should see consequences for the Gods breaking their Styx vows and not freeing Calypso like they promised Percy. Instead it all falls on Percy.

I'm really hoping or the next series to have some sort of massive rebellion against the Gods. Like Percy and campers and random allies uniting against the Gods and killing off the Olympians because they seriously, absolutely, suck. It would also fit with the themes in Greek myth of sons killing fathers, so ....
