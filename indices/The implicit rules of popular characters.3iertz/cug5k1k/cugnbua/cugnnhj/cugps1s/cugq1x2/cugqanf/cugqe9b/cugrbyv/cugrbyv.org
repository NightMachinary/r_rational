I think you're overestimating how many holodeck characters turned sentient. It's a vanishingly rare occurrence, at least until Voyager and its Doctor (who was mass-produced).

I'm not sure whether the holodeck safety protocols have anything to do with it. As far as I know those are only in place to ensure that nothing on the holodeck is lethal (and even then as a convenient plot token to have them malfunction and cause tension).
