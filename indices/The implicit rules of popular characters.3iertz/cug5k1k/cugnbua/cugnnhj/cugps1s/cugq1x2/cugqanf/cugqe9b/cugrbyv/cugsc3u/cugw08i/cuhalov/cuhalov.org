  Despite all these cases I still maintain that it's a rare event.

That's not rare. Out of three installations depicted, it happens by accident in all three. And that's just the cases where it's been noticed. If some WWII soldier hologram woke up half an hour before being gunned down by Lt. Paris in a D-Day sim, would anyone know about it?

My point is that if it's that easy to happen by accident, why aren't they doing it /deliberately/? AI is clearly not /hard/. It doesn't take a lone genius to make a positronic brain to get AI.

The answer is, they've got rules against it.

Someone else in the thread asked why the other, what, hundred and fifty races (species?) in the Federation don't have rules against it. That one doesn't bother me so much. Humans are the ten ton gorilla, that's why.

But then there's the non-Federation races...
