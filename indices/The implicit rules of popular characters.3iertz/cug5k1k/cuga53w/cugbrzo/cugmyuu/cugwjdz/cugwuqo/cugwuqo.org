Taking everything we're told about how transporters work literally, they give the Federation read write control of reality. They could become gods trivially.

So I just sort of accept transporters don't really work like they say, and instead are a form of folding space or something. Though that's another implicit rule now that I think about it: Transporters are only ever for bulk movement of cargo or persons, not direct destruction or movement of subparts.
