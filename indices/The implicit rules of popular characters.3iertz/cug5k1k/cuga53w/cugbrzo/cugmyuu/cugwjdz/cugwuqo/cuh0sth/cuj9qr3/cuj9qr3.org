That's an implicit rule of episodic fiction in general: the monster|MacGuffin|character|phenomenon of the week cannot be used or contacted later, no matter how relevant it may seem.

The degree to which the rule is followed is of course proportional to how episodic the story is - many stories will sometimes re-use plot devices, but not as often as would seem sensible from a rational in-story perspective.
