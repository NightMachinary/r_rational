No idea. He draws power from the 'speed force', allowing him to ignore all sorts of physical laws where they might be inconvenient. Little things like friction and momentum and there not being enough gravity to keep him on the ground and air particles hitting him in the face.

If you want to figure out to get infinite power or destroy the world or time travel, I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard with that power. Wouldn't even need to think particularly hard.
