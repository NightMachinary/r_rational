You're generally right about your rules, but there are some exceptions. These are just off the top of my head and I'm sure there are other examples:

#+begin_quote
  All projectiles must be thrown

In Young Justice he [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUlmUAf-x-g][takes Clayface down with a taser.]] (It's actually a Moment of Awesome; the superpowered members of YJ have just been beaten unconscious by Clayface, who is about to finish them off when Batman comes through the skylight and takes him down in seconds.

#+begin_quote
  No power armour, cybernetics, or other technologies that would render him largely immune to gunfire
#+end_quote

In The Dark Knight Returns, an old and retired Batman puts on powered armor and takes Superman to school.

#+begin_quote
  The Batmobile is a method of transport, not a valid source of tactics in and of itself
#+end_quote

In the Justice League cartoon, he drops freeze bombs from his Batjet in order to shut down an alien nanofactory. In [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DUz38n-fvQ&t=25s][The Dark Knight Returns]] he uses the Batmobile for starlight rounds and rubber-bullet machineguns to take down a crowd.

#+begin_quote
  The only way to incapacitate an enemy is via beating them unconscious.
#+end_quote

He uses gas to take out opponents, and has used sonic attacks / kryptonite / etc against Superman on multiple occasions. He's also used explosives quite a lot -- off the top of my head, C4 to take out a rebuilt Amazo and (on a different occasion) Metallo. He only uses them on enemies who can take it, though, and most of his enemies are squishy humans.

The reason for all the rules is because Batman is supposed to be the shining light for the viewer -- he doesn't have magic powers, or a mutant gene, or alien godhood, or even power armor. He's simply human, and vulnerable. Unlike almost all superheroes he suffers pain. Despite that, he still fights in the top tier alongside people like Superman and Wonder Woman, who can tank howitzers, fly, and rip through steel with their bare hands.
