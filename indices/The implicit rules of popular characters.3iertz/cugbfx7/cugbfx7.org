I guess it depends on the version of Batman, but most of those rules have been broken at some time or another by 1990s movies Batman, Batman Beyond, etc.

But yeah, I agree with [[/u/LiteralHeadCannon]] that these rules should have some reasoning behind them.

  the Green Lantern has an implicit rule against creating any construct whose effect would be too brutal (no turning his enemy's brains to mush via razor wire up the nose, no blinding his enemies with retina-destroying brightness, no railgun constructs launching pebbles at mach 3 at the enemy's skull).
