- The Flash cannot use weapons at superspeed; he must use solely his own body's /movement/ at those speeds, even when it makes no sense (I'll vibrate through this wall!) Actually, this seems to apply to all speedsters; I have no idea why.
- Superman can only use his superspeed for travel and, occasionally, preserving his secret identity or performing a mundane task faster. (Otherwise he'd make the Flash seem useless.) Nor can he use his heat vision at any appreciable range, despite possessing telescopic sight.
- Wonder Woman has to block bullets and such with her bracers, because she was originally closer to a Batman-style "badass normal".
- Nobody can ever use a sniper rifle, even when they're supposedly demonstrating the power of mundane technology/ingenuity. You can use a goddamn /nuke/, but not a sniper - it's unsporting to shoot someone in the back.
- Science-based superheroes can't deliberately attempt to create other superheroes. No replicating freak lab accidents, no sharing powered armour with other people. Mundanes can /steal/ your tech, or attempt to copy your origin; but if they become a hero, they'll never do it again to anyone else.
- No using FTL drives for time travel, or even mentioning the possibility. The only exception I know about, surprisingly, is the original series of Star Trek (which was closer to technobabble anyway.)
- If "Deals with the Devil" are a thing, nobody will ever use them for altruistic purposes. You can /summon/ demons for altruistic purposes, sometimes, but the traditional Deal is a purely selfish thing.
- Superheroes are not allowed to keep super-tech from the villains they beat. They can't even release them to the public, or something. Even when they were stolen! Even when they were stolen /from the superhero in question/ (I'm thinking of Iron Man, here)!
