  Would the Devil accept an altruistic deal? Doing so seems counter to his goals.

Well, he does get your soul for eternity. I definitely remember CS Lewis' Screwtape writing something about how well-being on Earth is irrelevant, because it's nothing compared to suffering in Hell.

I was thinking of setting where you get to name your price for the deal. (Actually, on thinking about it, I think this rule applies to /wishes/ rather than merely DwtD - why do so many supposedly-altruistic people get genie or fairy wishes and never consider helping anyone with them either?)

Actually, I just thought of an aversion of this rule: in the /Ghost Rider/ film, the Devil shows up and offers to cure the protagonist's father in exchange for his soul. Crucially, in this case the Devil named his terms, rather than the other way around.
