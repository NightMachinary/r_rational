  No mind magic.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure there was mind magic in Deathly Hallows. They had a puppet Minister for a while, stuff like that.

Also, /Imperius/ was used extensively in Goblet of Fire, albeit mostly by proxies, and Voldemort broke an /Obliviate/ in that book -albeit using /Crucio/, which is ambiguously mind magic.
