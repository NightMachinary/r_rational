Good point.

Here's another Voldemort rule I thought of though: "All conflict must be within the laws and customs of war". This rules out terror campaigns, most attacks on neutral civilians, certain classes of weapons and tactics... And it's almost always upheld in fiction, even by the worst (human) villains.
