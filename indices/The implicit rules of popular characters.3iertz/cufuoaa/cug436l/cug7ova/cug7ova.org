  all the talk about how lots of people were under an Imperius in the first war.

I always understood this as "Death Eaters just don't use mind magic, or at least not with any regularity or effectiveness, but 'I was Imperiused!' was the excuse all the rich, powerful, smart, good-looking, or upper-crust Death Eaters like Lord Malfoy used to dodge any consequences, while all the poor, dumb, or weird-looking rank-and-file Death Eaters like the Lestranges went to Azkaban, and everybody damn well knows it but what can you do."

More of a two Magical Britains thing than an actual use of Imperius by Death Eaters thing.
