In a lot of fiction, especially YA:

-*no character should be too thoughtful.* Impulsive characters push the plot forward, even if their lack of learning from consequences is infuriating eventually.

-*no character should remember and be willing to immediately use the full extent of their powers.* A good example is Percy Jackson in the second series-- he's often rendered useless or put on the defensive just in time for another character to do something useful. Even though he's repeatedly established and demonstrated to be so far ahead of other demigods that its something of a running joke in the fandom. A less egregious example is when Percy is threatened by monsters, which happens a lot of the time. You know from his previous feats that he's easily capable of defeating basically any medium-size group of average monsters, even after his curse is removed, but he stills treats them as a substantial threat.

-In YA fiction, *no enemy except the 'final boss' is deserving of death*, even when a character's continued existence is enormously convenient and that person has caused enormous suffering. *So the rule would be that protagonist should not feel okay about killing anyone except for the final boss.*
