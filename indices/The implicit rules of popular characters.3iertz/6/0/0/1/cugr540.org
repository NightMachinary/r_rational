The Federation has rules against genetic modification of humans because of the wars that were fought on Earth over that prior to the discovery of warp travel and the subsequent formation of the Federation. Apparently those events have left them so traumatized that they refuse to even consider genetic manipulation.

So it's a Butlerian-Jihad-rule in that sense. But they do not have any rules against the creation of AI that I'm aware of. Data is the one of the few androids in existence because apparently creating AI is very hard. That doesn't stop others from trying, though.

The reason that holodeck characters coming to life is seen as problematic is that you're effectively creating sentient life forms that you're then responsible for when you weren't trying to do anything of the sort. Almost like an unplanned pregnancy, except worse, since they're 'born' fully sentient.
