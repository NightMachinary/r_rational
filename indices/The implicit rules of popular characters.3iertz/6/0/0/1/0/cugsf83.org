  The reason that holodeck characters coming to life is seen as problematic is that you're effectively creating sentient life forms that you're then responsible for when you weren't trying to do anything of the sort. Almost like an unplanned pregnancy, except worse, since they're 'born' fully sentient.

Of course, you don't want to have that happen accidentally, especially when they're based on simulations of fictional criminals, but given how easy it seems to be... there's got to be some reason they don't do it deliberately.
