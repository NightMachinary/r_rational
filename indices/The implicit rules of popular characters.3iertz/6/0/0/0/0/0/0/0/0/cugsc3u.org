  I think you're overestimating how many holodeck characters turned sentient.
#+end_quote

Two in TNG, three incidents with multiple characters in Voyager.

- Moriarty
- Redblock
- The Doctor
- Leonardo
- The holodeck characters Janeway gave to the Hirojens, who seem to have all "woken up" (though maybe it was only the survivors).

I didn't really follow any other series. But that's two crews and maybe three ships (I don't recall which enterprise Redblock happened on), and they had multiple incidents on each. If you look at Star Trek rationally, that's actually a pretty high incidence.

  I'm not sure whether the holodeck safety protocols have anything to do with it.

I can't argue against that, but given how often it happens it's likely there is /some/ specific mechanism. I just used "safety protocols" because that's the usual handwavium.
