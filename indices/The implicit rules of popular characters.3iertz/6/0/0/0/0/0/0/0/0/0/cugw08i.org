There's another on DS9, a holo-singer who is aware that he's a hologram and is perfectly content with that.

Despite all these cases I still maintain that it's a rare event. The show tells you as much, and the characters certainly act as if it is. This doesn't strike me as unreasonable because all of them happened in special circumstances.

The Enterprise-D's computer has been stated to be unusually powerful, as befitting its status as the Federation flagship, and that's the reason given for its ability to generate sapient holograms. That combined with the relatively-new holodeck technology resulted in the inadvertent creation of Moriarty and Redblock.

The Doctor was never designed to be sapient, but deliberate modifications were made to his programming by the Voyager crew to allow him to attain sufficient complexity that he could be considered self-aware. They only did so because they had no one else to fill the role of ship doctor, so they were forced to upgrade their emergency hologram into one.

Leonardo seems to have been allowed to attain sapience because of the Voyager crew's boredom. Weak justification there, but I can't think of anything better.

The Hirojen have been stated to deliberately tweak the holodeck's programming to create realistic prey. They actually wanted self-aware holograms to hunt and kill, so where the creation of sapient life was seen as unethical by the Federation in their case it was actually what they were aiming for.

To sum up it isn't that the Federation has some sort of ironclad rule against creating AI, or deliberate safety protocols against it. They just see it as unethical and a hassle to deal with when it happens by accident. In situations where they do need AI (most notably Voyager) they're willing to go along with whatever's needed to keep them functioning.
