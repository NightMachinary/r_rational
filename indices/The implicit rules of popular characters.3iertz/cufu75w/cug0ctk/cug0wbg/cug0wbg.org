  Seven dragonballs to grant a wish? Why is Earth/Namek only being attacked NOW?
#+end_quote

Believe it or not, this is actually explained in-story; the only reason the existence of the dragon balls is leaked out to the universe at large is because Raditz kept his communicator on when Krillin, Bulma etc. were talking about them after Goku died. Earth apparently had no aliens heading there before Raditz who weren't too young to remember anything different and Namek apparently kept their secret really well.
