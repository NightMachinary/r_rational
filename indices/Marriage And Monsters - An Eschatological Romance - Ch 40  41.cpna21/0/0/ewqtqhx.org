Yeah, same. I had the biggest grin when the culture ship was introduced. These certainly are "special circumstances". Also happy that they might be getting back together soon.

I was wondering if the spell mindblank will make you immune to the concept, but it looks like Pathfinder nerfed that spell. No more immunity to mind affecting effects, just a huge bonus to resist.

However, the best wandable spell to cure people is "sequester thoughts" assuming the concept is a single topic. It might actually be the best spell for it, wandable or not. As your only other options are "wish", "modify memory", "damnation of memory" (has limitations that may cause issues), "hidden knowledge" (probably won't work), or just drink an "elixir of amnesia".
