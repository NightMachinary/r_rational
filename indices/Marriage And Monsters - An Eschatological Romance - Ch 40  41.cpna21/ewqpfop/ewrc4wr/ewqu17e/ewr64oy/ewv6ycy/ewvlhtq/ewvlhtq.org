The Culture series are books by Ian M Banks that take place in the same universe but are mostly independent of each other. Some of this might sound spoilery but it's all just background for the books.

Some books take place completely outside the Culture but feature 1 Culture citizen.

Basic setting is that the Culture are a post-scarcity "space-socialist" society at the top of the technological chain possible in the material universe. Most books are how they deal with other peoples that they disagree with without simply curb stopping them into submission.

The only way for them to get more powerful would be to Sublime into a higher plane of existence which they don't do mostly because they see themselves as necessary for peace in the galaxy.

So the infomorphs finding this Ship means they're basically getting a near God tier uplift.

I highly recommend you start with Player of Games.
