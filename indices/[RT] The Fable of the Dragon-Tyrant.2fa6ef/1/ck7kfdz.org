An excellent parable, and a good thing to post here.

That said... I'm not sure what the appropriate tag would be!

- =[RT]= doesn't seem quite right to me, since the setting and characters are clearly designed to convey a particular message rather than interact realistically. That might be more the style though, and it's not wrong.

- It has the flavor of a rationalist story, but by instruction rather than by example. What does that make it?

- Is it SF? Fantasy? A genre deconstruction (of reality?)?

Discuss!
