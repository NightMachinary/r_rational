That helps too, but if people have baby fever then it's likely to be more of a problem. Contraceptives can be evaded.

We can't eliminate the issue without going a bit crazy but it'd be good if wanting a baby was voluntary. Would reduce the pregnancy rate.

From googling it might not be hormonal. Whatever. There may be some genetic cure instead. Something like that would be good so that women could choose when they wanted a baby based on their intellect more easily.
