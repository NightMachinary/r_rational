Lower attempt rates only slow the problem. Even if success were 100% and people only tried to raise 1 child apiece - pure replacement - population would still grow at 1 generation per generation if there were no offsetting deaths. Plus, we have no idea how human psychology would respond to vastly lengthened fertility windows. We know about "empty nest syndrome". What if it turns out that many people will naturally have kids every 20 years or so if given the opportunity?
