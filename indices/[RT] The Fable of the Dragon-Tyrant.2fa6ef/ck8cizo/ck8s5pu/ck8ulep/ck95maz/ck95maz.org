I don't know what would happen, but as mentioned, past experiences suggest that society adapts fairly quickly to new norms about lifespan. If the birthrate dropped to a tiny fraction of what it currently is, that would mitigate the problem to something very manageable, where we could construct habitat (in space, in arcologies, maybe just seasteading) fast enough to keep up with demand.

Also, remember that a century ago, the term 'teenager' didn't exist, because it wasn't useful. If people live longer, it's very likely that they will live with family longer, and we'll have some new term for not-quite-adults at a higher age.
