No, you are not the only one, because population growth doom fears are a perennial fallacy dating back ages. That part is almost certainly just wrong, because curing old age instantly kills two of the major factors motivating people to have kids (legacy, someone to keep things going in your old age)\\
And heck, thanks to the wonders of math, even given true "My mind is backed up onto the cloud, my home harddrive daily, and weekly onto memory diamondstored in the repurposed yucca mountain dig" immortality every couple could have one kid and that would still be fine (Generation sizes halving: End result slightly less than a doubling of population over infinite time)

Old farts hanging on to all the wealth and all the power for ever? Uhm. Ever so slightly more of a problem. Already a problem even with them dying on their own.
