It's very unlikely to be a problem, based on all we know of factors effecting birthrates.

People dying of old age is 100% certainly a problem. A mortal one. For everyone that do not manage to get killed by something else. Thus, this is not a difficult question. It's a problem worth paying some attention to /after/ old age is no longer a concern. At which point society will suddenly have a vast increase in the available labor force to throw at all problems - including in this case, "how to increasing the carrying capacity of planet earth". And there a bunch of obvious attack vectors on that problem. It's not, however anywhere near the top of the list of issues to fix because it will almost certainly just not arise.

"The Koch's brothers sticking around forever" is much higher on the list of problems to address.
