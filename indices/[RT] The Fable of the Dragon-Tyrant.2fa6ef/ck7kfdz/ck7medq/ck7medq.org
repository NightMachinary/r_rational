Educational?

Personally I'd go for [DC] and [EDU]. It may not be strictly deconstructive but it has the same feeling of a story used to point out the flaws in something. In this case the something is our world rather than a story world. ¯_(ツ)_/¯

In any case it is a great story I fully support placing it on here.
