Even if we had an antiageing drug right now wouldn't it take around a century just to test it? And ageing, and the human body in general, is so poorly understood that I highly doubt that any treatment will be available for at least another century, which means at least two hundred years until it's distributed to even just the rich people. The human population is already set to plateau at around 2050, and might even decrease after that as standards of living improve in India and China. Higher standards of living are probably more likely to put a strain on the environment than population growth. Not to mention agricultural problems related to climate change, scarcity of fresh water, overfishing, etc. which might result in famines and many millions of people dying before then and possible societal collapse. So I think the risk posed by getting an antiageing drug too soon is relatively low.
