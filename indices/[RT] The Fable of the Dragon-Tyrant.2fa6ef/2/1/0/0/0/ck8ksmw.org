Well, we're both making unwarranted assumptions. I'm assuming worst-case because I'm trying to make a cautionary point, you're assuming best case because you want to move ahead with research. Yes, conquering /all/ forms of death up to and including pianos falling on heads isn't going to happen anytime soon, but a general anagathic would trigger 95% of the economic issues associated with my doomsday fear, and we have no idea what that might look like.

Also, many of the issues don't need the technology to be /available/, they just need it to be /plausible/. Take pensions, for example. As soon as a working anagathic within a decade or two starts to look as if it has any chance of happening, annuity rates go to zero everywhere, and stay there forever.

You might think implementing a UBI or similar scheme should be a trivial problem compared to conquering death. You might be right. You might think the same about healthcare provision, but look at the US. You might think the same about housing, but look at the UK. Never underestimate how determinedly elites - elites who by that time may have no reliance on the general population either economically or militarily - can do the wrong thing when they aren't the ones suffering consequences.

I also think you're severely underestimating the likely resistance to a state veto on reproduction. Even the Chinese had a tough time with that; how do you think the Catholics are going to react?
