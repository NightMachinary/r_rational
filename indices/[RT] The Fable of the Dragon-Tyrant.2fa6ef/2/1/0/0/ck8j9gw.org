Assuming that it was distributed uniformly across the population, sure. But life extension won't be like that - it's going to come to the rich first, and probably in fits and starts as we eat away at the long tail. We're not going to conquer death in an afternoon, and not in a few decades either. Given that, there's no reason that we can't work on multiple problems simultaneously - the elimination of death being one of those.
