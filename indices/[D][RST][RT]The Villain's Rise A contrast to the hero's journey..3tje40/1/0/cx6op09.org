Hum well [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DeepRise][Deeprise]] is done, and I'm working on converting it to an easier to follow format [[http://deepaccord.blogspot.com/][here]]. It is early work for me though and so things are rough and chunky.

[[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My%21-Generic-Monster-Girls%21-It-s-a-Kind-of-Magic][OMGMG]] is much closer to this theme and still in progress.

I have a third project planned to come after the monster girls sci-fi fun which will probably end up being my first real foray into full magical fantastical fantasy. But I've got more character interaction/writing/dialogue/visual art chops to figure out before I think I can do that particular project justice.
