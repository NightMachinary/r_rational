  I am looking for the rise of majestic power.

  I am looking for conquerors. I am looking for builders.

Well in that case you'll probably enjoy [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cruel-to-be-kind-si-multicross-thread-iv.310606/][Cruel to be Kind]], an extensive and pretty much daily updated fic about using dimensional jumping tech to build an empire from the ground up through 'acquiring' technology. It's at > 500 updates so far and so far as I can tell there is no other story quite like it. Or at least I've never been able to find one anyway.
