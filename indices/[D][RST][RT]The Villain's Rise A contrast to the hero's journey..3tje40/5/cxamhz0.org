I poked through this thread, and didn't see any mention of the GEoM, God Emperor of Mankind, from Warhammer 40k.

Warhammer mostly concentrates on the aftermath, after the betrayal. The darkest, most horrible part of the history of mankind.

But before the universe was cast into chaos by a resurgence of the chaos gods, and later before some of his sons were corrupted by chaos and betrayed him, the Emperor led humanity to greatness.

And he wasn't very gentle about it.
