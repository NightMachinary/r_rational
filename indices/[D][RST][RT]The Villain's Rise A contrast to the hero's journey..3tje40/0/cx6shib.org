That sounds awesome and exactly like what I am looking for as well, if put a bit more elegantly than I would be able to.

Sadly I can't think of something that fulfills all of those criteria off of the top of my head. The one that comes closest, in my mind, would be [[http://www.amazon.com/Fimbulwinter-Daniel-Black-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00KZ41LHM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1448018769&sr=1-1&keywords=fimbulwinter][Fimbulwinter]] and its sequels. While the protagonist is technically a mundane dropped in a magical world he leverages the powers he gained in the transition into a rapidly expanding, and very ambitious, power base.

Have you tried looking/asking in the quest forums of SpaceBattles or SufficientVelocity? I think that the crowdsourcing of borderline insane plotlines that happens there is the closest you're going to get when it comes to already existing literature.
