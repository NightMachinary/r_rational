Fimbulwinter has the downside of shoddy writing, excessive self-insert (The author's pen name is E. William Brown, the main character's name is Daniel Black, could he make it any more obvious?), and some rather gratuitous sex scenes. This isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, but be aware you're reading male nerd wish fulfillment.
