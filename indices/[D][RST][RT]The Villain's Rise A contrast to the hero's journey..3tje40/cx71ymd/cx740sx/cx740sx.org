The key distinction for me is the story starting with the hero in "mundane" the idea of the call being a thing to be ignored, the inciting incident being external. I actually have tried following this structure before when I write. My current view is The heroes journey is in many ways a story of youth or inexperience. The hero is not yet tested or safe or any number of things.

But the story of life is not just about school, or college, or origin stories or frightening firsts. It's also about gradual builds.

The story of the rise can be shoehorned into the heroes journey monomyth. But it's not about that kind of perspective.

It's about what some one does after their journey.

It's about antagonists or mentors as the main perspective.

People who change the world or engage with wider views.

Or groups working together.

Or those that are threshold gaurdians.

Trying to tell the story of a god would not fit into the heroes journey very well.

Stories about shaping and building worlda don't seem to fit the overarching structure. And I feel it's a does a diservice to the potential of stories that people are always framing everything as the heroes journey.
