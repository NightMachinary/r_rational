  Sometimes the hero returns with the tools necessary to transform his world in the same way that he himself has been transformed.

I sort of agree, but with a caveat.

Although the hero returns with strength to change the world, in almost all cases this manifests in one of two ways:

1. The World was already ruined, the Hero returns it to 'normal', how it was before the Rise of Evil. Sometimes there is a suggestion that they will try to do some things better, but most of the time it's assumed 'normal' is good.
2. The Hero understands that although they have the power to change the world, they choose not to for moral/ideological/personal reasons. Now that their adventure is over, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal][they just want to lay down their sword and live in peace.]]

In the standard heroic narrative the story changes the hero. Maybe they learn something about themselves or about the world, there is a theme of acceptance and humility.

In the kind of conquering narrative the OP is talking about, the hero changes the story. Changes the world the story occurs in. Changes the society the story operates in. The theme is less of acceptance, and more of disagreement, and less of humility and more of confidence.

'The Villian's Rise' works as a swift explanation of this I suppose. Villains are the ones who normally take these kinds of positions. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact][Villans act, Heroes react.]]

The best explanation of the difference I read was in [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm]], a worm fanfiction about a hamtacular Silver-Age style villain patterned after a (slightly nicer) Doctor Doom dropped into the clusterfuck that is Worm.

One of her monologues to the heroes when they ask why she's a villain explains exactly this: she plans to remake the world in her own image, and so she must be a villain, even though many of her actions are heroic.
