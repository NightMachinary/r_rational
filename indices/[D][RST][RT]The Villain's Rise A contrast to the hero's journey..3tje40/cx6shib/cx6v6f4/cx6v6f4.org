Eh, I didn't finish /Fimbulwinter/ but then I didn't find it that engaging either - it just felt like wish-fulfillment-as-the-"plot"-demands.

The best example of what [[/u/Nighzmarquls]] is looking for that I know of is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3998737/][/Amelia/]] - it's probably the best Wormverse rise-to-power I've read. Much drama, more escalation, and a +healthy+ realistic dose of politics.
