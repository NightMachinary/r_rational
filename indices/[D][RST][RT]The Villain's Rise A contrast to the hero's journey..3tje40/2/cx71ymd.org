What you're talking about is a very specific part of the hero's journey. In its simple form, the journey is:

1. Call to Adventure
2. Crossing the Threshold
3. Road of Trials
4. Abyss and Rebirth
5. Transformation
6. Boss Fight
7. Return, Having Changed

I feel like it's only that last part that you really dislike, and then only if it's handled in a certain way. There are many forms of the hero's journey where the hero returns back to his mundane life having undergone a /personal/ transformation which nevertheless leaves him as mundane as he was at the start. Having saved the world, the hero then fades into obscurity.

But that's not the only way to handle the return. /Sometimes/ the hero returns with the tools necessary to transform his world in the same way that he himself has been transformed. I feel like this is what you're talking about? /The Matrix/ is one example that follows that version of the hero's journey very closely.

Or I might be misunderstanding what it is you really want in terms of structure and/or content.
