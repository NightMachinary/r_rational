I think that there is a certain qualitative difference between the usual intense violence and what you've written here in terms of impact on the reader. The "acceptable" violence for teens is usually more about slaughtering enemy mooks or villains, who the audience barely even registers as representing sapient agents. Here you've done a crack job of getting the reader to empathise with Shiina. By the time she was captured, she was firmly in my "she represents a human, I care about what happens to her" mental bucket. The emotional response to subsequent snuff is much stronger than "oh another mook bit the dust, some guts may have fallen out".

  I have written nothing that I would not have been prepared to read as a teenager. ...if anyone is still reading after that, they know what they're letting themselves in for.

Personally, I completely agree with you here. I think 99% of "Mature" content on fanfiction.net doesn't really deserve the label. Certainly, I would have gladly read most of it when I was a teenager and would have enjoyed it even more in those years. Still, by the silly convention of fanfiction.net, the kinky sex goes into M category and I'm pretty sure that this chapter is no more appropriate for teens than smut is.

  If this post was meant as a request for more kinky sex in LUD, your suggestion shall be taken under advisement.

I was thinking more of first-person perspectives of vivisection torture, but I ain't gonna say no to kinky sex either. In fact, I enthusiastically approve!
