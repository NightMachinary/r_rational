Also, ochimaru's immortality method relies on there being people, I'm pretty sure- it's a vampiric-type immortality, a cost constantly paid. It's not like voldemort's one-and-done immortality. (yes, i know, backups. he only needed one, if it weren't destructible.)

If he wants to be strong, there needs to be strong ninja who are willing to give themselves to him. He'd probably choose from his own side if he were rational- especially if they felt it was an honor- but he might value rare abilities that are tied to the body more.

sharigan is quite likely worth the risk, and more-so considering how outmatched he is by atsuki. He needs power and needs it quick, if he's discovered the threat.
