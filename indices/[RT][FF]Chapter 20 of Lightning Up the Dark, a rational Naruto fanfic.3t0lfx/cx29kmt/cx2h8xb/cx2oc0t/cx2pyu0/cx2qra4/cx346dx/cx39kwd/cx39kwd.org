Oh, I didn't doubt that for a second. It's quite obvious that the point of the scene is to show off Gaara and I wouldn't actually want you to just write pointless gratuitous scenes of violence, at least not inside this story. It's just that I already expected him to be pretty much like what was shown. What I didn't expect is how impactful you'll manage to make the death of what essentially amounts to a known sacrificial mook. You've done a really good job of giving her enough depth quickly to make the scene really mean something on emotional level.

  I don't think the label is accurate.

I don't really think so either. But I know of no better label for "being inside the characters head as everything is casually taken away from them: first their freedom, then comrades and hope, then health, even any chance that Gaara will face retribution for his actions, then finally the broken, pitiful thing that used to be a person dies and no one in their universe even cares about their fate". Looks like everyone more or less understood what I meant by snuff anyway.
