I suspect you're fighting a losing battle here. Since even the gaiden is done by now this is all pretty much late-arrival spoilers.

To be honest, I don't even think it's worth reading the manga/watching the anime to the very end. I actually regret reading the chapters from the last couple of arcs. They were so bad, they've tarnished the memories of previous ones. Negative utility if you ask me.
