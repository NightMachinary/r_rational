  Tech levels in the Narutoverse are notoriously inconsistent (I think Kishimoto is on record as saying that they're overall analogous to ours, minus firearms and motor vehicles, which is insane), but there have to be some limits, and I think DNA is one of those. It would utterly break a lot of things, including ninja stealth vs forensic science.
