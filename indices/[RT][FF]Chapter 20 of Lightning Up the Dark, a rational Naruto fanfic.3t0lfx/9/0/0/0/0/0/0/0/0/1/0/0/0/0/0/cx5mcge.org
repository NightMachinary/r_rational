  They could get around this by leveraging the "default" advantages of being a ninja - nigh-superhuman reflexes, hardened bodies, chakra use etc. That would leave them with plenty of potential for weapons that a non-ninja couldn't use, or couldn't use effectively.

And this is already a less trivial task than inventing a firearm.

  As it is, it seems odd that the only standardised ninjutsu are the basic Academy ones (especially given that even those are ridiculously overpowered when used intelligently). The village that thought of expanding that arsenal to include, say, basic offensive ninjutsu (instead of forcing people to rely on notoriously underpowered kunai) would instantly receive a huge advantage.

Oh come on, you wrote it yourself, giving more jutsu to genin would be asking for rebellion! And how much overpowered would an intelligent user (like your Naruto) be if they had yet another basic technique? Ninjutsu stack exponentially, not summatorially (?).

  What I mean is that you wouldn't describe one of Kankur≈ç's puppets as a homing weapon, but that's the effect his abilities would have if they were applied to something like a shuriken.

I'd never heard the term homing weapon. Thanks.

True that.
