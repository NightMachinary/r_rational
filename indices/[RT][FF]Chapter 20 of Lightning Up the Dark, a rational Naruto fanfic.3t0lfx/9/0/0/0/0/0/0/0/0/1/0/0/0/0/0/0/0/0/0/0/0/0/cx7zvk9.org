I suppose it's not impossible, but we've /seen/ ninja use shuriken. They have some advantages such as wider spread, more spontaneous use and a higher fire rate, but the only special thing about /ninja/ throws is how accurate they manage to be when throwing several objects at a time. After all, shuriken are in fact blocked all the time, whereas under the right circumstances arrows can punch through plate mail (and the right circumstances mostly involve quality materials and high accuracy, both things ninja have in abundance).

We've also seen Kid≈çmaru use a bow designed for ninjutsu-enhanced strength (the only Narutoverse archer I can think of). That thing could pierce Neji's absolute defence.

Finally, bows can be used for long-range sniping. Shuriken cannot.
