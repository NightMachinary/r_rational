You're changing the terms of the debate.

"Body-enhancing reality-bending magic" is unambiguously a reference to individual use of combat ninjutsu, not military intelligence, blackmail, aviation etc.

I am saying that, just as the individual soldier on the ground uses a rifle (or whatever modern infantry weapon you would like to substitute), with the other things being specialised tools with limited availability and/or a need for advanced training to use them, so in the Narutoverse the individual soldier on the ground uses kunai, with combat ninjutsu being specialised tools with limited availability (many of them are clan techniques, or classified, or only available from specific teachers) and a need for advanced training to use them.

I am not pointing to the lack of firearms specifically as a problem with the setting. But real-world ninja used cutting-edge technology for their time (in fact, they were among the first in Japan to adopt firearms). If Narutoverse ninja had any level of technological advancement that made sense, they would have come up with their own equivalent weaponry - high-speed shuriken launchers, maybe, or explosive tag grenades, or pseudo-homing weaponry through crude use of chakra strings. /Anything/ better than trying to cut their enemy with knives.
