  In the present Kishimoto situation, a juunin can take down one hundred normal genin with ease, but I argue that it's pretty difficult to take down one hundred opponents who can shoot fire at you, erect walls, jet water and electrocute you if you touch the nearly invisible ninja wire that they can thread around you in a second, being in vast numerical advantage.

I think this is pretty much consistent with Naurtoverse power curve. The difference between genin and jōnin is enormous. A hundred genin could probably take care of one jōnin *if* they were perfectly coordinated and managed to saturate the immediate area with hazards. But even then, if you're against someone like Kakashi, he'll see it coming and substitute away, or burrow into the ground. Then emerge somewhere else, charge up one jutsu and wipe out all of your hundred genin in one strike. Someone like Gai wouldn't even slow down. He'll just run around punching everyone hard enough that they explode. Kurenai would cast one jutsu and everyone would fall asleep or go into la-la land or something. Not to mention the fact that a jōnin can disengage and re-engage at will and the genin won't be able to keep up.

There are two ways genin win: either they manage to somehow completely surprise the opponent, or he gets into straight up ninjutsu slugging match and stands there taking fire like a moron. I've always felt that Narutoverse battle-wizards mostly rely on overwhelming firepower and speed. Only the ones who have some special advantages stand around tanking hits, everyone else just dodges. Jōnin would have an overwhelming advantage both in speed and in accurately delivering firepower.
