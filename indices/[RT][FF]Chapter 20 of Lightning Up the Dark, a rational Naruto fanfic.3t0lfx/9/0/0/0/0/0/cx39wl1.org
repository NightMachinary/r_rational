  Not relevant anymore seeing as Gaara could have done a bunch of creative things with the remains, but Orochimaru was splicing people in his lab. He went as far as creating a genetically engineered embryo, and I can't believe he got the whole field of genetics all on himself.

I think Orochimaru is one of a select few, maybe even the greatest of a select few, when it comes to scientific ability. A... different... view of ethics also helps when making progress with biology research.

As for the splicing, well, Kishimoto seems to have the attitude that as long as it involves disturbing experiments, Orochimaru can do it, no matter the obstacles in the way. I try to be more restrained.
