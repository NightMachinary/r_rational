  But ninja technology has developed in different directions, many of which already draw on the user's personal power. Examples include storage seals, exploding tags and summoning scrolls, all of which are tools rather than techniques, yet draw on the user's chakra for their effect.

Still not user-bound weapons. If I'm not remembering wrong, canon says non-ninja can use a little bit of chakra. And how difficult can it possibly be, if even ten years old can learn it?

  A matter of incentive, surely?
#+end_quote

Surely. Not even prototypes around tough. My point is progress can leave some paths unexplored.

  As mentioned in another comment, there are things like bows which are strictly superior to shuriken in the right context (e.g. sniping, or penetrating an enemy's guard).
#+end_quote

I can see how sniping is absurdly undervalued in the Narutoverse, probably another lack of the author.

#+begin_quote
  Besides, it seems like ninja's enhanced accuracy and reflexes cancel each other out - 99% of shuriken throws get blocked or dodged, whereas a faster or heavier weapon might not.

This reminds me that we have seen few average fights among average combatants in the course of the show. We lack information.

  I don't recall any evidence of this. While we see no scroll-shops, nor is there any evidence that technique scrolls in general are restricted.
#+end_quote

The scroll Naruto steals was restricted, it was in the Hokage office which was surveilled constantly, and Naruto was in fact caught stealing it (and I think he manages only by plot device. Other techniques we see in the old Uchiha compound, and were only accessible with a sharingan. We don't see any easily accessible technique scroll that I can remember during the whole manga.

  while apparently having no need to transport goods or equipment on a regular basis.

That's the absurd part. Technology requires materials, more materials and even more materials. Research even more. Unless it's all chakra-powered, we fail to see [[#s][concerns future events but not exactly spoiler]].

  I think my original argument was that they aren't replaced with magic warfare, because magic warfare is much too complicated and expensive to fill the same niche. Instead, the thing we have in place of firearms to supplement the magic warfare, kunai etc., is strangely inadequate to the task.

Hmm. I think it fits in the boundaries of Japanese culture. During the Sengoku Period there were constant feuds and wars, and yet Japan military technology evolved from swords to somewhat better swords. It's, in my opinion, fitting of the Japanese historical mindset.

  Language evolution is in the hands of the people. If you truly want your variant term to become accepted, simply get enough people to use it in their daily lexicon.

I am a linguist. The tantrum was just for the lulz.
