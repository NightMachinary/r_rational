  You're changing the terms of the debate.

  "Body-enhancing reality-bending magic" is unambiguously a reference to individual use of combat ninjutsu, not military intelligence, blackmail, aviation etc.

Yeah, I tend to steer discussions to branches. sorry.

  If Narutoverse ninja had any level of technological advancement that made sense, they would have come up with their own equivalent weaponry - high-speed shuriken launchers, maybe, or explosive tag grenades, or pseudo-homing weaponry through crude use of chakra strings. Anything better than trying to cut their enemy with knives.

Hmmm, food for thoughts. Are we advanced in every area that we could be advanced in, right now? Because if we aren't, it would be possible for ninja to forget the "tool" component of warfare in favour of personal power. After all, to keep power limited to the few with access to clan secrets/specific teachers/classified jutsu is something of a value for them. If anyone could grab a gun and sniper a ninja, it would kinda screw the status quo.

Can't compute

Also we are horrible nerds for discussing in depth the politics and development of a fictional world.
