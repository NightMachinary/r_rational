I'm not sure about that.

Since bows are obviously /available/ for ninja use, maybe the reason is that /bows/ can't compete with /shuriken/.

Sure, /IRL/ bows have more power, but we aren't talking about human thrown shuriken. We're talking about /ninja/ thrown shuriken. Maybe chakra enhanced muscles can throw shuriken with more force than the draw of a bow can generate?
