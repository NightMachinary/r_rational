  I dunno, it took 400 years between the discovery of gunpowder and the invention of firearms, and then another 600 before they became anything like modern weapons in terms of safety, reliability and firing speed.

Yeah, and all this for a basic concept as a thing that shoots things, a simple mechanism that anyone can use.

#+begin_quote
  are you maybe thinking of a different fic?
#+end_quote

Man, I read your fic thrice over already. It was said by Tariki during his interrogation. "You know what happens when too many ninja live long enough to get real strong? Of course you don't, you idealistic little prick. They start getting ambitious."

If you teach them things from genin already, they'll become stronger and get ideas. And they'll have numbers.

#+begin_quote
  That happens anyway, though.
#+end_quote

But in time and with people checked over and over again by their mentors. Also, few reach jonin.

  It's not like there's a ban on Genin learning new techniques, and in principle a Genin could learn all the techniques they have time and talent for just by asking around.
#+end_quote

And at the same time be checked. Nobody really learns a new techniques from the library, they get taught. Well, this thing isn't really clear in canon.

Anyway that's like, what Kishimoto thought was cool, rather than what would supposedly happen. Unless we accept his subconscious mind was pattern-matching on reasonable things while he din't know and he just felt like it flowed well.

  I think the opposite of "exponential" is "linear".
#+end_quote

I think "summatorially" ought to be a word.
