Sand is notoriously absorbent, and Gaara is capable of doing all sorts of clever (and disturbing) things with it.

Even if there were, it would be one small pool of /something/ in a vast forest. Worse, the forest is filled with people who can use a variety of bizarre techniques, including ones to create and/or manipulate various liquids which may be left behind after the technique is done.

  Don't ninja have knowledge of DNA and DNA reconnaissance capabilities?
#+end_quote

Tech levels in the Narutoverse are notoriously inconsistent (I think Kishimoto is on record as saying that they're overall analogous to ours, minus firearms and motor vehicles, which is insane), but there have to be some limits, and I think DNA is one of those. It would utterly break a lot of things, including ninja stealth vs forensic science.
