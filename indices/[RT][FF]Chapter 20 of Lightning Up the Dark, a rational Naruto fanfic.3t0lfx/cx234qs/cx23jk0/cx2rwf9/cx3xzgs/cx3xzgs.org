It seems to have problems with its perspective changes. Like Worm, the protagonist is done from a first-person POV, and everyone else through third-person limited. Problems with that choice is that the perspective character still shifts within the chapter, and Shikamaru isn't actually focused on as much as you would think. When Shikamaru is focused on, there is no easy labeling the author can give the reader due to the first-person nature of the shift. You get something that's fairly confusing and feels disjointed, when chapters are supposed to be units.

EDIT: Finishing what's there, it's actually more of a Kakashi-centric fic, as his Kakashi has stolen the fucking show completely. It's amazing.
