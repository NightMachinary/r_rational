My only Naruto experience is through rational fanfics so I have no idea about its accuracy, but I'm really liking the portrayal of Shikamaru. He seems like a good candidate for a rational fiction (and apparently [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6781426/1/Shikamaru-vs-the-Logical-Fallacies][one already exists]]).

I'm assuming Orochimaru was the one that left the notes, and probably did so for more than just that one team. That lets him establish a perimeter so that his little discussion with Sasuke can go uninterrupted and unobserved without revealing his involvement. Clever, though I do wonder how he found so much dirt on so many genin; he must have been planning this for a long time or has comprehensive intelligence reports.

Gaara is apparently the host of the One-Tailed Beast in canon. That presumably means that he's a serious threat here. His sensory abilities and ninjutsu control imply that Gaara is leveraging that, and the distaste at drinking the blood from the heart suggests that it isn't total control (as does the fact that he isn't murdering everyone).

This might be a state that Naruto could also reach, though I imagine it has some serious drawbacks with respect to free will, morality, etc. Gaara's sand control and perceptiveness would make him another pretty hard counter to the Uzumaki style, so I wouldn't put any money on Naruto solo even with Nine-Tail's cooperation (or at least I wouldn't if he weren't the protagonist).
