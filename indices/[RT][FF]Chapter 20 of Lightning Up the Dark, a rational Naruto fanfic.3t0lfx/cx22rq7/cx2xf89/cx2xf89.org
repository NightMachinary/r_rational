I honestly think Talk No Jutsu could still work out, it would just need tweaking to new situation. Something along the lines of "You want to see interesting things not just now, but also as far as possible into the future as well, therefore maximise working togetherness and minimise things that make dangerous people want to kill you in order to maximise your lifespan and thus maximise the number of interesting things you see."

Except more eloquently put and padded out a bit. Also, I'm loving the Orochimaru is selling himself as the good guy, or maybe the necessary evil. It's just a better strategy when talking to recruits.
