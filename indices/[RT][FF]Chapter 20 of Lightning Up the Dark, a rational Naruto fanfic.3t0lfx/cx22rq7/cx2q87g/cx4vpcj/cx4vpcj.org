  It would be interesting to see all the different uses/flavours of intelligence; perhaps even each tailed beast could represent one.

Are we sure Gaara's beast is super intelligent too? It looks like Gaara has abnormally huge chakra levels, since he got the tags from the obelisk and was not tired. That's more similar to the tailed beasts of canon than to the alien incubators.
