It would be interesting to see all the different uses/flavours of intelligence; perhaps even each tailed beast could represent one.

Off the top of my head, they could be planning, analysis, deduction, creativity, manipulation, learning (as in absorbing information or techniques that already exist), empathy, genre savviness, and...I don't know, rationality?

If this is implemented, I'd see Kurama as being planning (doing the tricks with the shuriken and deliberately lying to Naruto to gauge his reactions), and I'd wager that the Shukaku would be analysis (obsessed with seeing new techniques, immediately figured out that the light-wielding ninja would have nothing more to show him). Just a random idea.
