  What's the difference between Naruto's smarts and Shikamaru's? Their training in childhood? Are they supposed to be equally intelligent here?

Shikamaru does have the fact that he was born into a clan of particularly intelligent ninja, who take education and training with appropriate seriousness, going for him. Overall, though, it's best to reserve judgement until you have a fuller picture of his capabilities.
