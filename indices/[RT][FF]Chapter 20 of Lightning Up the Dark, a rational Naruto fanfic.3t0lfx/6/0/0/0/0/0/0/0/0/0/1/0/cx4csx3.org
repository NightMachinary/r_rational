I was never clear, but I think Orochochohoho needs a new body every three years, right? He took a new body at the end of the Sasuke Retrieval Arc. He wanted it to be Sasuke's, but Sasuke took too long to get there and he needed a new one before Sasuke could arrive. And then 3 years later, he was preparing to take Sasuke's body, but Sasuke killed him instead.
