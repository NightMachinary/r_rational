What, just for me? Aww, you shouldn't have!

More seriously, I think that potentially such a scene could serve a purpose beyond just being gratuitous guro and, as such, may deserve a place in this fic. Perhaps it can be used to show that while Oro-tan is a cool dude who's all about minimising existential risks (I assume that's a direction Velorien is taking him), he does in fact have some not-so-heroic interests.
