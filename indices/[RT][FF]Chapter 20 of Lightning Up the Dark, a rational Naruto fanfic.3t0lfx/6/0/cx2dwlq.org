Well, there are two ways of looking at that. In terms of the letter of the T rating, I have certainly stuck within the conditions of "some violence, minor coarse language, and minor suggestive adult themes".

In terms of the spirit, I have written nothing that I would not have been prepared to read as a teenager. In addition, it's well-established by the end of the Wave arc that this story features regular risk of violent death, emotional trauma and even Lovecraftian horror, all happening to children, so if anyone is still reading after that, they know what they're letting themselves in for.

I do agree with you on the general point that exposure to kinky sex is vastly less problematic than exposure to intense violence, and wish that our culture didn't place these things exactly the other way round.

(if this post was meant as a /request/ for more kinky sex in LUD, your suggestion shall be taken under advisement)
