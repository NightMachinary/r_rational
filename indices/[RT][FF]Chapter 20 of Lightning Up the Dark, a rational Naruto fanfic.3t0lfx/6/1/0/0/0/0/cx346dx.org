I think I may be one of these too. But it's not /why/ I write what I write, and I should probably emphasise that the intention of that scene was not to be "snuff".

The original draft was exactly the same in terms of what happened, but shown from a mostly neutral perspective. But the end result came out a bit dry and lifeless, so I decided that it would be better to have the doomed ninja be the viewpoint character, and show what Gaara looks like to normal people.

/Then/ I decided that I didn't want to create a faceless mook just to kill them off, at least not when I had a clear opportunity to avoid it, so I gave Shiina such depth as I could manage in a single scene. So if adding emotional impact to an already-decided death makes it snuff, then fair cop. Otherwise, I don't think the label is accurate.
