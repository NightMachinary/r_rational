Wow, is Gaara OP or what? And intelligently crazy. That's bad. I can't imagine how Talk No Jutsu could affect him in this condition, and in a rational world his purposeful murdering disturbs me more than it did in Kishiverse.

A question. What's the difference between Naruto's smarts and Shikamaru's? Their training in childhood? Are they supposed to be equally intelligent here?

Also I love how Orochimaru is legitimately badass, flawless.

Good chapter. I'll grudge every following day until next week.
