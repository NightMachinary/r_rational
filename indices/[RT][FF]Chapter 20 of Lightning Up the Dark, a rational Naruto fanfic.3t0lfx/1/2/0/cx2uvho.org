Apologies to [[/u/eaglejarl]], but the Kyubey is more terrifying than his Kurama. Although Kurama is pretty damn scary, he seems (/SEEMS/) fairly humanoid. Kyubey has the nightmare of Knightian uncertainty cloaking its goals.

Their Orochimaru are fairly comparable, but that might be because [[/u/Velorien]] hasn't really shown him off yet. Orochimaru is more viscerally terrifying to me than the Defense Professor, but that might be the rapey factor kicking in. Regardless, Gaara is (seems) more terrifying than both Orochimaru because he doesn't even hide his deviant psychology. Orochimaru is probably smarter than Gaara, but it might even be more interesting if Gaara was actually the smartest character so far (besides Kyubey and Shukaku).

/secretly wants Gaara to be major character/

If you're up to naming suggestions, it would be pretty amusing to name the One-Tails "Shikako," from the motivated Nara in Dreaming of Sunshine.

[[/u/Velorien]], you're good at writing characters that scare me, and get me to empathize with despite their obvious status as narrative cannon fodder, goddamn you. [[/u/eaglejarl]], you're good at writing characters who I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY WANT WHILE THEY PRETEND TO WANT SOMETHING ELSE, which is pretty terrifying in its own right. You clearly weren't going for the alien feel, so I'm not actually sure how well you write that, but you do keep me second-guessing almost constantly.
