Hey! I resemble that remark! Kurama is the soul of innocent helpfulness. Yes, he lied to Naruto /one time/, but it was only as a test of character and he owned up to it on their next meeting, even though he didn't have to. Everyone beats up on Kurama just become he's a hyperpowerful inhuman Primordial monster with a known penchant for eradicating entire cities! Poor guy.
