I think Shikamaru's intelligence is the more explicit, deliberate kind, while Naruto's intelligence is more instinctive and implicit.

That makes Shikamaru a better team player, since he can explain to other people what he is thinking. Naruto on the other hand is very good at being creative and thinking fast in the middle of combat.
