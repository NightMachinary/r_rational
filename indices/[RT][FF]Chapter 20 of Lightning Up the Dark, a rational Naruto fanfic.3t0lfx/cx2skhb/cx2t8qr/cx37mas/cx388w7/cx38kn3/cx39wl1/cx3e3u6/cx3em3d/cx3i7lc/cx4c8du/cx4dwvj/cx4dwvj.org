And I would challenge that. In the real world, the standard tool of warfare is the computer. Rifles are used nearly as sparsely as tanks and missiles and drones.

In fact, in this moronic horrible thing that is happening in the middle-east, a number of countries intervened with mainly aviation and intelligence. Terrorists use rifles as much as bombs and kamikaze (yes, I'm classifying them as weapons, not soldiers), and a very used tool of war is blackmail (see Russia).

To get back to the narutoverse, you could say the most used tools of war are the basic three of the academy.

I'd say the most unacceptable nuance in Naruto's tech-level is the lack of transportation, not firearms. That really would be impossible.
