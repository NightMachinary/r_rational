  After all, to keep power limited to the few with access to clan secrets/specific teachers/classified jutsu is something of a value for them. If anyone could grab a gun and sniper a ninja, it would kinda screw the status quo.

They could get around this by leveraging the "default" advantages of being a ninja - nigh-superhuman reflexes, hardened bodies, chakra use etc. That would leave them with plenty of potential for weapons that a non-ninja couldn't use, or couldn't use effectively.

As it is, it seems odd that the only standardised ninjutsu are the basic Academy ones (especially given that even those are ridiculously overpowered when used intelligently). The village that thought of expanding that arsenal to include, say, basic offensive ninjutsu (instead of forcing people to rely on notoriously underpowered kunai) would instantly receive a huge advantage.

What I mean is that you wouldn't describe one of Kankur≈ç's puppets as a homing weapon, but that's the effect his abilities would have if they were applied to something like a shuriken.

  Also we are horrible nerds for discussing in depth the politics and development of a fictional world.

Fanfiction, and fiction in general, is all about exercising the power of the imagination. /Rational/ fiction is also about exercising the power of analytical intellect. I think we are doing exactly what we should be doing under the circumstances.

Besides, it's way less depressing than discussing the politics and development of the real world.
