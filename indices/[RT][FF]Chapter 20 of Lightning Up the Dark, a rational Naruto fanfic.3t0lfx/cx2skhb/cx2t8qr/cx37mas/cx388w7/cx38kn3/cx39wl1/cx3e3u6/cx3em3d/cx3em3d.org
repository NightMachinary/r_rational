To reiterate, the Narutoverse's technology levels are insane. In one of the Fourth Ninja War fillers, Sakura is shown using a bona fide desktop PC to analyse medical data. I do not accept that this is possible in a world where secondary education is non-existent and the standard tool of warfare is a knife.
