I was keeping it short to give you a socially smooth way out of what was becoming a long conversation, but seeing as you don't mind...

I meant that ignition-accelerated bodies is a simple technology, when compared to user-bound weapons. For example, we still don't have genetically (fingerprint/body chemistry/blood vases pattern) marked firearms, and yet those are well within the reach of our technology. And anything requiring ninja abilities could also be detrimental in battle.

Seeing as ninja have very, very good reflexes and reaction times, it's reasonable that anything short of firearms and hand-thrown kunai would be dead weights instead of force multipliers.

  Setting aside the fact that Tariki is ridiculously cynical [...] everyone else either treats it as a burden (e.g Tsunade) or as an achievement to be earned (e.g. Naruto)

Uchiha. The problem with them was that they had a gamebreaker power that made the common chuunin, maybe even the advanced genin, be on the level of a lot of chuunin, and a, S-rank Uchiha can take down a Hokage. In fact, Shisui could have taken the whole fire country if he had bothered to try.

Now of course this is a little outside of the (common genin + more techniques) area, but can you imagine a militarized nation with a lot of troops with /personal power/? I't like in Nigeria, continuous succession of bloodthirsty dictators, only there it's the kalasnikov.

In the present Kishimoto situation, a juunin can take down one hundred normal genin with ease, but I argue that it's pretty difficult to take down one hundred opponents who can shoot fire at you, erect walls, jet water and electrocute you if you touch the nearly invisible ninja wire that they can thread around you in a second, being in vast numerical advantage.

  Checked for what?
#+end_quote

For loyalty and trustworthiness. Just like when Voldemort goes around searching for minions, or when a drug dealer only deals with you if you are a friend of a friend. Not that I would know.

  We know that technique scrolls are a thing, and indeed we see ninja learn things from them on multiple occasions (including Episode 1).
#+end_quote

Yeah, restricted scrolls under the control of the Hokage, or clan heads. Not scroll-shop scrolls.

To get back to the original problem, a technological society without modern transportation (or better) is absolutely absurd, but one in which all firearms are replaced with magic warfare seems pretty reasonable to me.

  Then people might confuse it with "summarily", or think it was related to "summarise".
