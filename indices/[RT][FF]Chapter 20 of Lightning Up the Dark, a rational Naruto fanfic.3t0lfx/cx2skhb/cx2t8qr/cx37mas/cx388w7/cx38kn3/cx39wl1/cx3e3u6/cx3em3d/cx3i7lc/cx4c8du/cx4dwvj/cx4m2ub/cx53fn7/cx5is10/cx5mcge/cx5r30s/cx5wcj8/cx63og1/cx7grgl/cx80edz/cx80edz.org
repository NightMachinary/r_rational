  I meant that ignition-accelerated bodies is a simple technology, when compared to user-bound weapons.
#+end_quote

But ninja technology has developed in different directions, many of which already draw on the user's personal power. Examples include storage seals, exploding tags and summoning scrolls, all of which are tools rather than techniques, yet draw on the user's chakra for their effect.

#+begin_quote
  For example, we still don't have genetically (fingerprint/body chemistry/blood vases pattern) marked firearms, and yet those are well within the reach of our technology.
#+end_quote

A matter of incentive, surely? Such things would be expensive unless mass-produced, and the people who would use them en masse (i.e. armies) do not fear having their weapons wrested from them in combat. Indeed, anonymous firearms aid illegal traffickers (who have a lot of influence in certain parts of the world).

#+begin_quote
  And anything requiring ninja abilities could also be detrimental in battle.
#+end_quote

See above. Ninja are already capable of preparing gear in advance that does not have a meaningful chakra cost in battle, and in any case I doubt any such weapon could be on the same order of magnitude as the chakra cost of ninjutsu (which are often one-offs that are wasted if they miss).

#+begin_quote
  Seeing as ninja have very, very good reflexes and reaction times, it's reasonable that anything short of firearms and hand-thrown kunai would be dead weights instead of force multipliers.
#+end_quote

As mentioned in another comment, there are things like bows which are strictly superior to shuriken in the right context (e.g. sniping, or penetrating an enemy's guard). Besides, it seems like ninja's enhanced accuracy and reflexes cancel each other out - 99% of shuriken throws get blocked or dodged, whereas a faster or heavier weapon might not.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, restricted scrolls under the control of the Hokage, or clan heads. Not scroll-shop scrolls.
#+end_quote

I don't recall any evidence of this. While we see no scroll-shops, nor is there any evidence that technique scrolls in general are restricted.

#+begin_quote
  To get back to the original problem, a technological society without modern transportation (or better) is absolutely absurd
#+end_quote

Maybe not /that/ absurd. If we're sticking with the Sengoku period as the inspiration for the Narutoverse, the transport tech seems about right, and ninja are naturally fast enough to cross countries on foot, while apparently having no need to transport goods or equipment on a regular basis.

#+begin_quote
  but one in which all firearms are replaced with magic warfare seems pretty reasonable to me.
#+end_quote

I think my original argument was that they aren't /replaced/ with magic warfare, because magic warfare is much too complicated and expensive to fill the same niche. Instead, the thing we have in place of firearms to supplement the magic warfare, kunai etc., is strangely inadequate to the task.

  But I liiiiiike iiiiiit!

Language evolution is in the hands of the people. If you truly want your variant term to become accepted, simply get enough people to use it in their daily lexicon.
