  Yeah, and all this for a basic concept as a thing that shoots things, a simple mechanism that anyone can use.
#+end_quote

You're doing that term-shifting thing again. A thing that shoots things could be a bow or a sling, which anyone can use with a minimum of training (though accuracy is another matter - but that's true of any ranged weapon). Narutoverse ninja don't even have those, relying instead on throwing weapons which offer no force multiplier.

  Man, I read your fic thrice over already. It was said by Tariki during his interrogation. "You know what happens when too many ninja live long enough to get real strong? Of course you don't, you idealistic little prick. They start getting ambitious."
#+end_quote

Setting aside the fact that Tariki is ridiculously cynical and his words should be taken with a pinch of salt, the hypothetical scenario he's describing is that of lots of Genin surviving long enough to reach Chūnin or Jōnin status. At that point, they are already strong and have a bunch of techniques, irrespective of what they were doing at Genin level. I guess unless you go full-on Tariki and object to teaching Genin ninjutsu just on the grounds that /then they'd survive/...

As for numbers, there are several problems with a straightforward armed coup like you're suggesting. First, there can only be one Kage. Numbers will only make competition for the top seat worse among would-be insurrectionists, and we haven't seen any ninja radical enough to propose a different form of government. In fact, political savvy is not something we see among ninja until we get to the top echelons of authority (who need it as part of their job).

Second, as we see with Sand, a ninja village relies on daimyo support to function. Nothing is going to freak a daimyo out like watching his opposite number getting torn down by the ravenous masses.

Third, internal conflict in a village, especially conflict which ends up getting a bunch of Jōnin killed, is an open invitation to all comers to invade, and people around here don't seem all that shy about that sort of thing (three world wars in eighty years).

Fourth, real-world history suggests that what creates coups isn't a high number of contenders but more a combination of ambition and resourcefulness in the right/wrong people (to simplify the matter). And while power does beget ambition, culturally ninja are brought up to seek personal rather than political power. Besides, in canon Danzō is the only one to want to be Hokage for power reasons - everyone else either treats it as a burden (e.g Tsunade) or as an achievement to be earned (e.g. Naruto).

  But in time and with people checked over and over again by their mentors.
#+end_quote

Checked for what?

#+begin_quote
  Nobody really learns a new techniques from the library, they get taught.
#+end_quote

We know that technique scrolls are a thing, and indeed we see ninja learn things from them on multiple occasions (including Episode 1).

  Anyway that's like, what Kishimoto thought was cool
#+end_quote

The entire Narutoverse setting summarised in eight words.

  I think "summatorially" ought to be a word.
#+end_quote

Then people might confuse it with "summarily", or think it was related to "summarise".
