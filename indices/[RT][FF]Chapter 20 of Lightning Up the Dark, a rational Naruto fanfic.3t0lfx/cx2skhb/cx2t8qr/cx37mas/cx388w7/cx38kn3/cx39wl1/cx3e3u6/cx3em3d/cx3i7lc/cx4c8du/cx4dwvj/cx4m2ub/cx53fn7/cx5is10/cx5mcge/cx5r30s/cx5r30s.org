  And this is already a less trivial task than inventing a firearm.

I dunno, it took 400 years between the discovery of gunpowder and the invention of firearms, and then another 600 before they became anything like modern weapons in terms of safety, reliability and firing speed.

  Oh come on, you wrote it yourself, giving more jutsu to genin would be asking for rebellion!
#+end_quote

I don't think Genin rebellion is a real concern for village authorities (are you maybe thinking of a different fic?). Genin are the most brainwashed kind of ninja, fresh out of training before real-world experience/disillusionment can take effect. Canon also shows them dying in droves against individual J≈çnin-level opponents. Extra techniques are not enough to overcome that barrier, especially if you don't have the experience or chakra levels to use them to their full potential.

  And how much overpowered would an intelligent user (like your Naruto) be if they had yet another basic technique?
#+end_quote

That happens anyway, though. It's not like there's a ban on Genin learning new techniques, and in principle a Genin could learn all the techniques they have time and talent for just by asking around. Plenty of people would know basic Genin-level ones to teach them. I'm just proposing that the learning of new techniques could be more guided and standardised, rather than haphazard and self-motivated.

  Ninjutsu stack exponentially, not summatorially
#+end_quote

They ought to, but I'm not sure that's really the case except with individual synergies like Kiba's Beastman Clone and Fang techniques. Whenever I think of canon ninjutsu users, it's more a case of them being able to handle more different situations as they learn more ninjutsu, rather than getting a huge boost in specific ones they can already manage. Maybe that's part of what makes Naruto's Multiple Shadow Clone Technique so powerful - it's already applicable to so many different situations.

I think the opposite of "exponential" is "linear".
