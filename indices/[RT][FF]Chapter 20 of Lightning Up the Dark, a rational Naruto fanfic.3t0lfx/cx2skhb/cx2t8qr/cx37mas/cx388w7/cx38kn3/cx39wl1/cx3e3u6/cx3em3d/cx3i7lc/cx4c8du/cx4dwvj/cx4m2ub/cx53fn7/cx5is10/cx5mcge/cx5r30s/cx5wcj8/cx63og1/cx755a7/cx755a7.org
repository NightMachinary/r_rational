  You're doing that term-shifting thing again. A thing that shoots things could be a bow or a sling, which anyone can use with a minimum of training (though accuracy is another matter - but that's true of any ranged weapon). Narutoverse ninja don't even have those, relying instead on throwing weapons which offer no force multiplier.

The Narutoverse /definitely/ has bows.

For one thing, Sasuke's Susaano uses one. For another, we see a flashback episode where Itachi takes Sasuke boar hunting, and Sasuke uses a bow to do so. I also believe that some of Gato's hired thugs used bows.
