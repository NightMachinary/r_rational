Kishimoto has canonically stated that there /are/ computers, but they are "maybe 8-bit...definitely not 16-bit."

So, yeah, no laptops. Also, the idea that they can have chips with the level of technology shown is laughable. I actually had a serious rant about this in Team Anko, but I'm not going to hijack your thread. Suffice to say, the tech levels in Naruto are made of stupid.
