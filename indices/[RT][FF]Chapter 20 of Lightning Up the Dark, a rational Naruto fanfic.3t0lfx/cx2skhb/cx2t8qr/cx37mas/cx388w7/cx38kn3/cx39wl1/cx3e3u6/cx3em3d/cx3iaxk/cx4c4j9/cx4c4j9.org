  We're only shown what amounts to education in ninja villages, of those children that want to become ninja. I'm not sure it's ever implied that the Academy functions as a normal school for civilians.

On the other hand, schizo tech notwithstanding, the Narutoverse appears to be set in a version of the Sengoku Period, the heyday of the ninja and the time when daimyo ruled, during which most Japanese commoners were illiterate. While the existence of bookshops suggests that this is not the case here, it nevertheless gives some context for the level of education we should expect of this culture.
