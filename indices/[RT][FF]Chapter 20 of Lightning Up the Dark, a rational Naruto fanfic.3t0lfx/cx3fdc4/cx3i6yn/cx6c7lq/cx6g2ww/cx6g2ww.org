Sasuke and Sakura named their daughter Salad.

Well, /technically/ they named her [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sarada_Uchiha][Sarada]], but Sarada sounds like a japanese pronunciation of Salad and the japanese name Boruto of Naruto and Hinata's son was changed to Bolt in the english so people thought Sarada might be like Boruto, just an english word with japanese pronunciation, and the fan nickname stuck.
