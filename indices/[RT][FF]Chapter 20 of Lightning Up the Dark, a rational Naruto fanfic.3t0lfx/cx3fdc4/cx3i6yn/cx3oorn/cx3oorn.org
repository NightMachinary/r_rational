good to know someone else is aware of [[https://imgur.com/a/gc6Cc][keikaku]] hehehe ^{translator's} ^{note} ^{keikaku} ^{means} ^{plan}

Also, on another note, in that one movie where Naruto goes in the past and meets his dad, I never got why /Naruto's/ memory had to be erased too. I mean, I get it from continuity perspective, can't have Naruto finding out who his parents are in a movie before he does in canon, but like, what was their explanation in-universe? I get Minato and Kakashi's memories needing to be erased, they can't know about the future, but there was no good reason to erase Naruto's memory too. Naruto was just about to return to the future, so how was him knowing about the past going to affect anything lol?
