You might want to stop following it -- the ending is ridiculously unsatisfying. When Kishimoto turned Kurama into a rainbow-maned alicorn I just gave up. And don't even get me started on what he did to Orochimaru; he carefully set this guy up as a psychotic maniac, and then he has him get hit on the head /one time/ and suddenly become a Buddhist monk who spends all his time braiding flowers into Kurama's hair and apologizing to everyone in verse? And verse that doesn't even scan, for that matter. You can't rhyme 'ridiculously' with 'humongously', Kishimoto! The ACCents are on the wrong syllAble!

Oh and, in case it's not obvious, all of the above is a joke.
