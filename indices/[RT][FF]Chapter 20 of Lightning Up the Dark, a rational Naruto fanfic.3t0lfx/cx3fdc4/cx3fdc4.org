So, nobody's going to talk about this?

My two cents: Eh. At least it's better than his stated canon motivations of +painting with all the colors of the world+ learning all the jutsus in the world.

I don't know why he was so obsessed with it, anyways. Kakashi is supposed to have learned thousands of jutsus, but we never see him use more than a small handful of them.
