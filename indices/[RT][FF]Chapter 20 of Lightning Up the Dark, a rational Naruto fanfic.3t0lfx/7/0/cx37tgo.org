One answer is that during the first exchange Shiina was too busy being bewildered by the other team's strange behaviour (and in fact considering the possibility of psychological warfare). The camera thing in itself could easily have been taken as preparation to use a secret technique Gaara didn't want seen by the examiners (not implausible, given the presence of Bloodline Limit ninja in the exam).

By the time of the statement about lungs, on the other hand, she was aware that Gaara was both psychologically aberrant and fully powerful enough to do what he was saying.
