I don't think that's true. The Cambist is shown to be good at exchanging one thing for another. If the problem were not couched in the form of finding a price, he might not be able to generate any better advice than "reform, spend your money on charity, don't have wild semiconsensual sex orgies and murder people"; which presumably Lord Iron knew perfectly well already. The relevant insight is not "a life of virtue and service"; it is "I happen to have one such, with which I am willing to part".
