My first proper update and I'm just in time for the title drop! I picked this story up a couple of days ago, finished it in under twenty-four hours, and already want to go for a reread, so let me join in with the chorus of praise here.

Anyway, going through the chapter.

  Well, no, that was the wrong question. The real question was the proper way to minmax
#+end_quote

In my head, this just buries the question. After all, Juniper's got to decide what to minmax /for/. Genre conventions and what he's been through so far would push him towards trying to be a combat monster, but it's not like that's the only option. He could probably go off and, I don't know, open up a bakery if he wanted (or join an acting troupe). Or he could try upping his social/intelligence abilities and being the guy who hires out adventurers to go out and complete quests for him. There are so many options if you step back from trying to break the game and instead look at changing the game.

On a semi-related note, Joon's earlier speculation on whether the game is railroading him (w/ the cowardice trait and the princess plothook) is making me think he should check in with Arthur's writing about Refusing the Call -- if Arthur was dealing with the same problems there might be a clue there.

  it was clear that the game was actually changing things in my head.
#+end_quote

Somehow, I keep forgetting that this exists as a very good reason not to go messing about with Mental abilities (or to a lesser extent pick up skills, raise loyalties, or interact with the game /at all/ really). I don't think I've seen another litRPG or story that really delves into this whole extinction of self idea. It's terrifying and I love it.

It's also ramping up the existentialism a whole lot which brings us to:

#+begin_quote
  WARNING: COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT HAS CAUSED PERSONALITY NETWORK TO EXCEED HOLISTIC INTEGRITY THRESHOLDS. REVERSING AND REFACTORING EMULATION TO WITHIN HOLISTIC INTEGRITY THRESHOLDS. ENABLING TRI-STRATUM PSEUDO-INTELLIGENCE INJECTION SETTING TO COMPENSATE.
#+end_quote

Well that's terrifying. I was not expecting that from this self proclaimed self-insert litRPG portal fantasy that seems to be sort of moving towards harem shenanigans and general overpoweredness. That's actually a little bit bone chilling as far as plot twists go.

But there are probably clues buried here. A cursory google of “Tri-stratum” points to a theory of intelligence that seems to match up at least a little with the ways skills and abilities operate (although that could just be a bit of coincidence given that they're both modelling similar things). I kind of want to skim through Eclipse Phase in case there's any inspiration for the themes/execution here, because that might point in certain directions for this story.

#+begin_quote
  And the message, about exceeding personality bounds, said that they had put in bounds to keep me from becoming not-Juniper.
#+end_quote

I can't quite decide if this is comforting or not. It /probably/ is, but everything going on here is somewhat horrifying, for obvious reasons. It's enough to throw everything about everything into doubt.

Still, I guess that the only real answer at this point is to “push forward, try not to think about it, focus on other things, do what needs doing” like Joon said.... Although the fact that he holds that attitude, and conviently has a history that leads him to respect the world as real, is in itself suspect because if I were an all powerful DM, those are the values I would want him to hold

That aside, I doubt Juniper is going to be able to avoid picking away at this, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this revelation shakes things up going forward.

Also, I find it sort of funny that in a chapter called “In Which Juniper Stares At His Character Sheet”, the character sheet never actually makes it on screen (not that I think it should have).
