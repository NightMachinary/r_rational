  if you change out the part of you that is run by intelligence why should you be considered a different person anymore than if you lifted weights to change the part of you that is muscle mass.

I like the Animorphs: The Reckoning take on a similar-ish problem, which points out the "distinction between the object and the meta---between that-which-changes and that-which-guides-the-change" (and that just turning the dial up on all traits equally might lead to a problem, because even if those traits are kept in a constant ratio, the payoffs from them might vary at different rates).

Getting overwritten by some higher power is a problem because it's not a natural change, or one that you would lead yourself to. Normally when people change over time there's still a continuity of self, where you can trace a clear line between who you were and who you are, and all the steps in between. That's not really the case if suddenly something outside of you reaches in (even if you're "choosing" it by applying points) and starts fiddling around with the building blocks of your selfhood. Suddenly there are these big open question about how related the different versions of yourself are to one another, and whether the different states could actually link up to one another without this outside intervention - the clear line is broken, or at least blurred.

(I think the closest real world analogue here might be people who suffer from brain damage leading to personality changes/amnesia/etc.)

I guess ultimately this is a question of how you want to measure identity/self, which is somewhat arbitrary. Personally I think you need to look at it in a dynamic sense more than a static one - who you are at a given point in time has to be considered in the context of how you got there.

And while it's really hard to differentiate between internal/external influences, or to have a definition that doesn't arise at least in part from "outside" yourself, the idea of having an unknown force that is operating under unknown guidelines and is separate from everything else in your reality suddenly rewrite everything about you is a little more outside influence than I'm entirely comfortable with.

But the fact that the Game seems to be trying to preserve Juniper's personality seems like it would be good news - if you trust the program, you can probably ignore a great deal of this. Although that's another issue entirely..
