Fixed all the typos, thank you.

As for the other two:

I changed it to (WIS * (WIS - 1)), though really it's possible that it's either that /or/ ((MEN - 1) * (MEN - 2)), because they've so far gone up in tandem. I think there's not really a point in there being a digression on that there, except for the sake of completeness.

I changed the wording somewhat to clarify:

#+begin_quote
  then I would put points into PHY when the skill was capped on SPD (putting them into POW when it was capped on POW)
#+end_quote

If you can go to three times the primary attribute and five times the secondary, then you're always in one of three states:

1. Limited by the primary
2. Limited by the secondary
3. Limited by both

And those states help define what you should spend your points on to end up with an optimal build.
