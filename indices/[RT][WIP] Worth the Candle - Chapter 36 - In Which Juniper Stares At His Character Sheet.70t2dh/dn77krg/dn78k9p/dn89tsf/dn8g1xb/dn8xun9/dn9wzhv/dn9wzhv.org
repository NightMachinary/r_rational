I would strongly prefer that you not.

I don't want to lose control of the rights, or have it be perceived that I've lost control of the rights. The story is also kind of a personal one for me that I want a tight leash on, especially since I think audio versions of text are prone to reinterpretation by the narrator, which makes me kind of queasy to think about, plus the fact that I can't go back and change or edit things (especially a concern as the story is ongoing).
