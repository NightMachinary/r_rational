I have /ideas,/ but I'm loathe to commit to anything. I also worry that saying how much is left can be a bit of a spoiler, albeit one that's nearly unavoidable after a work is complete.

There are fifteen planned major story arcs left, where "leaving Comfort" or "getting through Silmar City" is what I would define as a story arc, which means that we're (at a minimum) a quarter of the way done, and I should have all of /Worth the Candle/ completely written six to eight months from now, with a projected final word count of between 600K and 800K words.

But that's my idea of how long it will be, not how long it will /actually/ be, planning fallacy and all that, and none of this should be taken as a promise or even all that accurate of an estimate.
