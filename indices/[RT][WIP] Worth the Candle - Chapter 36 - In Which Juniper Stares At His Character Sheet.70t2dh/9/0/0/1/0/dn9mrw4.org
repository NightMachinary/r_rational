So far this story is quite a bit better than a lot of the litRPG published books available on kindle right now (I have read almost all of them and more are duds than gems). If you did a rewrite/edit and published it on kindle it would probably do really well since most people who are your current fans would want to read the new edited version and it would bring in way more new readers since most mainstream readers don't read web series. The author of the web series The Gam3 mentioned that he makes way more income from his kindle published re-writes than he does from his Patron account even though all his writing is already free on his website.

Disclaimer: I know very little about the publishing process so take my words with a grain of salt. My main point that your story is better than most published litRPG still stands though since I do know quite a bit about that. :)
