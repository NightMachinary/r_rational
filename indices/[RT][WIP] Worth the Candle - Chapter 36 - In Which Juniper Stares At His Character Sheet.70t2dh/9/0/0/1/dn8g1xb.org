Archive of Our Own has a download button in the top-right corner that allows you to download as EPUB, MOBI, or PDF. There's some stuff that doesn't come out quite right in that, but it's nothing that makes the story unreadable. (I have been meaning to make some changes to ensure that the auto-export works correctly, and that the story works fine without the custom CSS, but I would rather write than do any of that.)

I'm probably never going to monetize the story unless a publisher or agent approaches me about it, because I'd /really/ like to unlock the "publish a dead trees book" achievement. Of course, if I were serious about it, then I would probably be querying agents myself, or maybe just writing a manuscript and not putting anything online (because that tends to lower publication value unless you're Andy Weir or David Wong).
