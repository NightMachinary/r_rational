Great chapter.

Just a quick thought. The three substats of MEN don't seem, by themselves, to increase intelligence. Cunning, knowledge and wisdom are all things that can be learned & improved through "natural" means, although your intelligence is probably a practical limiting factor, and so increasing these stats beyond a certain level probably does require increasing overall intelligence if the system didn't want to cheat in some way. My question is, does increasing MEN (or any of the superstats) have an additional synergistic effect over and above just increasing the three substats? There is a separate number for MEN, PHY and SOC; is this just a representation of the substats or does it have some meaning of its own? I'm extremely curious to see what happens if he increases CHA and POI (so his SOC stats become 3/4/3) - will SOC also increase (from 3 to 4)? If it does, that's some evidence that it's just a function of the substats, while if it doesn't, that suggests SOC might have some function of its own. It might be worth the potentially inefficient use of attribute points to test this out; it might be an additional reason to favour less specialisation.

Overall, very impressed with the story so far and looking forward to seeing where it goes.
