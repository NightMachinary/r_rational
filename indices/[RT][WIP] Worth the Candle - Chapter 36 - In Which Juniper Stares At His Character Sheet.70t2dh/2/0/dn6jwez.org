If that's the case, I'm curious to see what happens if he pumps Soc to a similar level, since at least Ins seems to imply that it also hones your ability to think. It seems like capping how intelligent he can be in every way he can tune, provided you trust the game's claim to retain his essential personality, would be the biggest gain he can presently access.

That being said, I feel like he's basically ignoring how mages tend to work in RPGs... His current magic may be crap, but in genre those abilities tend to grow quadratically, with late gains making up for a puny start. Gem magic 6 may be useful only for a light show and blood magic 12 only useful for some epic jumps, but Gem magic 20 and blood magic 20 might make him into a Dragonball character. You just have to see how those skills level.
