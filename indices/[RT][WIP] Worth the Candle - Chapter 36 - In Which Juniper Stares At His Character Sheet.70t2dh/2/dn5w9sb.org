So, if I'm reading the error message right, Joon will not feel any smarter or be able to reason better if he continues to pump MEN, but he will gain "pseudo-intelligence" that will allow him to use skills as if he were smarter. Like being able to program really well even if he couldn't reason through the logic or math being used, he'll be able to cast spells or use magic that normal people have to be able to reason about sort of "intuitively"

Nice way to sidestep the problem of your main character making himself smarter than the author.
