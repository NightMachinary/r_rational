Amazing chapter! Had all the oomph you'd expect for a turning point. Also I've been speculating where Uther could be and it feels like some more flags were set off here...

--------------

Typos:

The generalist approach would have left me with *an* 9

The puzzle took *for* form of blocks

blood magic was â€˜hidden' MAD because it was mostly *+a+* melee-combat oriented

but +I couldn't+ I couldn't get the clonal kit

and (if) it was possible within Aerb

--------------

Other misc. that I might have misread:

#+begin_quote
  which meant that it was probably in the form of (MEN * (MEN - 1))
#+end_quote

When Joon had 12 as the mental exhaustion cap, didn't he have 5 MEN (per the last stat sheet)?

#+begin_quote
  then I would put points into PHY when capped on SPD (putting them into POW when capped on POW)
#+end_quote

Putting into POW when capped on POW? I didn't understand this part.
