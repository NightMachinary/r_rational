So I've been bingeing this fic for the last few days, and I have to say that I'm really enjoying it!

This chapter certainly took a dark turn, but that's probably to be expected when the story concerns someone inside a game. Especially when your own mind is directly mechanised! It actually seems to show a degree of caring on the part of the DM (to use Jun's name for whatever agency is running this show) that raising mental stats appears to insert thoughts into his stream of consciousness where possible, as opposed to directly altering his mental processes themselves. This seems /somewhat/ less intrusive on his personhood, as fuzzy a concept as that is to begin with. The fact that the agency creating the game took that kind of trouble is certainly interesting.
