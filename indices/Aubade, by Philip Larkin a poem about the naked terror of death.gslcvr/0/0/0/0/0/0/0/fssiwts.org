  Long run 'it is that hopeless': are you referring to this universe's apparent second law of thermodynamics (for which the something-rather-than-nothing existence of the universe in the first place represents hope of future meaningful discoveries), to the statistical likelihood of meaningful survival (for which strategies can already be imagined, such as as a fallback method lots and lots of far-away-from-each-other backups, and/or for instance redundant consciousness with many far-away-from-each-other communicating points), or something else?
