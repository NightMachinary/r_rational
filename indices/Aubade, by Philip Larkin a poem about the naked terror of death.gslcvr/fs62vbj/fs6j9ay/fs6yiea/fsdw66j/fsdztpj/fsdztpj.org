It is that hopeless, though, at least in the very long run of 'total emptiness for ever'.

It's not the primary focus of the poem, but to me it seems like 'we can't escape, Yet can't accept. One side will have to go.', accompanied by the coming light of day, is meant to provide a spot of - not quite hope - but at least sufficient desperation to achieve all that hope would. And I'm satisfied with that. It's a lot more honest than phony raa-raaing would be.
