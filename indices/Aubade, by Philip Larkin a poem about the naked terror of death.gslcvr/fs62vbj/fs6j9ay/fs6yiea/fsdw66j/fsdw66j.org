Hopefully not impossible, but yes.

From the rest of the poem I'm inclined to interpret the author's 'One side will have to go' as--consistent with other parts--taking our 'going' as the foregone conclusion, though I would certainly applaud if the author had intended a twist.

'know that we can't escape': 'knowing' suggesting a truth rather than a possibly-false impression.

'Death is no different whined at than withstood.': true (attitude of complaining versus attitude of acceptance), but the hope of an attitude of fighting against it is either ignored or lumped in with 'whining' as no more meaningful than acceptance.

'Most things may never happen: this one will': again, treating it as something certain to happen, rather than something that one could do something about.

'And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.' Similarly certain (nothing more true than that it will be soon).

'The sure extinction that we travel to', similarly certain.

My impression is thus that the author either is taking death as a given or writing a narrator who is taking death as a given--it's conceivable that the author in writing such a narrator is subtly trying to suggest to the reader (maybe also using reverse psychology?) that it's not as hopeless as the narrator thinks, but I feel I have insufficient evidence for this to be convincing.
