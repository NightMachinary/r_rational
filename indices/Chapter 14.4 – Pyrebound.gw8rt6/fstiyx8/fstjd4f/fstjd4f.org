Holy cow, that was quick. I was planning to leave the news to somebody else, since it's not really advancing the main plot and it's been a month coming. So I felt a bit awkward about putting myself forward with this. But it took a month because I started it five times, only to delete and start over. Hopefully the next update will be quicker coming.

All of which is to say, "you're welcome."
