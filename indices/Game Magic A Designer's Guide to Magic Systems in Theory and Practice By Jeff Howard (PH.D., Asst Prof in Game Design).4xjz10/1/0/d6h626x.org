Dominions 4 is great; it's one of my favourite games of all time, and I'm pretty active on the subreddit [[/r/Dominions4]] It's got great flavor. It's probably most similar to Ars Magica stuff, from Tabletop roleplaying. For those interested, I'd warn that the game has a learning 'curve' like a brick wall, and 90's era sprite-based graphics, and finally the AI doesn't play particularly well so you really end up learning by playing against real people over games lasting literal months of realtime. However, if you can look past those issues, you'll find a basically unparalleled depth and breadth of strategy that make other games feel boring.

On the book that's the nominal topic of this thread: From the TOC, I think it looks like this is trying to be an overview of a lot of things that have gone before. Which I mostly don't need, from having played or read roughly ~75% of the things they list personally already. I mean, I don't need 8 pages on Eternal Darkness - I played Eternal Darkness for 30 hours to beat the entire story 3 times for the secret ending, I could /write/ a dozen pages on it myself quite easily. Similar feelings for roughly three-quarters of the other things it lists.
