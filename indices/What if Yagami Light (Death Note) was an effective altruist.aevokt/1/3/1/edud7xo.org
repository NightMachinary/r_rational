  it makes me really sad that people who consider themselves "rationalists" and "effective altruists" could hold those views.

I mean, are you surprised? You're saying that like it's a failure of rationalism as a philosophy or something, but really, every tribe has extreme members with unpleasant opinions. Politics is hard and subjective and all that.

That's not a mark against effective altruism or rationalism.
