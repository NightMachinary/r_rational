From your Wikipedia link:

#+begin_quote
  The self-report measures were as follows: openness to experience was estimated to have a 57% genetic influence, extraversion 54%, conscientiousness 49%, neuroticism 48%, and agreeableness 42%.[81]
#+end_quote

so based on a self-report study of twins saying conscientiousness is 49% effected by genetics vs other factors, you are for murdering all criminals (and before you claim strawman, this is exactly what the Kira thread I criticized was defending. Pulling out some softer social program 'eugenics lite' philosophy would be strawmaning /me/.)

Tight case.

Welcome to my shitlist.
