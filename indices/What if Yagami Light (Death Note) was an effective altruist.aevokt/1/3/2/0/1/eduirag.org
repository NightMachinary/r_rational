  The poster is advocating some of the... least-supported aspects of eugenics - namely that criminals and criminality are inherited

Turkheimer's First Law of Behavior Genetics: [[https://jaymans.wordpress.com/2012/12/31/all-human-behavioral-traits-are-heritable/][everything is heritable]].

Specifically...

1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ][IQ is heritable]].
2. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Heritability][Conscientiousness is heritable]].
3. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_A#Aggression_and_the_%22Warrior_gene%22][Propensity to violence is heritable]].

If you don't think that stupider, more impulsive, more violent people are more likely to become criminals, I have a bridge to sell you.

Or, as psychiatrist [[/u/ScottAlexander][u/ScottAlexander]] noted on [[http://web.archive.org/web/20170511203009/https://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/160215100256/slatestarscratchpad-public-service-announcement][his Tumblr]]:

  Public service announcement: if you have a kid with some kind of horrifying predatory criminal, and now your kid is a horrifying predatory criminal, and you have no idea how this happened because the father left before he was even born and your new husband is a great guy and you've both always done your best to raise your kid well and give him a good home, your kid's psychiatrist will listen empathetically to your story, and then empathetically give you a copy of /The Nurture Assumption/.

  ...maybe not actually. But it will definitely be on his mind. And maybe it would get people to stop having so many kids with horrifying predatory criminals. Seriously, I'm doing inpatient child psychiatry now and I get multiple cases like this /every day/.

  Seriously, don't have kids with horrifying predatory criminals. THIS NEVER HELPS.

  HAVE I MENTIONED NOT HAVING KIDS WITH HORRIFYING PREDATORY CRIMINALS? I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A SURPRISINGLY UNDEREXPLORED STRATEGY.

If you want to tell me eugenics is unethical, that's one thing. But don't tell me it's unsupported. It isn't.
