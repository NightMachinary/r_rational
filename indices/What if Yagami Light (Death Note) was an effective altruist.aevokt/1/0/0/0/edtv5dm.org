  Out of curiosity, what's your stance on the trolley problem?
#+end_quote

I like [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K9ZaZXDnL3SEmYZqB/ends-don-t-justify-means-among-humans][Eliezers answer]], though I don't know that I fully agree with it.

If you really pushed me on it, I would say something along the lines that, yes, there is a moral distinction between killing people and letting them die and sacrificing someone else for the greater good is not a morally defensible decision.

That said, you can always make the thought experiment dramatic enough to make my intuitions flip the other way (sacrifice one innocent guard to prevent an omnicidal villain from getting to the nuclear launch codes), so my position is mostly that I don't really know and that we shouldn't judge people being put into impossible decisions whichever way they go.

  What would you do with the Death Note? Would you ever use it at all?
#+end_quote

Me personally? Definitely not. I don't have the stomach for using a weapon that powerful in a consistent enough manner to yield net utility for the world, so even from an extremist utilitarian position I would reject using it. Can I imagine a mostly good, mostly rational character that would decide to use the Death Note? Yes (and I would read the hell out of that story).
