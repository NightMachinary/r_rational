That's actually an amazing idea. I was thinking, of instead of having targeted people die in a 'normal' way, why not have them act like zombies (possibly until they die of a heart attack). It's a random idea which could come across as a) supernatural or b) a reason for an unusual circumstance. A bunch of people dying of heart attacks is suspicious, and people look for a reason. 'A zombie virus spreading through the mob' comes with a 'reason' - virus spreads between people in close contact, and now people are looking for the answer to a different mystery - where did the zombie virus come from? This also has the benefit of having some of the people on the list go after other people - less 'heart attacks' and more 'zombie attacks'. It's just something I thought up (Light as a ~Necromancer) that would probably be better than what Netflix did.
