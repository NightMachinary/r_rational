One of the things I noticed was that Kira's methods only took out the target.

If it doesn't work, they die of a heart attack. Why waste the opportunity to find out what's possible? Fashion, fame, fortune, politics, religion, sports, literature... (And if one must show one's hand, why heart attacks, when you can use lightning, flames, planes, or pestilence?)
