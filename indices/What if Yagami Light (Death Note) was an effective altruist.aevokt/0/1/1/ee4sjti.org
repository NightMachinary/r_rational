The logistics of collecting the children for slaughter would be pretty dystopian.

Parents tend to get pretty attached to their children, and you're unlikely to get enough donations for the system to work. In particular you need to worry about the effect of slowing death on population growth and reign in births accordingly so you're talking about confiscating children by force.

And preserving adults at the expense of children is likely to lead to social and genetic stagnation. It would probably be strictly worse for the human species than the status quo in the long run.
