Refer to my quote above. That rule is canon, but unknown to the characters in the story.

Also, consider this: /The Shinigami are not actually gods of death./

The vast majority of deaths happen without their influence. They don't shepherd souls to any afterlife. They barely have any power to influence the world at all.

What they are is a species of magical parasite. They sit around and occasionally drain some lifespan if they are about to run out.

So the Death Note's primary cosmic function is as a feeding tube for shinigami. A magical lifespan transfer device.

Why should this primary function stop working when the book is brought to earth?
