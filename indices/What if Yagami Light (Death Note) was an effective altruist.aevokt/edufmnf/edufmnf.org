Honestly I would start by writing down every dictator's name in the book, starting with those dictators who live in a quasi-democratic country and are trying to make their countries even less democratic. This lack of political stability is what's causing severe poverty and slow economic progress in many developing nations. Not to mention that they tend to resort to severe repression in order to maintain their power.

So first on the list would be people like Erdogan, Poland's prime minister, Viktor Orban, etc. Going after criminals is small potatoes and not really worth your time. Besides, by keeping the number of victims somewhat small you can vary the causes and times of death enough that even if people realize that evil leaders are dying, they wouldn't be able to notice a pattern in terms of who the killer is. Unlike with criminals, every leader's pictures are well-known and published by multiple newspapers and magazines so people might not even realize you need both a name and a face to use the Death Note.
