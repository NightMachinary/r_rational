What if

a) he had the criminals turn themselves in before dying? (With a little more variety than heart attacks, but an emphasis on health conditions which people who have them would know about, so it can look like them wanting to set things right before they die.)

b) instead of dying of heart attacks, the criminals are incapacitated at inconvenient times (by terminal health issues), so their deaths aren't 'out of the blue'.

c) A bunch of criminals are caught, and some prisons are hit by an epidemic. (Instead of people fearing the wrath of the god who stops hearts, people don't want to go to jail and get sick and die.)
