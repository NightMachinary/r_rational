I think the context makes this different to traditional assassinations or warfare. If corrupt leaders reliably commit suicide writing "I REPENT" in their own blood, it will have an effect.

On top of this, attacks can have a protective role. One of the major inhibitors of good people in bad societies is simply that the bad people aren't afraid to use violence, and jail or kill their competitors. God's wrath descending on the perpetrators is at the very least going to act as /some/ kind of protection against this, and likely legitimize those protected by it in the eyes of the populace.

The "only words can fight words" thing is an addictive phrase, but I think we've seen a fair bit of evidence that actually you can fight philosophies with bullets. The thoughts don't live in the air, or even the books, they have to be carried and transmitted through human brains, and if you take out the right ones you stop the spread. This is especially true from extremes like "kill all the radical terrorist imams".
