I used to go to [[/r/slatestarcodex]] a lot, and stopped going specifically because of the prevalence of that kind of thing, not just in how much it was posted, but also how much it was upvoted. If you want to argue that it's isolated people there, no more prevalent than they are here, I would disagree with that; I think it's a persistent problem with the culture there, which is largely a result of the moderation. This is based mostly on me spending a lot of time there a few years ago, and dipping my toe in every once in awhile hasn't changed my opinion.
