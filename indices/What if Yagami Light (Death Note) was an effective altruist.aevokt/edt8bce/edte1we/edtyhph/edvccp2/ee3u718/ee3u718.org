That lasted /months/, and it was terrible, mostly because a lot of people really, really think that free speech should be the driving consideration for every mod decision, or are worried that it's a slippery slope to arbitrarily removing people for expressing their views, or are worried that there will be chilling effects, that wrong and/or vile views should be met head-on with vocal debate, etc. All valid concerns, IMO, but it requires this place to turn into "debate a Nazi" with far too much frequency for my tastes, which really gets in the way of our core mission (sharing and discussing rational fiction).

Part of the issue was that someone like that can toe the line fairly closely and take advantage of every mechanism in place to ensure that people get a fair shake and mods don't act too hastily. It's arguing for white nationalism in such a way that you're being as oblique as possible, until eventually you slip up and say that you want to kill the Jews.

In the future, I'll be more vocal about advocating for immediate ban. The whole thing left a very bad taste in my mouth.
