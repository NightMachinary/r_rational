Out of curiosity, what's your stance on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem][trolley problem]]?

- Would you pull a lever if it made a train run over 1 guy instead of 5?
- Would you push a fat guy under the train to make it stop before it hits 5 people down the line?
- If you were a rural doctor with multiple dying patients, and an innocent dude walked into your village, and you could save 5 patients by harvesting his organs, would you?

I have no opinion on the issue one way or another, I'm still trying to figure it out, so I'm curious what are some good arguments pro/against that?

What would you do with the Death Note? Would you ever use it at all?
