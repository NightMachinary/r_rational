If Yagami was an effective altruist, he would've realised that treating the symptoms doesn't cure the disease. He's a lone actor, and he has to be a lone actor due to the murderous nature of his power. That in mind, if he uses the note at all, it is best done as a method to discretely give himself enough wealth to begin distorting the world in his favour via the conventional means of bribery and corruption, and then to use the note to take out major locii of organized criminal networks. Beyond this, targeted execution of certain politicians may have a beneficial effect. Also, he could probably edit society's preferences by using the note to exacerbate problems in media-sensational ways. Suppose Light wasn't to end the Yakuza. Then, he could use the death note to cause a bunch of them to do something outrageous to Japanese sensibilities, while remaining sufficiently within the baliwick of things that it is concievable a Yakuza gangster would do. Perhaps Light believes that weapons are too accessible: he can streamline stricter regulation by scheduling a spate of successful knife and sword attacks in preschools.

There's all kinds of levers to move society in a Death Note, if you're rational enough to consider it's potential, and disgusting enough to actually use them. The lesson for us here is that Light was a Level Hollywood Intelligent character.
