The problem is that, contrary to famous historical figures, death solves very few important problems. Effective altruism is aimed at doing good most efficiently, so death note isn't a great tool for it.

Many of the people you might think to kill first, are /also/ holding things together while they're awful. Western capitalist republics and all the high living standards they have aren't the result of a mere lack of dictators. Rather they're the result of a cultural value system that most people in the west share. People on both right and left generally agree that we have a right to life liberty and pursuing our individual happiness. We generally agree that individual freedoms/autonomy are important even when we disagree on specifics. We generally agree that all people have value and some minimum amount of 'human rights' even when we disagree what exactly those rights should be. We generally praise people who work hard, are frugal, and are generous towards others.

Kill a dictator creating a power vacuum in a country which has neither these shared values, nor the prosperity required to allow the vast majority of people to survive /while being virtuous/ (i.e. not stealing to eat), and you won't get our results. Unfortunately you can make very little headway towards instilling virtues and a culture that leads to prosperity with death.

If it were me, I'm not even certain that I'd use it to say, kill all the radical terrorist imams. If I were aggressive and successful enough, maybe it slow their roll a bit, but it's not a long term solution because killing them doesn't destroy the philosophy. So in a few decades when I'm not paying attention, the ideas will come back and I won't be around to stop them--then what? The antidote to bad philosophy can only be a convincing case for good philosophy.

If not terrorist leaders and dictators, who else do we know the names of that we could righteously kill? At best you're playing The Punisher and killing people after their crimes. But you're not solving the problems that create more criminals.

Life is suffering /by default/. If you wake up naked and alone in the woods and every person and human creation has been removed from the planet, you're going to have a bad time. Death is just the capstone on that suffering. Most people aren't so evil that early death is a solution in any but the most cynically twisted way.
