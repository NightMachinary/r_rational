I'm not so sure about that. The plan that Light made before he forgot about it relied on predicting how he would act. If knowledge of the Death Note changed him, he would have predicted wrong.

I think he told Rem to give the Death Note to someone evil and selfish, because only then would Light be motivated to stop him. He even points out to himself and the audience that he could tell the new Kira was a different person because the old Kira had a morality remarkably similar to his own.
