that sounds exactly like he starting down a utilitarian path. get rid of all the criminals through obvious ways and undesirables through accidents.

​

wanting to make the world a better place (same goals as EA and hes very rational) through the use of force (the death note) is inevitably going to lead down a path of corruption. it doesn't matter how good your intentions are, or even how rational you are.

​

the path starts the moment he decides that hes going to make the world a better place through the killing of others. when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail. when all you have is a death note everyone looks like they should die.

​

the rest of the show is just the inevitable consequences of the first episode, and Ryuk knows this. he knows that the moment a human picks ups the book it brings misery and death to the user and everyone around them. this power can only end in death and destruction. the end is preordained and its only the journey that is interesting.

​

at first he starts with criminals and saving people then the second a problem shows up he immediately tries to solve it with the death note. he knows L isn't bad he knows the cops aren't bad but he kills them anyway because he is going to do good in the world and they are stopping him therefor they are bad. your with him or your against him.

​

i think the main issue is that he hasn't gone meta. the medium is the message. its the way we go about solving problems that matters not just the problems themselves.

​

you cant solve the worlds problems by forcing it. you try to kill to solve problems you create a world where people kill to solve their problems. change comes from within.

​

sure you can give me a examples where violence solves problems but in general (there are probably lots of real life edge cases) you are probably creating more problems then you are solving. your solution is worse than the problem.

​

sure hes got flaws who doesn't? what separates the normal person from becoming a tyrant is that they have to contend with others. if a power dynamic is overly tipped to one side then the one with the power will not care about the other. there is no reason to, from a game theory point of view.

​

sure you can give exceptions people with power who doesnt abuse it but it is the exception the proves the rule. a good tyrant is a rare thing.

​

anyway the way i see it is that the whole show is about his journey down this path, starting as a model person and ending with making the whole world a worse place.
