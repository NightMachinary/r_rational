Used effectively, the Death Note isn't so much an assassination tool as it is a mind control tool that happens to have the unfortunate side effect of killing the targets.

If Light's wants to wipe out crime, then targeting probable criminals for whom there isn't enough evidence to convict is ridiculous. Instead he should have the heads of terrorist organizations, drug cartels, and the like, all experience bouts of guilt, turn themselves in, share detailed records of the names, faces, and locations of their subordinates, and then commit suicide in jail.

The effectiveness of such a campaign would be boosted by cooperating with government agencies, but it might be difficult to do so without those agencies obtaining the Death Note, which would be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO][potentially disastrous]].

A less gruesome use of the Death Note is as a form of euthanasia. And this may have the beneficial side effect of extending other people's lives. One of the rules of the Death Note is as follows:

#+begin_quote
  A human death caused by the Death Note will indirectly lengthen some other human's original life even without a specific intention to lengthen a particular person's original life span in the human world.
#+end_quote

Combined with the fact that "A god of death can extend their own life by putting a name on their own note, but humans cannot.", this suggests that the stolen lifespan is randomly distributed to another human. So Euthanasia can redistribute lifespan from those who don't want it to someone who, statistically speaking, likely does.

This also calls to mind some sort of dystopian nightmare where the lifespan of humans is harvested from toddlers to make the rest of humanity immortal. Like how fetal souls are farmed for fuel in Worth the Candle, but significantly more horrific because the Death Note can't kill someone until 780 days after birth.

Hrm, and the sacrificed children would have to actually have the potential to live long lives absent the Death Note intervention, or else the Note can't harvest their counterfactual lifespan. So there would have to be facilities to raise them, kept mostly empty except for randomly spared 'calibration children'. It would be interesting to read a story from such a child's perspective.
