Although Eliezer meant it differently, this has long been the crux of the matter to me with a lot of these thought experiments. The situations they use don't embody the pure, crystalline dichotomy that is being claimed. Then people add things like the fat-man variant, where a random person asked the question is going to be influenced, likely subconsciously, by a whole lot of aspects that are then projected by academics onto unqualified claims about utilitarianism and deontology.

Sticking to likely, relatable models seems a lot truer to me, like discussing sending people to war, or experimental variants; [[https://slate.com/technology/2018/06/psychologys-trolley-problem-might-have-a-problem.html][one article I found that talks about a mice study]] points out:
