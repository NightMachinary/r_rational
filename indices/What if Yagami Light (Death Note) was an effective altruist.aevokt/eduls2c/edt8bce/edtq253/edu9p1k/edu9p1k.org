The most recent Sword Art Online: Alicization episode had a newly introduced character reveal their plan was literally to kill /everyone/ because she didn't like the state of the world, with the excuse that they were going to lose the war anyway. She offers to save 10 people the main character choses. (The main character then hugs this character and says she will be one of the ten people he saves.) Quite a culture shock to read [[/r/anime]] near unanimously declare her best girl and neutral good.
