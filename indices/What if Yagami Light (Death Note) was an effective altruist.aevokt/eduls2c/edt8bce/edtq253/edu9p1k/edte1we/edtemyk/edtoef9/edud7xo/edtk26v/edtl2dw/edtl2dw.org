Nazism and Eugenics are pretty intertwined. The poster is advocating some of the ugliest and least-supported aspects of eugenics - namely that criminals and criminality are inherited and that therefor all undesirables should simply be killed. This is a core piece of Nazi mentality and policies. While historically Nazism was specific to Germany and white supremacy, the /class or mode of thinking/ it refers to -- namely that "people like me are good, and not good (ie. not like me) people should be killed" -- is what is at issue here.
