Well there was a period where we'd get a few comments about conservatives being moral mutants that should all be sterilized for the survival of ethnic minorities, which would turn into debates about the appropriateness of violence and whether conservatives are even evil to begin with, etc. The US politics ban put a stop to these (they were only in the Friday threads anyway).
