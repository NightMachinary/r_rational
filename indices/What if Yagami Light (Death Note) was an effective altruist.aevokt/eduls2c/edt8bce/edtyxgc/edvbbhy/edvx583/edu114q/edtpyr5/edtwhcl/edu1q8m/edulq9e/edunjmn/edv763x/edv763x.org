From episode 1:

#+begin_quote
  Light: At first, I wrote the names of the worst criminals I could think of. Like I was cleaning up the world, one name at a time, so that eventually no one will ever do anything evil again. And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks, the people who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others will slowly be erased through disease and accidental death. Then and only then the world will start moving in the right direction. It'll be a new world, free of injustice, and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind, and hardworking.

  Ryuk: But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left.

  Light: Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm a hard working honor student considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest. And I... I will become the God of this New World.

I think it's /kind of/ ambiguous, depending on how many people you think Light killed before he got to this end state that he more or less stays in through the whole series, but if there's a character arc there, a corruption through the use of the Death Note, it's mostly implied, and contained entirely within that first episode. "Power corrupts" certainly doesn't seem to be the driving theme of the show to me, because Light is a megalomaniac basically from the end of the first episode onward, and debateably before that.
