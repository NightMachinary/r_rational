I would like to read a real criminologist of law enforcement commenting on Death Note.\\
btw\\
Light would have to concentrate on where is most crime -- Latin America and Africa not countries where crime is already low so.\\
Comeone at tvtropes commented that if Taliban members saw that very few of their comrades are dying of Kira but Kira is active in First World countries then it means Kira supports Taliban. Killing LatAm & African criminals would magnify storywriter difficulties a lot, plus potentially RL backslash from dictators (like North Korea reaction to Sony movie), so it's easy to see why the storywriter did not go that way)
