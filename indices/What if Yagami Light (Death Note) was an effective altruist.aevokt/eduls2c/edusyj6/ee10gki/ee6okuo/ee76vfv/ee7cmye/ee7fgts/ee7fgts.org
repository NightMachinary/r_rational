True. And like I mentioned in another comment, the lifespan being lost into the aether is more likely to be what the author intended.

My point is just that there are textual elements which suggest conservation of lifespan as a plausible mechanism, even for human users.

Plus, it's an interesting hypothetical.

/Edit/: I'll add that my headcanon is that the reason shinigami die when they save someone is that their lifespan gets transferred out of them. And that humans are similar enough to shinigami to use the Death Note and benefit from transferred lifespan, but different enough that the targetting mechanism gets messed up. But that's complete imagination on my part and has no textual support.
