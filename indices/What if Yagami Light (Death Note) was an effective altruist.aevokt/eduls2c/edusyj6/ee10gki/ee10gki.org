  This also calls to mind some sort of dystopian nightmare where the lifespan of humans is harvested from toddlers to make the rest of humanity immortal.

/Is/ this a dystopian nightmare? I mean, arguably small children are less intelligent than livestock we routinely murder for food. Arguably, preserving sentient self aware adults who have been around for centuries is a higher cause. You know, if you had to. And you would ideally gene edit the small children so they are all born with microcephaly and use artificial wombs if you can so there's no mother or father to be emotionally attached.
