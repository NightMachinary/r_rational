The part about lengthening the lifespan is more in the case of, if Light kills a murderer who would later go on to murder Misa on the 1 January 2010, then Misa lives past the 1 January 2010 and instead will die on, say, the 1 January 2018. This has extended her lifespan even though Light didn't intend this: the 8 extra years doesn't "come from" the murderer, it just appears out of nowhere, AFAIK. I don't believe the "conservation of lifespan" that Death Gods operate under applies to humans at all, canonically.
