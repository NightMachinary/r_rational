I mean... the characters actually encounter and fight spirit-world entities in the series. Unless by "it's psychological" you mean "it's a plane created by human thought," which is fine, but still allows magical energy to flow from it to the material plane.

I get wanting to keep conservation of energy, but I agree it's so much neater to say "bender energy comes from this massive external source" than "benders eat their bodyweight in food every day," which breaks the setting way more and might even negate the use of bending. Most benders in the series aren't 100x as wealthy as muggles, and as useful as a bender is to have around, they're not more useful than 100 people.
