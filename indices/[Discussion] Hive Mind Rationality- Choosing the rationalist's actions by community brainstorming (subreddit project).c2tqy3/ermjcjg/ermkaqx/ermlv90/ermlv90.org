If you've ever read a cyoa story it's pretty similar. The Quest Master, or Masters, provide the plot, setting, etc. and the players vote on the character's actions.

SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity are great websites for quests, and Questionable Questing is for all NSFW questing.

Marked for Death comes highly recommended on this forum, being an explicit attempt at a rational quest. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/]]

The Erogamer also comes highly recommended for how it realistically portrays people being forced into â€˜Porn Logic' situations. As a heads up, Questionable Questing requires an account to view posts in the nsfw section. [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/]]
