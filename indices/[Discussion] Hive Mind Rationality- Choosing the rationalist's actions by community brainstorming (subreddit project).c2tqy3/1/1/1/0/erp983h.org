  That is an interesting idea and I have though about it sometimes though I suspect the reason it doesn't usually happens is that there are lots more "logistical" problems in running a pvp. Especially in the usual formums people do quests on, since you would have to prevent people from voting in the two places, you can't easily keep what one team is doing secret from one another, you need double the people voting for it to work and that kind of stuff.

I'm still thinking about logistics. There will definitely be private discussion forums for only team members, and entry will be 1 team per user. Maybe a verified email account, because its easy to make new Reddit accounts.

  But it could be really fun if you can actually make it work.

Great to hear you like the idea! I'll work out the details and probably create a new post. Thanks for your input!
