Don't worry you are not the first person to reinvent quests after reading hpmor without realizing they already exist in this subreddit (that was how the idea of marked for death started if I remember correctly ).

I second recommendations of mfd. Oh and also vetch and radvic are going to write a Zelda one soon too.

Also I warn you that people here are likely to munchkin whatever magic system we get our hands on untill it breaks, see mfd ideas like implosion nukes, skywalkers or whipguns.

I started running a quest myself but haven't posted in more than a month, maybe I should go back to that.
