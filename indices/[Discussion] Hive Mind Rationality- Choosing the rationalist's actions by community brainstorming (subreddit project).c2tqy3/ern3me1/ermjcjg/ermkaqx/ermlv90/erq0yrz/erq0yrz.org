/Erogame/ logic, in story porn logic is something distinct and different, an ero game has to at least have a coherent storyline, with characters, goals, and progression. This is a pretty essential part of the quest, so I feel calling it porn logic is a bit of a downgrade, as literally anything can happen in porn, no matter how absurd, so long as it leads to sex. This isn't the case in eroge, as is expounded on in detail by the Quest.

I might add that the Erogamer is probably one of my favorite things ever, so I'm a bit biased.
