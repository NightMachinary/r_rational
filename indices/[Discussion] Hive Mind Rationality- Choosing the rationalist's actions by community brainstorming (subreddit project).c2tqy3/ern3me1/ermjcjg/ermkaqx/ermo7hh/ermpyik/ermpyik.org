A PvP situation would be rather unique, I'd have to say.

I'd be interested in participating, but I'd suggest some caution. Any direct combat would probably have to be decided by dice rolls (albeit obviously with modifiers). For example: Team Zuko has found team Avatar on the Avatar Island. Team Zuko has decided to launch most of their ship's fuel reserves to the battlefield in order to have something to burn, and is holding the town hostage in order to provoke a fight. Team Avatar has an advantage by having a surplus of water, this being an island, but moving enough water to quench fires will quickly exhaust their food reserves.

Who wins? To me, this kind of combat would a lot of number crunching and back and forth between the players. Does Team Zuko actually burn down the town, or is it just a bluff. When does team Avatar decide to retreat? After team Zuko has left, or do they leave him to burn down the town at his leisure?

How in detail will each team's supply trains be? The fire nation here as a distinct advantage that most things are burnable while most things are not edible.

I'd love to participate though.
