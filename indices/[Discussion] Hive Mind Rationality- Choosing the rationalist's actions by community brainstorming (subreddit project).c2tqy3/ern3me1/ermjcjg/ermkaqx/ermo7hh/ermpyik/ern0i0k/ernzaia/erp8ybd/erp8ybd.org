  I'd be interested in participating, but I'd suggest some caution. Any direct combat would probably have to be decided by dice rolls (albeit obviously with modifiers). For example: Team Zuko has found team Avatar on the Avatar Island. Team Zuko has decided to launch most of their ship's fuel reserves to the battlefield in order to have something to burn, and is holding the town hostage in order to provoke a fight. Team Avatar has an advantage by having a surplus of water, this being an island, but moving enough water to quench fires will quickly exhaust their food reserves.

My original thoughts were for the lead author to decide what's actually happening during the fight after the players decide their plans, and only if someone objects to the way I made things happen we will have a discussion or perhaps a dice roll.

  Who wins? To me, this kind of combat would a lot of number crunching and back and forth between the players. Does Team Zuko actually burn down the town, or is it just a bluff. When does team Avatar decide to retreat? After team Zuko has left, or do they leave him to burn down the town at his leisure?

The decisions will be made by the players. The outcomes will be determined by the lead author probably, based on parameters that should mostly be given beforehand (the shape of the island, how much fuel Zuko has).

  How in detail will each team's supply trains be? The fire nation here as a distinct advantage that most things are burnable while most things are not edible.

You are correct, however the key difference is that Zuko does not have access to the fire nation's economy while Sokka has access to the water and earth nation's resources (at least potentially).

  I'd love to participate though.

That's great to hear! I'll work on PvP logistics and create a new post probably specifically for the A:TLA PvP quest.

Thanks for your input!
