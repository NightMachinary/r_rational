You might want to reach out to the guys that run marked for death about how to handle PvP. After much deliberation (seriously, months of discussion) they ended up using a modified version of the fate system to resolve martial and social combat. You might want to see if you could adapt their system (which is public).

Also, they are pretty nice/approachable.
