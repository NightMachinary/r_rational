Coming back to this, your team roster is actually well thought out (every character has distinct advantages to draw players), but I do think that if possible, it'd be nice to expand it slightly if there are enough interested players. In particular, it suffers from lack of a waterbender, as well as having only one earthbender, in comparison to three firebenders! One nonbender is probably the right amount, but I think a waterbender and a second earthbender would be good additions.

The waterbender, I'm not sure who would be, but it can't be Katara since access to the avatar is TeamSokka's big advantage to make up for not being a bender.

For the second earthbender, may I suggest Bumi, the "mad genius"?
