  This sounds extremely ambitious. Props to you if you managed to get it working (for the years this project WILL end up taking), but I suggest warming up with a smaller "quest" system first, and looking up the other quests recommended in the thread for advice.

You might be correct about starting with a smaller quest because I don't really have experience with those things, Ill consider it. Thanks for the input.
