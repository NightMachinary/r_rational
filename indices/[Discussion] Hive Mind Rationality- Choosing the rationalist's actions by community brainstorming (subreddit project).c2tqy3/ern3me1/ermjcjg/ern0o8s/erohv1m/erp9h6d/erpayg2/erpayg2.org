No problem. I've experienced far too many quest threads etc. that tried to be too grand and feature-rich yet end up spinning out of control of the DM and burning itself out before it got anywhere interesting. Even Andrew Hussie's MS Paint Adventures and Homestuck end up dragging out far too long (you might want to skim those a bit for some ideas how to run yours).

You might also want to browse a few quest forums or PM some of the more accomplished quest writers on Sufficient Velocity/SpaceBattle for tips on mechanics like dice rolling combat. yrsillar (Forge of Destiny) and Saphrith (Fate Denied) were some of the quest writers recommended to me before on this sub.

I really do think starting small and gradually expanding it up would let you familiarise yourself with how to run one of these quest things. And perhaps the most tricky thing you're doing is trying to run multiple viewpoints at once, FIVE characters which means trawling through FIVE threads full of posts is a huge workload and probably too much for one person. You'll never really know how chaotic it gets until you actually experience it though, so starting a small week/month-long storylet with one viewpoint only is what I suggest until you get yourself in the zone.
