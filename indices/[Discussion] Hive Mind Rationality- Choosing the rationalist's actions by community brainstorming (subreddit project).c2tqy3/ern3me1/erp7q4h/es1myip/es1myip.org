I've gotta agree with others; wanting to keep conservation of energy is one thing, but needing to eat that much food would be a logistical nightmare for any civilization built on bending. But perhaps there's a way to keep both attributes?

For starters, what if there's a rich source of energy in food that normal humans can't digest, but benders can? There's certainly precedent for this; there are many things other species can extract energy from that we don't have the biological ability to do so, although I don't /think/ there's some latent source of energy in our food that would be equivalent to eating 100x as much. But there's no reason there COULDN'T be, there just doesn't happen to ACTUALLY be. It could explain the discrepancy in power without changing the logistics much. As a side effect, benders would probably be much more capable of surviving on very little food as long as they didn't bend (though unless they're getting enough vitamins and such they will eventually have problems), but I don't think that's nearly as huge of a thing as having to eat 100 times as much to be able to bend.

As for why benders are so biologically different from nonbenders, well, that's gonna depend on what your explanation for how bending even works in your setting within the laws of physics. I'm assuming not a simulation run by some entity that arbitrarily cares about what people would do under these conditions, because that's way too easy, and nanotechnology programmed by some entity that arbitrarily wants people to have these specific powers is in a similar boat, so personally I think SOME derivation from the laws of physics would be the best option, though I agree it should be kept as small as possible: ideally one simple new thing that can explain everything you want bending to be able to do (and can make useful predictions useable by your players) while explaining why the things you DON'T want it to be able to do are impossible. Unless you happen to have some really clever-yet-plausible way for bending to make sense within the real laws of physics that is also both satisfying narratively for your players to discover and makes useful predictions that they can utilize, in which case I would be seriously impressed and you should use that. I think it's probably possible, but it'd certainly be a very difficult task.

Alternatively, you could extend the firebenders' mechanic to others, where EVERYONE needs to get their energy from their element. Airbenders would get it from cooling down the air around them, waterbenders from the water (possibly water in the air), earth from geological processes, etc.
