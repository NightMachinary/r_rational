  You really can't just drop this fact in there like it wasn't anything. Considering we're already going with magical wuxia physics, there's no need to mix in mundane reality like this because that makes the worldbuilding go donkeyfuck. If you still want it to be rationalist after that, you need to account for it and that would end up with a wildly divergent setting.

I didn't intend to drop it like it wasn't anything. Yes, there are big differences between this AU and the canon A:TLA. The reason for this specific detail was to avoid very quick world-breaking ideas I had while watching the show regarding what can be done with bending.

  If you absolutely need to explain this for whatever reason, just say benders and chi using non-benders draw their energy from the spirit world.

This is going to be a spoiler for some of the plot I had in mind, but the spirit world is not actually real, its psychological, and the characters are supposed to understand this at some point of the story.

This is for the same reason I inserted the anecdote about the exact amount of food benders can eat. My own personal preference is for hard-scifi. From point A in the universe you can predict what point B will look like in 10 seconds, if you know the rules. And I want the rules to be as close to real life rules so its easier to understand the physics.

Hence, conservation of energy is still a thing in this AU. Bending energy comes from food. I calculated how much calories are needed to produce about 5 short lightnings per day.

I realize this may come from a personal bias I have towards physics system as close as possible to real life. If this is not something the community wants, I can change it. If it breaks the game in some way, I'll definitely change it.

Thanks for your input!
