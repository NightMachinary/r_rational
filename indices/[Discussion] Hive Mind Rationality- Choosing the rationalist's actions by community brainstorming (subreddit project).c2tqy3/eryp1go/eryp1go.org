  Fire benders can only create heat from heat near them.

Two things jump out at me:

1: Fire bending is still a good source of energy in practice because you can make a temperature gradient and run (e.g.) a Stirling engine off of it.

2: Since campfires are several times hotter than normal air, the region of air cooled should be far larger than the flame, and using it would likely be the main combat ability for fire benders.
