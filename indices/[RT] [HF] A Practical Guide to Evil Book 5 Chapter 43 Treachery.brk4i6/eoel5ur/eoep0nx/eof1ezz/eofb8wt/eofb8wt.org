I don't think that's quite how this works. The thing in the tomb said that Kairos would die before his thirteen nameday, and though we don't know the exact wording, I suspect that it could be interpreted as "You'll live for thirteen years under your Name" and he simply didn't catch that because the idea of becoming a Tyrant didn't cross his mind until the confrontation with his father. Skein implied that each Wish cost him one year from a very limited lifespan - one he already had lived six of.

As for not aging, that's not exactly how this works. Villains don't age by default, but Kairos' death is predestined. I'm not sure a Wish can counter something that didn't happen yet and doesn't have much reason to hapen other than the story that keeps the Aspect going in the first place - and so far there's room for this story to be about a madman who tried to defy fate only to end up fulfilling the same prophecy he's been trying to break.
