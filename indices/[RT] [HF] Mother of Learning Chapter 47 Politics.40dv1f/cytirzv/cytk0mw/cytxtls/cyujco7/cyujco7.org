Because red robe knows there are two other time travellers, and for zorian to enlist help from people he knows might be traceable back to him. Not to mention, the enemy might have mind-readers on their side. Zorian is good at mind magic, but most people he could recruit are not because it is illegal to use mind magic. All it takes is a bad encounter between an ally who's not a mind mage, and an enemy who is, and all the details that Zorian needed to tell his allies in order to recruit them could get to red robe.

EDIT: He HAS recruited people to help him with the bigger issues involving the time loop and the invasion, he just does it VERY sparingly.
