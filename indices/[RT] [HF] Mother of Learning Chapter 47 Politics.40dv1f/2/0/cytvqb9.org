I'm still uncertain how optimistic we should be about that. I find it implausible that Red Robe has been /idle/ this whole time just because he's not helping the invasion. If he's still looping (he might not be given that there are only two soul-tags) he's got to have been doing something he considered productive during this time. The higher level bad guys Zorian tangles with, the more chance that he'll start to encounter someone who talks to Red Robe for at least a bit every restart.

Here's hoping the big reveal for both Zach and Red Robe is something epic!
