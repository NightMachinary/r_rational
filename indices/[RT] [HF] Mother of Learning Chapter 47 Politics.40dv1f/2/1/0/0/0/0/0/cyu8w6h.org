Well, nothing says Red_Robe!Sudomir cannot put someone else in charge of this plot when he personally is absent. It could be this Deputy Guy's reaction, not Red Robe's.

The point is, we can't have both Red_Robe!Sudomir not noticing and mindraping Zorian in 28-35 and Red_Robe!Sudomir sitting on his fingers in Iasku Mansion at the end of restart. It's just inconsistent.
