What? A crucial transportation hub for the largest event taking place in direct vicinity of the time traveler zero (Zach) is of no interest for time travelers? I mean, come on, that's how Zorian got there, by investigating the invasion. That's what Zach should have done instead of dragon hunting and screwing around.

If I am Sudomir the Red Robe I will not under any circumstance allow my mansion to be used by Ibasan invasion. No, nope, never. If I am somehow bound to assist them due to an arrangement (foolishly) made prior the loop, I will make everything to distance away, erase as much connections as possible.
