  Or, you know, since there can be more than one TTs looping, TT1 throws in a really big explosive charge, detonates it immediately, while TT2... TTn physically scattered throughout the Highlands try to detect the explosion footprint.

This wouldn't work, as the manor is specifically warded against this. Also divinations.

The fact that time travelers might eventually get in through the gate is a possibility that I would consider very remote were I Sudomir. If anyone does come through, the defenses make the manor serve as an effective honeypot.

In any case, it's clear that the gate and invasion were being set up way before the loop ever started. It's not a practical option for Sudomir to sever it based on concerns he's developed during the loops. Would you defy Quatach-Itchil and all the Ibasans if you were him?
