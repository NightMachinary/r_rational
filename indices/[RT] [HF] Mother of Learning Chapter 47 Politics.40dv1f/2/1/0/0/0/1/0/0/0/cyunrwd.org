Except for the Cult and the Ibasans. Which makes it irresponsible from StRR POV. He should anticipate the possibility of someone investigating the invasion. Then, being connected to the invasion StRR would have perfect understanding how vulnerable Cyorian gate is. Zorian got in on the first try, solo but it was not a miracle.

Now, I've criticized in the previous thread that storming in was utterly reckless on Zorian's part.

If I am StRR I know this:

- Cyorian gate is poorly guarded.
- Cyorian gate is known to the invaders
- The invasion is not unknown by Time Travellers
- The invasion is a major point of interest for TTs regardless of their alignment: it's just too big of an event, it's worth investigating even for Evil TTs. Evil TTs get a bonus for their investigation techniques, by the way.

From this StRR concludes that competent TT will get to the gate, eventually.

Now, limits of magic are not entirely known to us, they aren't a given for StRR either. Thinking otherwise would be, again, a poor judgement call on his part.

There could be a possibility to track gate's destination without exposing oneself. I am thinking about throwing something/someone through the portal and then trying to divine their location right away. Maybe throwing in someone with soulmarker like Zach has and tracking him with the same ritual. Unless mansion defenses take out intruders in under a minute (they don't even /detect/ the intrusion immediately), the location is busted.

Or, you know, since there can be more than one TTs looping, TT1 throws in a really big explosive charge, detonates it immediately, while TT2... TTn physically scattered throughout the Highlands try to detect the explosion footprint.

Based on this, StRR concludes that it is impossible to hide mansion location and his connection to the invasion. Based on this he should sever the link, if possible.

tl;dr: I am certain Sudomir is not RR or he is dumb and the story loses its appeal.
