  A crucial transportation hub for the largest event taking place in direct vicinity of the time traveler zero (Zach) is of no interest for time travelers?

At the time, no one had any knowledge of its existence. Zorian didn't stumble into/become aware of the manor by actually investigating the invasion at first- he did it because he happened to be hired to rob that one guy's rival, who happened to have documents saved that indicated Sudomir was tied to the invasion. That's just sheer random luck.

Later on, when Zorian actually breaks into the manor through the gate- he's doing it by infiltrating what should be an extremely well guarded and dangerous (even to time travelers, as Quatach-Ichil will protect it) gate.

If I am Sudo-Robes, I assume the manor is basically the safest place on earth for me to be. Even AFTER it gets invaded. The first time, I'm surprised and caught off guard. The second time, I've prepared in advance, and test the invaders skills/methods without exposing myself directly, and without giving away the fact that I was expecting him to arrive. Try to figure out who the hell he is and what he wants.

The third time, I prepare for the invader to come again, and spring a much better trap- one that will catch the time traveler off guard as he's relying on me behaving the same every time. Then, its soul/mind magic time to neutralize the threat permanently.
