I'm not seeing the dozens of opportunities Sudomir would have had to mindrape Zorian. They've only met twice.

The first time, Sudomir was thrown off by Zorian being able to restart the loop, so there was no time for it. The second time, Sudomir is wary of the invader and won't approach him in person.

Plus, there's the whole thing where Zorian is actually the more capable mind mage than Red Robes.

If I'm Sudomir who is secretly Red Robes, and a mysterious invader with power over the time loop enters my home /again/, I'd stay the HELL away, but also try not to let the invader discover my secret (which means behaving similarly to the way I did the first time, within the limits of safety)
