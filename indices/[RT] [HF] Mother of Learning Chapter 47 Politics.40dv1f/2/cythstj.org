I just love the thought of this necromancer sitting at home while an invasion he's part of is happening, and all of a sudden someone not at all on his radar breaks into his house and starts analyzing his wards. With the confusion incrementally increasing every restart when this guy he's never heard of is ready for all of his traps.
