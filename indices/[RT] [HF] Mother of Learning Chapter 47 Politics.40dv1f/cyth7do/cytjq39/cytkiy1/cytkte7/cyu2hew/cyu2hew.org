Neither. If you remember, "getting the fuck away from Xvim" was one of the main motivations for Zorian at the beginning of the book. I would argue that he is actually the perfect teacher for him-forcing him to improve himself, making him do the very very useful shaping excercises, never asking questions as to why the hell he is so flipping good and never running out of stuff to teach, even within the time loop.
