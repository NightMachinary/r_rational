I say that's not how time works because that's not how /any/ of the self-consistent ways of looking at time work.

Epistemology is important to me. If you want to say "Xvim should be Zorian from the future because I want it to be that way.", then I'm fine with that. No problems. If you want to say that it is a logical and reasoned conclusion when it's got more holes than a swiss cheese, not so much.
