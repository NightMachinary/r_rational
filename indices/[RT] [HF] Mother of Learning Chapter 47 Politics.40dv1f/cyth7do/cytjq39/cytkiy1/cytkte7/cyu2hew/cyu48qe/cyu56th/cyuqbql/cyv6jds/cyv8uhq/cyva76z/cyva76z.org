  That's not how time works.

Neither you, nor me know how the time really works. Especially in a select fictional world, so please stop asserting ultimate knowledge. There could be a variety of reasons as to why he couldn't do any of those things. I agree that at this point Xvim doesn't have to keep being an ass to motivate Zorian, but that doesn't mean he would want to blow his cover by /not/ being an ass.

  He still could have bribed, mind controlled, convinced or otherwise manoeuvred literally anyone else to teach Zorian useful things.

And you are assuming he didn't do it as far as he was able to. We never get a look at a restart /without/ Xvim affecting things. Zorian spent a few loops without knowing he was a mind mage? Who is to say it wouldn't have been a couple hundred without his future self nudging things? As far as anonumous notes-receiving one of them would be a huge sign of "HELLO THERE IS A TIMELOOPER WHO KNOWS WHO YOU ARE", and if Xvim doesn't want to tell him outright, there is hardly any reason to do it anonymously.

And finally, you are taking this analysis of a crackpot theory a little too close to heart.
