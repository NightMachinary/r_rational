Nice one! The curious ominous feeling that is mentioned in two mansion invasions could be Zorian's empathy detecting wards' intelligence. When intruder is detected, system goes from dormant into active mode and its intelligence is woken up. Zorian starts picking it up, but since it is probably some not-so usual mind (necromancer warder? probably some disfigured souls trapped or something similar) he can't yet connect the dots.

add: which, by the way, if true, opens avenues for mind attack on ward scheme. For Zorian the mind mage this could be a godsend.
