Seems to me like the wards are self-adapting, and Sudomir can direct if he wants to as well. Zorian thinks that the level of intelligence is too high for a mindless construct, so I imagine Sudomir has some souls or captive minds powering it.

My guess: It's related to the angry Iron Beaks that he's loaning to the Cyoria invasion efforts. "Hate. Grudge. Kill." was the reply Zorian got from an iron beak back in 43 when he asked if it wanted to kill more Ibasans. Their loyalty is being forced, and if you look back to chapter 40, Sudomir Kandrei is the one supplying both the iron beaks and winter wolves to the Dragon Cultists, and not even the Ibasan forces directly. We'll have to wait three weeks to find out the rest of Sudomir's secrets though, which will probably also tie in to the organized killing of soul mages, since none of the people Zorian mind-delved knew anything about that either.
