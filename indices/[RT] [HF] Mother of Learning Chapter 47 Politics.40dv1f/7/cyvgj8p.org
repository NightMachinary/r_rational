I didn't do this before, so, cheap tactical observations.

The golem+ alchemy combo is obviously immensely powerful for storming positions and fighting. It's worth experimenting with ways to enhance this. Can he convince his classmates to make him potions and golems in return for limitless cash, for example? Can he learn how to do mass alchemy, perhaps from the witch, so he can make a huge quantity of attack potions?

The iron beaks and super trolls are both powerful weapons and enemies. Next time he's in Cyoria he should do some research on such magical creatures, see if there's an expert who could help him. It's very wasteful losing so many of his expensive resources fighting them. I assume he's pretty good at handling undead from Alanic, but check with people there to see if they have any cheap ways to handle undead. Maybe go ask Alanic if he has any good tips on handling liches beyond don't.

The lich summoning amulet warrants further investigation. If he can reliably summon the lich that's a good way to target an assassination attempt or a grab and mind rape attempt. Perhaps he could mass produce it and jam the summoning signal. He could either investigate it at the end of a loop or teleport far enough away and underground that its signal won't reach the lich under lots of wards.

He's facing powerful wards that can defeat a number of his spells. It would be worth next time he's in Cyoria asking the resident ward master Ilsa about them, to see if there are ways to better punch through them or evade them.

He's facing a necromancer now. It's worth finding the location of all these shifter tribes and asking them for soul magic help, as with the Aranea. Some heavy duty soul wards or defenses would help a lot, and if she knows useful stuff about soul magic they should too- there surely are shifter mages who specialize in messing with other shifters.
