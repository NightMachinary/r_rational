I guess it depends a bit on the details of soul ecology. Presumably there is a large (although not infinite) supply of dead souls to draw upon from graveyards, battlefields, etc, and using them in this manner does not affect them across the resets.

So my thinking is that these could be summoned into golems or other suitable hosting objects assembled by golem labor. Then they would be reprogrammed with either mind or soul magic (initially by the original caster, but later by a "parent" undead creature that has already been programmed) to do what the original caster wants, including recasting spells at given intervals. Checksums could be used to make sure no deviations are introduced during replication.

Now that you have an exponentially expandable supply of undead servants, you can use them to enchant as many golem bodies as necessary.
