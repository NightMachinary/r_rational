Dammit! I even had a page set up on auto-refresh and everything... but on the plus side, I get to read a new MoL chapter... so I can't really complain.

EDIT: Oh yea, I'll use this comment to actually discuss the chapter after I've read it.

EDIT EDIT: Fun chapter, but - as usual - I now want more. Was it me or was this one shorter than the ones before? It had many interesting facts, but seemingly very little plot development. Then again, that's just what I feel. There could be a lot of plot secreted away within the setting of the scenes.
