Yeah, I'm sure everyone will have their own script. :P But this sub actually prevents reposts. That's how I know that a chapter has been posted already.

The biggest problem when posting is to: 1) post when it comes out. My email didn't ping me like usual, so I tried 2 minutes too late. 2) know what the title is. Everything else is predetermined.

We're gonna buy servers that host the closest to fictionpress to get the lowest ping. We're gonna write our scripts in assembly to ensure they are fast. That means no bloated curl. It means writing your own drivers for the firmware to bypass kernel. No, we're gonna write scripts that are in the firmware of the networking card. Scratch that, we're gonna make specialized networking cards for this very purpose.

On second thought, it might actually be faster to hack a script into fictionpress' servers to post immediately when Domagoj presses the post button. (For all police reading, I have no intentions to hack anybody.)

/s :P

I just realized that posting this is the [[/r/rational]] community's way of saying, "First!"
