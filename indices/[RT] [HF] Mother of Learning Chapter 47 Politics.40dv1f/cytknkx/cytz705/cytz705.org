  It'd be pretty cool if the resets gave him the insight to become a legendary teacher for “younger” generations when (if) he successfully exited the loop.

That seems more and more likely. Zorian has expressed concern that his previous choices for career paths are inadequate at his current level. His initial bad luck in mentors slowed him down, but time loop negated that obstacle. Since he had to reinvent the wheel, so to speak, he has a fundamental understanding how many things work, also a plus.

And he will be teaching at least two people (Taiven, Kiri) once the loop ends. And he expressed desire to at the very least write a book on mind magic, because his experiences in mastering that field were dangerously painful. Literally and figuratively.
