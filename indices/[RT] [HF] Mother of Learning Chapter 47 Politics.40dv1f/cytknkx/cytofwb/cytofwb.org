  Hahaha, maybe that almost an entire colony literally dropped dead after deciding to have business with him.

From the perspective of something that is unaware of the time loop Zorian never had any business with any colonies of Aranea. More importantly this "Spirit" either disappeared like all the angels and demons and the colony are just covering for it by refusing visitors or isn't extraplanar and thus is one of the terrestrial spirits like the fey or elementals or potentially even a lucid/intelligent primordial (but not likely). Could be an interesting area of study, but again it could just be missing.
