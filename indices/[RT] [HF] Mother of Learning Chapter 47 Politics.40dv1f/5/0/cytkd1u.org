Yes. I'm not sure how it works in this fiction, but I don't see any reason to think of it such an "intelligized" warding model as anything less that a (perhaps partial) transfixion of a soul to a object.

Under which model, it is interesting to ask who the soul donor was. Seems to me that powerful wards in your house are the sort of thing you'd want to be friendly. It would please my sense of aesthetics if it was his wife, but in that case I can't imagine getting real confirmation out of Sudomir.
