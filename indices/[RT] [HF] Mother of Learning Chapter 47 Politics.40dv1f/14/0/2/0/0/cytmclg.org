If you want to read an interesting article about prestige, here:

[[http://www.meltingasphalt.com/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/]]

Its sequel is here:

I'd recommend you read them both, they're very interesting. He actually writes:

  Today I'm offering a red pill (of sorts): an eye-opening account of social status. I won't say there's "no turning back" after reading this --- but I've seen down the rabbit hole, and it's indeed as deep as advertised.

  If you decide to join me (warning: long), by the end of this essay you'll know most of the important things I know about social status. There are wider and more practical perspectives we could take, but today we're going straight down, i.e., into the theoretical and evolutionary roots of the thing.

Again, as a member of [[/r/rational]], you have to read interesting articles. :P
