Ah, I see. That could potentially work... if Zorian had soul sight and was a proper necromancer. Note that if would be easy, even if he were - this is a sort of epic project a master might embark on, if they were also a master golem-maker to boot, not something Zorian could do in his free time.

And interesting idea, but hard/impractical to actually execute.
