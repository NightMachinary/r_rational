That would explain him being bad news, not worst news. My guess is it has precognition and it saw that if it oracularly answered its subject's queries for bad news reasoning, that would be bad news (it would see and answer that he's a time traveller, and they would know that their only chance at inter-loop legacy is subduing Zorian, so they would try, and they would fail, and thus the spirit's powers said "don't tell them", because its powers dont care about legacy, they care about linear-time survival or something. And there's your lesson about your superintelligent advisor having not /quite/ your values.)
