  What did the spirit know about Zorian that pissed it off so much?
#+end_quote

Hahaha, maybe that almost an entire colony literally dropped dead after deciding to have business with him.

  He was also steadily trying out new shaping exercises, writing down which ones were easiest to work with, which ones had a trick to doing them right and which ones became much easier if he did some other exercises before them. He was surprised how lacking the various exercise manuals were in regards to crucial information like that.

It'd be pretty cool if the resets gave him the insight to become a legendary teacher for “younger” generations when (if) he successfully exited the loop.

  Was Sudomir somehow adjusting the warding scheme on the fly or were the wards itself somehow intelligent?

Maybe Kandrei managed to re-purpose extracted human brains as an additional intelligent defensive element to his wards, preserving some form of smouldering semi-consciousness in them for that.

Typos, mistakes, nitpicking:

- They also offered to put him in contact with some of their human 'trade partners', in case he wanted something they currently lack. → [..] in case he wanted something they currently lack*ed*.
- altered the distribution of monster in the Dungeon → altered the distribution of monster*s* in the Dungeon
- only to suddenly fail when he face off against Sudomir → [..] when he face*d* off against Sudomir
- he wanted to see what would happen if he talk to the man → [..] what would happen if he talk*ed* to the man
- or were the wards *itself* → or were the wards *themselves*
- trying to ambush him from as he tried to navigate → trying to ambush him from *[]* as he tried to navigate
- Crystal oozes were virtually immune to physical damage, absorbed most forms of magical energy, quite fast, could shoot arrow-like shards of crystal at things that annoyed them, [..]

  - the sentence's structure is “Oozes [were] [property1], [did action 1], [property 2], could [action 2], [..]”. Imo, would be better to move properties together and then switch to actions, for the sake of coherency. Something like:
  - “Crystal oozes were quite fast and virtually immune to physical damage, they absorbed most forms of magical energy and hurled arrow-like shards of crystal at things that annoyed them, [..]”
