Sufficiently proficient psychic(aka Zorian from the future) is indistinguishable from a non-psychic, unless the aforementioned psychic wants to be distinguishable. It was already mentioned that /a proper mindmage/ would be able to construct a fake mind on top of their own and keep it online at all times.
