That's not how time works. If time paradoxes are a thing then the first run through essentially sets the tone for all the loops after that. Your theory is that the first time Zorian went back in time to affect his younger self he inexplicably decided that he did not want to show his young self a selection of the most useful and helpful spells he ever learned, a list of which exercises he would find most helpful and in what order, and some extremely relevant training in mind magic, he instead decided that time wasting and shaping exercises was the way to go.

But hey, whatever, let's say that sitting in a room having marbles thrown at you without being told how to dodge for months was vitally important. He still could have bribed, mind controlled, convinced or otherwise manoeuvred literally anyone else to teach Zorian useful things. Remember he spent quite a few loops not even knowing he was a natural mind mage? Could have solved that with with five words or an anonymous note. Being told "you get access to the library by doing /this/" would have helped too, or even just agreeing to take books out for his younger self. This is not what a smart mentor helping his younger self looks like.

Your theory doesn't fit the facts, stop trying to twist them.
