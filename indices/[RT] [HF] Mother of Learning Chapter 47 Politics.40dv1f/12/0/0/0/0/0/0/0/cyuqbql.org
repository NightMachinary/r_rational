You credit Xvim with his motivation. I could just as easily credit the threat of the death of almost everyone he knows if he fails, the lack of any possible kind of tangible progress save magic or the fear of Red Robe extinguishing him if he learns too slowly, the lesson of the overly specialised other looper or even sheer boredom.

Still, l'll be generous and for the sake of argument say that Xvim was responsible for his munchkinry through sheer blind luck, he was still nowhere near perfect. I would not even call him competent when it comes to teaching.

Edit: I do understand what you're trying to say though, that the series of events precipitated in part by Xvim were good. I just don't think that has anything to do with Xvim being good. Were I going back in time to teach things to my younger self, I would act absolutely nothing like him, and I doubt you would either.
