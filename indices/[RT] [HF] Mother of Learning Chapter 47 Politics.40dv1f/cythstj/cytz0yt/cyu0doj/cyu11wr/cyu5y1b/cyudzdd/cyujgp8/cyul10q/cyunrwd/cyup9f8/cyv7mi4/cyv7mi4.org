  This wouldn't work, as the manor is specifically warded against this. Also divinations.

Except it's not? It's not warded against explosions in dormant mode, it is not warded against explosions in active mode, and it's warded only against spell formulae explosions in supercharged mode. We throw in a ton of alchemical goo, an nuke it the instant it is on the other side. Good luck suppressing shockwaves that strong. Unless you claim this is a layer of distraction as well (not productive for purposes of our discussion I think)

  The fact that time travelers might eventually get in through the gate is a possibility that I would consider very remote were I Sudomir.

What can I say except "NOT PARANOID ENOUGH! CONSTANT VIGILANCE!"

I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that.

  Would you defy Quatach-Itchil and all the Ibasans if you were him?
#+end_quote

If lich is not a time traveller, yes, eventually. Not defy as in "I challenge you, pile of bones", more like "Have fun finding me on the other side of the world". Avoid direct confrontation and be fine.
