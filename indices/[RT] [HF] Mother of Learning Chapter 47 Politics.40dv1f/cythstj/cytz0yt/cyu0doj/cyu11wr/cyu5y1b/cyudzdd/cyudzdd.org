  If he was Red Robe, he would notice Zorian back in 28-35, when Zorian was messing with assasinations of Lukav and Alanic, and then it would be a child's play for him to hunt Zorian down.

That's an excellent point, and not something I have a satisfying answer for.

  but what does he do then? Feverously researching mind magic somewhere on the other side of the world, far away from the legion of imaginary timelooping mindmages? But why is he in Iasku Mansion then?

This one though- I have an answer for. Iasku Mansion is like Sudomir's personal fortress. It's a hidden location that, as far as he knew until recently, no time traveler be interested in or even know about- and on the off chance that someone comes along poking around he's got layers and layers of defenses (as well as a very handy escape route).

Why /wouldn't/ he be in Iasku Mansion? And in future restarts (like the next chapter), he's got an amazing opportunity to lay a trap that can really hurt his only serious enemies- the other time travelers.
