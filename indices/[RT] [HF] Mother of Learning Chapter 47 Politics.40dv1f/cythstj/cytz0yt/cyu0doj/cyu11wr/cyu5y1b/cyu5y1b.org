Sudomir is the mayor of Knyazov Dveri and the person behind killing of soul mages. If he was Red Robe, he would notice Zorian back in 28-35, when Zorian was messing with assasinations of Lukav and Alanic, and then it would be a child's play for him to hunt Zorian down. It could be argued that Red Robe doesn't pay attention to that plot either, but what does he do then? Feverously researching mind magic somewhere on the other side of the world, far away from the legion of imaginary timelooping mindmages? But why is he in Iasku Mansion then?
