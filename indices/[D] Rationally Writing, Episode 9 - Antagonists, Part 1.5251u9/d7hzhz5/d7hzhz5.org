I couldn't agree more about Magneto. I think that he would be the most promising candidate for a rational protagonist in an X-Men fanfic. Not necessarily as a hero, though if you include some of the stuff from the comics (such as alien invaders) it'd be easy to cast him in that light.

In the movies, his power is massively underutilised. At one point [[#s][X-Men 3 spoiler]] . That makes him astonishingly powerful, and in other scenes he is shown to have fantastic fine control (though it's implied the degree of control scales inversely with the total mass/volume he's working with).

What he should be doing is manufacturing weapons or powering generators or something (or dropping large chunks of metal from hundreds of metres in the air if you really need to just destroy a base). Hell, just put bullet-shaped chunks of metal through the brain of all your opponents, or entomb them if that wouldn't work.

Jean Gray and Professor Xavier have similar problems with underutilisation, but as the "good guys" you expect that sort of thing. If they solved their problems the most efficient way, either there'd be no conflict or it would be portrayed as crossing a moral event horizon.

Villain protagonists are perhaps the most interesting to me, and Magneto is likely the best rational villain from a non-rational franchise.
