Yeah, as I mentioned in a previous episode, anyone with psychic and telekenetic abilities should be grossly powerful, but it makes sense for them not to abuse them due to morals or the lack of proper mindset. Magneto can do such ridiculous things with his powers that a rational story from his perspective either has to find justifiable reasons to limit him that are never explained in the canon works... or have him win in the first few chapters and then face some new threat greater than his powers can immediately help him through.
