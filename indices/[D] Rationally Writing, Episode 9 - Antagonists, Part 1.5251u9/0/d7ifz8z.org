Funny thing, better solution you propose is [[https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-78c02092653ffc25064a24fcfd69bc95?convert_to_webp=true][exacly what happens in comics you complain about.]]

Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne has lots of heroes that are protagonist or antagaonist depending on your point of view. Illidan, Kael'thas, Lady Vashj, Maiev, Sylvanas. They took full advantage of player switching sides.
