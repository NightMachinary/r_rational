You're the first fan of Fables I've seen on this subreddit, so I want to know: Why do you like it? I heard it was great but I gave up after 10 or so issues when it became clear I didn't like any of the characters and they weren't developing into something I would like, which is really bad for a drama. What's especially weird is that I loved the very same characters in The Wolf Among Us, and enjoyed the drama in that game immensely more than in the comics.
