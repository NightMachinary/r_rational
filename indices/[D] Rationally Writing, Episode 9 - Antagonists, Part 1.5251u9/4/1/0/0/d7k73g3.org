I got two chapters into Wooden Soldiers before I decided nothing had improved since I had last stopped. The writing is still bland, the characters are still stupid and/or assholes, the plot still moves too slowly, and people's expressions still look weird. It's like a soap opera, and I don't think increasing the scale of the story with war and politics is going to make me care any more than I currently do.

I liked The Wolf Among Us because it was a noir story that explored themes surrounding poverty, crime, and prejudice in a community. It wasn't perfect, but it knew what it wanted to be and pulled it off thanks to good acting and writing. The comic just kind of...happens and I don't care about any of it. I don't understand why I'm the only person who feels this way.
