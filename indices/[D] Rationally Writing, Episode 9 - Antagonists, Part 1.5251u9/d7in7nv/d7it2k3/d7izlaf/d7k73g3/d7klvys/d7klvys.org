  I don't understand why I'm the only person who feels this way.

I haven't gotten far enough into Fables to tell if I agree with you or not: I only read the first two issues that a friend lent me after Wolf Among Us, I believe it ended with the coup attempt at the farm. I enjoyed them, but not enough to go out and buy any more.

In any case, you can probably rest assured you're not the /only/ person who feels that way :) Somewhere out there are others who lost interest in the comics and just never posted online about it in places that you've seen.
