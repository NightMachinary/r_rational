Simply put, it gets better. First three volumes (18 issues) are not representative of the rest of the series, they lack many key characters and aren't realy in the same genre. Main plot kicks in volume 4: March of the Wooden Soldiers (issues 19+), and series shifts focus to big battles, great heroes, combing magic and technology, political intrigue and tactical planning. There's still personal drama but many great characters are added, so don't worry about getting stuck with characters you don't like.

It's also not that wierd that you didn't liked characters in first issues. Wolf Among Us is prequel, but they retroactivly included years of character development.
