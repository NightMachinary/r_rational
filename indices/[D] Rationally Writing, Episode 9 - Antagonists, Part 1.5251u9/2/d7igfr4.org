My favorite villain from Justice League was always Darkseid, just from his sheer inhumanity. He is the ultimate evil that seeks to destroy or dominate all of existence for the sake of it, and every word he speaks is drenched with such arrogance you can tell he's talking down to you. The only reason you exist is because he permits it, for now. He's the case of a shallow, evil villain completely embracing his role and actively desiring it, which is kind of terrifying.

My favorite version of Lex Luthor, so far, is from the Young Justice cartoon. While he doesn't have a huge role and isn't even really the main villain, they absolutely nailed his intelligence and personality. He always acts like he's in control even when he's in mortal danger, to the point where he uses his own smugness as a tool to manipulate his adversaries. I totally believe that he is a criminal mastermind that has never been arrested.

The best example I've seen for a villain written as if they were the protagonist is Kingpin from the Daredevil show. He was such an amazing character it didn't matter if his plan was never fully explained, and despite the horrible things he did I felt empathy for him at every step. He was a monster, without a doubt, but he really believed in what he was doing, had people he cared about, and was even afraid of becoming a villain when he didn't want to be one.

Kilgrave from Jessica Jones is just as well done, though in a completely different way. He's a completely unrepentant monster that believes people only exist to serve his sadistic pleasures, and the story is so good at putting you into his warped mind that he never feels shallow. He also ties in perfectly to the protagonist's conflict over victimization and the show's themes about sexual abuse and stalking.

I wish I could come up with favorite villains that weren't from superhero stories, or superhero noir in the case of JJ, but most of my favorite stories are more about the protagonist facing an internal conflict, a nebulous antagonist, or an ambiguous situation. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has great villains, but I still found the conflict with them to be secondary to the personal struggles of the other characters.
