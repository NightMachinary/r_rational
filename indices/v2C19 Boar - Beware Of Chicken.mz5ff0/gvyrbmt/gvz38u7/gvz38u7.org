  The animal characters definitely aren't rational

i kinda give them more leeway cause they're animals, so we really don't have a baseline of how should a newly sentient animal act while being raised by what they perceive as a godly entity. The humans so far have been acting very rationally. I am biased cause i like it so much but i'd love to discuss this further.
