My 2Â¢ is that, if it isn't rational, there really shouldn't be an update thread for it, and it should at least be removed for having the RT tag.

Especially because we have threads for all sorts of other things things, from non-rat fic to off-topic discussions, the other threads should be reserved for actual rational/ist fics.
