I agree that it isn't a explicitly rational, and I wouldn't want to see constant posts of updates (especially since the author puts out four a week). But I personally really enjoy the updates and come back to it once a week. It's wholesome, and also a good inversion of some common xanxia tropes. My two cents - it isn't rational, but a lot of readers here may enjoy it anyway.

IMO, it fits in the weekly recommendation thread, but it doesn't need its own update threads. Still, I wouldn't want this post removed because it IS a series I think a lot of readers here would like.
