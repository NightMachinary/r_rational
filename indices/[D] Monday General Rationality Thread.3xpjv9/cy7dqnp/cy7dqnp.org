Is there a word for "something like backlash, but without anything to backlash /against/"?

The two examples that bring this to my mind are the actress playing Hermione Granger on stage being black, and Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan being Sihk and East Indian (I'm sure that there are more, and non-race ones as well.). I haven't seen any criticism of them, but I've seen a lot of people loudly proclaiming that they're not only okay with it, but fully supporting it as well.
