Don't forget the black Stormtrooper in the new Star Wars film! Although there as well, I haven't seen anyone being racist. Just a few people going "Aren't the stormtroopers all clones of that one guy?" and then someone saying "The clone thing didn't work so now they just kidnap babies" and the 'racists' going "Oh, ok."
