Fair enough, although I will point out that in Plato's imagined Republic, there are no slaves. There is a caste system, but all the material wealth stays at the bottom, while political power comes with forced asceticism and gender egalitarianism. Children are assigned caste independently of their parents, depending on how well they do in school (although the eugenics program suggests he expects most apples to fall near the tree). It's clearly far from a society I or others of today would endorse, but while the realm of the forms and all that jazz is plainly silly, the critical thinking was presented in a way that helped me become more interested in philosophy. Obviously Plato does not 'own' critical thinking, but he's an early master of it.

He is not in any way mandatory reading, but he was an excellent starting point for me, and I still enjoy reading a dialogue every now and then.
