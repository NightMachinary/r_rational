Selling things is hard. In order to be capable of making a sale, you need to be able to compete with millions of other, better sales agents out there. If you're not able to do that (which mostly people can't, not with just standard social manipulation and empathy) then you're not able to make a sale, and thus don't actually know how to sell things.

I think sales is a really common thing to get Dunning-Krugered on, since I've seen a lot of really inept people trying to sell things (including rationality).
