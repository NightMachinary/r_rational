My own pet peeve on that score: why is "the Sequences" usually (or often) capitalized?

For purposes of comparison, Christians like to capitalize "Old Testament" and "New Testament," "the Koran" is capitalized, etc.

*It's not a big deal*, and I suppose most people don't pay much attention to details like that -- but I've always found it a little creepy.
