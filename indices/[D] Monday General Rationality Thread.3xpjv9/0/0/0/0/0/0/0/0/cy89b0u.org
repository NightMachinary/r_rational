  See, that's the interesting thing that I've just realized: a lot of what we see as being common-sense is, to people who haven't seen it before, Deeply Profound. Like, the bit about death being bad: We see it as blindingly obvious. Death is simply a bad thing and I can't see anything in the laws of physics that demands it, and so I would prefer the universe where nobody has to die. But if you say all that to someone who hasn't thought about it, you end up Deeply Wise!

Oh right. As a group, [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/][we're split into the five-year-old children and the meta-contrarians]]. Oy.

(Although the Second Law of Thermodynamics /does/ seem to demand a heat-death of the universe /eventually/. That's just not relevant to our timescales right now, unless you're searching for [[http://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism][Eternal Deep Truths]] to solidify a worldview.)
