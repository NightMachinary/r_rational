I've observed a couple people as they read through the sequences. I think that it's capitalized like the other books because it has comparable power. If it's new to you, you can understand, and you it buy into it, you can build most of your personal philosophy around it. It's about as creepy as, say, an Asian person reading a Bible translation around the age of 20 and suddenly becoming a furious Christian.
