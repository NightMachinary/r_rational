[[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences]]

I'm not sure whether it is a name (the webpage I linked to above is titled "Sequences" but has both EY's collection of posts that are usually referred to this way with a capital S, as well as other sequences by different lesswrong-affiliated authors).

Regardless of whether it is a name, I still find it a little creepy to see someone told to "read the Sequences."

Just something off about that. Although: I may be the one off here, I suppose creepiness is in the eye of the beholder.
