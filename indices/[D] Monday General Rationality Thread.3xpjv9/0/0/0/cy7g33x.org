I remember talking to some people on LessWrong a few years ago about /why/ the brand was a bad one and getting some combination of denial ("It's not a bad brand!"), obstinate refusal to see this as a legitimate problem ("It's a bad brand because we say things that are true!"), or placing blame on others ("It's the haters!"). It just convinced me that I wasn't likely to have a productive conversation on the matter. Same with the "cult" stuff, which is closely related.
