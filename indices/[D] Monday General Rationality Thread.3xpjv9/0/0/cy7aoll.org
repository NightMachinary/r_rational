Rationality in general has a PR problem. People hear about it and based on whatever past experiences, dismiss it right away. Individual tenets of rationality, or even the whole hog, are accepted by people if you don't introduce them as rationality. You can put lipstick on this pig.

Of my friends, some hate the rationalism, and the one who hates rationalism the most is also the one who uses it the most. It's just a name / branding issue really. Stuff like the ideas in [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/][Beware Trivial Inconveniences]] or [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/][The Toxoplasma of Rage]] or whatever rationalist article, if presented without rationalism mentioned, are usually really popular. I can just take the idea, present it myself, and people will like it. It's hard to give them follow-up reading though.

It's just a bad brand. I can't speak about SB and SV specifically, but that's just what I've observed.
