I'd guess because they have had a number of obnoxious posters trying to encourage people to read less wrong or support the singularity institute. Probably also bits of appealing to Yudkowsky as an authoritative source despite his lacking of credentials the opponent would find meaningful.

There was/is a personality cult around Elizier because of the halo effect and people creating an image of him as a person based only on his high rated and carefully crafted posts.

While lesswrong has a number of transhumanist memes, the ones that are only really associated with lesswrong tend to be the weird and implausible ones like the A.I foom theory, worry over existential risk, roko's basilisk, cryonics and overuse of the word rationalist as an adjective.

The community does resemble a religion in a number of respects. The meetups, solstice celebrations, the insular community, the weird beliefs and most importantly the appeals for money from the machine intelligence research institute (formerly known as the singularity institute)

People do stereotype members of the rationalist community. They are wrong to write the community off as a whole but they do have a point. The people that do deliberately advertise that they belong in this community tend to be the obnoxious posters I mentioned earlier.
