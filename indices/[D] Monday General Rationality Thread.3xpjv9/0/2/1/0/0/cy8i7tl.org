I want to build a space blanket tent, like the double walled inflatables they use near the arctic.

I like a lot of the libertarian ideas around start up cities and seasteading, but using conventional construction the startup costs are just too high. I'd like inexpensive open source infrastructure to be a thing.

This is an early test in patterning mylar to make a sort of bubble-wrap type surface. About soft-ball sized bubbles.

One of my other goals, well more of an aesthetic then a goal, is self-sufficiency and ultra portability. This potentially tackles that pretty well as well.

I also have most of a yurt. It's a lot less portable then my ideal, and probably unreasonably expensive to heat then the mylar if it works well.
