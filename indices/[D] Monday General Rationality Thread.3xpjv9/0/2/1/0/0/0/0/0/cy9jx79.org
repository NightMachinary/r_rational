not yet. Technology not yet fully developed, low hanging fruit not yet picked, no economy of scale etc. However, unlike 3D printing complex objects, where economy of scale and build quality really favour a centralized approach (despite what 3d printing enthusiasts say) house printing does not have the same issues.

However, seeing that labor costs make about 50% of house projects the advantages should be obvious. Naturally not all or even most of that is going to be masonry, (maybe 20?) but you should be able to have reduced build times as well. House owners and investors should like hugely reduced build times.

The construction savings are most evident if the houses you build dont need a lot of afterwork finish, eg. basic houses, shelter for the very poor or refugees. Without tons of plumbing, internal wiring, a basement etc. This is where we expect to see first widespread deployment, and indeed that is where we see the stories currently breaking taking place.

TDLR: Extremely basic houses, yes. Modern amenietes(?), developed world houses, not so much, and not until a while.
