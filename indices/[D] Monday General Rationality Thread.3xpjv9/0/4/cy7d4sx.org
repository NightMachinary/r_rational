Well I can't speak for them, but I can say why I don't like it.

At its worse, the community seems more like a cult than a group of people interested in overcoming biases and well thought out fiction.

For example, Friendly AI/Singularity stuff is just Rapture without the Jesus, AI-X Risk is Caveman Scifi for the modern age, Roko's Basilisk is Pascal's Wager with the serial numbers filed off (though at least noone takes that seriously) etc.

For all its focus on being rational, there's a lot of outlandish ideas passed around without any critical thinking.
