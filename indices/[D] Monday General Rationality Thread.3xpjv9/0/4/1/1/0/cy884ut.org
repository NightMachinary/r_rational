The wager depends on hypothetical existence of a thing Y which reinforces you significantly for a belief X, using a huge weight on the reinforcement to balance out the minuscule probability of its existence. The counterargument is to construct an equally-likely hypothetical Y' that reinforces belief not-X in the same way.

This was originally constructed in response to Pascal's wager, the reification being "Yes, but if I believe in God and I'm wrong then Azathoth or Thor will smite me".
