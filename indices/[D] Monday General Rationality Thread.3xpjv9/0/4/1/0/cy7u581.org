I suppose this is a side tangent, but I'm fairly skeptical about the scope for recursive self improvement.

First off, it's hard to make an argument that doesn't already apply to human history. Education will make people smarter, and then they figure out better method of education and so on. Technology makes people more effective and then they invent better technology, etc. Humans have been improving themselves for centuries, and the pace of technological advance has obviously increased, but there's no sign of a /hyperbolic/ takeoff, and I don't think there ever will be.

The other issue is that it flies in the face of all evidence and theory. Theoretical Computer Science gives us a lot of examples where there are hard limits on self improving processes. But FOOM advocates just ignore that and assume that all the problems that matter in real life are actually easy ones where complexity arguments don't apply, somehow.

Sometimes they get sloppy and ignore complexity entirely. If your story about FOOM AI involves it solving NP Hard problems, you should probably rethink your ideas, not the other way around. And yes, I know that P != NP isn't technically proven, but noone seriously doubts it, and if you want to be pedantic, you could substitute something like the Halting Problem, which people often implicitly assume AIs can solve.

There's also this weird obsession with simulations, without any real consideration of the complexity involved. My favorite was the story about a computer that could simulate the entire universe, /including/ /iteself/ with perfect accuracy in faster than real time. But pretty much any time simulations comes up, there's a lot of wooly thinking.
