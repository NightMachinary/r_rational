  but there's no sign of a hyperbolic takeoff, and I don't think there ever will be.

My understanding is that you don't really need hyperbolic takeoff, or even a move move up the computational complexity hierarchy, to get hard a disastrously hard takeoff. All you really need is to move your intelligence off electrochemical computational platforms and onto semiconductors, which gives you something like a factor of 1e8 speedup. Then you accidentally raise a single hyper-fast serial killer without having an equally performant police department in place, and creating that equally performant police department is chicken-and-egg problem.
