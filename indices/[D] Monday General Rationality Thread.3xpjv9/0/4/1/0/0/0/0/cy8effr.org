  There was a recent article by Scott Alexander that said he thinks we live in a world where the jump from infrahuman to superhuman is going to be very fast.

He's entirely wrong about that. Even Eliezer and Bostrom's arguments rely on the AI starting out /human-level/ intelligent, that is, capable of doing the computer-programming tasks necessary to improve itself usefully. A jump from "cow" to "superhuman" is so implausible I'd buy "someone deliberately upgraded it" first.
