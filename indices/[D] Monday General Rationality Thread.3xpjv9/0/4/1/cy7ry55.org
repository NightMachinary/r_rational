Perhaps the critical thinking is there you just haven't seen it being done? For example, it sounds like you're conflating [[http://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/schools/][at least two of the different versions of the singularity]]. I mean, a recursive self-improvement explosion is clearly a thing that could actually happen - we could do it ourselves pretty trivially if we didn't have all these hangups about medical research with psychedelics or if we dumped a spacex-sized pile of money into brain-computer interfaces - and the risk of unfriendly AI is obvious enough that /Hollywood/ has been making movies about it since the 60's, though as always [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/1/friendship-is-optimal/prologue-equestria-online][the real deal would be much more subtle and horrifying]]. I'll give you the initial response to the Basilisk, though; it's a non-issue now that people have realized that it's a wager and deployed the general-purpose wager countermeasure, but the flawed memetic form is still floating around causing problems.

I can see how it would be extremely cultish if viewed from the outside, though. It's a large, obviously coherent system of beliefs, with a consistent core and an unusual but relevant and deep-sounding response for many situations, and that gives it the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8/how_to_seem_and_be_deep/][seemings and feelings of deepness]] that you usually only see in religions. And then it comes down to whether your first impression suggests "Bible" or "Dianetics".

Probably explains why 95% of it is well-received if delivered on its own. Without the rest of the large mass giving it unusual coherence and consistency, it seems like just an awesome idea rather than a cult. Which would kind of explain the success I've had directing unsuspecting people to just the sequences, since by the time they've gotten to critical mass they've bought into most of what they've read.
