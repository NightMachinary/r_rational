Hmm, that might be the disagreement. To me, "there exist innately unpredictable events" means "there is a theoretical cap on the accuracy of any model". Which, maybe? Map-territory distinctions and computational complexity theory do suggest to me that there are systems which can produce events that couldn't have been predicted by any model simpler than the system itself.
