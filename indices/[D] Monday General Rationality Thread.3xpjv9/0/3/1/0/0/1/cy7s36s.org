I guess that's sort of what I'm wondering about. Spacebattles et al. seem to be completely on board with 95% of the individual ideas if presented on their own - all you really have to do is rephrase them and post them in isolation - but if you mention that you got it from LW it's suddenly rejected. As if the argument's validity is somehow dependent on who came up with it first. "They're rejecting what they see as a cult" might explain that, though.
