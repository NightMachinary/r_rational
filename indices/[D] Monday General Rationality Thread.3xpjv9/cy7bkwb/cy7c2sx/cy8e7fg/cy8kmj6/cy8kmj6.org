Most interesting, is that SpaceX's goal is to be sending up a Falcon 9 every two weeks. At that pace, no other company can near keeping up unless they also go to the reusable model. Because of this, the rate of adoption will be quite high - ignoring the fact that NASA and other regulatory bodies will slow it down. We'll see what happens.

The major question right now is how much refurbishment will need to be done to the first stage after landing it.
