A Falcon 9 launch currently costs $61 million (according to wikipedia). According to reading on [[/r/SpaceX]], the first stage makes up 75% of the cost. So yes, a rocket launch can now be down to $15 million. ULA, SpaceX's main competitor, costs the US government $380 million per launch.

To be fair, the cost for the government from SpaceX is $130 million instead of $61 million because of regulations and stuff, so a fair comparison would be $15 million versus $175 million. It's a /bit/ of a difference.
