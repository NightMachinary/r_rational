I don't really know anything about these questions, but my first (and perhaps very naive) reaction to this: isn't the mere possibility that the takeoff could be very fast and the computational problems tractable something to be worried about?

For example, if you were 95% confident that one of your objections here would hold in real life, that still leaves a 5% chance of potential disaster.
