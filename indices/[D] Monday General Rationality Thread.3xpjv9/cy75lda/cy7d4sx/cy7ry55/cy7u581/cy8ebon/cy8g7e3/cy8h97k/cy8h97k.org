  Re approximation: There are some problems where approximation is useful and some where it isn't. Generally, any problem inspired directly by the real world (routing your trucks, optimizing manufacturing processes, etc.) is a problem where approximations are useful. By contrast, more abstract problems, such as anything from cryptography tend to require an exact solution, where approximations are useless.

  There also seems to be a conservation of hardness thing. A randomly generated SAT instance is usually easy, but if you take a hard problem, say factorization, and convert it into a SAT, the resulting SAT instance is also intractable. There aren't any free lunches.

Well yes, of course.

  To the extent that "increasing intelligence", whatever that means, increases the ability to solve hard problems, then increasing intelligence is at least as hard as every problem which it enables a solution of. Complexity results just don't allow loopholes like that.

I do agree. I just also think that most problems related to the physical world, the ones that decide whether or not intelligence has real-world uses in killing all humans, are mostly problems were increasingly good characterizations (eg: acquiring better scientific theories) and approximations (possibly through specialized methods like building custom ASICs) can be helpful.

If we put this in pseudo-military terms, I don't expect a "war" against a UFAI to be "insta-win" for the AI "because FOOM", but I expect that humanity (lacking its own thoroughly Friendly and operator-controlled AIs) will start about even but suffer a steadily growing disadvantage.

  (You can still do stuff like increase clock speed, since that's just engineering, but you'll quickly run into physical limits there)

When you're worried about the /relative/ capability of a dangerous agent to /gain advantage/ over other agents, "just engineering" is all the enemy needs. A real-life UFAI doesn't need any access to Platonic truths or computational superpowers to do very real damage, nor does a real-life operator-controlled AI or FAI need any such things to do its own, more helpful, job competently.
