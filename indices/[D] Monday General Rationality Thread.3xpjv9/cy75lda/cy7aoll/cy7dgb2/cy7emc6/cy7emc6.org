Good point! That's what I'm talking about.

There's definitely some terminology problems here. "Rationalism" as it is used refers to a bunch of different ideas, some of which people like, and some of which people do not. This is exactly why, when you want to talk the things you want to share, you don't call it rationalism.

In a similar vein, when I try to introduce other things (like socialism or libertarianism or whatever charged idea there is) I don't call them by name. Names and labels hurt people's ability to be good about this kind of thing.
