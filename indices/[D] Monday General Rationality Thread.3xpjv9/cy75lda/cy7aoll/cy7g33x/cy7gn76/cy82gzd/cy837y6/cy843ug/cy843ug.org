I haven't actually run into anyone who's told me either of those things in response to a query so I can't say in context. Comparing "Read Yudkowsky's /The Sequences/" vs "Read Plato's /The Republic/", the latter sounds better, but this to me again boils down to a branding issue. If I wrote a book called /Modern Cognitive Science and You: Seventeen Easy Steps to Success/, even if it contained the same content, you'd have a real different experience recommending it to people. Same if a famous cognitive scientist wrote it and gave it a more professional title.

I'm sure it's not helped by rationalists suggesting it in a strange way, either. People in general don't know how to sell things. I doubt rationalists are an exception.
