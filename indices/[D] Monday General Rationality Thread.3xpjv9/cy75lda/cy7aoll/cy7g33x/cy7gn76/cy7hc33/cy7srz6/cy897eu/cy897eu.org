  Ironically, the thing I like most about this subculture is that we value the commonsensical and the natural over the Deeply Profound.

See, that's the interesting thing that I've just realized: a lot of what we see as being common-sense is, to people who haven't seen it before, Deeply Profound. Like, the bit about death being bad: We see it as blindingly obvious. Death is simply a /bad thing/ and I can't see anything in the laws of physics that demands it, and so I would prefer the universe where nobody has to die. But if you say all that to someone who hasn't thought about it, you end up Deeply Wise!

Agreed on needing better introductory material. EY's single biggest achievement is that he put all of this in a single place and organized it so a single person can assemble it for themselves. It's an important achievement, but it can be duplicated more easily now that it's been done once. We just have to get it put in more places.
