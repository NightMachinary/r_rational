Considering how much sufficient velocity and space battles pushes for starships that make very little sense, I'm pretty sure the "it's Nonsense" thing is not the real answer. But they as a total group might now know themselves.

Incidentally I've started crossposting a story that is threaded with a whole bunch of rationality stuff to their forums and responses are pretty positive so I think it's likely that their actually more concerned with the 'dressings' of rationality being distasteful and not the actual core ideas.
