While Eliezer's first post yelling at Roko was a very unfortunate, and the least calm thing I've ever seen him write, I think it's painfully clear that it's a non-issue E. and all of Less Wrong have no interest in talking about, but others like to bring it up again and again because it sounds silly, especially if you haven't read anything about all the stuff you need to read about for the idea to make sense.

I have tried to give Less Wrong a chance a few times, but it doesn't capture my attention. I read a few sequences every now and then, I like this sub, and... well, that's about it.
