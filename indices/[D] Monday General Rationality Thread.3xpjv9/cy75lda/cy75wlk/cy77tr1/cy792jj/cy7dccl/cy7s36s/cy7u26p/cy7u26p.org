People don't like to be fed "hooks" where you start with seemingly commonsensical ideas and end up with radical, implausible-sounding stuff, at least not as Author Tract-y stories. If you think your logic is airtight, you'll usually just talk to scholars. If you want to write a story, you keep the weird-logic in the background and let people work things out on their own.

People have very little reason to shift their fundamental, semi-metaphysical beliefs about the world just because someone's preaching at them. In fact, it's rude and gets people mad.
