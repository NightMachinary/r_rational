"Black swans" are indeed a load of bullshit. If your model (eg: Black-Scholes Equation) puts an extraordinarily low probability on an event (eg: demand-starved, debt-driven financial crisis) that other models (eg: conventional Keynesianism) called practically inevitable, and which has happened before (Great Depression), /it's just a bad model./
