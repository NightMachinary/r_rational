  lecturing them about Rationality or Science is like lecturing Ashmodai on Torah.

See, that's the thing- they respond with hostility even if there's no lecture, even in incredibly not-lulzy-fun threads. Like, you go into the debate subforum and check out the thread about life extending drugs, and you find out that they've spent three entire pages piling on a guy that said he wanted everybody to live forever. It's just weird.
