And now I'm actually reading /The Last Angel/ and finding it horrifically boring, basically a bland attempt at +HFY+ STANDARD SPACEBATTLES FARE - BATTLES IN SPACE - with overdramatized, clearly pulp-scifi-inspired navel-gazing attempts at Deep Meaning that even invoke "souls" and "sins" for spaceship AIs.

Oy gevalt. The damned thing thinks it has a soul and kills because it /hates/. And this is realistic?
