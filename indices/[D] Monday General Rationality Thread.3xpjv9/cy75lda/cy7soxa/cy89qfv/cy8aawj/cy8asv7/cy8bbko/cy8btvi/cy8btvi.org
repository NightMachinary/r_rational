Maybe my perception of it is different because I didn't even care that it's focused on humans. All I really saw was that it listed off about five or six civs that hit various different AI extinction risk failure modes - there's a CelestAI, a paperclipper, one that's unexplained so far but that I suspect is going to turn out to be a Whispering Earring, etc - and the one group that pulled it off because they did an upload and kept it as close to normal psychology as possible (even preventing forking) rather than attempting to design a mind from scratch. Which causes problems and /seems/ cheesy, but I wouldn't be surprised is actually relatively realistic. Also doesn't present AI as magical or "has already read the second half of the book" or "beep boop kill all humans".

I'll give you that it's overdramatic and cheesy in places. I don't feel like the AI is one of them, nor that its navel-gazing is that far past what we'd do in that situation.
