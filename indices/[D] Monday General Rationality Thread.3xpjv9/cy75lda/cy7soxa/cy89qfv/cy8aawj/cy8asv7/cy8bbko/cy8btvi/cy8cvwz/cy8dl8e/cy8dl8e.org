...I was wondering if the "'hate' engraved on each nanoangstrom" thing had really come up that early in the story, yeah.

Also, I don't often recommend this, but I'd suggest possibly going through the "who replied" list and reading the author's comments in the thread. It's possible that some of the things I'm remembering were extracted from author comments and wouldn't appear in the story proper unless he's done an edit pass. Which is a bit of a technical failure in the construction of the story, yes.
