Nah, there are /damn/ serious threads on there. Like, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The Last Angel]] is one of the single best portrayals I've ever found of AI in literature - it even [[#s][minor background spoiler]] - but I know from watching usernames that, if I posted any link back to an LW blog post, the author would be the only person in the thread that didn't join the lynch mob.

(apologies if I missed a sarcasm there... )
