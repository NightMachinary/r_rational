Last week my roommate was very pissed off at how hard it would be to run an independent study on bacopa monnieri, compared to quick and dirty trials we can run on other drugs.

Yesterday I tried to make coloured-flame candles and used basic science throughout. I used basic science to figure out seam strength when bonding two pieces of mylar space blanket together just last week.

We constantly use science to binary search though our 3D printers' problem space.

Science is not what lesswrong brings to the table though. It's impossible to do any kind of engineering job without at least a basic adherence to the scientific method.

A lot of the rationality techniques that I value most aren't just basic science though. When I did a CFAR workshop that was something that kept coming up, the cost of information and dealing with uncertainty.

As an individual, you don't have the time or resources to test your questions against reality.

Take, as an example, the question of what career to take, or which job offer to take. The scientific method won't help you here.

People conflait lesswrong style rationality with science because +they+we talk about science a lot. But science is only one tool in the toolkit, and although it's often useful in my day to day life, it's only useful when your claims are testable.

The practical explanations of cognitive biases, cached thoughts, etc are really what make it a useful toolkit.
