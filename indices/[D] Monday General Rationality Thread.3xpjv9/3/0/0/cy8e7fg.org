Does anyone know of the science behind speed of adoption of innovations vs costsavings? Eg. is there a law or relationship between magnitude of cost savings vs adoption rate?

I remember from my chemistry years that industrial replacement cycles are on the order of >50 years; 2007 some of the oldest, most inefficient methods for H² or SO⁴ production were on their last factories, which surprised me. I'd have expected the huge costsavings trough increased effiency to have much faster market adoption.

Related to Falcon 9, I'd expect x10 in cost reduction to lead to 90% adoption in 2 build cycles.
