I'm not aware of any studies, but the obvious relationship would be based on the required capital investments and rate of return. Effectively ROI. For things like chemical factories I assume regulatory costs of opening a new facility slow the process down by lowering ROI

As older facilities breakdown eventually it becomes worth it to upgrade.

But I suspect if you asked this on marginal revolution you'd get a better answer. Isn't it tabbarok's law -- there are always more studies than you think.
