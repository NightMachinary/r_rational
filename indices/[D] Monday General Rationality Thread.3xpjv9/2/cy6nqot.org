What's a good way to go about giving to charity? The way I see it, here are two parts to the question: how you choose a cause/organisation to support, and how you go about actually supporting it.

For the first, one obvious answer among this group would be some form of effective altruism, and just leave it at that. That leaves me with the question of what to do about groups that I'm personally involved in, or else are relevant only to the local area.

I don't have a good or simple answer for the second half, other than to give money (the currency of caring.) Beyond that, do you guve a lump sum once a year? Wait for some matching opportunity? Automatic monthly ones? Also, volunteering seems like a good idea for some things, mostly akrasia and community building.
