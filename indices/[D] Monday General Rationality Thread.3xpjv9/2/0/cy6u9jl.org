I'm not a very charitable person, but there are a couple of causes/organizations I support. I mostly donate to feel good about myself, but also out of some basic duty to donate some nonzero amount of money. I donate about 0.5% of my gross income. Whenever I think about the money I donate, I feel proud of myself. It's also great to talk about. In terms of value for the money, donating to charity is a great way to make yourself feel good.

I donate a small amount of money to [[https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give][Wikipedia]] every year. I do this because I think Wikipedia is great, and I get a lot of use out of it. Wikipedia needs (I think) about 3 dollars per year per user to operate, so I donate 10 dollars a year and feel pretty good about helping out one of the most useful tools at the level of "I'm doing my part, at least, and covering for a couple less fortunate people".

I also donate a medium amount of money to [[https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/onetime.cfm][Doctors Without Borders]], who do good. Givewell doesn't find them transparent enough to be a good idea to fully evaluate (compared to AMF or other charities) but gives them a [[http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/doctors-without-borders][positive review]]. Doctors Without Borders is often involved in crisis areas, and also helps provide medicine and medical care throughout the world in underdeveloped communities. It's nice to donate to Doctors Without Borders and feel good about myself.

My last donation is a political one, so you can stop here if you want. I donate a moderate amount of money to the American Civil Liberties Union (which I will not link, since it's political). The ACLU is an organization that defends the rights and liberties of Americans in court and by pushing legislature. Traditionally, they advocate for freedom of speech and religion, defending for example anti-war protestors. They also fought on behalf of the Japanese-American internees during WW2, and more recently for the rights of students, homosexuals, and the poor. They're also aggressively against the PATRIOT act, a set of laws that vastly increases the powers of the state and restricts civil rights in order to fight terrorism. I feel like the ACLU is one of the few big organizations fighting to keep America great and free.
