Perhaps you can publically commit money to the first matching opportunity that arises for a given rate and recipient. (Which is effectively matching with the reciprocal rate.) Although all these zero-sum moves in a game of charity are kind of silly, and I don't know how to mathematically tell apart "matching" and "taking hostages" and "proposing trade" and "blackmail".
