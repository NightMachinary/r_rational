I think this is one of those moments when it would be appropriate to ping. [[/u/sam512]]

Assuming that he doesn't answer, his website, [[https://qntm.org/][Things of Interest]] has a number of non-fiction articles about writing, which don't necessarily go over his process, but illuminate how he thinks about writing. These are usually in his blog section, which has a lot of other stuff and no tagging, but the most relevant here are the most recent three posts there:

- [[https://qntm.org/worldbuilding][Worldbuilding]]
- [[https://qntm.org/mystery][Stomp on the Mystery Box]]
- [[https://qntm.org/write][Write Like a Programmer]]
