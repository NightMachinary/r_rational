I've lately had a lot of success looking for, not advice, but reporting by authors I like about their everyday process. Then I try out their specific practices one by one and find which ones work. I started doing this about a year ago, and the results have been very good, in the quality of the work I produce (I like it), the speed with which I produce it (two novels, a handful of essays and short stories, and good progress on other projects), and the diminishing of the negative side-effects of writing (burnout, existential crises, etc.). But there's still more I can grow :)
