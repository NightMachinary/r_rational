Low willpower: I think replacing all the milk in your house with soy/almond milk is an easy way to make a low willpower change. You really can substitute them freely for cow's milk in recipes and whatnot, and you really do get used to the taste (I used to drink a really bad tasting brand of soy milk because it had the most fortification, and I got used to it). Request soy/almond when it's available, and when it's not, don't. That said, I think animal welfare wise, milk is the least of our worries not because the dairy cow has a pleasant existance (it's not), but because the dairy cow produces so much cow's milk that an average american probably causes about 10 days of dairy cow suffering drinking milk per year, whereas if you eat a chicken you're causing 60 days of chicken suffering /per chicken/, which is qualitatively probably worse.

More low willpower changes can include things like if you are buying nuggets, try buying the vegetarian/vegan alternative. They are processed out the wazoo anyway so you will notice minimal difference. They are slightly more expensive though.

Another low willpower change is something like "meatless monday" or "vegan before 6pm" type things. Or just find and add a few vegan dishes into your regular rotation, or if you're going for fast food, go to places that you know have a veg option that you like rather than a veg option you'll accept.

RE muddled messaging:

I think the big thing with veganism is that there are so many reasons. Health (admittedly, the "objectively healthiest diet" is probably vegan + fish, but vegan is probably better than what most people reading this are eating now), the environment, animal welfare. So vegans, I guess, try to attack from all sides. If I'm in "advance the cause of veganism" mode, I'll go for the environment because health has people asking dumb questions ("where do you get protein?"), welfare has people making dumb statements ("being a dairy cow isn't that bad!"/"how do we know chickens have feelings?"), whereas the environment is pretty uncontroversial and the average liberal youth cares about global warming a great deal.

  if I only care about animal welfare, I should still be able to eat things without nervous systems
#+end_quote

There are vegans who do that; oysters and clams. My husband eats them very occasionally; my partner refuses to.

  if I only care about the environment I should be able to hunt, kill, and eat deer
#+end_quote

Maybe; depends on the environmental impact of deer hunting which I have heard is not great, I'm sure there's tons of politics with it but I am completely ignorant on the subject, but there are vegans who do this.

#+begin_quote
  if not that then kill and eat animals that I'm growing on my own land.
#+end_quote

Unless you have a very specific type of land, you'd get more calories by growing vegetables on that land, but I know you were just giving examples.

(note that when I say "there are vegans who do [thing that would make them by definition non-vegan]" I should add that other vegans would revoke their vegan card for doing that and it would probably cause a big debate, but I hope you understand my rhetorical device there).

#+begin_quote
  I tried veganism for a few months, just to see what it was like, and didn't really care for it.

How long ago? What didn't you like? The people? The lack of options eating out? You couldn't find recipes? You just don't like cooking?
