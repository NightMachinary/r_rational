  How long ago? What didn't you like? The people? The lack of options eating out? You couldn't find recipes? You just don't like cooking?

This was back in 2004, so a long time ago, and a very different life than what I have now. Mostly it was a lot of work making sure that things were actually vegan instead of just "not obviously made of animals", but partly it was that nothing tasted quite as good. I blame some of that on marketing: a lot of vegan stuff is labeled something like "vegan brownies" but it's not actually a brownie, it's just a poor substitute that I'm now comparing to an actual brownie (which the vegan version simply cannot compete with unless you've forgotten what a brownie tastes like or have a very different palate from mine). I had that experience repeated over and over.

It's something that I could put time, effort, money, and unhappiness into again. I guess I could run the numbers some afternoon.
