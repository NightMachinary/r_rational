  One of the things that I find strange about vegans is that the arguments come from all over the place; in one sentence it's about the environment, while in the next it's about animal welfare, and then it quickly switches to health benefits. For most people these are contributing factors, but it brings in so many different debates at once.

Indeed -- I have seen this confusion as well. The phenomenon is a bit strange, and I have pet theories for why it's happening. However, [[https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism][veganism is, and always has been, the philosophical position that other animals deserve equal ethical consideration]]. By adopting that philosophy, one becomes a vegan, and by /extension/ of becoming vegan, they're also helping the environment, human health, etc. However, adopting a plant-based diet (e.g. for health reasons) doesn't make one vegan per se; that would be kind of like deciding to keep a kosher kitchen and then self-identifying as Jewish without ever adopting the tenets of Judaism. Likewise, avoiding animal exploitation out of a concern for the environment in and of itself also doesn't make one vegan.

This isn't meant to take anything away from environmentalists who avoid animal products out of concern for the environment, or from health-conscious folks who adopt a plant-based diet. More power too them! However, until they actually adopt the philosophy of veganism, it's actually a misnomer for them to self-identify as being vegan.

Fair enough? ^{*=o)*}
