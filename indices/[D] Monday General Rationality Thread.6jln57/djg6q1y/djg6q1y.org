I recently had a (possibly somewhat wrong, but interesting) insight that could be summed up as Everything Is A Skill.

Being a great writer (or even just a hack who can churn out a story from start to finish on demand)? Skill.

Having original new ideas? Skill.

Resisting food cravings so you lose weight? Totally a skill.

Being skeptical of extraordinary claims? Also a skill.

Habits and skills are almost the same thing, i.e. sets of conditioned responses. Some are aided by instinct, but most can be learned by repetition, and can be formed more easily under certain drugs (nicotine for example). Some sets of responses (those that produce negative outcomes, like smoking or overeating) may also be thought of as anti-skills, although these tend to be categorized as habits due to their relatively low complexity (which I think is because they are the kinds that are formed by accident, which usually filters out more complex habits).

A writer instinctively models their story arc and characters, and responds with predictions about what they will do that could make a great story, a person who successfully loses and keeps off weight responds to hunger cravings with a distraction or inhibiting thought of some kind. They do this mostly at the pre-conscious or unconscious level.

Newbies trying to gain a skill tend to have to use the conscious level, which makes them feel incompetent because the conscious mind doesn't have that much control and is easily distracted/bored. Depending how you react to that feeling (which itself is a skill/habit) you might tend to drop skills before getting competent with them.

I also think social incentives to learn a given skill have a lot of leverage because we tend to do things that are socially approved of even if we don't feel like we are doing them well. However this only works when the social incentive is to perform an action integral to the skill, as opposed to actions that superficially resemble the skill.
