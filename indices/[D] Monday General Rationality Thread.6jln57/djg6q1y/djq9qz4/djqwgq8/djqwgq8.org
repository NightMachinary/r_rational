  Is mayonnaise a skill?
#+end_quote

No, of course it isn't. I was going for shorthand though, not tautology.

Everything Is A Skill => Many more things are trainable mappings from experience to behavior (skills) than one might think.

Making mayonnaise from raw ingredients is obviously a skill, but making a sandwich from mayonnaise by spreading it on with a knife is a skill too (it's just so super-easy to learn that we all tend to learn it and forget there was ever a time we couldn't do it).

The main point I had in mind is that most human behavior is the result of or at least strongly influenced by skill levels. This is interesting because when we think of self improvement we often think in terms of specific outcomes (lose weight) instead of trying to practice up a skill (resist food).

That isn't to say you would be likely to train 'resist food' without 'lose weight' in mind, but it is a totally different way of framing the task -- grinding rather than questing, if you will. I suspect it is a perspective that factors a lot into why some people are more persistent than others; they view the attempt and experience gained as itself valuable, so there is a mental reward for each additional try.
