Has anyone here read Seeing like a State? One review:

#+begin_quote
  Subconsciously or not, most of us presuppose malice behind failure. This goes doubly for historical failures, and quadruply for political failures. The daily form of this hisses about “corrupt politicians” (past and present), perhaps about “businessmen and special interests”. The more extreme forms fall into conspiracy theory. Often this is diagnosed as a form of pessimism, especially “pessimism about politics”. That's wrong; it's optimism.

  The pessimistic view is this: “Everyone is just trying their best.” If the horrors of history are the result of /ill will/ then we should take comfort. It may not always be possible to avoid evil dictators, but at least we know that human agency has some power. An evil person realizing their evil machinations implies that /perhaps/ a good person can successfully realize a good plan. Stalin may have been /mean and bad/, but if we just get the right people in there (read: me), then surely The Good will result. But if everyone is just “trying their best” then none of this is assured. Indeed -- something is so broken that our best intentions /still/ produce misery. So... what happened?

  Seeing like a State sets out to answer this question. Namely: why do we see large state schemes cause /so much misery/ even when guided by good intentions and (seemingly) careful design? And that also explains its subtitle: /How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed./

Seems like it could be a good read based on this. Have you read it? And if so, what did you think of it?
