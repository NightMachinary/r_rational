So, veganism is surprisingly popular in rationality circles. I've been vegan a couple of years now (and cooking exclusively vegan for ~4.5), I'm passionate about cooking and eating good food, and I'm a very small way through a bachelor's degree in nutrition.

I don't want to start a debate - there's [[/r/debateavegan]] if you're so inclined, or have a read through [[http://www.yourveganfallacyis.com][www.yourveganfallacyis.com]] - but if you have any genuine questions that can't be easily answered on google, I'm happy to help out.

The more specific the question is, the better. (e.g. "my diet looks like this. what are some high value changes I can make?", "Can you tell me how to enjoy tofu?", "I've heard that vegans don't get enough protein. I'm guessing that's not true because vegans are not dying en masse, but what's the deal with protein?", "my favourite food is X. Do you have any vegan recipes for X?")

Some recommendations for improving the environment, animal welfare, and your own health that will not change the quality of your life:

- /Try unsweetened almond milk/. Next time you're at the shops, get a carton of it and give it a try. When I first tried it I found it was /so much better than cow's milk/ in cereal and hot chocolate. It is also very low in calories, which might benefit people trying to lose weight. Subbing cow's milk for almond milk at your home is an easy change, doesn't require a lifestyle change (I mean, order it at cafes when you can, but you'll still be able to go to cafes and what not). If you can't stand it, then you're not forced to keep drinking it. But give it a try. (Tip: get the cheapest, most processed, least "natural/organic" brand you can. The expensive organic brands tend to have a poor texture).

- When you're eating out, genuinely consider the vegetarian menu option. People tend not to choose from the vegetarian section if they're not vegetarian because they don't consider it "as good". Check it out and see if you could go without meat for that one meal. Meat is very environmentally destructive: eliminating meat from one meal saves more greenhouse gases than eliminating /every single one/ of your food miles for a week.

- If you bake, buy "egg replacer" powder and use it in baked goods (pancakes, cakes, etc). In Australia there's a brand called Ogran, and I believe in the US there's one called Ener-G. They're very common. It's a white powder that you can get in health food sections in supermarkets, 1 tsp powder + 2 tbsp water can replace an egg in most baked goods. Nobody makes a chocolate cake to get that eggy taste. It's cheaper than chicken's eggs, and I doubt the difference is noticeable in a baked good.

- Just avoid eggs in general. They're one of the worst possible things you can eat, animal-welfare wise. I'm not asking you to eat scrambled tofu (though scrambled tofu is nice), but if you're ordering a burger that normally comes with egg, maybe ask them to leave it off?
