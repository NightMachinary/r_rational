I'd say, just replacing your cow's milk with almond milk would be great from a weight loss perspective, though almond milk is lower in protein and fat and may not be as satiating - but one glass of it probably won't make much difference. Soy milk is more similar to cow's milk nutritionally, so it might be a better substitution if you find almond milk doesn't satiate you as much.

How are you preparing the chicken, eggs, etc? What are you eating them with? Do you cook?

Butter and yogurt can be bought in vegan versions pretty easily now: replacing butter with a vegan equivalent (I believe Earth Balance is the most ubiquitous American brand) is an especially good idea as butter is high in saturated fat, which is not very good for you.

In terms of replacing the chicken, without knowing how you prepare it I can't give you great instructions. If you're frying it, replacing it with some tofu or tempeh would be the way to go.

Tempeh has a very strong taste and some people don't like it - it took me about 10 years before I started enjoying it, and I think that's more because I started buying a different brand. It can taste very bitter, but steaming it first seems to fix that - doesn't really make things "easy" though does it?

Tofu has a bad rap, try pressing it, marinating it, etc. I like to pres it, marinate it, coat it in cornstarch, and then fry it in canola oil.

Looking at the nutrition information for chicken breasts: ONE chicken breast has 120% of your daily protein needs, so if you're eating two... that's an awful lot of protein, and too much protein can actually be bad for you (i'm guessing you are not an internationally competitive weight lifter).

Tofu over chicken breast, assuming about the same number of calories, has about the same amount of fat, about half the protein (but still plenty; the amount of protein you're eating is kind of excessive), the /tofu/ has more iron, also more folate, less sodium (by a huge margin), more magnesium (common deficiency).

Honestly, thinking it over, I'd say if you replaced even one of those chicken breasts with a grain or a tin of legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans, etc), you'd not be compromising any of your goals (unless you're an international weight lifter), you'd save money, and my husband has been known to eat a tin of legumes straight out of the can with some hot sauce, so it's a time-saver, too. That's not an 80/20 intervention, though: maybe a 20/40? :P

Per my OP, I'd be more interested in getting those eggs out of your diet, but without knowing exactly how you're eating them it's hard to give you a specific bit of advice. (That said: you can replace them with cereal, a protein shake, or the aforementioned tin of legumes)
