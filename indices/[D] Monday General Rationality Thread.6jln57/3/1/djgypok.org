This kind of is similar to alexanderwales comment, but in terms of low hanging fruit and 80/20 (where you get the first 80% of the benefit from the first 20% of the effort) what are some good interventions to make from a health perspective? I'm primarily concerned with eating natural and healthy food in reasonable amounts and being satiated enough to continue exercising and losing weight. In a typical day, it's common for me two have two chicken breasts, a glass of milk, and 2 eggs, as well as the occasional use of other products such as butter or yogurt.
