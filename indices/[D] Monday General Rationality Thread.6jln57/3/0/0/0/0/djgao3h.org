The difference in just the past 5 years has been night and day. I think you'd have a far easier time of it now. I mean, vegan icecream is actually decent now! (I have my own ice cream machine that I use to make mine from scratch, and I culture my own vegan cheese: but the retail versions of the same aren't bad)

On brownies: that's the bane of my existence. Vegan becoming synonymous with gluten free somehow has destroyed me because it's so hard to get anything decent in the dessert department. But you can get vegan chocolate flavoured almond milk or coconut water from time to time as of very recently! It's made me so very happy as I don't drink caffeine and I try to avoid fizzy drinks because of the sugar content. Used to not be able to get chips in anything other than original flavour, but now there's a variety of milk-powder-free flavours (not all of them, but some!).

I recommend this brownie recipe: [[http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2016/10/13/sweet-potato-brownies-recipe/]] - yeah it has sweet potatoes in it and I was skeptical when I made them but I did it on strength of the reviews, and they're probably the best vegan brownies I've made, and I struggled so hard to find a good recipe. Still not perfect though, but not bad.

More generally, you can do the whole "vegan at home" thing as a good "stepping stone" so to speak, and do whatever standard you want out of the house.
