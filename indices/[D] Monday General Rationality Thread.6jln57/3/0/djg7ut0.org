What are the highest impact /and lowest willpower/ changes? Or would that vary too much based on personal preference, personal diet, and personal values?

One of the things that I find strange about vegans is that the arguments come from all over the place; in one sentence it's about the environment, while in the next it's about animal welfare, and then it quickly switches to health benefits. For most people these are contributing factors, but it brings in so many different debates at once.

Like, if I /only/ care about animal welfare, I should still be able to eat things without nervous systems, and if I /only/ care about the environment I should be able to hunt, kill, and eat deer, or if not that then kill and eat animals that I'm growing on my own land (or, if not even that because a humane death is still a death, then my pet chicken surely can be allowed to feed me eggs).

I don't know, I used to work at a food co-op and thought a lot of the veganism stuff was just horribly muddled. I also worked on a farm for a while and it's hard for me to connect too much with the animal suffering aspect, since /factory farms/ are a whole different thing. I tried veganism for a few months, just to see what it was like, and didn't really care for it.
