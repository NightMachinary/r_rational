As far as I understand it, intelligence = having knowledge. Knowing how to do things, knowing how to make things, etc.

Wisdom = having "good" goals. I.e., Prioritizing things that are "good", like "self-preservation", over things that are less "good" like "lust".

Except of course, what defines a "good" goal is extremely subjective. So calling someone wise just means you acknowledge their goals are good, in your opinion.
