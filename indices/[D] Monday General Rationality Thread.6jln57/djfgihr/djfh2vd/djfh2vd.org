Yeah it's probably still useful to have separate words though, since there is a real phenomenon for "someone who is "smart" by metrics in some easy-to-measure ways, but somehow doesn't convert this into success". Even if there's no fundamental difference between "smart in ways measured by metrics" and "smart in terms of getting what you want done" and these are just different points on a sliding scale, it's still useful to have diff words for them.
