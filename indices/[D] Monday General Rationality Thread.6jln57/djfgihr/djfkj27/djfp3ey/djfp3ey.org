What you described as different wisdoms are just (heuristic?) optimisations to the thinking-computation (don't compute to the fine precision when you are not going to use it, reuse previously computed results if available). Why are you think-computing in the first place? Presumably you have a goal you are trying to archive, and you want to archive it without extra work. Thus the desire for efficiency folds into utility function, and the entire process is still just the maximisation of it.
