[[https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/6jijbn/what_is_in_your_headcanon/djetby7/][I like this headcanon for the Emperor of Mankind.]] Not only is it suitably grimdark, but it makes actual sense for where his sort of character comes from.

Normal humans, even superpowered ones, just don't decide to become galaxy-conquering ubermenschen, especially not galaxy-conquering ubermenschen who sabotage themselves by sheer lack of ability to understand regular humans.

However, if you're in a situation where you're never sure if He really accounted for this or not, where everything may just be according to His design, where nothing can make Him give in or trade off, where only on one super-pressured occasion is He ever seen to /lose/? He's probably not a normal human.

[[#s][/Master of Mankind/]]

Or more probably, the writers had to give Him /just low enough/ Charisma, Empathy, and Diplomacy scores that He would /lose/. Because lacking those, He would have gotten what He wanted and beaten the gods -- for humanity, whatever humanity was in Him in the first place.
