Ultimately I think pretty much every kind of function the machine we call the brain can do is capable of being boiled down to a form of intelligence. But the label of Wisdom is just the box we draw around some combination of:

A) Intelligence in how to optimize actions to coincide with particular goals/beliefs

B) Intelligence in how to imagine and synthesize the overall long term big picture of different competing goals/views

C) Intelligence in specific domains that are separate from "traditional" intelligence domains, such as empathy and navigating social situations rather than memorization/mathematics/etc.

And maybe D) Intelligence in perceiving differences in various domains of intelligence. Plenty of very smart people win awards and get accolades for their work in a particular field, and then start speaking authoritatively on fields outside their expertise rather than recognizing that they're not applying a proportional level of time and effort and skill in those areas.

Just thinking out loud, not sure how firm I am on any of this.
