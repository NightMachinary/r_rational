I sometimes hear people empathizing the difference between intelligence and wisdom. Usually 'supported' by some lame quasi-deep quotes like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/325uep][here]]. Is there an actual difference if we adopt a rigorous definition of intelligence, i.e. the ability to maximize one's utility function? It seems to me that there isn't, and what is commonly referred to as wisdom is simply greater levels of intelligence, stuff like accounting for longer-term consequences, accurately modelling other actors or responses of complex systems, etc.
