"Intelligence" as "fitness for a goal" probably isn't a very good definition. I'd just use "ability to precisely (without introducing additional noise in the inferential process) manipulate complex (high K-complexity, many bits to encode) cognitive representations (generative models)".

Under this definition, there is a difference between intelligence and wisdom, but there are also multiple kinds of "wisdom". Wisdom could then consist in fluidly trading-off precision, complexity, and accuracy/utility in one's representation (knowing when /not/ to overcomplicate, or when it's useful to do so), but also in having certain /a posteriori/ knowledge that closes off possibilities and saves on deliberation ("a tomato may be a fruit, but it just doesn't go in fruit salad").
