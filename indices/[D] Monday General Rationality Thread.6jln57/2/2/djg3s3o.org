My preferred (quasi-deep?) aphorism is "A clever man gets what he wants, but a wise man knows what's worth wanting." If I were to make this rigorous, I would say that "wisdom," used colloquially, corresponds to having strong heuristics that cut down the search space to just the things that are important for achieving long-term goals or ultimate values. Whereas "intelligence" in this sense is a strong reasoning ability towards achieving short-term or mid-term goals. Of course, at the end of the day, it's all "intelligence," but wisdom is still a useful term for high-level heuristic pruning. So my view is essentially a combination of [[/u/DaystarEld]]'s

  B) Intelligence in how to imagine and synthesize the overall long term big picture of different competing goals/views
#+end_quote

and [[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai]]'s

#+begin_quote
  Wisdom = having "good" goals.
#+end_quote

For example, let's use a quote from the AskReddit thread you linked:

#+begin_quote
  Intelligence is knowing that Frankenstein was the doctor. Wisdom is knowing that Frankenstein was the monster.
#+end_quote

To know that Frankenstein was the doctor is to have technically accurate propositional knowledge, useful for making pedantic points in debates about Frankenstein, not all that useful for much else. To know that Frankenstein was the monster is to make a moral judgement, thereby allowing a deeper understanding of the literary point and enabling the metaphor to be applied more generally.

It's like the difference between tactics and strategy in chess. An intermediate player notices the tactical themes on the current chessboard, but a "wise" grandmaster sees the long-term strategy and can instantly focus on the right moves without an easy propositional explanation. Wisdom, almost by definition, must be on the level of holistic pattern recognition, attainable only through experience.
