  Why is it so hard to find fantasy books that focus on the personal development/selfish goals of a normal protagonist in a fantasy setting?

Konosuba is an extremely popular comedy deconstruction of this trope. It is also an anime - basically an exact opposite of a book.

As for why books aren't like that, authors tend to be relatively insulated people is my guess. They don't exactly go around looking at TV shows and movies that */frequently/* have these characters in more modern contexts.
