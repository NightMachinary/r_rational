Why not? Can't farm boys be rational, if they learn how?

A great deal of rational fiction seems to deal with the concept of 'a particularly intelligent and rational person gains access to some source of special power that allows them to break the normal rules. How do they exploit this in surprising ways?' or 'rational character faces some unique and surprising challenge and applies rationality to solve it'.
