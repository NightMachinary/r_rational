  how do you turn him into someone who can take on a dark lord so fast in a believable way?

Well, in real life, dark lords remain undefeated simply because most people don't care enough to try to defeat them. The lesson of heroic stories is that even you, simple farm boy, can make a difference if you actually try to do so.

I think Batman could, in fact, do the first thing, if not the second. Unfortunately, the other truth about real life is that assassinating the big bad guy doesn't usually actually help matters, but still.
