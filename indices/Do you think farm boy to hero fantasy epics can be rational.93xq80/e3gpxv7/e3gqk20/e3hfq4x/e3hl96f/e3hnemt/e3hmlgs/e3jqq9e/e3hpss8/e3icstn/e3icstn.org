  - Explaining prophesy, how it relates to the world and the magic system, how did people verify that prophesies are legit form of divination and not the ravings of lunatics?
#+end_quote

You can either have prophecies as lies to manipulate people: perhaps someone knows the farmboy is one of the few mages of equal power to the evil king, but knows that few would follow a farmer, so makes a prophecy to convince people he's a special hero, or it's a ploy to lure out someone who fits the description provided in it. Or it's actual magical future knowledge, whatever a prophecy states will come true, though naturally there's multiple interpretations of most and those meanings must be exploited (a farmboy is prophecised to defeat the dread lord, so he faces the boy in an duel ending at first blood and loses to get around it).

  - What makes our farm boy so special?Why was he chosen and not the farmer next door?
#+end_quote

Usually there's some farmboy out their who is somehow special (a genius, a wizard etc.) the reason for this depends on your world (a magical event when he was conceived, genetics, simple random chance etc. however people like that usually occur), and naturally we follow the life of this farmer because he's the special one, noone writes about the one who spent his entire life just mucking out pigsties.

  - Why would the farm boy succeed where so many failed before him?how do you turn him into someone who can take on a dark lord so fast in a believable way? (Without years of training, and studying, making connections etc.. )\\
#+end_quote

Broadly it's because he's somehow better than the others who tried, maybe he does get training or maybe he's blessed with some innate power that he instinctively knows how to use.

  - Realistically, what can one person do?if the whole society couldn't get rid of the dark mage, how can one farm boy make a difference without having a powerful backing?in modern terms, it's like telling me that Batman could kill Putin and take over Russia on his own.

Usually he does have the backing of rebels, beyond that it's generally a case of there being an evil ruler and some loyal lieutenants at the top, then a whole bunch of people ruled by fear below them. Sometimes he's directly controlling his armies (necromancer with an undead army fuelled by his own magic that collapses without him, army of robots that are no longer a problem once the central command computer is taken, mind controlled slaves freed by his death).
