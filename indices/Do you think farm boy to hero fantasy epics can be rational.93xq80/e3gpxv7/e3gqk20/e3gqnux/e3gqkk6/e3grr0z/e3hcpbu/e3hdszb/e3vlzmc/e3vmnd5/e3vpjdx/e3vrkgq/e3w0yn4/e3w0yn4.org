Precisely, it's very enjoyable. Though I'd argue that she's not the only one who can defeat many of those supervillains, she's just the one that ends up doing it.

She's not the only one that could potentially have beaten the final challenge (unsure if you've finished it and don't want to spoil), but she's the one that does, and innumerable stories have been written about other heroes or villains that could potentially have done it, through powers or simply through figuring out what makes the final challenge tick and advising others.

There's one awesome and relatively short Supreme Commander crossover that's actually able to take on the final challenge head-to-head through self-replicating armies with overwhelming firepower.

Thinking about it, it's not necessarily "there's only one person who can do it" that I mind, it's when the reason only they can do it is because it's "fated" or when the reason seems contrived, like "only they are brave enough" or "only they are clever enough" when they never really display qualities particularly above the normal for people in the setting.
