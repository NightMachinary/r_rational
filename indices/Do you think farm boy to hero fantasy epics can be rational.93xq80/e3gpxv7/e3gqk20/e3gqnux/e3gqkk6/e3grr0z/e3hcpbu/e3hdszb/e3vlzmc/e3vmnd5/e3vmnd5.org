  Ah, that's fair enough. I mostly have an issue with the stories where the basic core of the story is "there's a super-special person and nobody else in the entire universe can change anything except this one guy."

Yeah, and I can see where you're coming from. I think the prevalence of that sort of story is largely because it's a whole lot easier to write, rather than for any deeper reason. You only need to consider a world, and the changes wrought upon that world by /one/ person (two if you allow the Villain to make his own changes). You don't need to consider the consequences of ten thousand different people each trying to make their mark on the world...

  Though evidently it does not have to be the final confrontation, there might be many other occasions to stop the villain for good, but at all the other occasions a lot more people die,

That works too. Then there are stakes - if the Hero fails in this confrontation, a dozen cities die before the next Hero can step up. That maintains narrative tension; especially if one or more characters whom the reader has met are in these cities at the time.
