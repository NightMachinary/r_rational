Why must the protagonist be the only one capable of dealing with the villain?

I'm a big fan of seeing stories from the perspective of "this isn't the story of a super-special person, this is a historical retelling of the one guy that did end up doing the thing, and we only retell it about him because he did it".

It's not that noone else couldn't theoretically have done it, it's that he's the one that ended up succeeding, potentially doing more good than if the villain had fallen to some other circumstance later, or been allowed to rule until his heir took over.
