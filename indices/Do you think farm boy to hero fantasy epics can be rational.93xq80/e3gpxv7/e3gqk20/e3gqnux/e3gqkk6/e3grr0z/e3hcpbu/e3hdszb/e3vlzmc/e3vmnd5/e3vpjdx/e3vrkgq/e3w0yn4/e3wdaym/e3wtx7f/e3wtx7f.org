Either earn it, or just make it feasible that they possess a quality or combination of qualities that lets them do a thing that noone else has managed to do before.

Halo for example, kind of half-assed it by saying that what 117 had most of that noone else did was "luck", while Half-Life has the more believable example that Gordon Freeman is a regular guy, but placed at precisely the right time and place where some powerful organization who can see the future foresaw him reaping an unstoppable path of death through the Evil Empire's lines.

He himself is not special, he's just at the precisely right time and place with precisely the mind, skills, causal butterflies etc as determined by a clairvoyant, and that seemed feasible enough to not bother me, since it's clear that the primary reason other people haven't already done what he's doing is that the Evil Empire of Half Life is simply obscenely powerful and normal people have a hilarious mortality rate when fighting them.
