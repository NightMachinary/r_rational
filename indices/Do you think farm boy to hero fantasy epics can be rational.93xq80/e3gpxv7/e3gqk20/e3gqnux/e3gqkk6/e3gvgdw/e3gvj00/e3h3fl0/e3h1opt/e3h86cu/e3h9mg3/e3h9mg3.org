Dunno if this is coincidence or just subtle really good writing, but the reason why it took the black death for the renaissance to happen is because the black death basically killed half the population of Europe, including many of the various guild's customers:

Guilds, from the 1100s to the 1400s, basically burned stuff and killed anyone that tried to sell more than their quota - the "higher profit per sale, lower profit from fewer sales overall" method. The black death killed enough customers and guild members alike that modern capitalism was able to take root in Europe. Women were forced/paid highly to work in jobs (/gasp!/) as compared to at home and in the fields in order to literally keep gov'ts and businesses from collapsing. The black death also was a crucial moment for humanity in general, as that basically forced politicians/kings/businesses to care about the /health/ of their citizens (as compared basically breeding them for hundreds of years like cattle), as well as introduced the beginnings of germ theory, along with the baby steps on the importance of sanitation.

My guess is that in the Eragon series, the bad guy (forget his name) was basically trying to oppress his people, like many modern day dictators.

If people are able to profit and the gov't can't control the people into following the gov'ts completely arbitrary and morally wrong rules, that profit leads to investment and development, and eventually revolt. Change the gov'ts rules to be more sensible (like allowing development and investment), and boom, no revolts.
