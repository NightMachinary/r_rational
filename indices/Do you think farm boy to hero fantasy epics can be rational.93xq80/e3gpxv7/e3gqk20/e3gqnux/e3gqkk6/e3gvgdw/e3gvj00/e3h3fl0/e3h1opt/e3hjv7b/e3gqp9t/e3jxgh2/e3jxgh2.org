  Wouldn't it be infinity more interesting to read about an average mage trying to get by in a society where everyone can become a mage? A protagonist that works hard within an established magic system and makes use of the rules and limitations in clever ways is way more interesting than someone who is just very unique/gifted and constantly acts outside of what considered normal to get out of difficult situations.

I personally agree ... but it's a lot more difficult to write, since your exploits should (in theory) not be low-hanging fruit, meaning that they should credibly be insights that only occur after intensive study by a keen intellect. It's understandable that this is more difficult, because you have to simulate, in your head, several layers of thinking and meta thinking by large groups of people.

I worked as a software engineer for roughly seven years, and describing my daily work /and all the systems, base knowledge, etc./ would be a real challenge, even before getting around to the fact that all that would have to be invented from scratch as part of the worldbuilding.
