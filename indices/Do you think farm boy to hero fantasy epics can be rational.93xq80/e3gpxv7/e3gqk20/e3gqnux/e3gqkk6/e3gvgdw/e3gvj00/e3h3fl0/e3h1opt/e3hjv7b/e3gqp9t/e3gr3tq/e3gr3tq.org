Because it is far more interesting to experience a setting through the eyes of a person living in it, I think it would be incredibly boring to read what is essentially a fake history book. By average I didn't mean that nothing should ever happen, I meant average in abilities/potential/ starting social standing or circumstances, than bulid up from there.
