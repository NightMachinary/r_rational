  It's easier, but it's so much more fascinating and engaging when the world feels real, and that it's full of the possibility for change.

You're right - but that can also be done in farm-boy-to-hero epics. Consider, since you've just bought it up, Worm. That is a Ordinary Schoolgirl to Hero epic, in which one character gains a sudden superpower and must save the world from an endless and escalating series of supervillains, many of whom only she can defeat...

On the one hand, that description is everything you just said you don't want. On the other hand - Taylor isn't the /only/ character going ordinary-person-to-superhero. More than half the cast is on the exact same journey, and the world reflects that; moreover, Taylor earns her victories. They are not merely given to her. Taylor doesn't win because she's super special. Taylor wins because she works /hard/ to make those victories happen.
