  Why must the protagonist be the only one capable of dealing with the villain?
#+end_quote

Narrative tension.

Now, I don't mean that the Hero necessarily needs to be the only one able to deal with the Villain /at all/ - merely that the Hero must be the only one able to stop the Villain /at the time of the final confrontation/. This might be simply because the Hero is the only person in the right place at the right time (example: an ordinary accountant who has to try to land a plane after everyone else (including the pilot) ate the chicken and he's the only one in the cockpit in any state to fly anything) and anyone else could theoretically have done it /had they been there/.

But you lose a lot of narrative tension if the hero's loss just means that the next prospective hero in the queue walks in.
