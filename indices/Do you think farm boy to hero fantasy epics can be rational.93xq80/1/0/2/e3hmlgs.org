  how did people verify that prophesies are legit form of divination and not the ravings of lunatics?

  What makes our farm boy so special?Why was he chosen and not the farmer next door?

That sounds like an important thing for our rational farm boy to do, assuming that there's indeed a prophecy. And maybe the answer won't be what he expected: maybe the prophecy was made up by the villain to root out rebellious sorts. Maybe it was made up by a rebel leader whose noticed the farm boy's talents and wanted to force him into the spotlight. Maybe the rational farm boy makes up the prophecy himself. Most real-world prophecies aren't the ravings of lunatics; they're clever manipulations cooked up by conmen or political leaders.

And that's all assuming there's a prophecy. Luke Skywalker didn't have one, he just had a special bloodline and bought the wrong pair of droids. Maybe our rational farmboy finds a magic sword abandoned in his field from an old war, or an alien spacecraft crashed into his blackberry patch.

Not everyone is required to act rationally in rational fiction, they just have to have justifications for their actions. People believe in prophecies all the time today.

And maybe just being rational is enough for a call to arms. Maybe our farm boy perceives a weakness in the evil overlords plan and works for years to come up with a plan.

  Without years of training, and studying, making connections etc..

If you think that's what's required, why not include it? It's not hard to skip ahead and explain what the protagonist has been doing to further their cause.

  Realistically, what can one person do?

Ask Nelson Mandela, Ghandi, or other major revolutionary figures. Of course they need backing if their enemy controls the government, but most such stories already include a Rebel Alliance of some sort.

If your bad guy is uniquely bad, like a powerful necromancer or something, maybe it's enough to kill him and his inner circle. Maybe there's a specific leader in the line of succession who the farm boy judges would be preferable. Maybe the charismatic leader has gone insane, like many thought Hitler had when he continued pushing the war effort after it was clear Germany was losing.

It sounds to me like you've identified some key elements of a good rational farmboy to hero story.
