  I wouldn't consider sparing all day with someone who talks in riddles the kind of training and preparation that could rationally make a naive kid into any sort of threat to a world threatening Villain

Well no, it didn't. As I said, he got lured into a trap and got his ass kicked. The only reason Luke survived that was that Vader didn't actually want to kill him.

  it would take years of studying, making connections, planning and acquiring strong backing

You mean the years between episode V and VI, where the Rebel Alliance got fully off the ground and put enough ships together to threaten the Imperial Fleet guarding the Death Star? After which Leia goes from being 'Princess' to 'General' Organa? At the end of which Luke is far more confident in his abilities?

  My rough definition would be(for the classics)- a young person who lived all their life in a secluded and sheltered small part of the world gets pulled into the bigger picture by a prophecy or some other form of initiate uniqueness. The stakes are very high and their goal to is save the wide world from some great evil, they are out of their depth during most of the journey while learning to control their unique powers. for example- Sword of truth, inheritance cycle, Wheel of time..

Absolutely none of that precludes any of my solutions to the typical sloppy writing in the trope. Either define how prophecies work or explain why it was faked. Include adequate time for training and making political connections. Have the villain act in ways that real people would act, and have the hero come up with solutions that are most likely to achieve his goals with the information he has at the time.

I think your problem is that you are defining the trope as a pejorative, assuming that it must include all the rational problems in order to still fit the trope, but I see no reason at all why that's the case. If one were to write such a story taking all of these things into account, it would both be a rational story and recognizable as a 'farmboy to hero' story as you define it.

Nothing in your definition precludes the hero spending a lot of time and effort training, making political connections, and doing espionage.
