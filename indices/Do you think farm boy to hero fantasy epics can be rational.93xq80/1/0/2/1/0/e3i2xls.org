And my point is that the whole point of rationalist fiction is to take familiar genres of fiction, set up the setting so that things work by clear rules, and then showing a rational character exploiting those rules to achieve surprisingly effective results.

As I've demonstrated, the 'farmboy to hero' trope is completely workable in this paradigm.

  your story contains so many things that need to be explained and justified, the immersion breaks.

Then you need to study history. Our world contains a huge stock of things that absolutely need to be carefully understood or you will get a lot of wrong ideas about how things work.

You seem to want rational fiction to be something other than what it is.
