Well, one of your questions has a simple answer, at least how I see it. If there is a simple "exploit" within the system, that doesn't rely on some nebulous unique quality of the protagonist, someone probably already discovered it. If the protagonist is the first to discover it, then we need a reason why it isn't widespread.

Sure, a capable writer can make a reasonable reason for that, but that only works a couple of times before we either circle back to the protagonist being unique in some way, or everyone else being irrational, which can for some readers be the same thing as far as uniqueness goes.

Of course it might just be that all "exploits" beyond the first rely on the first one to work, and even that falls under the "why didn't anyone else think of it" category.
