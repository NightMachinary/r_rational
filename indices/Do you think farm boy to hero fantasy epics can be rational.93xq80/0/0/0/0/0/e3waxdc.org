  I mean, the battle school consisted entirely of professionals who are trained specifically for it.

eh by professionals you mean 6-8 year old kids, most most of whom (in Ender's platoon specifically) were completely green recruits. When he gives the "enemy's gate is down" speech most of his squad had never seen a battle at all.

And the main innovation wasn't just not thinking of yourself as oriented to the doors, the point was tactically making yourself a small profile and only exposing your legs to fire (which would not result in a "kill" by the rules of the game.) I'm sure lots of other kids got used to 0G and reorienting themselves mid-fight, it was the "legs first kneeling firing position" Ender created.
