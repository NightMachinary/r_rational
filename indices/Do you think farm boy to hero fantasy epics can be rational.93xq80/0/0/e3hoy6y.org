Well...idk if this is true from a /storytelling/ perspective. Ender's game depicted a "simple" exploit ("the enemy's gate is down"). In real life the arbitrariness of "down" would have probably occurred to most people in about 30 seconds of being in zero gravity. Yet the first time I was reading this (granted, I was younger) it didn't break my suspension of disbelief that a group of people who regularly practiced combat sports in space were all too uncreative to realize this. The fact that most people don't just hang out in zero gravity was pretty sufficient for young-me to buy the idea that most people would try to maintain an arbitrary "the floor is down and the ceiling is up" reference frame
