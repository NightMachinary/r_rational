The Inheritance Cycle (Eragon and co.) has shades of this, particularly in the magic system. It's really not all there in Eragon itself, but that was the first book written by a high-schooler. From that perspective, it's fairly cogent.

Starting with the second book, however, the rules of the magic system and the ways society was built around are fully realized and make sense. Dragons and races who have tied themselves to dragons are the most magical, though dragon magic is far more esoteric and wild than any used by humanoids. The elves used a ritual to tie themselves to the dragons thousands of years ago, so nearly all of them have the capacity to use magic. Magic has four simple rules: don't fuck with time, don't try necromancy, magic costs the same as doing a task personally, and don't use up all of the energy your body has available.The punishment for any of these mistakes is death. There are clear rules of energy usage and transfer, though right now only biochemical energy can be used as a fuel source. You can expend your own stored energy, drain it from surrounding plants, animals, and people (at the cost of feeling the moment of their death personally), and store excess energy in crystals, but nobody has figured out how to extract energy from light yet. It has a ton more rules and background, but none of those rules are ever broken in the series, as far as I can tell. All the obvious low-hanging fruit has been picked by the elves already, from spells which instantly kill people at almost zero energy expenditure (14 of them), to a dizzying bevy of healing spells which Eragon doesn't have the time to study due to the civil war raging o'er the land, to...really anything you can imagine. The elves use magic for practically everything, and they almost never accidentally kill themselves with it. The whole system is used really well, and it's tied into the otherwise steel-age tech base quite skillfully.
