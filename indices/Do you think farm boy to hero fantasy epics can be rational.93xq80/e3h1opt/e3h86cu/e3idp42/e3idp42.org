For the lace thing it's actually fairly well done, in the empire mages of all kinds have two choices, serve the king or die, so no magical mass production there, the elves simply don't value (mundane) things (easily) made with magic since almost any of them can do it (lace isn't part of their culture but if it was then making it magically would result in it being common and low value, simple economics would see to that even before you get to their cultural views on magic), then there's the rebels who do do it.\\
Perhaps the rebels were slow to try, but they didn't have many mages and funding wasn't a big enough concern to use the few they did have until they went on the march.
