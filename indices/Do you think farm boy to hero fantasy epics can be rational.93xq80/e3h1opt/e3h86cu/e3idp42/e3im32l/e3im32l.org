There were mages around long before Galbatorix came to power. If Eragon had said "let's return to the magecrafts of old, which were outlawed by Galbatorix", I'd give Paolini all the credit in the world for consistent and rational worldbuilding. As it stands, with Eragon inventing magic-aided manufacturing, in my mind it's a hole in what is otherwise all-around excellent. But it's been a decade since I read those books so I could be selling him short :)
