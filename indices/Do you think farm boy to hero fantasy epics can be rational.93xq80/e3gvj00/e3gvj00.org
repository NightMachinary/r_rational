  When I look for stuff like MOL
#+end_quote

So...I'm a little confused here. I /think/ that you're saying that MoL is a rare example of what you're looking for, but then shortly afterward you state that "farm boy to hero epics" can't be rational - and MoL kind of is that, yet most readers consider it rational. Zorian isn't quite a farm boy, but he's very much an ordinary student, slightly above class average maybe but nothing special, until he's pulled into a special situation and given special opportunities.
