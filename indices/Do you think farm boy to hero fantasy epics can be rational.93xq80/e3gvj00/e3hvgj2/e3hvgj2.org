Zorian is only above class average in terms of intellectual interest and hard work, isn't he? And his special ability is something that could happen to people of any kind of social background, though likely only made good use of by a mage.

Though what's more interesting about MOL is that it's still unclear whether the protagonist is the Hero in classical terms.
