  Wouldn't it be infinity more interesting to read about an average mage trying to get by in a society where everyone can become a mage?

If the "average" part is how much the universe pimped the character (call it Chosen-One Factor), then yes definitely. I always enjoy characters that get ahead by their brains more than those about people born with some unique power-up.

And I would definitely enjoy a low-key story where the things at stake are things that are important to the character, not the nation/world/universe. I'm not sure it gets /more rational/ just because the initial conditions and scope is different though, that's probably up to the author no matter what.

I also prefer when "anyone can become a mage" means that in the same way as "anyone can become a PhD" - you need money and/or connections to be able to do expensive studies for many years instead of working, and you need the drive and grit (and a bit of brain) to master difficult subjects.
