  Because it is far more interesting to experience a setting through the eyes of a person living in it, I think it would be incredibly boring to read what is essentially a fake history book.

The last-linked story in my previous comment (/Look to the West/) is /literally/ presented as a series of long excerpts from history books gathered from an alternate timeline. I find it /far/ more interesting than fiction that, rather than [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_d%27Artagnan_Romances][having an interesting protagonist]], merely focuses on [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216363][a boring everyman who is observing the setting]].

I hope you don't seriously think that a biography of your life would be more interesting than a general history of your country (or your culture) between the year of your birth and the year of your death.
