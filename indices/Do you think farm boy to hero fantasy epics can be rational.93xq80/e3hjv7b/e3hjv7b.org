  I don't understand how people find it appealing to read about someone who is the first -insert magical something- ever.

Reading about someone who is the first -insert something- ever is hugely popular, and there's no reason they can't be rational. Because most of them have no fantastic elements at all.

A year or so back I read [[https://www.amazon.com/Longitude-Genius-Greatest-Scientific-Problem/dp/080271529X][Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time]]. The story is intensely rational, it's about a long, painstaking scientific invention and the lone inventor fighting against the establishment to get recognized.

Really, a better question would be /Do you think fantasy epics can be rational/?
