It's easier, but it's so much more fascinating and engaging when the world feels real, and that it's full of the possibility for change. Now that I think about it, it's one of the things I enjoy most about many stories like Starcraft or Worm.

It's not a story about the special guy, it's the story about how shit went down, and even a small change could make it go anywhere else.
