I'm not familiar with the story of Half-life myself, but this sort of thing (if done badly) would drop him directly in Boring Invincible Hero territory. (I assume, given that you're presenting it as a positive example, that it was not done badly).

I think you might find [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/208014/bring-me-the-heads-of-the-cutie-mark-crusaders][this fanfic]] to be a decent example of an ordinary character taking on a powerful force (though I wouldn't call it anywhere near 'rational', mainly because the villain of the piece is, frankly, an idiot).
