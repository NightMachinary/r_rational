  Thinking about it, it's not necessarily "there's only one person who can do it" that I mind, it's when the reason only they can do it is because it's "fated" or when the reason seems contrived,

So, in short, you want your heroes to /earn/ their victories, and not be given them on a silver platter? You want them to actually display some form of heroism, and not just He Is The Hero Therefore He Wins The End?

In that case, yeah, I pretty much agree with you. And I know I'm not the only one - the Boring Invincible Hero trope on TvTropes is called /Boring/ for remarkably good reason.
