Ah, that's fair enough. I mostly have an issue with the stories where the basic core of the story is "there's a super-special person and nobody else in the entire universe can change anything except this one guy."

Though evidently it does not have to be the final confrontation, there might be many other occasions to stop the villain for good, but at all the other occasions a lot more people die, like how the Avatar is forced to stop the Firelord on the day when he's strongest.

Even if he failed and fled that day, he could probably have beaten him another day, but by then a few million people would be dead and their cities turned to rubble.
