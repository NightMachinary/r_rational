Imagine an author. He wants to write a story. This story has a villain, some evil or morally-grey figure who is doing some form of Objectionable Things which must be stopped. (Perhaps he simply disagrees with the protagonist on some point of philosophy. Regardless, he is Opposed). This Villain need not be a single person; it may be an entire organisation.

Then, the Villain must be stopped. Or, at least, an attempt must be made to stop the Villain. This is generally done by the Protagonist, who we will for the sake of simplicity refer to as the Hero. (Perhaps he will succeed. Perhaps he will not.) But the Hero, like the Villain, need not be a single person.

Let us consider the options here. Either the Hero is a single person, or he is not (and the Villain is bought down by a significant cooperative effort without a clear leader).

If the Hero is a single person, then he must face the Villain in person - and probably multiple times, to allow him to occasionally lose and thus increase the narrative tension. Moreover, there must be some element of 'last chance' in the final confrontation - there must be /no/ further chances to defeat the Villain. Generally, this implies that the Hero /must/ be exceptional in some manner - such that no-one else can confront the Villain in the way that the Hero can. And this leads to a unique/gifted Hero, and is why these stories are so common.

--------------

What of the option, then, the Hero that consists of multiple people with no clear leader? Such a story can be written, yes, and can be written well.

Let us say, for the sake of argument, that each chapter deals with a new Hero, doing his part to defeat the Villain. Then each chapter needs to establish a new character, establish his or her support network, friends, and resources, and then run on until his or her confrontation with the Villain. It /can/ be done, but - well, you end up spending a /lot/ of time on character establishment, and most of it for characters that you won't see outside of the given chapter (you can save time with /some/ overlap, but there are limits).

In short, I don't think that small "contained" stories lend themselves more to rationality. I do think that small "contained" stories, regardless of genre, are easier to write.
