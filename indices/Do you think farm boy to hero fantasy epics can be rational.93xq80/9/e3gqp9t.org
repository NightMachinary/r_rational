You seem to be describing a book that /pretends/ to be following the life of a /character/ but /actually/ is merely using the character as an excuse to explore the /setting/. Yes, such stories may be more "rational"---they abandon [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#Freytag's_analysis][the standard "dramatic arc"]] in favor of a flat line---but I personally find [[https://www.baen.com/1632.html][such stories]] very annoying, because I find their settings more interesting than their characters. At that point, why not just [[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/general-history-of-africa/][get rid of the character and write solely about the setting]]? Why restrict yourself to writing a book that follows the entire path of Average Joe #116768 through magical university when most of that path will not be interesting, when instead you could write [[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/157898][a series of in-universe materials (brochures, testimonials, criticisms, accolades, scholarly studies, /etc./) describing that university]], or at the /very/ least a series of short stories that illustrate the /interesting/ parts of /several/ students' lives?
