  What makes our farm boy so special?Why was he chosen and not the farmer next door?
#+end_quote

This one at least, I can answer. Suppose a writer creates a setting where /A/ farm boy, it doesn't matter which one, gets magical whatever-it-is that enables him to become a hero and save the world. The writer will obviously make the story about that farm boy. This is called the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple][Anthropic Principle]].

Example: How come Taylor got the power to control bugs, and not something less versatile and exploitable? How come Zorian happened to be the one to get included in the time loop, and not someone else? Why did Catherine Foundling get saved by the Black Knight and become his Squire, instead of some other headstrong young woman with a similar outlook on villains and heroes? None of these people were particularly special or unique before the events of the story. Personal details aside, you could surely find someone just like them within a few miles of where they live (or the school he goes to, in Zorian's case). So why are these ordinary people going through such unusual and fantastical events, and becoming such /extra/ordinary people?

Simple: because if these things had happened to someone else, the story would be about that other person. instead.

I like to think of it like this: A story (even a rational story) can withstand a certain amount of unjustified, unlikely events. If you have too many, the story falls apart because the main thing moving things along is luck and random chance, not the characters and their motivations. But if yours has none, and your setting is being properly exploited by other people who /do/ have something unlikely giving them more power and influence than the average person... then why isn't the story about one of them?
