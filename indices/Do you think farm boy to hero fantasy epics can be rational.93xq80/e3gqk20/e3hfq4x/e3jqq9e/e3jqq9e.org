Except that it has happened at least once in the real world. Jeanne D'arc, played it pretty straight (prophecy, farm girl -> national hero, lead armies against the English, etc.).

It wouldn't be that hard to write an alternate ending that leads to a French victory for her story.

In general prophecy is easiest if you just assume the prophet is a charlatan.

A fortune teller who makes falsifiable claims gets outed as a fraud pretty quickly, and it's best for business if their customers leave liking what they heard. So the prophecies most likely to be told are going to be vague and generally positive. Then all it takes is a fortune teller stringing together some generic signs and potents nonsense and a farm girl with enough ambition to think "hey, I'm a maid from Orleans", and a general populace who wants God to favor their war, and there you go. That also neatly explains "why this farm girl". She's the one who heard that prohecy and thought "they're talking about me" rather than "I hope that otehr girl shows up soon." This can be made explicit in your story (The lego Movie is a decent example of that) or not as what really matters is how the characters react to it.

As for the issues of "what can one person really do?" well, that's actually pretty easy. Pick any random historical figure of note. That one person did all that. Remember credit travels up-hill (and blame down-hill). A rational heroine doesn't have to do everything herself. But being there holding the flag while others do probably gets her the credit, and if it's her idea/plan or her who convinced the people in question to try it the credit isn't entirely underserved. Throw in a couple hands-on accomplishments that she could realistically achieve to keep it honest and you're good.

Another pretty trivial one is "how do they do all that without years of training/etc." well they could juts receive years of training, have introductions made by somone who'd using them, and otherwise be groomed for the position ones they gain some momentum from the prophecy thing. (Codex Alera takes that rout with 'Tavi.)

The hard part is dealing with the final duel between the heroine and the Big bad. However I'd argue that a literal direct duel followed by immediate dispersal of the evil army isn't required for the 0 to hero story arc. All the heroine really has to do is get rid of the evil army (save conquering/reforming the empire for the sequel). In a rational story that might look more like arranging a strategic victory by some combination of assassination, leveraging the evil empire's political disunity back home, and a well timed tactical victory to cause the Empire to loose the will to continue it's conquest in the heroine's back yard.
