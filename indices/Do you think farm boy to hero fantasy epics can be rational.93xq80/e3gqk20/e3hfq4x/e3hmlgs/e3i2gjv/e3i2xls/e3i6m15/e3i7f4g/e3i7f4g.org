  taking an already contrived and unlikely plot and trying to make sense of it.

You mean what HPMOR did?

  This whole discussion is problematic because we didn't(I didn't) define what makes a story a "classic farm boy to hero" story, for example, in your previous comment you suggested that the farm boy could make up a prophesy himself or that he could be training for years before actually going on the adventure, well, if you do things this way are you still writing a classic farm boy to hero story?Frodo didn't train years before taking the ring to Mordor , saying "well, he can just study/train"is going against the whole spirit of the discussion, a huge theme in these stories is the struggle of a weak unlikely and unprepared hero against overwhelming odds, which I claim can't really be written rationally.

Literally the first example I think of when presented with the idea of 'farmboy to hero story' is Star Wars. In Star Wars, Luke only does one important thing before going off to train with Yoda for an un-specified amount of time, and then runs off and gets his ass kicked by his dad. If your definition of the trope excludes the most popular, obvious example of the trope that the vast majority of the populace will think of when the trope name is mentioned, then your definition of the trope is bad.

But let's try to clarify here: What exactly is your definition of what's required for something to qualify as a 'farmboy to hero' story, and what works of fiction actually qualify?

Any other than LoTR? Because Frodo doesn't actually do much that's that impressive in LoTR, he just delivers a ring to a volcano while his powerful friends do most of the fighting, and he barely manages that without succumbing to mind control.

What would the story of LoTR look like if Frodo was a rationalist? What better solutions would he have come up with?
