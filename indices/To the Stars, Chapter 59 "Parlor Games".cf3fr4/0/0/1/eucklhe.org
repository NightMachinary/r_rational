Okay, I read it and it was enjoyable, though again it just felt like it had good worldbuilding rather than engaging characters, and the plot was hard to enjoy because I already knew where it was going. Might have enjoyed it more if I didn't know it was a magical girl story already, but even then the detective just felt... soulless, somehow. Dunno, maybe there's just something about the writing style that isn't meshing for me. Ah well, thanks anyway!
