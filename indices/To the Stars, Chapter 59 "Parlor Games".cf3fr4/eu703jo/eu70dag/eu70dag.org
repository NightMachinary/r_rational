You could make an argument that it kicks off in Ch. 18 (the beginning of Volume II), but I don't think you're more likely to enjoy the story at that point if you don't by Ch. 8. That's not really a major divergence point.

I might suggest reading Ch. 17, the interlude between Volumes I and II, which is a stand-alone story set in the late 21st century, even if you don't read anything else afterwards.
