So I tried reading this and got maybe 8 chapters in before I realized I just wasn't enjoying it. I loved MM, and the worldbuilding they did is clearly very good, but there's nothing compelling in the plot or characters yet early on. Do others have opinions on where it really kicks off, or is it maybe just not for me?
