A few things.

*Your regularly scheduled call for criticism*

First of all, thanks to everyone who's commented thus far. I feed on your feedback, and it really helps to keep me going. I want to make sure that HSTW remains a story that you enjoy, so please, don't hold back your criticism.

The last time that I specifically asked for crits, a couple of people said that the chapters should be longer. We've gone from an average word count of 1,091 to 1,531, and while Sequence 3 is still in-progress, we've got at least one chapter that breaks past 2,400 words and another that's in the 2,000 range, with an average word count of 1,627. I can't say how long this growth will continue, but let me know if you think that a given chapter is too long or, for that matter, just the right length.

*Site theme*

After talking with several readers, I've elected to go with...none of the themes that I was considering. "Light text on dark background" and "As close as possible to the original theme" seemed to be the most important characteristics, but Wordpress /really/ limits what you're allowed to do unless you pay for the premium plan. I can only select a number of possible backgrounds, I can't change text color site-wide but have to manually do it each time, etc.

Turns out that Blogspot might have been the better option. Who knew? Anyway, I hope that this theme is satisfactory. Let me know what you think.

*No update this Friday*

This is the last chapter of Sequence 2. As with the previous sequence, we're going to take off the rest of this week. I don't plan to take a break like this again with future sequences.

I hope to have a small surprise ready for the next update, so...

/fingers crossed.
