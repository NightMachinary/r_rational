You are tasked to win a game of /Diplomacy/ with a power, against others with other powers and are experienced players. The format will be face-to-face in a typical Bar, 15 minutes phases.

Pick one option:

- [[https://5etools.com/spells.html#detect%20thoughts_phb][Detect Thoughts]] from DnD 5e. You can use it however many times you want at once. Any ability check is replaced with a 10% chance to fail. You get the 2nd pick of countries.

- [[https://codegeass.fandom.com/wiki/Lelouch_vi_Britannia#Geass][Lelouch vi Britannia's Geass]]. You get the 5th pick of countries.

- [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Contessa#Abilities_and_Powers][Contessa's Path to Victory]]. You get the last pick of countries.

- [[https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Mystique#Powers_and_Abilities][Mystique's transformation abilities.]] You get the 3rd pick of countries.

- [[https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/S%C5%8Dsuke_Aizen#Zanpakut.C5.8D][Sosuke Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu.]] You get the 6th pick of countries.

- [[https://toarumajutsunoindex.fandom.com/wiki/Imagine_Breaker][Kamijou Touma's Imagine Breaker.]] You can safely assume every other power on this list can be negated. Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu can be ignored and can be permanently dispelled for everyone by touching the activator(eyes/blade), Path to Victory does not know how to deal with you, you are immune to detect thoughts and can temporarily end the spell for others by touching the victim/suppress the spell for everyone by touching the caster, and can temporarily dispell Mystique's transformation by touching her. You get the 4th pick of countries.

- The ability to obtain any ability whose player is eliminated by you, defined by controlling their last or one of their last supply center in a build phase. You get the 1st pick of countries.

Additional rules include:

- Any players caught using their power by the GM is immediately forfeit. Their country goes NMR. Criteria for catching includes perceiving the verbal or somatic component for detect thoughts, witnessing an activation of Geass or Kyoka Suigetsu, or witnessing a transformation of Mystique. The activation of Imagine Breaker does not count as evidence against anybody. Edit: GM is immune to everybody's abilities.

- No players can harm a player or using their ability to cause any players harm. Edit: This rule applies to GM as well. This is magically enforced.

- Every player knows every player's abilities from the start on a surface level. Details that would be considered a secret of their power is not known initially. The exception is that the player with Imagine Breaker knows how to disable others' power from the start.

Which power do you pick, what countries do you pick, and how do you win the game?
