Path to Victory will win pretty easily barring EXTREME imagine breaker shenanigans as it can counter all other powers.

You can almost do nothing personally and let the path play for you. You don't even have to know your own strategy so detect thoughts is useless.

To counter Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu you merely need to close your eyes as both require visuals to activate.

Imagine Breaker is the trickiest, but you don't have to model the person to ask "Path to making optimal moves based solely on board state"

You can also ensure other players turn on IB during negotiations

You can also feed the moves IB makes to a predictive algorithm to make an increasingly accurate model of them throughout the game: "Path to knowing the probable next move of a person who has done moves x, y and z"

You can also be dick and use "Path to setting up other people to get caught using their powers"
