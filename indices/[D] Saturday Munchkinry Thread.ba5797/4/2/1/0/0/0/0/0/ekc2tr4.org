I suspect Mystique will be in the IB alliance, because shape-shifting is one of the weaker powers. I mean, it is completely nullified just by keeping your eyes on her, and PtV would never be fooled by her. If IB is eliminated, I doubt Mystique stands a chance against PtV, KS, or Geass.

Also there's a huge problem with buying information from PtV. How can you tell whether she is lying? Sure she has a motive to prevent KS and Geass from gaining too much power, but who knows how the path to victory will lay out? Maybe tricking people into falling for KS to eliminate them first IS the optimal path to victory. Or maybe telling them extra false information, like "Close your eyes AND do X to avoid Geass" leads to a better outcome for PtV. Honestly, a massive amount of PtV's power comes from being able to say things that manipulate people into doing things that increase PtV's odds of victory, so if I were playing rationally against PtV and I wasn't IB, I would ignore everything she says no matter what. (Not do the opposite of what she says, just straight up pretend I heard absolutely nothing.)
