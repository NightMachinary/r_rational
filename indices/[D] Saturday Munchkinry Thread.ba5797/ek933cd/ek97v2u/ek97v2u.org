Honestly I think this ability is incredibly strong. I would predict that most dead people are willing to let you learn their most important skills since they would be interested in leaving a legacy and doubly so when there is no risk of them being outcompeted by an apprentice.

This does seem to be really powerful in any supernatural framework, however it really shines in the HPMOR universe since it can circumvent the interdict of Merlin and thus be abble to creat say more Deathly Hollows.
