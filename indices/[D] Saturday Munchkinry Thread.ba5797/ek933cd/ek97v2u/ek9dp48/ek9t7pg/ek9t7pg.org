I like these ideas! In my fanfic AU you must undergo an abominable ritual to be able to cast the Unforgivables, but I hadn't thought about being able to learn them directly from a shade. A Veela's allure might be stretching it, since that might not work cross species, but a metamorphmagus should be able to gift that ability methinks.
