I'll admit that I don't remember an actual definition but I'd like to point out that AFAIK there is no non-living minds in. Ghosts aren't mind as much as they are imprints and I can only imagine that Voldy is considered living despite not having a living body. So the interdict isn't set up with this scenario in mind.
