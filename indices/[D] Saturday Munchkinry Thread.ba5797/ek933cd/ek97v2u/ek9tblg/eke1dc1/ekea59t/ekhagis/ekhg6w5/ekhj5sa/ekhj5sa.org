I'd expect the 'dead' you comunicate with via this power to also be a species of ghost.

​

Note the elaboration on the nature of the entities further down in this thread:

"They linger where their remains are still thinking of what occupied them in life (mathematicians continue solving problems, architects continue designing buildings, authors continue creating stories). The power is unique in the original story. In HP, consider it a power of the Resurrection Stone."

​

The undesirability of being dead also being a major theme so I don't think there would be any afterlife in HPMOR that isn't composed of 'mere imprints'.
