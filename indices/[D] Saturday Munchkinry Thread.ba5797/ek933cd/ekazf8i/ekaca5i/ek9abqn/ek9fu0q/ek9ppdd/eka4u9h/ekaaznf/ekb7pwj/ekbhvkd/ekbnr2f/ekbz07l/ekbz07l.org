Are you saying that the prediction works something like "Okay, if I say this, then Player A will offer unpredictable Player B an alliance, and I can't predict what Player B will say in response, but it will result in Player A attacking France"?

(With the caveat that PtV doesn't make the prediction visible to its user, only the instructions, but I don't think this changes how the prediction itself works.)
