It'll be really hard to get others to turn on IB and not you. You are most likely stuck with Austria (not Italy since they want maximum gang up on you). Then Italy, Russia, Turkey and maybe Germany will attack you from the start. You can't just win solely on the board in that case, and with other players being experienced it might not be possible to convince them to not kill you.
