I think people are focusing too much on the slow way of winning the game of Diplomacy via Path to Victory. Let's aim for something faster.

  No players can harm a player or using their ability to cause any players harm.

Say you use Geass or Kyoka Suigetsu on one player to make them punch another player.

Technically, you have not harmed a player with your ability, you just made them punch another. Or heck, you could just make Kyoka Suigetsu show an illusion that makes a player want to punch another, that way you have another layer of indirection since it was ultimately that player's choice to punch, you didn't make the player do it.

Would that be allowed for you? Would that get the player who did the punching disqualified?

Can you make all the players gang up on Imagine Breaker and beat up Imagine Breaker until they can't play properly? Same for Path to Victory if they get the idea of closing their eyes so you can't use your ability on them. Or just make someone else hold Path to Victory's eyes open so you can get them.

I bet you can use Kyoka Suigetsu faster than it takes for Path to Victory to convince the others to close their eyes! Especially since for all they know, closing their eyes for a while could be the activation for some ability, and there's no way to tell who is Path to Victory or whether they are lying.

The only problem would be somehow avoiding the GM's eyes while you are brainwashing the players.

Which brings me to my next question: I noticed that you didn't say you can't harm the GM. Can I Geass or Kyoka Suigetsu the GM into thinking all the other players have broken the rules and disqualify everyone but me? That way I instantly win and Path to Victory can't do anything about it since there is literally no set of actions that could let them stop me in time.
