Aschente.

New plan then. I noticed that Imagine Breaker can only negate Kyoka Suigetsu if they touch your blade, not touch your brainwashed puppets. In other words, you're thinking of Kyoka Suigetsu as something like Innocentius which cannot be erased without erasing the source right? This makes things easier.

Plan remains roughly the same: begin by distracting the GM somehow ("Look a UFO!" or just ask about some obscure rule to make them check the rulebook) and brainwash everyone except Imagine Breaker (who is immune) and Path to Victory (who knows not to open eyes). Step 2: use your 4 brainwashed puppets to hold down Imagine Breaker and Path to Victory physically. Since its just holding instead of punching, you aren't violating the no harm rule. And though it will look weird to the GM, there is no evidence that you used Kyoka Suigetsu since you may have just persuaded them somehow through mundane means. Since Imagine Breaker is held down, they can't erase your brainwashing and so can't get free from the brainwashed puppets.

I would assume that the game has turn time limits (otherwise any losing player can just stop playing and force the game to never end). So Path to Victory and Imagine Breaker will time out every turn without doing anything and you have free reign to win the game against 6 other players who all do nothing every turn.

​

The loophole in this plan is since your 4 brainwashed puppets can only hold, not attack, I imagine it is a lot easier to Path to Victory to compute and execute a Path to dodging all their grabs without hurting them. Still, Path to Victory can't save Imagine Breaker because they can't predict Imagine Breaker: if they try they will just get in each other's way and actually allow your puppets to take down Path to Victory. And if they don't save Imagine Breaker, that means Path to Victory has to compete in the game against you + your 4 puppets (who can take turns holding down Imagine Breaker in threes so they can all play their turns). Even if Path to Victory can see the path to maximizing their odds of victory, attempting to win the game of Diplomacy 1 vs 5 is going to be very difficult. That's like trying to win a game of chess with only your king and a single pawn against the enemy's entire army. I don't rate Path to Victory's odds of victory as high, even when maximized with their ability.

​

Unless of course Path to Victory starts counter-cheating by instead of computing how to win the game, computes how to make you want to make them win the game instead. But that gets into really vague territory about how Path to Victory works. They can't compute a path to do the impossible, so exactly how impossible is it to make someone want to someone else to win? What are the limitations here? Can Path to Victory compute before the game that the best plan is kidnap your family beforehand and blackmail you into losing? But if you're allowed to use your abilities before the game starts, the complexity suddenly increases by orders of magnitude.

Every player will be waging a shadow war using their abilities, stealing what's precious to the others to blackmail them, finding some way to turn the others (especially Imagine Breaker) to their side, etc.
