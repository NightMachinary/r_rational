Let's give Mystique some more credit. She's not going to show up to the game in her, say blue form from the X-men movies, she's going to show up as a normal looking person. Or looking exactly like one of the other players, or looking like any of the characters that had those powers in their respective series. Remember the players don't know who has which power until they figure it out themselves or Path to Victory just flat out asks for the answer, so if somebody looking exactly like Aizen shows up and nobody else carries a blade (openly) your first thought is likely that 'this player looking exactly like Aizen is probably the player with Kyoka Suigetsu'. For all you know you might well be playing the real Aizen, how else would somebody just have Kyoka Suigetsu? And let's also give her a unisex toilet to work with and with that she can be an important wildcard impersonating here and there.

The point about PtV giving false extra information is solid, and even if you are IB you still need to be aware of that. That would then swing the balance of power back towards KS and Geass a bit as now it'll be really easy to fall victim to KS and Geass, and subsequently IB gets a little more leverage.
