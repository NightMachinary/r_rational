Path to victory is incredibly powerful, though. It is more "intelligent" than basically everyone in the room combined. It has full knowledge of external state of everyone in the building, which means that it can collect things like sound, heart rate, breathing, eye movement, etc. It can track every single person's external tells. Just with that alone it will be capable of outperforming any human player. It knows what moves people write down, which means you need to be forced to write them down first. Etc. It's basically local omniscience with the worlds best supercomputer sussing out the future.

Edit: To belabor the point, ptv can bring about any victory it wants on a short timescale, as long as it's around to shepherd the target. Contessa remarks as much when she talks about how she can PTV eidelon. Considering the fact that Diplomacy is all about that, I don't see any problem for ptv winning.
