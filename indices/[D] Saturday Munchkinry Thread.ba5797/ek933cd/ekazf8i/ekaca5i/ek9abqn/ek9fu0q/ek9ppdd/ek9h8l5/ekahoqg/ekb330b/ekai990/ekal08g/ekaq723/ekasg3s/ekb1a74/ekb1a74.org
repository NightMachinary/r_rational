Great work.

Nobody wants anybody to be controlled by Kyoka Suigetsu or Geass, so they will actively seek out the Path to Victory player and attempt to buy information from her ("You will tell me how to avoid Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu for Munich"). PtV player will also tell the two sight-power players how far can they take things or else she would tell everyone how to stop them.

IB will permanently disable Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu(until IB is eliminated) if he touches their eyes/blade, but doing so essentially establish them as your permanent enemy so as to restore their power. I'm imagining he would also bargain with them as to what actions are acceptable ("don't cross the stalemate line unless you don't want your abilities").

So there are 4 factions on the board, IB alliance with IB, detect thoughts and gain ability, anti-IB alliance with Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu, Mystique, and Path to Victory.

I predict the country layout looks along the lines of something like this and for those reasons:

Gain ability - France (rather hard to attack, can access many centers on the board, allows access to both sides of the Mid-Atlantic Ocean)

Detect Thoughts - Germany (access to many centers, close to the stalemate line, proximity to France)

Mystique - Italy (Slight inclination to attack PtV, participation in both sides of the board)

Imagine Breaker - Russia (helps towards PtV and against England, throws a wrench into anti-IB Juggernaut, Sweden guaranteed thanks to German ally)

Geass - Turkey (really hard to attack, leaving Austria to PtV, an England-Turkey alliance is still effective)

Kyoka Suigetsu - England (really hard to attack, leaving Austria to PtV, an England-Turkey alliance is still effective)

Path to Victory - Austria

If we start guessing with this lineup then indeed looks like Imagine Breaker has a very high chance of winning.
