- I don't actually know! I'll ask.
- Oozaru is modelled as using a separate pool of energy, which can't be accesses at the same time as the regular human pool, but a clone can go Oozaru while the regular body doesn't - this is currently just about the only way to get any value in combat out of regular Multiform.
- The fusion dance is sadly a lost art, and one that research into has been very lacking in, since apparently getting it wrong can be lethal. That's an interesting idea though, and I might suggest looking at Multiform if we ever do go looking into it.
- The sealing literally sealed away his ki above a certain level, and the unsealing reversed that - could you clarify what you think might be learned?
- The funny thing about the Sight is that it models exactly what would happen if you hadn't used it - in this case, it would show success (or failure, I suppose) of whatever method is decided upon - but if the players don't come up with a superior method, we won't get to see it, because it won't happen.
- Astral projection stops Multiform entirely, for reasons unclear.
