Ideas:

- What happens if each of the clones eats a senzu bean? Could this be used to overcome the power cap? This would be expensive if you need to do it every time you split.
- How do transformations like Oozaru affect the clones if you perform them after splitting?
- The fusion dance hasn't been mentioned in the quest, but looking at doing that in reverse might be informative for an alternative method of splitting.
- Similarly, the sealing and unsealing might provide insights in terms of how they affected Jaffur's ki reserves.
- Could seer powers be applied to the problem? Use future-sight to see if or how you manage it in the future?
- What about using mental projection while you have a multiform running? Do all the copies project?
