Removal of common words that would require drugging your targets will probably be useless, given that if your goal is to cause harm to someone and you already have them drugged and unconscious for 24 hours you can basically do whatever harm you want, including killing them. There's not much you could do with removal of common words that you couldn't do via other means if you can reliably get people into this situation.

You either need to pick obscure words that nevertheless are noticeable when absent (the names of certain nations?), or if you get someone who is bilingual and swaps to thinking in a certain language when in a nation that speaks it, you can sabotage their use of the other language. You could perhaps remove the English "the" from them while they're in France, and then remove "le" from them while they're in England or the U.S.
