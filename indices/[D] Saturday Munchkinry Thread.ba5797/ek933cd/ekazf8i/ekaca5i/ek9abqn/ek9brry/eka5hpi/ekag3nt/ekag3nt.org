  The restriction that they can't think the word in the 24 hours after targeting them seems like the main obstacle, but you might be able to get around that by drugging your targets. If they're unconscious for the full 24 hours, could they still think the word?

Yeah that would work, assuming you can find some way to do that safely without being caught.

  Another way to get around it would be to target babies, or people with a different native language.

  Similarly, you could make babies forget their name before they learn it and use that for blackmail.

Wouldn't work. The word must first be in their vocabulary in order to be deleted from it.

  Another approach would be to choose words that are uncommon, then introduce them to the target yourself. For example, being able to set up "What is Aleppo?" incidents with politicians might be enough to sustain a career as a journalist.

This would work to some extent. Your ability deletes the word from their vocabulary, so they will forget what the word "Aleppo" means. But they wouldn't forget the existence of the city itself, nor what has happened there. They just wouldn't know what the name of the city is and can't relearn it.

And in saying this I just realized your blackmail idea would work wonders on celebrities and companies. Simply threaten to erase their names from tons of people. Most of them aren't famous enough to have people thinking of their names every day, yet plenty are famous enough to have their names been learned, so your ability would work on a significant fraction of people you target. Which can be a huge amount of people since you can just look down from a tall building or wander around a shopping mall and target everyone in sight. And while forgetting the name of a celebrity or company won't make people forget the existence of them, it would make getting any news or advertisements from them a huge inconvenience. An ad could be like "Come down to store X to find massive discounts!" and the viewers would be like "Where?" when you erase X from their vocabularies. And you could ruin actors' careers since any movie advertisement going "Starring Actor Y" would just have viewers going "Who?" once you erase Y from their vocabularies.
