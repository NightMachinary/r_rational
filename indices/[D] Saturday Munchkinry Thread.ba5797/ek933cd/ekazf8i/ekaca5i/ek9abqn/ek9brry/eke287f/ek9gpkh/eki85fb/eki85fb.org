You could taboo shitty misleading phrases like "the next stage of human evolution" on the entire world population. Chances are, most people aren't thinking that phrase on any given day, so wiping the phrase out of, say, 70% of people's vocabulary would be a pretty good start. As long as nobody catches on, you could wait a couple of months then do it again.
