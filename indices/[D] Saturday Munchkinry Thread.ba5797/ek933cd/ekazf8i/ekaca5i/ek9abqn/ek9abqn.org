You have the ability to permanently delete words from a person's vocabulary. Specifically, your ability works by picking a word X, and picking a target person Y from within your memories. If Y does not think the word X in the next 24 hours, Y will have X permanently deleted from their vocabulary and cannot relearn X no matter what. Your ability can be used as often as you want, on as many people as you want, but a person cannot be targeted twice within 24 hours. So each person you target can lose at most one word per day from their vocabulary.

What can you do with this ability?
