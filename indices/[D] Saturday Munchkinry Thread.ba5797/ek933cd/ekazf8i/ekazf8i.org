You have the power to portion off sections of you consciousness at the cost of each section running more slowly. You emotions and memory are effected and experience collectivey by all your consciousnesses so all the yous all still you. You can merge your section together.

So you could split you consciousness into two sections with each section running at half the speed, in effect experienceing time twise as fast. Or you could split into a hundred sections each with a 1/100 of your total processing power, experienceing time a hundred times as fast. You could also split your mind into two with one section running with 99/100 of you processing power and the other running with 1/100.

How can you use this?
