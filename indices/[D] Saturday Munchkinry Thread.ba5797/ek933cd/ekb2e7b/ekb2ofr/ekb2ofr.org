Deadspeak doesn't grant physical strength with which to fight, even though the instincts are given, for example. In canon and in my AU, magical strength is determined by a host of factors revolving around maturity and knowledge and social status among other things. Gaining knowledge is a huge factor, so learning from the dead would boost your power, but it's still your power. You wouldn't be able to just download the sum total of the magical might of all the dead of wizardkind. That would definitely be broke and trivialize things. Do you think that's a sufficient limitation?
