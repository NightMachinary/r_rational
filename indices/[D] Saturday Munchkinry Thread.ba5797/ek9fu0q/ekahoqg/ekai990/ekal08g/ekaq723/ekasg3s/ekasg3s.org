  They do know each other's powers on a surface level, so you have to get them to open their eyes to fall for it.

I'm assuming the fact that Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu works through sight is the main secret of their powers (like it was in their series), and so not known initially.

In which case, the other players have no idea how the other's ability is activated. It could be sight sure, but it could also be sound. Or through knowing someone's name. Or by drawing a circle around them and chanting some spell. Who knows? In which case, if you're up against people whose abilities you don't know the activation sequence of, why would you ever close your eyes and let them do all kinds of shenanigans while you blind yourself?

And in fact, there IS a player whose ability only works if you close your eyes: Mystique. If people don't close their eyes, Mystique can shape-shift all she wants and everyone will still know its her. But once you close your eyes Mystique can shape-shift into anyone else and start impersonating endlessly, especially since she can copy voices perfectly. So if your game plan is close your eyes in case of Geass or Kyoka Suigetsu, you just gave Mystique free reign to do whatever she wants.

So if the players don't know how the other's abilities are activated, there's no reason for them to close their eyes and every reason not to. Even if someone claiming to be Path of Victory tells them to close their eyes it won't be easy to convince them.

  Holding someone down so they can't move freely or write down orders would count as harm, both for the sake of preserving this prompt(sorry, my bad for not clarifying the rules better) and in terms of pledge 1.

Hmm... Imagine Breaker just became much much stronger. You can't harm or hold him without breaking rule 1, but he can totally touch you and so nullify all your abilities without breaking the rules. All he has to do is walk around the game table, regularly touching everyone else to ruin all their ability-based plans.

By doing so, he gives away the fact that he is Imagine Breaker (especially if someone tries to use their ability while being touched), which could cause the other players to gang up on him to eliminate him and so restore their powers... but would they? Not all powers are equal, so for players with weaker powers, like Detect Thoughts and Obtain Ability, the fact that he is nullifying everything is great news for them. Ganging up on him would let abilities be restored and swiftly end in their loss since their abilities are weak.

Only players with strong powers like Kyoka Suigetsu or Path to Victory would benefit from eliminating Imagine Breaker. So trying to attack Imagine Breaker would immediately out yourself as having a strong power, and encourage the players with weaker powers to ally with Imagine Breaker and beat you first, while your powers are still sealed.

Even Path of Victory with her invisible ability would be defeated by this alliance with Imagine Breaker, because she cannot predict Imagine Breaker, and so cannot predict allies of Imagine Breaker who are playing in coordination with Imagine Breaker.

Imagine Breaker would become, if not the King, at least the King-Maker. Because his actions during the alliance phase will determine the final winner. Whoever he attacks first will almost certainly lose the game regardless of their ability.
