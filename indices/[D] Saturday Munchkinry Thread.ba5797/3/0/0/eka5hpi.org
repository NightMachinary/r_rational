  Removing "the", or similar extremely common words, would probably be the most harmful.

I don't know if "the" would be that harmful, depending on exactly how it works: plenty of languages get by without having an equivalent of "the".

It'd be a mindfuck as you become completely unable to learn the meaning of an apparently very common word that all your friends and family insist you used all the time, but eventually someone would get frustrated trying to teach you and say "look, it doesn't actually mean anything all that important, just ignore it and you'll still be able to understand what other people are saying". You'd waste money going to neurologists to try to work out what the heck happened, and you'd not be able to do public speaking, and your writing would be poor quality and have to be edited by other people... but you'd get used to it.

Then again, after writing out all the above, I'm guessing that you were talking about that level of inhibition rather than "literally becoming a snivelling nincompoop"? Because the above does sound pretty bad.
