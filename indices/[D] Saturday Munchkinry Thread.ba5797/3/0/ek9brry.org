The restriction that they can't think the word in the 24 hours after targeting them seems like the main obstacle, but you might be able to get around that by drugging your targets. If they're unconscious for the full 24 hours, could they still think the word?

Another way to get around it would be to target babies, or people with a different native language.

Removing "the", or similar extremely common words, would probably be the most harmful. You might be able to extort people that way, if you can inflict it on enough public figures for it to become a known phenomenon. They could always switch to a different language to get around it, but that could still pose a significant impediment.

Similarly, you could make babies forget their name before they learn it and use that for blackmail.

Another approach would be to choose words that are uncommon, then introduce them to the target yourself. For example, being able to set up "What is Aleppo?" incidents with politicians might be enough to sustain a career as a journalist.
