Lol, no worries. The person basically just has to agree to it, and they "give" it to you. You need to converse with them, but they don't need to teach it to you like they learned it. They can't be coerced into giving anything to you, though. You need to be polite. Most are willing to help you out, living vicariously through your accomplishments, though.
