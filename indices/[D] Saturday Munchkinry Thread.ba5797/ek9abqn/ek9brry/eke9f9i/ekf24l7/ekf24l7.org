Those are good points, thanks! With regards to the drugging, one way around that is that you don't need to have access to them yourself. If you've got a long list of public targets, you'd just need to set up alerts for if they become hospitalised for any reason, and attempt the removal on them in case they'll be under anaesthetic for long enough.
