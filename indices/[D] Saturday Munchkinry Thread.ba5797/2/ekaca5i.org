So this isn't a problem to be munchkinned or solved, but rather an amusing exploit someone thought up in response to a challenge posted to [[/r/AskReddit][r/AskReddit]] that I wanted to share. I wouldn't say that this is rational, but it's the sort of thing that I think people here would appreciate.

Here's is the link to the thread with this disgusting hypothetical scenario: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14uee5/how_long_would_you_let_someone_pee_on_you_for_300/?sort=top][How long would you let someone pee on you for $300 a day?]]

And here is the link to an interesting way to maximize money earned that someone came up with: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14uee5/how_long_would_you_let_someone_pee_on_you_for_300/c7gjvip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][Clean and sell the dirty sheets for even more money.]]

It wasn't a realistic way to do it, but it was so funny that I wanted to share it.
