When I want to memorize something, I can create a bunch of sections running at almost no speed, and merge one when I want to remember it - for the slowed section, it seems as if the event I want to remember just happened.

Also, there are a bunch of cases where it'd be useful to be able to consider two different ideas or possibilities, without my interpretation of the second being biased by having heard the first. So splitting is useful for that.
