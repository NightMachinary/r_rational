SCP-1425's page places it in April/May 2005, and makes reference to a 'Project LETHE' that sounds a lot like the bomb described here. Is the reference here 54 years off, or is the implication that SCP-1425 has happened twice and been resolved the same way both times? If so, is this a "when the stars are right" kind of thing? Sounds very CASE NIGHTMARE GREENish...
