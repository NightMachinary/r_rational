What kind of attitude is that? Should proto-humans never have left their caves to harness fire , which you can either not find or get your hands burnt on? Should they never seek out wolves, which can either not be found or try to eat you?

Yes, the unknown is scary and lots of people die for unknown reasons, but so far knowledge has invariably been power. None of the opponents in the series so far have demonstrated human-level intelligence (beyond memetics-aided mimicry), so who is to say they can't be beaten, or even tamed (genre notwithstanding)?

Either we live out our lives in fear of unknown monsters which kill uncountably many, until something big enough comes along to destroy everyone, or we try to master the situation no matter how awful it is right now.
