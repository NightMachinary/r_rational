I'm a little confused. Lyn Marness said that the more you know about it, the more it knows about you - so why was it able to get to Marion Wheeler? She knew next-to-nothing about it. Literally the only thing she knew was 'an unknown antimemetic SCP exists'.

Or maybe there's a hole in the story and I'm supposed to piece something extra together, but fuck it I'm super-tired. And dumb.
