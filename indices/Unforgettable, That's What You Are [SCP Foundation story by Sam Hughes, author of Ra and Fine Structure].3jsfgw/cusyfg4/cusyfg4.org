Keep in mind that you should not encourage yourself to think about or come up with plausible antimemes and that the entire department seems to be either ultimately futile or actively harmful to the human race. Are the researchers doing more harm than good by drawing attention to the things that go bump in the night? Sometimes good fiction has a grain of truth, and sometimes it is just fiction. Either way, you would probably be better served by playing with another mental puzzle, because either it doesn't exist and is a waste of your time and energy, or it does exist and there are sharp sharp teeth waiting to eat you when you least expect it. A lose-lose situation.
