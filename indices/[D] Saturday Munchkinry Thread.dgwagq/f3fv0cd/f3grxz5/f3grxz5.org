Unfortunately, the gravitation effect on an object's motion does not depend on that object's mass - it'll accelerate a bowling ball exactly as quickly as a coin. The limiter on gravitational acceleration is actually "distance from the center of the mass" - since your mass is described as 'point-shaped', this produces.. some inconsistency.

If the thing can pick up a single piece of invulnerable adamantium buckshot at a distance of 1m, then if you put that same piece of shot 1cm away from the point and let go, it'll accelerate toward the point at about 100,000 m/s^2 (and more as it gets closer), pass the point, start decelerating the same way, and come to a stop roughly 1cm on the other side. It should basically oscillate, and fast enough to cut through most things it can come into contact with.

Why 'invulnerable adamantium buckshot'? Well.. when it gets close enough, tidal forces will rip any real material apart - when the acceleration on the front half of the sphere is 1k, 10k, 1M times higher than the acceleration on the back half of the sphere, it will stretch out and deform - that will actually happen far faster than any real material can deform, so it'll really shatter into tiny pieces, which will also all oscillate around that center point as a cloud of metal dust. And we can go further, since the individual atoms will end up ripped apart by the same effect when they are *close enough*.. and ripping apart atoms is pretty exothermic.

This is the problem with trying to create physics based powers that violate physics - the effects always turn out to be explosive because of the boundary condition issues :-\
