.75 would be the diameter, and Shell's theorem says a spherical mass attracts things outside it as though it were a point mass, so the distance to the center is relevant. Agreed on the sig figs, though 1778 is less egregious and rounding when I say = is also iffy. 1778G also sounds like less of just a statistic than 1800G.
