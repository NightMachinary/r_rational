Some of you pointed out that this is not how gravity works. It's perfectly possible I had no idea what I was talking about and ended up saying nonsense. As such I'll describe the effect I had in mind when I described the power as 'increasing the gravity on a single point' and try to mitigate inconsistencies from there. The idea is that the point (though if being a point is itself a problem it could be a small spherical region) will attract everything around it with a force that is stronger the closer something is to it. My idea was that if I placed an object in the center of that attractive point/small spherical region it could break in of itself, but it would depend on how strong the attractive force of the point/small spherical region was imediately outside of it, and that is a variable the character should be able to control (though perhaps if it is too weak to break objects in of themselves it is too weak to be of any use at all? I would expect this would depend on the resistance of an object). If it does not break in of itself, the object will be suspended with 0 acceleration, with it's center of gravity and the point/center of the small spheric region coinciding, until either the effect stops or the object is hit by another. And, of course, all of this is relative to earth's center. No things being kept behind while the rest of the plat keeps moving on its orbit.
