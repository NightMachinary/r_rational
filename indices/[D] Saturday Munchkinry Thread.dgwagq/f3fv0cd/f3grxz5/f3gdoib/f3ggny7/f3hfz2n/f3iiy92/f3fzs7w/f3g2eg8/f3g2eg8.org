Available exploits depend a lot on what exactly the properties of the (infinitesimally small) point gravitational anomaly are. What do you mean when you say that you can increase the gravity on a point? Does that mean you just calculate the total gravitational attraction exerted at that point by all the matter in the universe and then multiply it by some factor? Or do you mean that the gravitational attraction exerted by objects at that point on other things is increased (or decreased?) by some factor. Or both at once? Something else?

If it's actually an infinitesimally small point-shaped anomaly, all sorts of strange things are possible, down to splitting atoms.

If it's not actually a point, then the nature of the boundary of the affected space allows for all sorts of odd things, potentially messing with microcircuitry in fun and novel ways.
