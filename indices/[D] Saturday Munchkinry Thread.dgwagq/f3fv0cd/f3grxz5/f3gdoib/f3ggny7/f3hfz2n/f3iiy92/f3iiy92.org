Others have pointed out how "only strong enough to pick up a small object" isn't a thing with gravity, and how a focal point becomes a terrifying shredding tool because falling off at a ratio of 1/r^{2} means that when r is very close to zero the force gets an absolutely enormous multiplier.

If I remember my basic physics correctly, once you are inside of an (even, ideal) hollow shell, the gravity of the shell as a whole is basically zero as it is balanced out on all sides.

So obviously the other thing you need to have to limit the power of this ability is that the effect needs to be produced as spheres of varying sizes, with anything resembling a point being a top-level effort.

If the sphere adds a meter per second per minute, it's fairly useless for launching coins but capable of demolishing buildings trivially with a little time. Stuff that enters the sphere basically just ignores it until it exits the sphere, limiting the force that it gets up to, and mostly resulting in stuff settling into a bowl-like shape at the bottom where the gravity of the sphere is balanced by the gravity of the earth, assuming that the gravitation is strong enough to lift things straight up at all. (Which would make it enormously powerful for crushing people with buildings, mind you.)
