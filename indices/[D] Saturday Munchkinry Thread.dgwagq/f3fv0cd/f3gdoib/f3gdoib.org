  gravity-point that's strong enough to lift a single coin but too weak to do anything else

That's not how gravity works. Gravity affects everything moving through its field the same way. It could be that things larger than a coin are large enough that parts of them get pulled in different directions--because different parts of the thing are in different places--but if it's gravity then it doesn't matter what's where the coin is, it will get pulled all the same.

Gravity falls off with the square of distance. So if the point exerts 1G at 1 meter (like you are trying to pick a coin up off the ground with your power, focusing on your hand) it will exert 10000G 1 centimeter from your hand and that coin will hit you like a bullet.

The way around this is to make it something other than a point. We don't fly to the center of the Earth at 10000G because the Earth itself gets in the way. You could make the power produce a sphere of some size, where outside that sphere it exerts 1G and inside the sphere it does nothing. That is what the Earth would be like if all its mass were concentrated at its surface.

Otherwise, as written... I'd throw a glass projectile with a target painted on its tip. Focus on the tip through the projectile, use my power. The projectile is accelerated forward and my eyes continue to focus just ahead of it. The limit on speed is the limit on how fast my eyes can focus.
