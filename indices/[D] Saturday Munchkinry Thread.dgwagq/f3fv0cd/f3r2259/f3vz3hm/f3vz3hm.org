Any suggestions for munchkining the power of Universal Translation? That is: the wielder of this power is able to learn and subsequently speak, read, or write any language that is known to the target, with very little time required. If the target's understanding of a language is incomplete, the gained knowledge is also incomplete, and with only one sample, or several, the wielder might speak with an accent. The target must be living and conscious. Machines are ineligible.

The setting is science fiction, with aliens. While the wielder is technically reading the target's mind, the wielder is not permitted to read or project thoughts or emotions. Body language is, to some extent, included in the definition of 'language.'
