This one /is/ true (for a sufficiently liberal interpretation of reason). The problem is that people want the reasons to be anthropomorphizable.

That one requires something really wonky is going on. Closest I can think of (short of a completely artificial day-night cycle) is a giant ring shaped solar panel at the L1 lagrange point that perpetually casts a shadow on the parts of the planet that are on the border between day and night.

Don't know of any real good way to munchkin that though, other than asking why on earth you would build your giant solar panel at L1, rather than at L2.
