Offense:

Increasing the gravity on a point of an enemy. A stronger field on the eyes or nose of an enemy to mess up their vision.

Utilities:

A weaker field near their mouth if you just want to mess up their talking (like a disliked politician on national news, or someone else trying to hit on your girl). Smaller fields on the head to mess up someone's hair. Lots of pranks like that.

Counteract gravity for jumping higher or cushioning falls.

Weakness:

Distracting the character so they look away and break the effect. Blocking the character's vision with smoke, a piece of paper, etc.
