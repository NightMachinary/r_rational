One of my characters can increase the gravity of a single point. This point is the focal point of his eye-lenses --- meaning that if parallel beans originating from one of his eyes passed through his eye-lense they would meet at a focal point, and when both focal points of his eyes meet /that's'/ where gravity will increase. Because of the way our eye-lenses work that means that he can't just look forward and decide where the gravity-point be at an arbitrary distance from him. There must always be something for his eyes to focus on.

He can increase the gravity of the point whenever he wants but he can only have one unusually attractive point in space at any point in time. The unusual attraction of a point has a life-span that gets shorter the stronger the attractive force of the point, but he can also end it at will. After an unusual gravitational point becomes normal he has to wait 10 seconds before he can create another.

If he creates a gravity-point that's strong enough to lift a single coin but too weak to do anything else it will last so long that he has not bothered to check. (I'm thinking of something like a year, but it could be more if necessary)

I'm trying to find a limit to how much gravitational force he can put on a point. I already know that, if several conditions are met, with many power-ups plus a MacGuffin and with him dying in the process he would be able to create a black hole the size of the head of a pin for a tenth of a second, but that's a final-showdown kind of thing and not a very practical limit for daily use.

With the exception of the will-die-black-hole-final-gambit, this is not supposed to be any world-ending, triumvirate-tier power, but it should still be powerful. I'm hoping this story will be something of street-level power fights.

Having all that in mind a) how do I muchkin the hell out of this power --- utility and offensive purposes are all welcome --- and b) what would you suggest to be a limit.
