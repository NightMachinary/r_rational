Any mass has a Schwarzschild radius (the radius of a black hole with that mass), and a point is going to lie within it and be a black hole (which should immediately evaporate due to Hawking radiation if it's sufficiently small), so your mass could be distributed in a constant-sized ball the size of the head of a pin (foreshadowing!) that can be with enough effort swallowed by the Schwarzschild radius.

Gravity decreases with the square of the distance. Think magnets - as you remove magnets a few of their sizes from each other, their force goes from strong to maybe barely noticeable. How far up does it lift the coin? Enough acceleration to hold the coin is one Earth gravity. Enough acceleration at the surface to lift it up from 10 cm away is about 1778 times that. You really really don't want 1778G in the space your brain is moving through.
