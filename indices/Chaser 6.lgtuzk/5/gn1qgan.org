Something I've not seen brought up (at least, not openly for discussion) yet is the potent parallel to using technology and consuming media. Sometimes I'll sit, eating something, watching TV and playing a game all at the same time. I presently have 5 internet windows and some 20 tabs open. I will take a walk, and most of the time I'm listening to music. I almost never leave the house without my phone.

I feel the pull of the Daniel, I fully understand /why/ someone would want to unplug, I at least partially understand how consuming a greater portion of the effectively infinite media landscape in which we reside leads to each individual part being less special, and yet.. I still find myself spinning up instances: I still take my headphones with me when I leave the house. Not every time, but enough that I start to feel it.

When i sit without my phone it's nice, but it's not.... divine. I've experienced lots of moments of silence. None of them have managed to convince me to change.

Yet.
