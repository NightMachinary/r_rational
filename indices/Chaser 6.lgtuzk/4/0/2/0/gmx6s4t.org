I'd just love it for the opportunity to bootstrap. Feeling like crap and have three dozen things to do? Spin off three dozen feeling-like-crap-but-oh-well copies to see how many of those things can be taken off your plate while your central thread takes a really long, nice nap, a hot bath, a great meal, and gets swanked up. Now you're ready to spin off a bunch of much better-feeling copies who can probably take care of harder levels of stuff.
