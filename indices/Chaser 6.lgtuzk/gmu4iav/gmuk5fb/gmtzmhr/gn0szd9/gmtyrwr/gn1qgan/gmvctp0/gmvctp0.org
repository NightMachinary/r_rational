This makes me feel something resembling [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wozmu-1Rv7g][existential sadness, I think]]. I simultaneously pathetically need and mournfully dread this universe. ... And I notice that "this" is ambiguous there, and find that even more appropriate.

Lonely Platypuses ... platypi? Platypodes? Sad avatars aside, the mention of meditation makes me wonder if maybe this wasn't meant to explore different interpretations of self (there is no self Vs there are many Vs there is one, or whatever). But I'm mostly distracted by how horrifying this world is, and how there seems to be no better options in reallity.
