She says she was in graduate school before she uploaded, but she also has pictures of her son's first split. And the grandfather died before the simulation was available and that was only 50 years ago. Given that both Kendra and Zeke appear to be relatively young (certainly not 50+ years) I don't think it is a safe assumption that growing up in the physical world and then uploading as an adult is the norm. I think it's more likely that Kendra grew up before uploading was available
