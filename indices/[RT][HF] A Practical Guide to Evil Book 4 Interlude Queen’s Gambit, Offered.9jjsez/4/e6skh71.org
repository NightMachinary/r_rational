  There are also known proponents of the extermination of all humans within Imperial borders in the Dominion's upper ranks, though they remain a loud minority for now.

This struck me as an odd fact about Levantine politics. The Dominion is a Good-aligned human nation, so I'm wondering why they want to exterminate all humans in Praes. Should this have been "all non-humans"? Or are they pushing to literally extinguish Praesi culture down to the last person?
