I don't think this works here. For two primary reasons.

a) Cordelia and her generals aren't named.

b) Clearly they /did/ speak it, we just didn't see it.

With b in particular... you can't say that the Practical Guide web novel that we're reading in the real world is the same thing as the meta-narrative operating within the fictional universe. Clearly they overlap, but the second encompasses the first by necessity.

The gods/the "story" aren't limited to seeing three chapters a week, and they certainly aren't restricted to Cats viewpoint bar the odd interlude (otherwise the universe breaks down and other Named don't really have a narrative).

Not every plan in the universe bar the ones we read benefit from the unspoken gaurentee, or otherwise 99% of plans going on at any moment would have that backing, the vast majority of them conflicting.

Now, what the frame of reference is for the meta-story, I have no earthly idea, but it being /us/ would raise more questions than it would answer.
