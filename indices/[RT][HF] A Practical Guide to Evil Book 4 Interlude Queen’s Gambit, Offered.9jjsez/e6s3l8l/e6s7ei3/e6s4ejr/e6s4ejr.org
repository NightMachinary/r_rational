The Tyrant just wants everyone to be his friend! :(

I have a feeling that Cordelia will let Iserre burn... but what will they gain out of it? The chapter title implies that Cordelia is the one offering the gambit, since Cat is too far away right now and in too deep of a shit to be able to influence things here. Black is pretty weak from enhancing his army continuously... where is the White Knight at? And where'd the Pilgrim go after escaping Callow?

I concur with Grem, I /really/ don't like the shape of this.
