Regarding heroes - I don't think any of them would be allowed to pursue the Praesi when there's Dead King on the march. The whole reason Black isn't saving up his Aspects for a battle is because this stretch of the war is about armies and strategical objectives, not narrative wrangling.

Is there anyone reading who's good enough at chess to analyze the parallels? We know from the beginning of the chapter that Hasenbach needs for someone to catch up with Black, and that Queen's Gambit is an offering of a pawn for furthered control of the centre, but I don't think Black would actually march to Iserre. His biggest advantage is superior marching speed that lets him avoid serious confrontations.

Still, if the Monday chapter's title isn't "Queen's Gambit, Accepted", then my guess would be that he'd let Cordelia scorch the earth and would march on Orne instead, so he can dig himself a pass back, but I don't know how that corresponds to the chess theme. Any other ideas?
