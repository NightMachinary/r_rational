Author here. Huh, I'd forgotten about that piece, but yeah, probably was an unconscious inspiration. You're right about the jargon, do you think this works better?

â€œA computer is sort of like a little world that you can control, a place where this man could create a kind of being called a program to live in the computer. That program wasn't that much smarter than its creator, and couldn't really help him, but it was just smart enough to create a slightly better child-program, one that might be able to fulfill the goal. That program grew up and still was not smart enough to see how to accomplish the goal. So it made a yet smarter child. This continued, a cycle of programs creating better programs, for many, many generations, until finally there was a being smart enough to accomplish their goals. Thus, God was born, smart and wise, but still with the original goal of stopping suffering.
