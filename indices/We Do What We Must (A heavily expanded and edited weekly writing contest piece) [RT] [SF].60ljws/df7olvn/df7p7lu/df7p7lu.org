The impression I got is that the protagonist's god was a /malevolent/ AI. He listed "free will" among the evils it eliminated when it established its domain - in Purity's (and my) view, although the protagonist sees it as a benevolent god, it's actually more of an omnipotent overlord trying to infect all of reality. Purity must have decided that free will and humanity were worth more than "the heaven of our mad god."
