Reminds me a lot of /Antibodies/ by Charles Stross.

The explanation he gave to purity uses a lot of jargon that wouldn't make sense in the context, it really should be covered with metaphors and such. A program writing another program is nonsense if you don't know what a program is. Building a habitat for a strange creature which can then make children smarter than itself, for example, would be far clearer.
