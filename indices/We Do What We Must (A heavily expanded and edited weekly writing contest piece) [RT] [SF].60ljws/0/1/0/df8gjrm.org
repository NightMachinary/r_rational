With the ending more open, there's also a lot more room for a continuation. I'd love to see some of the unanswered questions covered, like how Purity, raised in nearly complete isolation by an AGI pawn came to the decision to stop the singularity injection, and also how she managed to convince others to help her destroy what would appear to be technology powerful enough to spark an empire.

Also, with Thomas surrendering peacefully, there would be more time for the unexpected variable (Purity) to disrupt Thomas's state of mind. It could be something as simple as realizing that if his god's initial goal values were slightly different, it might have resulting in a superior version, and a god with values set by the world's inhabitants rather than by an extrauniversal god whos goal values are fixed, could serve that world better.
