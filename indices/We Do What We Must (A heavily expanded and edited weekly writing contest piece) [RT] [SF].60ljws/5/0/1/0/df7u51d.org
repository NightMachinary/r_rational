Maybe there can only ever be a single transmission of information between worlds? In that case, the AI wouldn't be able to know anything about the world before sending the information. That would mean that it's just booting human consciousnesses into the void, to either be extinguished as they hit a reality devoid of any humans to recieve them, or to land in a body and get to work.
