I'm not really familiar with assassins creed. "The maker", the local equivalent of a god, was real. The master race sort of believes they believe it. Some people care about it, so whatever. There are much more effective methods of social control built into their society, taking cues from communism and secret police and the like.

The servitors have terrifying wireheading magic, so god doesn't really come into it for them. They're pretty much treated like furniture, no brainwashing effort required. The protagonists need to be clever, which is mostly why I posted it here.
