Well Robots from Asimov are just made that way, they're not controlled by constraining their psyche. House Elves... are /actually portrayed as a moral issue in canon/.

Whereas in this newer, AC-y-er version, I'm sort of left wondering/worrying about how the heck the Servant Race are going to end up getting free, or what happens to the parent species, or how the story is going to avoid turning into an AC-like author tract about how everything $SENTIENT_SPECIES ever believed in was a Big Lie invented to enslave them.

As in, you know, humans believe in gods and religions and ideologies TO ENSLAVE THEM, AAAAAH. And genetically-engineered ponies will end up believing in friendship and niceness TO ENSLAVE THEM, AAAAH. Inevitably there will be some kind of ultra-cynical "fuck everything, maaaan, get free, maaaan" message.

If someone can promise me this is /not/ about to happen, I will actually push through the initial chapters and read the damn story.

Seriously, Assassins' Creed made me go /bleck/.

EDIT: Actually, rationalfic of AC would be a great way to teach the meta-ethics sequence.
