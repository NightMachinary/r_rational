I've been tossing around the idea of a Gamer fic where the Gamer is also handed Cheat Engine 6.6, or a Hex editor. Cheat to win baby!

The process of loading up one of those programs and using them to set yous stats to infinity doesn't sound particularly fun to read about though. So I'm not sure where to begin. And of course, gaining omnipotence in act 1 isn't going to allow for anything much longer that a short story.
