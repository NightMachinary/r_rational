What if the Game existed in-universe as a way to control artificial intelligence? An AI could essentially see the world as an RPG where humans are NPCs that give them work to do. All the rules of the Game are artificial restrictions we place on AI to prevent them from getting too powerful, and the rewards they receive are designed to incentivize good behavior in exchange for more power to do more work for humans.
