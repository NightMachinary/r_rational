I have been on a litrpg trip lately and Gam3 is one of the ones I have enjoyed, even though I have found the main character very frustrating at times, especially in regards to his (arguable) lack of agency and his tendency to ignore advice for no good reason and to just forget the lessons he's learned.

Sometimes I think the MC's starting AI should have been the MC instead.

I do like the reason why the game is important in the physical world, though.
