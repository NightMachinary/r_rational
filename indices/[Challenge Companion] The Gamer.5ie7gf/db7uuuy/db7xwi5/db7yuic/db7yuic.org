The Games We Play really shows that it was written on an absurdly fast schedule. It's riddled with spelling errors, overuse of words and phrases, and dangling plotlines and characters.

It's also not remotely rational. The protagonist is theoretically the most intelligent person in existence, but is really only Sherlock-smart. Whether a strategy works or not is down to whether the author wanted to insert a training montage or have a hail mary moment, not due to any metric that could be predicted in advance.

It's more or less a fanservice power fantasy, which is fine if that's what you're looking for going in. I would never recommend it for the writing, however.
