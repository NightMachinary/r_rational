My favorite gamer fiction is a manga called DICE: the cube that changes everything.

Where a bunch of people are competing for Gamelike powers, but really the DM is toying with them all. The whole story has Transhumanistic vibes and makes statements about human nature.

And those two things: competition, and an actual message beyond "this guy has awesome game powers" make it into an engaging story.
