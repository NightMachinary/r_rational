Tower of God, while it's had its ups and downs, still consistently manages to feel fresh for me. If you haven't checked it out, I'd highly recommend it

Season 1 does a good job subverting some typical shonent tropes, but Season 2 falls more into typical arcs / motifs. Now, though, it's taking a darker turn again, which is interesting. I love the artwork, and the characters are all quite compelling.
