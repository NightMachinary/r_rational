I'm going to plug [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-games-we-play-rwby-the-gamer-ryuugi-complete.351105/][The Games We Play]], a RWBY fanfic that turns Jaune Arc into the Gamer. Loads of fun.

The fanfiction.net link is apparently old and incomplete, but SpaceBattles has the whole thing.
