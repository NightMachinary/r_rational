I'm going to add a few traps/mistakes I seen in these kinds of stories, if you don't mind.

/Excessively Lucky Protagonist/: Too often, the Gamer in these kinds of stories receives a whole string of incredibly good items, skills and opportunities right at the beginning of the story. I'm talking mid-game or even end-game content here. Often they don't even purposely seek these out -- they just sort of fall into his or her lap. Setting aside that this is narratively unsatisfying and just plain bad storytelling... it's also bad game design. No game is that generous with loot (and for good reason, too) so it's not like this is even faithful to the material that inspired the story. The Gamer should have to work for their shinies.

/Excessively Convenient Grinding Opportunities/: The way many Gamer stories are structured (in terms of their game system), rewards the protagonist from essentially cutting themselves off from the world at large until they have grinded their abilities and skills into something great. This is, of course, not very fun to read about beyond a first couple of chapters. As such, the authors often have to make the protagonist a reckless idiot or fabricate a very contrived set of circumstances to make the Gamer quit grinding for a while and do stuff. I can't help but think that this is just a band-aid, and that a much better solution would be to simply make grinding a lot less convenient. Make the Gamer want to interact with the world because it has something they want, which they cannot get in their Instant Dungeon or whatever.

In my opinion, these two issues are the primary cause of most of the flaws you listed. The author powers up their protagonist excessively and unrealistically quickly, and then has to scramble to provide him some kind of challenge. This challenge is invariably some super tough opponent that they have no business in fighting, even with their broken-as-hell items and abilities... but which they succeed at beating anyway. From this victory they get another round of lucky loot that make them even more broken, necessitating an even stronger opponent next time, which will give more lucky loot... you get the idea.

Throughout all of that, they use their Convenient Grinding Method^{TM} to avoid scrutiny from everyone, which is used as a justification for Everyone is Blind problem you listed above.

Anyway, a few more issues:

/Irrelevant Game System/: Gamer stories have a tendency to make the protagonist excessively broken, and many people have noted that. However, I find that a lot stories that don't fall into that trap actually go into another extreme and make the Gamer power borderline worthless. The protagonist grinds and trains all day long without stop or rest, and when they finally meet their enemies/rivals/classmates/whatever... they find that these people have advanced their abilities lockstep to match theirs. Like they're rubber band AI or something. The Gamer system should be an actual boon for the protagonist, not just a cosmetic quirk, IMO.

/World-Altering System/: This is may be a personal preference, but I dislike it when the Gamer power has the ability to silently edit other people and even the world itself to help the gamer. The Luck attribute and the money conversion function of the inventory are primary offenders in this regard. Many authors point out the problems inherent in this, but then they promptly ignore it. Personally, I'd prefer the Gamer power to be â€˜self-contained', as it were.

(I've been meaning to write a Gamer story for quite a while now. It's harder than it looks.)
