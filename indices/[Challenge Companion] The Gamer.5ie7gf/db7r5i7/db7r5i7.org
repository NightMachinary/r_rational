While I am no writer, this is my second favorite genre of fanfiction. For those who are more creatively minded, I wanted to write up notes on what the strengths of the trope are, as well as traps I've seen writers fall into.

*Pros:*

/Discovery/ - One of my favorite parts of any fantasy/SciFi is discovering the world it is set in. While it can be hard to inject a sense of novelty into fanficiton outside of characterization, The Gamer is a simple way to add novelty in world-building.

/Writing Rational Decisions/ - In many rational stories, characters stopping to think through options, evaluating possibilities and opportunity costs is awkward to read, or comes off as preachy. However, the distribution of scarce resources is forced to the forefront for Gamers, and we as readers expect the character(s) to spend time trying to optimize.

*Traps:*

/Growth as Plot/ - If The Gamer is the only thing changing in your story, it can feel like you have to keep exploring new spaces, and thus leveling up your character to do so. This kind of speedy growth is the white sugar of Gamer stories, as it burns away all of the ability space you can create to explore without seeing how the choices The Gamer makes affect the world around them.

/Bigger Badder Baddies/ - I'm sure there is a TvTropes page for this, but I didn't want to go digging. Basically, this entails The Gamer having to slowly fight bigger and bigger to keep the plot alive. Having more powerful fights sequenced in order requires good explanation for the ordering, and in many times the bigger bad characters are completely flat.

/Everyone Is Blind/ - Another thing I am sure is somewhere in TvTropes, but when no one notices or cares about the characters growth. Often this appears avoided because The Gamer will reach out to 'masters' for training, or enlist a confidant. However, unless The Gamer starts out as a hermit, eventually everyone is going to notice something is different, be it school attendance or being home late for dinner or accidentally not breathing. Also, if mmagic is completely foreign to the world, please model the confidants for The Gamer as rational as well, even if they are not that effective because of limited experience. No one should suddenly discover magic exists and never wonder about its limits or its safety.

/Breaking the Game/ - Letting the character break the game is a double-edged sword. It can be an interesting climax, especially if it was effectively foreshadowed and presented as a clever solution, and not just appeared out of nowhere. While it is not well foreshadowed, and not technically a Gamer fic, The Waves Arisen has a good game break at the end. Usually this must be the ending, or precede a hasty denouement, as the rest of the story tends to be wish fulfillment. If people want to break the game for longer, I recommend it is done in the style of Time Braid, with a broken antagonist to force real conflict.

TL;DR Writing is hard, but writing about writing is easier. Also, if someone wants an idea, Madoka: The Gamer from the perspective of Homura.

Edit: Well, I can say that this is my favorite genre, but I should probably provide a few recs. I would check out Shinobi: The RPG at Spacebattles for a good take on the genre that mostly avoids the above issues. The Games We Play is fun, but does not remotely qualify as rational fic.
