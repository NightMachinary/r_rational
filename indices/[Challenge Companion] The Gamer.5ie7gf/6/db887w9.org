I have an incredibly off-topic question:

#+begin_quote
  The central conceit here
#+end_quote

This is the third time /today/ that I have read this phrase (the others were in an article and a different Reddit post).

Is this an actual saying, or are people intending to say "the central *concept*"? I'm wondering if there's an auto-correct issue at play. It just stood out to me after seeing it so often.
