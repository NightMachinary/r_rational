This exists as a Korean web comic already. Its called....

The Gamer.

Its about a typical modern fantasy world, where there are mages and hidden conspiracies and such. And one new mage gets a unique power which causes his interactions, and only his, to work via rpg rules. So he gets loot drops, and everyone flips out and asks where he got a stack of cash from. And he can send party invites to people, and force them to work via rpg rules as well. He gets shot and his hit points go down, while other people who get shot have to go to the hospital. Ect ect.
