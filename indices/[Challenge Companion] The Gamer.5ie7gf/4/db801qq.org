I'll say this much, one of the things that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_It_Wrong_to_Try_to_Pick_Up_Girls_in_a_Dungeon%3F][Danmachi]] did amazingly well is changing the level up mechanic. Instead of leveling up after earning X amount of exp, the adventurers had to face a life-or-death challenge and go beyond their limits to 'earn' their level up. This meant a guarantee of no level ups acting as a Deus Ex Machina to save the heroes and made for a more satisfying thrill when we see the heroes gaining a level.

For recs, there are:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11019074/1/Gamer-Arc][Gamer Arc]] is a RWBY Gamer fanfiction where a very OOC Jaune receives a very stripped down Gamer ability but I really like how he explores the ability and how it affects his character and interaction with others.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11992573/1/Multiplayer][Multiplayer]] which is another RWBY Gamer fanfiction where we have /multiple/ characters with the Gamer power hence the title with a Reset ability. I'm not going to say anything else to avoid spoilers.
