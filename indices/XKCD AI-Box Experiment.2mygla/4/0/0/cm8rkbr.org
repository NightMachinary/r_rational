I just wanted to cram in as many lesswrong memes for making fun of people who make fun of strong AI. I ended up with a jumbled sentence as a result.

#+begin_quote
  knee-jerk humor
#+end_quote

Automatic humor as opposed to sophisticated humor

#+begin_quote
  low-status
#+end_quote

Implies that it is playing the social game of making something seem low-status so people will automatically disagree with.

#+begin_quote
  pattern-matched
#+end_quote

This comic doesn't actually do much to make people pattern match it with fictional AI. I was just looking for more ways to mock its mockery at that point.

#+begin_quote
  to fiction idea
#+end_quote

The idea of strong AI is often equated with fictionally scenario and thus dismissed.

So yeah, I just jammed a bunch of memes into one sentence while tired.
