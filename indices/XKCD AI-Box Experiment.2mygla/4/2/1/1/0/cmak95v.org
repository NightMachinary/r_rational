That's very interesting, but I don't really see how it is relevant. If smart people were somehow more likely to wear oversized brightly coloured pants, I would still bravely make fun of people in oversized pants. Correlation of behaviour with intelligence is hardly a shield against ridicule.

That said, enough people have downvoted my posts to make me realise something. Turns out, implying that Californian accent is well suited to conveying a certain type of humour over internet is akin to making fun of a kid with a Down syndrome while skinning a baby seal alive. I shall simply cease to torment people here with my attempts at humour.

EDIT: I have a minor request of anyone reading. If the contents of the post offend you or otherwise displease you, could you kindly take a minute to share with me what exactly is the issue? I cannot do better next time if you do not tell me what to fix.
