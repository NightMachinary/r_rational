I found the comic funny the same way that having an elephant in my pocket is funny. In the first panels of the analogous comic, we establish that I have an elephant in my pocket. In the middle panels I take out my elephant and feed it and ride around on it. And then in the last panels, my elephant steps back into my pocket.
