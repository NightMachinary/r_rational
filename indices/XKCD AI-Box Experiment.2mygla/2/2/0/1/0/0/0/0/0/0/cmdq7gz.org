I don't think the threat here is bigger than the execution. It would be way more efficient to just give me a taste of the torture. If the AI has modeled me well it would know I would find the threat feeble and decide not to comply. And if it comes to that then I can already conclude that this is not a torture scenario. I might be entirely unreasonable here but the AI is supposed to take my unreasonableness into account and concoct a scenario accordingly.
