I was just happy to see an entertaining reference to LessWrong as far as I could tell and had completely forgotten what Roko's Basilisk was.

While I feel slightly bad for unintentionally spreading a possibly distressing meme, the alt-text itself seems like something of a rebuttal to the Basilisk idea itself (If the principals of the idea worked (which to my understanding, they don't), why wouldn't they work with an AI that punishes you retroactively for causing undue distress by spreading the Basilisk idea?). My concern is also alleviated by the fact that I imagine the majority of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is already aware of the Basilisk idea.
