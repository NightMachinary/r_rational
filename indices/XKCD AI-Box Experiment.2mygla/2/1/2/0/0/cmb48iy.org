I've heard that argument before, but I don't buy it. Sleep is not a break in your subjective experience, it's just a shift into a slightly different one. The mind never goes 'off', and the person who wakes up tomorrow is probably the same one who went to sleep the previous night. The brain which went to sleep is the same brain which woke up.
