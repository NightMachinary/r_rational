I wouldn't worry about it. There are no "Roko's Basilisk people", nobody seriously thinks we should build the Basilisk. Even Roko was using it to argue that we should /not/ attempt to build a Friendly AI.

It's a bit of a strawman, really. It's fun to argue against it, but there's nobody actually arguing in favour of it. The whole thing got kinda blown out of proportion due to some poor moderation on Lesswrong.
