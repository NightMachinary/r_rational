I don't think I did that. Maybe I wasn't clear in the above post, but what I meant was that a lot of jokes about Roko's Basilisk have the general form of: "People who believe the Basilisk have something wrong with their mind and are therefore worthy of ridicule."

If I have offended, I'll edit my previous post.
