Not in an infohazard way. If anything, reading about the whole debacle might make people more careful if they ever stumble on a real infohazard.

Arguably in that it further cements the LessWrong-Roko association, which is bad PR for LessWrong, which is bad for MIRI, which is bad for humanity.

Although making the vast xkcd readership aware of LessWrong /in any way/ is a net good despite the basilisk joke.
