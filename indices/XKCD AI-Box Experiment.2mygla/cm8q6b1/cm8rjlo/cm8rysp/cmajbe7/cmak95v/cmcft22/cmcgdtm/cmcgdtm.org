Fair enough. Guess it was a bit optimistic of me to expect people here not to assume I'm mocking someone by default, since I'm a stranger on the internet. Seems my brain somehow conflated the users of [[/r/rational]] with my personal friends, who'd know that I do not generally engage in pointless internet scoffing. Thanks for the feedback.
