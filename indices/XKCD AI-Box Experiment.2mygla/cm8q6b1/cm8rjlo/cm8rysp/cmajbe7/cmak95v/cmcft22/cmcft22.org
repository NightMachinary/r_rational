  Turns out, implying that Californian accent is well suited to conveying a certain type of humour over internet

(this is taking your edit into consideration)

You didn't imply well at all. The complete lack of context in your original post makes it seem like you're mocking California English because you're basically just pointing it out, which on the internet (/especially/ Reddit) is usually just implying that you're /deriding/ it.
