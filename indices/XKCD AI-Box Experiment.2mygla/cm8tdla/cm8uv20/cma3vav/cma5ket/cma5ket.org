This is the best answer I've gotten, thanks.

I see a problem with this AI: How does it decide what contributing to its development mean? If I'm involved in making the case for the hardware its involved in, am I involved? Is the guy who designed the modern SSD involved? How about the janitor of the facility? Surely he's involved, since he keeps the work enviroment clean for those who are working on it.
