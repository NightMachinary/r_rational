The AI could make a thousand simulations of you, each with the exact mind-state/memories as you do right this instant, then torture them. From your perspective, you don't know if you're a simulation or not, so you have a 1000/1001 chance of being tortured right now if you don't comply immediately. The lucky one will get survivorship bias.
