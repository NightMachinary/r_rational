I will observe that you have not really done any explaining. Besides, as I have gleaned from other sources, the acausal trade is simply one's co-operation in exchange for no torture of his future copies. Some people /are/ moved by that, and all these are literally what I wrote in my first post.

I am baffled as to why you think I am assuming information that I have no access to without saying what that is. But I will be blunt when I say that your argument about your uncertainty regarding whether you are inside the simulation or not all the while living a peaceful life in 2014 is comically naive. The AI doesn't have the slightest reason to conduct a simulation for your compliance, less so not to torture you and bizarrely wait for your compliance. I am only bothering to write this because without arguments to back that up, you have done exactly what you accused me for -- making assumptions out of thin air.
