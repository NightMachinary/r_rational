Oh you mean the torture starts from now? But then again in my current apparent reality, there are already many people who accepted all the premises yet chose not to comply and are obviously not under torture^{right?} . This knowledge can't be present in an worst case torture scenario because I am feeling bliss in their presence. As long as those people continue to exist, I can't even acknowledge torture even if a troll eats my legs now because I can't connect the dots since torture is not the obvious explanation. So how can I comply? Hope I am not far off track here.
