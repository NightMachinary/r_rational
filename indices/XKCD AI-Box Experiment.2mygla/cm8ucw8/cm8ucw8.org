Twist: Randall /believes in/ the Basilisk and is afraid of it. So he's doing his best to increase awareness of FAI, through the most far-reaching means he has available right now: his webcomic. He is then compounding it by mentioning the Basilisk so curious readers of xkcd will research it and feel compelled to furthur awareness of FAI and the Basilisk in turn.
