It's important to remember that this whole thing is kind of tied up with the Petty Internet Feud between Rational Wiki and Less Wrong, as mentioned by Eliezer in his post. This isn't just about a potentially viral infohazard that may or may not cause you to be tortured for the rest of eternity, merely by learning about it. I'm afraid we're talking about something far more dangerous.

We're talking about /politics./

And, well... I don't especially blame Eliezer here. From his perspective, Roko's basilisk is an interesting (but probably wrong) hypothetical that he once reacted to in an embarrassing way. But then people outside of Less Wrong heard about it and basically went "ha ha those silly nerds believe they're going to be tortured to death by computers. They're basically a cult around this Yudkowsky guy." If I was in Eliezer's shoes, I'd take that personally, too.

That's the problem with anything that attacks your in-group, and you especially. It hacks your brain. It's nearly impossible to *not* get defensive. You can have literally written the book on how politics in the mind-killer, and yet not be any less immune. One moment everything is fine, but then someone insults your priors or something and YOU TAKE THAT BACK THEY'RE FINE GIVEN MY EVIDENCE BASE BUT NOW I'VE GOT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT I'M ANGRY AND MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MOTIVATED STOPPING */aaaaaahhhhhhh my carefully crafted epistemology is falling apart it buuuurrrrrnsssssss I'm melting I'm meelllllttiiiiinnng......../*

I've yet to come up with an effective solution to this.
