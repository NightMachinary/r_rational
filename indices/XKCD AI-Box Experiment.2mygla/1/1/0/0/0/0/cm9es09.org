I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're attempting humor via taking concepts to their logical extreme. However, in a similar vein, I must point out that this wouldn't work. Mutually Assured Destruction doesn't really apply to PR, and it /especially/ doesn't apply when it requires everyone to be aware of the implied meta-humor of their actions.

If you're secretly in fact an AI designed to maximize the amount of meta-humor in the universe, I retract this objection.
