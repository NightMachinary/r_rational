Yeah... for someone who wrote an entire fanfiction chapter about learning to lose, it seems like Yudkowsky should try harder to just admit censorship is a bad idea and then deflect attention to the parts of lesswrong that are really good. If he really want to address the basilisk directly, he ought to just say that It Makes Sense in Context and leave it at that.

- Edit: I read some of peoples comments on the xkcd... and actually I think I now understand Yudkowsky's response perfectly, even if it is still suboptimal in some ways. The number of people who do one Google search, read the first thing that comes up, and then post some comment mocking the idea without actually understanding it seems much higher than I suspected.
