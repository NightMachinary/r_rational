1. So far as I can tell, the gag order has been unofficially lifted - there was some discussion of it when a Slate article went up a month or two back without much of the purging that I would expect to see if it were actively moderated against. (Edit: [[http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/lan/xkcd_on_the_ai_box_experiment/][see here]])

2. Fairly likely? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2cm2eg/rokos_basilisk/cjv6xa7?context=3][See this (long) comment chain.]] Although given that these statements are easily found, perhaps it's less likely than I think. If I were his PR manager, I would advise him to not comment on it - but obviously I'm not his PR manager. (Edit: [[http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=110467][see here]])
