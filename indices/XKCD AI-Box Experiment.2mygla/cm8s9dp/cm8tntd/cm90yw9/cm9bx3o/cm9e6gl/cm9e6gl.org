  I've yet to come up with an effective solution to this.
#+end_quote

(let me preface this by saying that the following applies if you, a. care about Less Wrong's reputation, b. are willing to be evil enough; I'm not sure this applies to most of the community, the typical member of which shies away on a gut level from the Dark Arts)

*Link to [[http://xkcd.com/631/][this (NSFW) comic]] and bring up "Megan" as often as possible.* There are several other instances of Munroe appearing creepy that you could jump upon. Forward this to wherever making fun of creepy nerds is in vogue, and grab a bag of popcorn.

No, it won't do anything to help Less Wrong's current PR, but it would show that drawing attention to community embarrassments goes both ways. And maybe that's worth it, if purely in a TDT-related irony kind of way.

(A more community-palatable solution, which I thought up when writing this comment, would be to just shut down LW altogether and let discussion be handled in a less gaffe-prone, more decentralized manner, perhaps opening a [much more controlled, professional-y] discussion board for CFAR. The book version of the sequences being primed for public would make a great excuse.)
