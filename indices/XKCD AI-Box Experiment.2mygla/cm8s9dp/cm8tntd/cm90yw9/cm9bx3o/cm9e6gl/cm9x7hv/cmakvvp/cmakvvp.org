/Oh./ Rereading the post, I could see how it could be misinterpreted. My apologies. :(

I model situations out of habit, and (like certain fictional characters we all know and love) when asked, I /can't not/ try to think of ways to utilize them. I don't know how you'd defend yourself against social exploits if you can't think of them yourself in the first place.

It's an inherent part of my mental process, and when I write it down, it possibly generates thoughts faster than I can contextualize my post... which is how I think of more ideas (like the decentralization one). If not stabilized quickly, my thoughts blob into a sort of disconnected non-thesis, which, combined with a desperate urge to avoid procrastogenic thinking, makes the occasional suboptimally clear post posted.

Thank you for your feedback. :)
