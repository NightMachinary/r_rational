  MIRI has been known to give Eliezer some time off to write HPMOR. If MIRI folds, think of all the rationalfic we'll lose!

Kinda true. Except that if MIRI folds, he obviously has more time for fanfics! After MIRI he hasn't had as much time for HPMOR. Also, I don't think MIRI will fund lots of fanfiction anyway.
