As someone who had never heard of Roko's Basilisk before this xkcd comic, I didn't see "People who believe the Basilisk have some/thing wrong with their mind/ and are therefore worthy of ridicule", but more "People who believe the Basilisk have some /stupid ideas/ and are therefore worthy of ridicule". So, for the uninformed, it did rather look like what [[/u/Dogeball_new]] saw.
