Not really, because Roko's Basilisk is a rather silly idea.

On the other hand, making fun of people who take Roko's Basilisk seriously is pretty much making fun of people with mental illness/neuro-atypical people.

When I'm careful about the Basilisk, it's not because I take its risk seriously, it's because I take real people getting real upset/emotional seriously.
