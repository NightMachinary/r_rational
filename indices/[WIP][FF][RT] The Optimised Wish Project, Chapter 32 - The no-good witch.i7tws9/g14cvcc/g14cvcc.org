So the idea for how Babas' magic power works is now more explained in a way that fits somewhat with the rest of the metaphysics of the universe, nice. It seems rather simple, in the end - just have your soul knocked slightly out of synch with your body, and the rest is practice. I've thought about how to abuse this to create more mediums on purpose, but it all depends on how common soul-affecting items or techniques are and what the chances of things going wrong are. Artifacts on the caliber of immortality elixir are likely pretty rare, and mistakes in disturbing the soul would obviously lead to bad consequences - death, or worse. All in all, I like it.

Her motaivations are also fascinating. She wants to get into heaven when she dies, and is able to mostly figure out the conditions for "doing good" by talking to judged souls. She seems to arrive at conclusions close to Effective Altruism, which is neat. She might be able to good with her abilities directly, but she can probably maximise the goodness better by selling to the highest bidder and then using that money efficiently. The catch is, of course, to make sure you're not comitting any greater evils in earning that money, which is where she seems to have stumbled. I wonder who she was tricked by? She's not impressed by people like her brother, so simple power displays wouldn't fool her. The only one on earth I can think of who has a reasonable chance of being mistaken for a god is Piccolo himself - she's certainly old enough to have met him.

I had honestly forgotten about Ninja Murasaki, probably because he was only around for a chapter or so. Good to see he remains ridiculous, and just as capable and useful.
