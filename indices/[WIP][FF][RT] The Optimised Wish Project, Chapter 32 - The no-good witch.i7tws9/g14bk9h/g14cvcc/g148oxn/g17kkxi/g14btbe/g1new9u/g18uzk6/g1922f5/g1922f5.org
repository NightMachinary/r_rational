Well, Puar lost against Bulma. The Instruments don't have anyone as smart on their side (in fact, let's face it, they're on average quite stupid and conceited; Piano is easily the smartest of their lot), but they do have General Blue/Flute, whose power is a hard counter to Puar if he can only look him in the eyes, and Mai/Violin who is quite the tough fighter. And of course, vast numerical superiority. But if it was a scenario like "the Instruments kidnapped Yamcha, Puar wants to free him", I'd give it to Puar. If it was to the death of either side, then maybe the Instruments. If you count Tao Pai Pai as on their side, well... I'd say that increases their hopes significantly. Much like in canon, Tao is both cunning and strong.
