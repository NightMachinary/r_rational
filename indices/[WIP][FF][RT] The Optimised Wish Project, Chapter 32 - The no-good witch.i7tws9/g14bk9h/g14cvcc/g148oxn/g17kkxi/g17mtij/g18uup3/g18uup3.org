What you did is a very good explanation of deus ex machina fortune-teller. The only thing I am missing is that maybe you should hint earlier that Baba powers are 'rational' because in the previous episode readers might feel hit by the irrationality of her power. Maybe I didn't read deep enough and it's just my subjective opinion, but I feel that her character and powers could be a bit more justified earlier in the story.
