So Baba took the weird dream she had /many/ chapters ago as being a divine commandment to help the Instruments? Damn, she put WAY too much emphasis on the "do not offend gods" thing and didn't pay NEARLY enough attention to the "just do good" part of her instructions. Now the question is whether she'll immediately try and sabotage her "allies" in the name of damage control or whether she'll largely stay the current course out of fear for her life (since she knows just how horrible death would be for her right now).
