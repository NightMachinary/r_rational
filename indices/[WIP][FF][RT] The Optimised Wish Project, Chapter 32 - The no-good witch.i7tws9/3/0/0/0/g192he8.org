Hm, well, for her character the mystery was intentional. For her powers I did drop bits and pieces (the expired elixir was mentioned at her first appearance, and during the Tenkaichi attack sequence I tried to make it clear that her power is mediated by telepathy more than being pure divination), but yes, never gave the full picture. I thought it could be fine as long as an explanation eventually came. I'll also say that as a rule, given that I'm adapting a universe like Dragon Ball, the rational aspect always leans on the soft side. There's just too many crazy characters and powers to make sense of all of it in an airtight manner.
