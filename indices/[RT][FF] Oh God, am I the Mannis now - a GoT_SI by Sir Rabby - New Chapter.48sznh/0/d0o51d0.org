It's a fun read! My only worry is that the story hasn't established a direction or central conflict. It's largely running on toppling existing conflicts from canon without setting up any new characters or /meaningful/ obstacles of its own. Problems arise (which is good), but they're solved relatively quickly and without knock-on effects. Even /Tywin/ falls into line, and Robert has basically no agency at all.

That said, the politics angle once the action moves from Storm's End to King's Landing is really interestingly explored, especially given that it's something not many fics pay any attention to whatsoever. It presents a lot of opportunities for opponents to build their own factions and for things to fall apart without any notice at all, if Stannis misses just a few crucial items at the wrong time.

It's a fic I'll be keeping up with, at the least.
