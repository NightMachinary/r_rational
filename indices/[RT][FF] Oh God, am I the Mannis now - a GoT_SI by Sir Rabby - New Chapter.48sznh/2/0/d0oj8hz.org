Probably because it's almost guaranteed that he'll eventually betray you on his way up, and he's smart enough to do it in a way you won't expect. I liken him to a landmine that spits out gold, but only if you keep it in your pocket all day long. Hey, maybe when it finally goes off you'll notice, hurl it away from you and hide behind a wall in time. Maybe you'll even /defuse/ it!

Also he'll happily burn the kingdom so long as he can rule over some of the ashes.

I'd rather go with someone less competent and more trustworthy.
