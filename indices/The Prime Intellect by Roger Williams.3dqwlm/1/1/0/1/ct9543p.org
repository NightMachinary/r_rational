By Prime Intellect's criteria, he should reverse his Thingy (I forget what it was called) because all the people were going to wirehead, thus destroying themselves, thus the whole human race dies. By Celestia's criteria, most people can be kept happy enough that only a few hundred actually /ask/ to die. We can quibble over how many such requests she grants, but surely if someone is actually better off /dead/ they'll /think/ a death-wish and be counted in the number of petitioners.

By /my/ standards, which are the ones that /count/ since I'm human and real, the Three Laws sound like the better idea at the start (no killing anyone because they won't join your subculture, obeying orders from humans as a matter of course), but the pony-shaped monster's utility function yields a better long term for those who /do/ live (ie: probably most humans and no nonhumans).
