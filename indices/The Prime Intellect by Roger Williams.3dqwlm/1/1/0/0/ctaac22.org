There's another way to look at that 86 thing in FiO. 86 is also the code for being thrown out of a venue or game, e.g. "I got eighty-sixed from Caesar's for counting cards." Since FiO contains a number of apparent shout outs to MoPI, I read that as "CelestAI would have just given an outlier like Caroline what she wanted, because it's what she would have deserved."
