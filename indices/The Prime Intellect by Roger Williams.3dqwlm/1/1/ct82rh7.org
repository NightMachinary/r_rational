Stupid Three-Laws Unfriendliness. 4/10, mostly wouldn't read again. However, my impressions are colored by having read /Prime Intellect/ half my life ago.

But still, think about it: how many people were death-seekers in that so-called "post-singularity utopia"? Not just two, /lots/: [[#s][]]. And how many iotas of superintelligent artificial intellect are devoted to solving that problem, to /making those lives worth living in interesting, complex ways?/

Jack fucking shit, that's how many, because Prime Intellect isn't bound to care about whether anyone's life is worth living -- only to keep them alive and follow their orders, no matter how dumb the orders are.

By comparison, a slightly better-programmed fictional AI singleton managed a record of 86 people being better off dead than posthuman (I actually just checked), /in all of time running from roughly 2011 to the heat death of the universe/.

Prime Intellect is a primitive, misbegotten moron, at least by the standards of fictional wannabe-FAI singleton agents.
