This is a fairly interesting read. It's not that long of a story, either. About novella length. I spoiler tagged the information below, but you can read the spoiler and still enjoy the story, it's not that big. Although, fair warning, it's very gorey, especially in the initial chapters. I'd say it definitely deserves almost every trigger warning in the book, as it can get very graphic. Don't read if you're even a little squeamish, although I suppose you can take solace in that most of the bad stuff that happens is consensual. But still very FUBAR.

So, has anyone else read this and, if so, what did you think of it?
