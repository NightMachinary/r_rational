For what it's worth, I'm most of the way through and enjoying it. It's important to note what /kind/ of story it is:

Some part of it is a view into a possible future with a friendly, not perfect, AI. It's pretty average on that count - there are better and there are worse visions.

However, it gives a really brutal look into human nature. Specifically, the rather dark elements of it, and how it might play out in such a future. The parts I found compelling all involved character interaction.
