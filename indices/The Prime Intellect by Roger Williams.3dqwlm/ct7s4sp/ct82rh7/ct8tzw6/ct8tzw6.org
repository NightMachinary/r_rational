  By comparison, a slightly better-programmed fictional AI singleton managed a record of 86 people being better off dead than posthuman (I actually just checked), /in all of time running from roughly 2011 to the heat death of the universe/.

By Prime Intellect's criteria, /nobody/ is better off dead than posthuman. You can't judge both stories by CelestAI's standards, that gives her an unfair advantage. How many people in her story would rather /not/ be ponies? Have their potentially-eternal lives been compromised by an obsession with talking cartoon horses and friendship? And which of those two caveats is worse?

Also they're both fictional and the numbers don't mean anything, but that doesn't undermine your point.

Edit: Sorry, my point wasn't very clear. All we know from FiO is that /in CelestAI's opinion/ 86 people were better off dead than posthuman. We don't know how true that was.
