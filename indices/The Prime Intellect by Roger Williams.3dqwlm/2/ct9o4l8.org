This story had a lot of moment that completely broke my suspension of disbelief, occasionally to the point of literally saying "*/What?!/**" out loud. It's [RST], but definitely not [RT].

(The hell sort of superintelligent AI can foresee that the disutility of people committing suicide will eventually outweigh the positive utility of allowing them the freedom to do so, but not update on that belief until it's /actually happened/? OK, I'll stop.)

With that said - with the exception of allowing people to "opt out" of being observed when the AI knows full damn well they're only doing it to produce as much disutility as possible in the time it's "unaware" that they're harming themselves (sorry, I'll stop) - this is actually one of the better utopias I've ever seen.

So /of course/ we never get to see any of that, and instead focus on torture-porn, because Author Appeal. Hmph.
