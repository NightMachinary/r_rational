  I guess the real message I got from this story is that it is incredibly dangerous to implement the 3 laws of robotics in a singularity grade AI. You could argue that without them a omnipresent AI could just wipe out the human race but... It's like this: do we want super smart indentured servants, or do we want companions in sentience? I'd rather have the latter than the former.

I'm really goddamn glad someone noticed the interpretation you would find useful if you were actually designing an FAI.
