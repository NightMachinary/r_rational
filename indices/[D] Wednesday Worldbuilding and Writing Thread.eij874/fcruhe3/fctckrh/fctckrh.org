Personally, I'm a sucker for bastard platonism, and since you have emanations from one world into another here, you might fiddle with that somehow? Since these shabti are effectively probes going into The Cave. The big question I would have is why the shabti are necessary if people can go there directly; presumably the shabti would have special capacities humans do not, it's easier to send a dozen shabti than one human, or the shabti can act as flight recorders if it all goes to hell, etc. I'd nail down their intended role, and define the rules from there.

(I used the term shabti for something in PB, as it happens, but mine fit the original concept only in the very broad sense of "artificial magic slave"; they play a limited role in the story and don't work as described here)
