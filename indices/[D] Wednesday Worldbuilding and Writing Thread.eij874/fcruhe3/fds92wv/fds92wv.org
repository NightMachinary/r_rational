  The first thing is to replace "death" with something else, maybe which works as a thematic parallel, but which isn't as blunt and obvious, and doesn't have all the overtones of theology and existentialism. Instead, maybe veils between worlds and one world that's subordinate to others, e.g. a prime world where you make the shabti dolls and a secondary world where they take on life, flavored not like the land of the dead, but like, say, typical colonial exploration/exploitation that you tend to find in portal fantasy.

Dreams. (If you want more layers, this could be done Inception style, or with a dream "world".)

  In terms of how I'd going about constructing the shabti on a mechanical level to work within the story ... *that's where I'm a bit stuck,* since obviously I could do programming analogies (I'm a programmer by trade), but seems better to me to have higher-level rules for what shabti can and cannot do,

The effects or power could vary by world. Or distance from the world in which they were made - shabti made in "reality" are level 1, at dream depth 1, level 2 at dream depth 2, and so on. Shabti made at dream depth 1 could be level 1 at dream depth 2 - or the rules between dreams and reality (or between dreamers*) could be different.

*One example of this could be, shabti you make (in your dreams) don't work in /your/ dreams (or at least, not with out you entering someone else's dream first, Inception style).
