How's this: the world is like a prison colony, similar to Brittish Australia. If you do something terrible you can choose shabti over death, where you're auctioned off for a job, and sent to the other world to perform that job. Shabti have weekly deadlines where they have to turn in a certain amount of ore/food/other-thing-special-to-shabti-plane that they were assigned to, and the better you do at your job the quicker you're able to get out. The more below you're deadline the more years are taken off your life (unsure about this part, but there should be something motivating not slacking off). Due to the lack of organized power structures and typical habits of criminals, this creates incentive for piracy, and a general wild west vibe. Weak coalitions soon form between groups hoping to avoid getting stolen from, and others hoping to steal more effectively. Some, smarter companies are trying to organize their shabti into more official coalitions, but this proves difficult as people can't bring any objects with them when they choose shabti, thus the companies lose enforcement mechanisms. There are currently lobbying efforts to allow high paying companies to train their shabti on enforcement and management tactics before they go in, but this is opposed by the general public who feel that it is generally a bad idea to teach murderers and rapists easier ways to murder and rape people.

Death is impossible unless it's done by not performing your job, those stuck in fatal situations are left to suffer until the deadline. These conditions are kept economically feasible because 10 years in the shabti plane is 1 year in our plane.

Hope these ideas will fit with the rest of your narrative. I'd like to know what you think.
