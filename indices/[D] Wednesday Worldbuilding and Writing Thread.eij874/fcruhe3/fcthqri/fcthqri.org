The premise you've framed up here makes me think about the (overblown?) concerns that were raised in some quarters when the LHC went into operation: that the existence of mass was predicated on a local minimum rather than a global minimum on some set of constraints, and that efforts to isolate the Higg's boson would provide activation energy to send the universe sliding into a totally new configuration with different (catastrophic-for-us) physical laws.

In a universe where something like this has happened, but for some reason you have two "universes" with distinct physical laws share a (hyper)spatial boundary instead of having one version of physics overtake the other at lightspeed, I think the determining how the boundary works and how it is maintained would do a lot to describe what is known or understood about how shabti would work, and perhaps about how they actually work.

Narratively speaking, it's presumably difficult to send anybody through a barrier like this, and more difficult to send anything through and have it be anything like what it was on this side. I imagine that plus the informational asymmetry could set up all different sorts of "expeditions" sent with all different sorts of agendas, which get scrambled or preserved in all sorts of interesting ways by what's on the other side.

The primary function of shabti in this formulation would be to try to ensure that explorers continue to be the agents you sent off, or at least continue to meaningfully share your original goals and possess the means to at least attempt to achieve then it send information back. Being on the other side of that activation energy barrier, and the presumably imperfect nature of the shabti would be significant here.
