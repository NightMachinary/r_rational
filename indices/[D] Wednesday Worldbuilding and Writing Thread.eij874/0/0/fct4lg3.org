Maybe instead of having parallel worlds, you can set this in an outer space story where the characters are going from a more primitive world to a more advanced world.

The shabti is what they are receiving as a reward/adjustment of sorts for coming to a foreign culture/world without any allowance to ever return home. The shabti will be a way for the immigrants to better fit in with some(one) who is reminiscent of home but is also very aware of what the new world is like and how to adjust from one culture to another.

Sorry if that's not what you were asking for, but I wanted to suggest what I would replace "death" with.
