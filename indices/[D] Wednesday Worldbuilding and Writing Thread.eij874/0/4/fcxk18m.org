In one of Greg Egan's short stories, something similar happens beyond the event horizon of a black hole (from which there can never be any communication). Neal Stephenson's Fall had something like that with a virtual world, but the book was unsatisfying for me (for one thing, it wasn't clear why nobody in the virtual world could contact the real world). In Egan's _Schild's Ladder_ there are several instances of characters copying their consciousnesses into "dolls" that go into and interact with realms of altered physics. A similar, but more fantasy flavored story would be a lot of fun.

I can imagine a story where the "shabti" are robots with human minds operating in the deep ocean or inside a neutron star or some other deadly environment. Hm! What if they were on a space ship travelling at relativistic speeds? That would explain the poor communication.

Thinking about The Cave, what if these shabti were exploring some deeper level of physics? They're in a quantum world for example where nothing is intuitive, and the things they do there have emergent effects on our classical world?
