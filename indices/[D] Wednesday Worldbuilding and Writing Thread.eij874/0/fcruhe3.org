The ancient Egyptians had a concept of 'shabti', little funerary sculptures that were inscribed with a shabti formula that specified their function in the afterlife. So the idea is, when you die, you would appear in the afterlife with your shabti that had been made for you in life. I think the idea is Neat, so am trying to figure out a way to appropriate it.

The first thing is to replace "death" with something else, maybe which works as a thematic parallel, but which isn't as blunt and obvious, and doesn't have all the overtones of theology and existentialism. Instead, maybe veils between worlds and one world that's subordinate to others, e.g. a prime world where you make the shabti dolls and a secondary world where they take on life, flavored not like the land of the dead, but like, say, typical colonial exploration/exploitation that you tend to find in portal fantasy.

In terms of "natural story", you would then have a brief run-up as someone is saying their goodbyes, and an adventure in the other world with the shabti and everyone else that has gone to the secondary world, and /their/ shabti. I like the idea of a secondary world that leaks almost no information back, and an expedition/colony that's gone badly wrong for unforeseen reasons, or foreseeable-in-retrospect reasons, but maybe I just watched /The Terror/ too recently and have been thinking about a fantasy version of that (the real life aspects, anyway). I'm not sure how the Egyptians thought they knew that their shabti would do, but obviously there's limited mechanisms for testing something that's only going to work in the other world.

In terms of how I'd going about constructing the shabti on a mechanical level to work within the story ... *that's where I'm a bit stuck,* since obviously I could do programming analogies (I'm a programmer by trade), but seems better to me to have higher-level rules for what shabti can and cannot do, if the intent is to have those higher-level rules play into the plot or inform character decisions. (This is also an ongoing problem in my robot wizard vampire story, which is stalled out because high-level rules about what magic can and cannot do are easy, but making sure that they work on a lower level without breaking the world is hard, especially if you want those lower levels to be exploitable to create higher-level effects or break apparent higher-level rules.)

(I really like looking to other cultures for worldbuilding inspiration, partly because it makes me feel like I'm learning things, partly because there are a lot of neat ideas that have stood the test of time in some capacity.)
