I know. The /quantity/ of contribution described in the link is extraordinary (though if you're willing, it would be /really/ awesome); I meant the link more as a suggestion for the /kind/ of feedback that would be the most helpful. What I would hope is that my betas would be willing to talk about where the story is going, how well the themes work, ways to improve things, stuff it would be awesome to see, analysis of characters, tone of voice, etc., rather than merely pointing out typos or awkward language (which is, of course, still helpful). Basically, just direct feedback on the kinds of things an involved reader would be thinking about. Want in?
