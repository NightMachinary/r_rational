Thanks for the feedback. I'm going to do some serious thinking about the title and come up with a list of alternatives. Thinking more about the current title, I can see how it has the wrong tone. It suggests I'm writing a Mary Sue fic, or perhaps yet another one of those clich√© civilization-building SG fics (you know what I'm talking about) where the author espouses their lame political philosophy. (Though those two particular examples are important for me to keep in mind, since they represent possible failure modes for my own story.)

What I'm going to aim for is something that captures the personality of the story. Something that's thoughtful, maybe slightly pretentious, and a tad bit funny. (I'd say goofy, but that's how the current title fails.) Or at least, that's what I think the personality of my story is. Am I reading it accurately?

Also, do you think the new title should drop the "Ship of the Line" part entirely?
