"Ship of the Line" refers to the genre of Halloween fics where the Gang dresses up as science fiction characters and somehow thereby receive a spaceship, and where, additionally, the Sunnydale universe turns out to simultaneously be a /different/ sci-fi universe (traditionally Stargate). The name comes from [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Challenge-7035/Ship+of+the+Line.htm][a "challenge" on tthfanfic]], which you'll see that I don't adhere to religiously.

Exemplars of the genre, which I consider to be influences:

- /[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-29783/PitViper+Ships+of+the+Line.htm][Ships of the Line]]/: Brooding, thoughtful, imaginative, and, sadly, unfinished.
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9280215/1/Ship-of-the-Line-Forever-After-Earth][Ship of the Line: Forever After Earth]]/: Erotica, incidentally, sometimes very extreme/disturbing. But if you look past that, it's a very well thought out and well written story with some interesting ideas. Also, appears to be written by an aspiring rationalist.

I'm glad you like "Secretly Awesome." It took me a while to think of, but it was clear to me that it was a good choice almost as soon as I came up with it. Much better than the previous "GCU /Principle of Explosion/."
