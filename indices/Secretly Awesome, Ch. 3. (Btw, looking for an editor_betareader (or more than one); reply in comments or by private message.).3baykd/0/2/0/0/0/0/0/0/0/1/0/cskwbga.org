'Ship of the line' did seem a little odd. I really did not get the impression that most culture ships were 'of the line' in the sense that they were even warships. GCU's, while very capable of fighting, are not warships.

Ironically, I quite like 'Secretly Awesome' as a title; it fits both with a culture ship name, and is very Willow.
