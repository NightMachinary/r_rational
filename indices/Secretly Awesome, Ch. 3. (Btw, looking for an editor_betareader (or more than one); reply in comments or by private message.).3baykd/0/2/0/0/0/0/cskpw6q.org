Good point. Thanks for the advice. The reason I responded is that I myself am not entirely happy with the title (which I guess it may be too late to change now). Here are some reasons why:

1. It's not a very clever title. Compare with the chapter titles, which for the most part engage with the themes of their respective chapters.
2. It makes the reveal of Willow's Mind-name ("Secretly Awesome") less interesting/unexpected/exciting/compelling. I spent quite a while searching for a name for Willow and was very happy with the result. Now it's possible that I have, in my haste and excitement to get the first chapter published, undermined the value of this name.
