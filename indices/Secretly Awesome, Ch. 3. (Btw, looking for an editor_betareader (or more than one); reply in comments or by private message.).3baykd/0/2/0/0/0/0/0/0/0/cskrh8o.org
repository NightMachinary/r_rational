I'm not a huge fan. I think it's a good ship name, but my ideal title is:

- A quote from somewhere, ideally from within the work itself (bonus points if it's the last line)
- Layered, so that it might mean multiple things
- Suggestive, so that it gives the imagination a kick
- Enigmatic
- Descriptive, so you can make a guess about what you're reading

That's a pretty tall order; I consider myself lucky if I can get two of those. (I've also been accused of being pretty pretentious though, and I sort of agree with that sentiment. These are just my personal preferences.)

/Secretly Awesome/ makes sense within the story, but I can see how it would drive people away, or draw in the "wrong sort" of people who aren't actually interested in the story you're presenting. You want to think about who you're writing for (even if that person is yourself) and then think about what kind of title would draw /you/ in.

And I agree that your chapter titles do a much better job than the story title.
