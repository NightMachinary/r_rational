I wish to be omnipotent, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality][completely immortal as defined by Tv Tropes]], and completely unaffected by wishes that contradict this wish and the results of wishes that contradict the results of this wish. There.

That /should/ deal with the wishes for no wishes, and should also deal with other omnipotent entities popping up that may or may not try to kill me. Omnipotence means you can do anything, so that technically means you can destroy other omnipotent entities. But if you do a wish that includes being incapable of dying... But omnipotence means you can do anything and that means that doesn't... You know what, I'm giving myself a headache thinking about this. I'm just not even going to /try/ anymore. Ugh.
