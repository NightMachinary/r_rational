I'm not sure if wishing for "the result of a perfectly worded wish for X" is any better than wishing for "X". You're hedging bets against malignant (or at least undesirable) interpretation of "X", but that same malignant/undesirable interpretation is still a possibility even if you specify "perfectly worded" beforehand.

Like...

I imagine there's this concept:

< a wish for X >

and this concept:

< a wish for an undesirable/malignant twist on X >

and this concept:

< a perfectly worded wish for X >

and you imagine that you can avoid the twist and get the good result by that proposed phrasing. But it seems to me that what could actually happen is this:

< the result of a perfectly worded wish for a malignant/undesirable twist on X >

I'm not sure if there is a way to get around that with only one wish.
