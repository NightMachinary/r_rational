IwishIexistedatthebeginningoftheuniverseandwasomnipotent. Phew. Hope I got that in before the cancelation wishes.

Assuming the wish was granted, I would then run a functional simulation of the current universe up until the present, creating backup copies of every sentient being ever in existence. Then start over, rewriting the laws of physics to eliminate the possibility of death and suffering of sentients, and which allowed every sentient limited omnipotence within their own pocket universe. Oh and of course the ability to travel to other's pocket universes at will, given permission to do so by the owner. Then copy everyone over and relinquish my total omnipotence.

I think that about covers it. I hope everyone would forgive me for denying their wishes!
