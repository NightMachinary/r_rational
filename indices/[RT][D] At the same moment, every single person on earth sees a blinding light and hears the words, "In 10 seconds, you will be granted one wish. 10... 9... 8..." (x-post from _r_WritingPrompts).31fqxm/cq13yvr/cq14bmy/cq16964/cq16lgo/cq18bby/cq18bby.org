Presumably, whoever says it first gets it, and then everything after that depends on them.

Really, everything is going to depend on whoever comes up with a significant wish. For example, let's assume the first million people wish for money or the resurrection of a family member, etc. - not really significant wishes in the long run. But if the million-and-first wish is that no wishes come true, the game is over. Or if the million-and-first wish is that they're omnipotent, then no subsequent meta-wishes will most likely affect that new god, but all other wishes do depend on those meta-wishes. It's all pretty random at that point.

Edit: I wish there was a way this post could time how long it takes for each poster's response. It'd be more interesting to see, sort of a model of how it might happen in real life. For example, [[/u/literal_hitler]] wishes for omnipotence at 8.2 seconds. Unfortunately for him, [[/u/Igigigif]] wished for arbiter-ship over wishes at 4.4 seconds and rejects this wish... but lets [[/u/JackStargazer]] wish to allow us to reach humanity's CEV. Be interesting to see what the final result would be.
