I know, I know. Normally I include the knowledge of how to use it in any 'make me omnipotent' wishes, but this one includes complete immortality so I'd probably figure it out eventually.

With a wish for omniscience, you can see everything. That doesn't mean you can /understand/ everything, and it doesn't mean you won't immediately go insane. Really, all the wishes for ultimate power are always going to have an out clause that destroys the person making the wish somehow, especially if there's only 10 seconds to develop the wish.
