I mostly just desperately want more Northern Caves, or more stories like Northern Caves, or anything vaguely related to Northern Caves, but at the same time I've accepted that this wish will never be fulfilled.

This new story seems promising enough, although in a very different way. Sadly, it kind of looks like the update schedule will be less than great and it might ruin the reading experience. Ideally, I'd make myself forget about it until it's finished, but I won't have enough willpower for that.

Prediction: the title means that something is going to have measure zero. Possibly related to Cordelia becoming "skeletal"?
