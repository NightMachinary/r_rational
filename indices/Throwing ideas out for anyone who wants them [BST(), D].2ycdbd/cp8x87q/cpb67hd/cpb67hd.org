I was thinking that they loop back to the anchor point along with everyone else who either died or made it to the end of the week. The story I mentioned was an old man wondering why his family has abandoned him, when only days ago they were crying at his side and making heartfelt promises and taking wonderful care of him. They've stopped caring. He keeps on living his last hours for all of eternity, wondering where his family's gone, why he isn't dying, why is he all alone, is this hell? etc.

As for the crime thing, it should be noted that THEY know where they'll begin as well, and they can go as far away as possible to another place. That said, shunning is a system that makes sense. Especially in what's essentially a very small community, now that you can only travel as far as one can travel in a week without planes (unless you've got a friend who knows how or you know how).
