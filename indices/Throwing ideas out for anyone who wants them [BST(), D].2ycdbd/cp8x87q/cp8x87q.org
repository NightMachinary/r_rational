"Money" as we know it would probably be largely replaced by status and favors. Property would still exist, but you could only own things nearby. You might do a huge favor for your neighbor, in exchange for trading houses.

Most jobs would become unnecessary. This means most of the population would probably be rendered unemployed, and most of the downsides of this would be avoided.

I could imagine jobs like manning power plants which would normally require far too much paperwork to pay for conventionally could involve some weird kind of taxation. If the power man asks for something, you give it to him. If someone doesn't, they're shunned. If they aren't shunned, the entire block loses power for a week. Then again, maybe these jobs would be rare enough for volunteer work on its own. And maybe volunteer work is nothing but this, done on such an instinctual level that we don't even notice it.

Murder would obviously be much less important. Bureaucracy would have to be massively reduced. Much of crime would probably be punished by shunning, but in cases where it's necessary it would be entirely possible to just lock someone up again each week. You know where they are after all. Or you could repeatedly kill them for a while.

Pregnancy and STDs would no longer be an issue. The consequences of that are obvious.

What exactly are you doing for people who die during the week? Based on the first story you mentioned, they lose all memories?
