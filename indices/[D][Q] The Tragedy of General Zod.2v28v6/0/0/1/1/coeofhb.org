I'm guessing you are basing this on the new Doctors. As far as the good wizard coming from the sky, or the blood soaked trickster god who will change/optimize your entire societies value system, I agree.

As for canonical Galifrey. . . um, no the time lords basically have a elder civilization prohibition against acting, and make stupid exceptions, for space opera plot reasons, but then again I side with new Chaos over the prime directive in the Open Door.
