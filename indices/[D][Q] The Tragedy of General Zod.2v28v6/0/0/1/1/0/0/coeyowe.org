  Remember, when you talk about those later Doctors, you're speaking of someone who would probably wipe out the Culture claiming that Humanity Is Not Ready. He's got some kind of hate-on for anything beyond the 21st century baseline humanity he likes.

I'm going to have to think about that and look at the doctor in a more critical light. I'm not sure if this is the character or the BBC always focusing on what they thinks makes the future relate-able, but I think your right from the perspective of the doctor actively opposing attempts to uplift humanity, and not doing it himself. From that perspective he is a lazy bastard.

But you did bring up my favorite trans-humanist example culture *Minds*. Yes they are story AIs and not good speculative AIs. I know Bolstrom has his arguments against super-intelligence via modding human intelligence as a potential existential threat. But some day, if it were safe, say approved by post-human intelligence working on CEV, if we could get there and maintain our identity it'd be very nice to think on those levels.
