  I'm going to have to think about that,

And remember how they devoted an entire episode to the Doctor telling a human that Humanity Isn't Ready for regeneration/rejuvenation, and that it will always Go Horribly Wrong, and immortality is just shite anyway and we humans should accept Nature's will? Except for how The +Emo Kid+ Doctor has this /terrible burden/ of flying around in a transdimensional space-and-time ship meeting interesting people, saving worlds, and causing hilarity to ensue everywhere he goes.

  I know Bolstrom has his arguments against super-intelligence via modding human intelligence as a potential exitental threat. But some day, if it were safe, say approved by post-human intelligence working on CEV, if we could get there and maintain our identity it'd be very nice to think on those levels.

Couldn't we try to find out about the actual science of human cognitive enhancement before declaring that it will /inevitably/ Go Horribly Wrong? Normally I'm early to the party on saying transhumanism should have caution and display ethical scruples, but declaring /everything/, including /human beings/, an "existential risk" (reason for scare quotes: /risk to what?/) until proven otherwise seems... well... dare I say this... kinda ignorant.

Point being, I think when we understand the mechanisms behind human cognition, we'll understand quite well how to enhance it without destroying "our essential humanity" or whatever the philosophers have conned themselves into believing in this year.
