  Human modification is probably the easiest way to get to making a superintellegence, but all things being equal it is very hard to be certain what the value structure of the resulting super-intelligence will be as human value structures are mutable, so you are probably going to get it wrong.

I think this very much depends on what you mean by "human value structures". Are we talking about the underlying cognitive machinery behind our morality, or are we talking about the airy-fairy philosophical objects labeled "moral values" and conjured into nonsensical consideration the same way dualistic consciousness is and for the same reasons?

The former could be altered as a side-effect of intelligence enhancement, but that's why you work to /understand what's going to happen/ before you actually go and enhance someone -- you also leave /no/ avenues open for recursive enhancement without cooperation and pro-social behavior. If all your avenues to cognitive enhancement seem likely to destroy a person's moral character, then you simply don't use them.

Of course, if you're talking about the latter, the philosophical ghosts usually called "values", then they /will/ be altered or destroyed by /everything/, because that's simply what happens to large masses of nonsense when exposed to reality.

  Edit: I started a new thread for good fictional examples of transhuman and posthumans, because your points on the doctor are well taken, and I'm interested to see which other fictional idols shatter under assault from the community.

Neato!
