This is why I an avid superman fan haven't seen it; (superman is a good first step for transhumanity to aspire too, aside from his physical impossibility)

That said, this is an interesting idea that would be a very compelling morality tale if done right. Please do write it and give us a rational, but militant, General Zod's struggle to restore krypton.

If you do, as a "If bilbo is a Jedi, then Sauran must have a death star" I'd suggest Supes being orders of magnitude more powerful, including his speed of thinking, due to having spent all of his life in a yellow sun.
