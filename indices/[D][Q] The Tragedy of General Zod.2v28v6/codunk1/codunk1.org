There were a lot of things that could have been done to make that movie better, and a lot of things that could have made it more rational.

- Make it so that the terraforming ship is damaged in such a way that it's not going to be able to move to another planet - it's terraform Earth or bust, which at least means that Zod has some incentive other than being a total dick.
- Have Zod make some token attempt at compromise before going psycho.
- Have Zod make a token attempt at trickery (a legitimate military tactic).
- Actually include some fallout from the near-total destruction of Metropolis. The Avengers at least made a token effort at this with the destruction in New York City, but /Man of Steel/ basically didn't try to give emotional weight to the thousands that died.

Mostly the movie just sucked - it was a bunch of flashy, enjoyable action scenes that strung together nonsense.
