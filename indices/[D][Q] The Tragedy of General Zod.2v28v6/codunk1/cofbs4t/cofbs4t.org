  Actually include some fallout from the near-total destruction of Metropolis. The Avengers at least made a token effort at this with the destruction in New York City, but Man of Steel basically didn't try to give emotional weight to the thousands that died.

My personal prediction is that this will be the sequel.

It would be a surprise, to me, if they deliberately went out of their way to emphasize the destruction - rather than sanitizing it like The Avengers did - only to be /surprised/ when people questioned whether Superman was actually a good thing. Especially considering the obvious sequel-potential with Batman and/or Luthor bringing this up as their motivation.

Unfortunately, I suspect it wasn't /worth it/, since the sequel sounds like it's trying to cram in too many characters /a la/ Amazing Spiderman 2. But we'll just have to see.
