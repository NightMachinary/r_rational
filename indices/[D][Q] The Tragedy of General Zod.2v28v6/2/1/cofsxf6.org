I'm thinking zod probably could have been called a combination of literally not caring about anything but krypton/it's preservation and in basis of that he was already insane in trying to accomplish anything after it's destruction.

Any act he took was desperation.

Killing humans just was not something I saw he cared about at all except how it related to superman. He was killing them because it was more convenient then spending a few moments to move to venus far as I could tell. Although as was mentioned earlier, this entire plot weirdness that really does hurt it would be relatively fixable with just making the terraformer ship unable to make a second trip.

If either the terraformer or the arc ship with the clone production facility were unable to be moved from earth then the conflict will remain.

But no one ever clarified if this was the case far as I can tell and zod kind of jumped onto obliterating all of humanity a bit fast.
