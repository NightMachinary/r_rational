The biggest problem with that movie, at least from a rational fiction point of view, is that there is really no reason for the fundamental conflict. Had Zod been acting sensibly, he could simply have popped down to Earth to meet Clark, explained the situation, asked him to help restore his species, and then terraformed Venus or something. He could have literally achieved every one of his goals had he simply decided against exterminating the human race for no good reason.

I'd almost go as far as saying that Zod fails at being a level 1 intelligent character -- if not for the fact that people with power frequently /do/ act like this, committing atrocities simply because it is convenient and satisfies their more ugly human urges. I remember reading somewhere that the true human relation to power, subconsciously recognized by everyone, is the ability to inflict injustice without consequence. Add to that the research demonstrating that power and wealth bias humans to higher levels of callousness and ethical laxity.

For this reason, I generally think Zod mostly qualifies as a level 1 intelligent character. The bit that I find a little doubtful is his pointless decision to kill off a technologically inferior species that had nothing to do with him or the losses he suffered. I suppose he could plausibly be considered to be mad with grief and/or power, but you'd think that this elder race would at least have learned how to condition their military commanders, no?

On a lighter note, how the hell is Jor-El, a Kryptonian bred and conditioned for scientific research, able to beat the shit out of multiple trained soldiers (okay fine, he had the element of surprise, but dat kung fu), and then take on Zod in single combat and /win/?

I think I'd have been happier watching the movie /Jor-El: Science Badass/ instead.
