Regarding the "deep sea / outer space is scary by itself" theme: the movie /The Descent/ starts out as a movie about being trapped in a cave and trying to find another way out, and it actually becomes a lot less scary when it becomes a movie about being attacked by cave monsters instead.

"Buried" and "Open Water" are two other horror movies in which the only enemy is an inevitability lethal environment...
