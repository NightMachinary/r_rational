We recorded this one back in January, and I think it's safe to say that if we'd recorded it /now/ we probably would have talked a bit about the coronavirus, specifically in terms of:

- Loss of control
- Fear of the unknown
- Portents and omens
- Disruption of the ordinary
- Body horror and betrayal of the self
- Horror in the marketplace

I'd be willing to take any of those up in the comments: I'm generally a believer in trying to understand what I'm feeling about any particular thing, not just for its own sake, but to help better be able to write about those things.
