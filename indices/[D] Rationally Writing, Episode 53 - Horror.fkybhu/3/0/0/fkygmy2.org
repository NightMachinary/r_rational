  The monsters in the John Wayne Cleaver books actually tend to become more terrifying as you learn more about them and how they work, which is great because it means that the climax of the book (where the main character has "figured out" the monster and how to defeat it) is also the moment when the monster is at their scariest: understanding the monster well enough to identify its weakness is also often the same as knowing exactly what horror it's capable of unleashing, and they're terrifying in ways that go beyond the fact that they can kill you.

The demons in the /Pact/ world are like this too; it could be argued that it's a horror story in general, but the oblivion demon chapters in particular definitely had a strong horror vibe that amplified once you knew what it could do.
