The idea of "rational horror stories" makes it impossible for me to not think of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGg8Cddkocw][Abed's scary story]].

There isn't much "rational horror," and part of that might be because a lot of horror, at a base level, already does a lot of what's commonly associated with rational stories. In the same way that a lot of "rational fiction" is in conversation with existing tropes of fantasy and other flavors of speculative fiction, horror movies are often in conversation with other horror movies, perhaps more than any other genre. (This is something that [[https://kuiperblog.tumblr.com/post/187414178288/ready-or-not-i-cant-believe-its-not-margot][I wrote about at greater length in a blog post about Ready or Not]].)

One of the best-known examples of this is Scream (mentioned in this episode), a slasher movie that has [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLpbHKV1_8][a scene where one of the characters straight-up explains "the rules" of slasher movies while they're watching a slasher movie]] and is very obviously trying to deconstruct the genre that it's part of. And in a similar vein, you have black comedies like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1t8OZn_uhE][Tucker & Dale vs Evil]] that assume that the audience is already familiar with the language and tropes of the horror genre and use that to play with their expectations by incorporating deconstructive elements. Another deconstructive horror movie is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsIilFNNmkY][Cabin in the Woods]] (where the movie sets up a world-building explanation for why all the classic horror tropes exist in a single Cabin in the Woods).

Then, you have your post-Scream slasher movies that are more reconstructive (like You're Next), where the movie tries to re-create what people love about classic slasher movies while almost self-consciously avoiding the common criticisms that people have of these movies (such as the criticisms that are articulated in the Scream scene linked above). A movie like You're Next is in conversation with the conventions of slasher movies in the same way that Shadows of the Limelight or Worm is in conversation with the conventions of established superhero universes. So, perhaps one of the reason we don't see more rational horror is that horror is already too meta. It's not "ripe for deconstruction" in the same way that something like Pokemon is, because the genre has already been deconstructing (and reconstructing) itself for decades. (Joss Wheden already made Cabin in the Woods, what else is there to say about those classic horror movie tropes now?)

Another reason that "rational fiction" seems to stray away from horror is that main of the levels on which horror operates are at odds with what people want from rational fiction. For example, a lot of horror relies on a "fear of the unknown," a terror of what unknown monsters might lurk in the darkness. That "fear of the unknown" relies on keeping people in the dark, and rational readers, for the most part, do /not/ want to be left in the dark. They're often the kind of people who most want to know how the world works, and explaining the world to them is often at odds with maintaining that "fear of what might lurk in the darkness."

One flavor of horror that inverts this is the cosmic horror and psychological horror that is associated with H.P. Lovecraft. If most scary stories scare people by depriving them of insight about the monsters that lurk in the darkness, Lovecraftian horror is about knowing /too much/ about the monsters that lurk beyond our sight. (Learn too much, and you might go insane.) It's also one of the levels on which deep sea horror (also mentioned in this episode) operates on: you don't need to make up monsters for a deep sea story to be terrifying; the mere reality of your situation is terrifying enough, and there darkness of the deeps is the omnipresent "x-factor" that keeps you wondering about what might be lurking out of sight. Space can be scary for similar reasons: like the deep sea, space is full of inky darkness, you're surrounded by +high water pressure+ a vacuum, and you're relying on a lot of sensitive equipment to keep you alive so you're constantly reminded of the fragility and frailty of your own body. ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBFuiHZRylY][SNL did a sketch based on this premise]]: every mistake is scarier when you're in space.) And of course, as the tagline for Scott Ridley's Alien told us, "in space, no one can hear you scream." It's enough to make you feel a bit of existential horror even before the terrifying aliens show up. Space is a place where it's easy for humans to feel small and powerless, which is exactly what you want from a horror story.

On a craft level, I recently replayed Halo (which was just added to the remastered Master Chief collection on PC), and though it's not a "horror game," it has a lot of great "horror moments" in one particular level, which I think might serve as an instructive example of how to tell a "horror chapter" in the context of a larger non-horror story. In the level 343 Guilty Spark, Master Chief goes to warn the space marines that they're about to walk into a trap; the base they're wandering into was secured not to keep them out, but secured to keep something in. For the entire game until this point, the humans have been fighting and been nearly overwhelmed by covenant aliens -- and yet, as you approach the structure at nighttime in the pouring rain, you see the covenant fleeing in terror from the structure. Now what could be so terrifying that the /covenant/ are scared of it? As Chief descends further and further into the structure's underground catacombs, things are eerily quiet. Everywhere, there are barricades and corridors and hidden nests that look like they'd be the perfect hiding place for an enemy, but there are no enemies, only the bullet holes and plasma burns on the wall and blood on the floor, the evidence of a battle that evidently took place here -- but against whom? The closest thing to an answer comes in the form of a human marine who opens fire upon you immediately upon seeing you, barely lucid and screaming in terror about "them," unwilling to move or say anything else. Eventually, Chief a room where the floor is covered with the bloodied corpses of space marines -- and on one of the corpses, he locates a data chip containing a record of what happened in the moments leading up to their death. The recording is mostly confused yelling and looking around for the enemy, cutting to black before some /thing/ starts to show up. And then the recording ends, and you as the player come to the realization that you're standing in the very room that you saw in the recording, the very room that all of these space marines died in, and now something is banging on the doors and the walls are starting to shake. (As an aside: hats off to Microsoft for keeping the flood out of the marketing for Halo; I'm sure tons of people played through that game in 2001 for the first time not knowing that the second half of the game involved you fighting through mobs of space zombies.)

The level starts by /implying/ the existence of an enemy that's stronger than the strongest enemies that you've already faced (such that your enemies are /terrified/ by whatever this /thing/ is), shows evidence of this /thing's/ destructive capabilities without ever showing it directly (again, merely /implying/ its power). The protagonist, with all of these gaps in information, keeps pressing further and further to find answers, until the moment that they finally figure out what is going on, and in that moment they realize that they're deep in the catacombs, far far away from safety, and now the monster has come out to play. Most of the level's scariest moments happen /before/ the monster is revealed. (There's also a great moment later in the mission where, after you've fought through several waves of space zombies, you make your way to an elevator and think "finally, a way back to the surface!" only to realize that this elevator, which is your only path "forward," is taking you down, /further/ into the catacombs, and it becomes immediately clear that things are going to get much worse before they start to get better.) This isn't a menace that you can defeat, only one that you can escape from. It doesn't hurt that the flood are even more body horror-ific than regular zombies, since the flood parasites transform their hosts into terrifying shapes that still eerily resemble the host body while looking like shambling, decaying corpses. And the fact that that the parasite attacks all sentient lifeforms and you see both "human zombies" and alien "covenant zombies" puts an interesting twist on the classic zombie trope.
