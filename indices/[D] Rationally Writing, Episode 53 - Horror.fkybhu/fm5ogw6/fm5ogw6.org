One of the more successful horror movies in recent memory, although it wasn't marketed as one, was /The Dark Knight/. Heath Ledger's Joker is very much a horror movie villain; the biggest difference between /The Dark Knight/ and most horror movies is that the protagonists/victims of most horror movies are ordinary people, but the protagonist/victim in that movie is Batman, and even /he/ can't cope. Nothing he can do to the Joker has any effect (he beats up the Joker and the Joker laughs it off, he puts the Joker in jail and the Joker escapes...) and although the Joker isn't a physical threat to him personally, he finds himself powerless to protect the people he cares most about.
