"Pandemic stories" are kind of their own genre (the film Contagion or Michael Crichton's Andromeda Strain being the clearest examples), though the "pandemic genre" often overlaps with other genres, sometime functioning as an "inciting incident" apocalyptic fantasy stories (like Stephen King's The Stand), or zombie movies, or science fictions like the Planet of the Apes reboot.

Dan Wells' novel Extreme Makeover comes to mind, both as a sci-fi story that has some fun "horror moments" (as you might expect from the author of I Am Not a Serial Killer). It's a fun read if you're looking at a book about the spread of a "pandemic" that, for most of the story, is regarded by world governments as disruptive to normal life but mostly harmless or a minor inconvenience, all while each chapter begins with a countdown timer (chapter 1 begins with the heading "267 days to the end of the world").

Dan Wells in general is interesting to me because he has a knack for what he calls "psychological terror, writing stuff that is "horrifying" or "creepy" without placing the main character in physical danger most of the time. (This is kind of necessary for the John Wayne Cleaver books, where the main character /can't/ die for the simple reason that the series name is John Wayne Cleaver, and if you're reading book 1 of 6, you can safely assume that John isn't going to die.) The monsters in the John Wayne Cleaver books actually tend to become /more/ terrifying as you learn more about them and how they work, which is great because it means that the climax of the book (where the main character has "figured out" the monster and how to defeat it) is also the moment when the monster is at their scariest: understanding the monster well enough to identify its weakness is also often the same as knowing exactly what horror it's capable of unleashing, and they're terrifying in ways that go beyond the fact that they can kill you.

I think there's also a conversation to be had about "horror as aesthetic" vs "horror as mood." e.g. there are lots of stories about vampires and werewolves that aren't horror, and you have lots of books that are shelved in the "science fiction" section of the bookstore that play a lot with horror elements. (You mentioned Michael Crichton's Sphere during the podcast, which I think is a good example, and there are lots of sci-fi stories that, while not really horror per se, have lots of "horror moments.")
