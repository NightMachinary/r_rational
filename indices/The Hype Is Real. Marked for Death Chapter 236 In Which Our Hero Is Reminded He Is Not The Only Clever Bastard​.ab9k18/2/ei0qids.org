Sorry for necroing the thread.

I've been catching up to this story (currently on ch. 59) and I like it so far.

The only issue I have is that I've been having a hard time finding out what the final votes are that lead to the chapters that get written. Do you happen to know if the voting results are somehow linked/highlighted in an easy to search way?

Usually the QMs do a good job of explaining things so you don't necessarily need to know what the vote was to understand what's going on. But sometimes I feel like I'm missing a bit of information about what motivated the group to take a certain action. And it's not fun hunting through pages of comments to figure it out.
