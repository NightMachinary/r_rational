So I dropped this story when the mc got inducted to leaf and it felt like all the risk of him dying left me for some reason so should I pick it back up again? I really wanted them to find their own village or something because being in leaf seemed like you won the game. I also didn't like how the mc was going for a harem with ino and was rationalizing it.
