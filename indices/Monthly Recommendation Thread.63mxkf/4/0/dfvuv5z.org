If you liked Henry August, you might like [[https://www.amazon.com/Replay-Ken-Grimwood/dp/068816112X][Replay]] even though I don't consider it as good. It involves a similar scenario where the character is looping in time, but every time he loops, it's back to a moment in his life where he is closer to death with a shorter and shorter loop. It's very focused on his emotional struggles with his upcoming death and how all of his life's work is undone with each reset and doesn't involve any antagonists.
