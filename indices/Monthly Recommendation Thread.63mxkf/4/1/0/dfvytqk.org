While I liked Henry August as a whole, I don't think I would qualify it was a "rational" story. Partly because of your sam issue with. The reason I think that is because there are several obvious things that the author makes no attempt to explain or even address. I guess it's not necessary according to subreddit rules, but it's one of my personal rules and I think other people can find it a little annoying as well.
