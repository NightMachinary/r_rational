An interesting read, but be prepared for a couple of things that may through you off. First, it is written in a distant, matter of fact way. Like someone telling you the backstory of something, only in broadish strokes. Almost like someone was trying to write a history book or something. Second, there is little polish and there are certain typos that happen often, like "seize" being misspelled as "cease" etc. The latter led me to eventually stop reading the story.
