Seconding A Practical Guide to Evil and The Gods Are Bastards. TGAB is a bit of a slog in the first three books, but the writing quality really picks up and the world is really interesting. I really, /really/ wish the author would go back and re-edit some of the earlier chapters, because it can be a bit off-putting.
