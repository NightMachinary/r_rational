I've been working my way through the list at topwebfiction.com; sadly not all of it (or even most of it) is rational, but there are still some gems to be had. And some to avoid, IMO.

[[http://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/chapter/14075][change: new world]]: Avoid it. /Eventually/ you might get drawn into it, and it does improve as time goes on, but the writing isn't very good, the power jumps and rules are seemingly arbitrary, and the author seemingly has no concept of measuring time or distances (I don't care how big your school is, it shouldn't ever take ten minutes to run down a hallway). The world is interesting but basically a trope by now (the world turns into a game and most people die but the high schoolers survive!). I get the impression that the author began this while in high school so there's some amount of wish fulfilment involved. Read about 100 chapters, and it wasn't worth it.

[[http://gravitytales.com/Novel/aethernea/a-chapter-1][Aethernea]] is one that I'd stick in the middle of the pack. There are some things I really enjoy, such as the neat ways that the magic systems seem to work and seeing the difference between how super-student Kiel approaches problems compared to how practical-demi-goddess Elaru does. But there's an issue in that Elaru is a Mary Sue character through and through. Beautiful, mysterious, has held every job in the world (while only being a teen, or maybe early 20s), a peerless magic caster, unlimited magical power - she's a manic pixie dream girl in fantasy form. Kiel is too, to a lesser extent, but at least he has some flaws... anyway, the story itself has some neat stuff, and the author often gives hints of things that come into play several chapters later, but overall I find the main characters frustrating.

[[http://blaise-corvin.com/2016/01/20/delvers-llc-chapter-1/][Delvers, LLC]]: Again a pretty standard trope - two regular guys are warped to a fantasy world and given powers but told they'll probably die anyway. However, this one I'd rate at slightly better than average. For one, the people sent there are adults (29-30 years old). Their responses make sense as you learn about some of their psychological scars and history. And the secondary characters are pretty decent (they even added a drag queen character recently, which was actually pretty interesting). It's not amazing, but it is one that I'll likely follow up on once more chapters come out. The second book (which all but the last two chapters are available for for free on that site) is being published this week.

[[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/2016/07/27/1-00/][The Wandering Inn]] is another one I enjoyed. Overplayed trope (Earth kids whisked away to a magical world with a class system and leveling), but interesting in that most of the story revolves around a girl who becomes an innkeeper rather than a hero tasked to save the world. She has a bit of a Bella Swan thing going on wherein everyone who meets her either seems to want to kill her or adores her, but she's not nearly as annoying. Oh, and if you like chess, you'll really like how she thinks. Worth checking out!

[[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/2015/10/03/orientation-1-01/][Heretical Edge]]: Still in the middle of reading this (well, 16/20 arcs into it), but I've liked it so far. A teenage girl ends up going to a secret academy where Heretics (humans who can see monsters and absorb their abilities) are trained to protect the rest of humanity. The writing is pretty good, and the author frequently throws twists and turns. Fair warning - the scene can go from jocular to extremely violent and gory very quickly. The author does a great job writing some of the horror scenes. There's not a strong focus on the system of magic or abilities unfortunately, but if you like action, drama, horror, and budding bisexual teenage romance, it's worth checking out.

I think that's all for now, besides echoing my usual recommendations of [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/prologue/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] and [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/][The Gods Are Bastards]]!
