I feel like the Starship's Mage books by Glynn Stewart would be enjoyed by this reddit. I don't think they're /especially/ rational, but the characters are reasonably intelligent and rarely hold the idiot ball. Perhaps more importantly, they're a lot of fun.

I've also been reading N. K. Jemisin's +Implausibly large number of+ Hundred Thousand Kingdoms books recently. They're pretty good, though I think I prefer her recent books (Fifth Season, etc), partly because I really like world building with a sense of a really extensive history.

(On which note, if you have any recommendations for other books with that sense, I'd appreciate it)
