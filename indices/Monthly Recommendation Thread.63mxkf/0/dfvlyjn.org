I've been reading a lot of webserials recently. I have a bit of aversion to picking up published works lately... I often have the sense that many published fiction works have lost their spark in the editing process. On the other hand, webserials writing quality varies vastly and I find myself leaving harsh reviews about 50% of the time. I abandon a lot of what I read, probably at least 20% of what I start is abandoned for one reason or another.

*Recommendations*:

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10286][The Good Student]] - Original webserial fiction. Follows one of four students who is able to attend a prestigious academy on a merit scholarship. Pretty much everything about this story is impressive, the writing quality is high, worldbuilding is just right, and the characters all feel real and multidimensional. I am seriously impressed. It only has ten chapters so far, but the content so far is fantastic.

I've read some of mooderino's other works, like How To Avoid Death On A Daily Basis, but I dropped that into Book 5. The Good Student is a significant improvement.

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10073][The Wandering Inn]] - Follows a girl from Earth mysteriously dropped into a fantasy world with no special abilities. Barely survives and gains a job as an innkeeper in a burned out village. It's quite good, albeit a bit slower paced.
