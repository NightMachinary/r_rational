I watched Youjo Senki, but I found it pretty boring. After the initial hook, it's just WW1.5 where some people are wizards and the Germans always win. I couldn't find any reason to care about the characters or the setting. In particular, I was kind of expecting Tanya to show some character development from being thrust into another world, but she's the same all the way through. Sometimes God shows up and complains, but nothing really comes of it.

I recommend you approach with caution, if you think you might want to watch this.
