I've heard good things about The Good Student but I'm holding off until there's more to sink my teeth into.

I will, however, second the recommendation for The Wandering Inn. I really enjoyed reading it, especially after other characters from Earth began showing up. Plus, it gave me feels about a giant ant. That's pretty well done!
