  It turns out that every competent/intelligent character in-story is female, and every male is a testosterone-poisoned derp.

I'm really surprised by this. Yes, there are several characters who are competent/intelligent females, but certainly not all of them are. And I can think of only two characters who fit the "testosterone-poisoned derp" label: Relc and Calruz. But both are still extremely competent. As for other males:

- Klbkch is male (well, he's a male-type humanoid ant) and is extremely competent - one of the strongest defenders in the city. He's definitely not "derpy" and I don't think he even has testosterone pumping through him.

- Pisces is male, but also competent and intelligent... just not socially graceful. He's got an inflated ego but also is hailed as a genius caster.

- Olesm is male, highly intelligent but perhaps a bit too experienced to be called "competent." Erin beats him constantly in chess, true, but he's been playing for only a year and she was a step below Grandmaster level.

  The story also features several chapters about periods and ice cream.

Not sure what the problem is here necessarily. The period thing makes a lot of sense - young women don't automatically have their menstrual cycle stop when they get teleported to a fantasy world. And the ice cream thing brought together quite a few threads - the effect that the new arrivals have upon the world, how hiding their origin is becoming increasingly difficult, and the entire thing brings Ryoka to the attention of Lady Magnolia, which expands upon the political and technological interests of the ruling class. Complaining about the ice cream is like complaining about apples being in /Spice and Wolf./
