In terms of good Naruto fanfics, I'd recommend Shinobi: Team 7 by Gallyrat and Team 7's Ascension parts 1 & 2 by Eilyfe. I'm not a /huge/ fan of Chiaroscuro, but it's decent.

I would also advise you to check out [[/r/Narutofanfiction]] (I'm a fairly regular poster there) as well as the discord channel (link's in the sidebar). Quite a few people can recommend you very good stories.
