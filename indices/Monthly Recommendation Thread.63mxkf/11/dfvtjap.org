[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/327551/changeling-space-program][Changeling Space Program]] (My Little Pony) - the changelings are attempting to be the first on the moon. It has realistic depictions of rocket research and the author is basing the characters' progress on his ability to build a rocket on the Kerbal space game. It's a great read and hilarious. But the updates are on the order of months in between.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Replay-Ken-Grimwood/dp/068816112X][Replay]] (Original) - it involves a man repeating his life with the repeats getting closer to his death date each time. It's not what I consider rational in the character's investigation and use of the power, but his emotional struggles were very vivid and well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]] (Harry Potter) - A great story where Ron goes back in time to his birth, but the world he is reborn into is an AU so he has no idea of what to expect from the future.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]] (RWBY) - It's a re-imagining of RWBY as an RPG-like world where everyone is a gamer character and the plot of RWBY is dramatically different as a result. I would recommend anything written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6272865/Coeur-Al-Aran][Couer Al'aran]]. He's a /brilliant/ writer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12326784/1/Auburn][Auburn]] (RWBY) - RWBY with Jaune, Weiss, Blake, and Ruby on a team together. The author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6098148/Super-Saiyan-Cyndaquil][Super Saiyan Syndaquil]] has written some other good fanfics, but Auburn's my favorite.
