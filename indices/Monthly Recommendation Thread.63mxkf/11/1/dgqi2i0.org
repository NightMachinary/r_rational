  I would recommend anything written by Couer Al'aran. He's a brilliant writer.

Quite a bit after the fact, but I wanted to thank you for the recommendation of this author's works. I've torn through several of them (Forged Destiny, Professor Arc, Not This Time Fate, The Entertainer) and enjoyed most... Professor Arc and Forged Destiny probably being my favorites (and NTTF being my least, just because Jaune is so unlikable for the first half). Only issue I've had is trying to keep all of them straight since most hit the same events but with small twists. FD is probably best in this regard, as it's a lot more unique than the others - the world of Remanent changes, not just Jaune himself.

Do you have any recommendations for authors of a similar quality or style? I think I've just about ridden the RWBY train to death, but that's all that Al'aran writes... I liked his blend of action, romance, and comedy quite a bit and would enjoy something similar with a different series or an OC. Thanks for any help!
