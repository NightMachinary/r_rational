/Life Is Strange./

It's technically a video game, but it more closely resembles a TV miniseries/serial in terms of pacing/plot/length. There are five "episodes," and each episode takes anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to play through (depending on whether you thoroughly explore the world or run through it).

It would be better to play through it on your own because there are so many choices/decisions you have to make, and most of those choices/decisions have a dramatic impact on events that happen later in the story. However, not everyone owns a PlayStation/Xbox/whatever (as I understand it, a not insignificant chunk of the adult population has no interest in "gaming" (and consequently remains unfortunately unaware of the existence of incredible games like /Life Is Strange/)).

I couldn't find many playthroughs that had no commentary (this isn't the type of game you want a Pewdiepie or a Markiplier to yell over), and this was the only one with no commentary that also left the in-game music on (music is copyrighted so youtubers can't monetize the video if they leave the music on). The episodes in this particular playthrough average at about 2.5 hours long each. Five episodes at 2.5 hours each is pretty darn similar to one season of a TV show.

I can just about guarantee you that if you make it through the first 19 minutes and 23 seconds of the first video, you'll be hooked.
