We are physics too, and so what we choose does matter. Even if our choices are theoretically predetermined, which we can't ever see ourselves (not even theoretically, due to Heisenberg), in practice we still make those choices and affect the world. I can't just choose to do nothing and then blame predeterminism for the result.

Accepting the inevitable is perfectly fine, the problem is that you never know what is inevitable before you've done everything you can to prevent it. Giving up before that means accepting tragedies that could've been avoided. And that's not acceptable. The game gives us a situation where things truly are inevitable (kind of, assuming the other ending is not actually a thing) which to me devalues the /game/ that we spend fighting against said inevitability. You never had any chance to begin with, so it was all just a cruel prank.
