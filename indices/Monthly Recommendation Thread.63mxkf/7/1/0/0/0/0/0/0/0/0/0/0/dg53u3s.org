I've seen two possibilities as to that.

[[#s][Spoiler]]

It'd have been fine within the scope of the game if the ending had had real choices and meaning, I could've dealt. Ideally, I'd have wanted to see Max consider that what she does is so tiny and insignificant compared to what she could do, to really consider the choice between altruism and selfishness - which is in no way a simple and obvious choice! But you should be given it or at least it should be /mentioned/.
