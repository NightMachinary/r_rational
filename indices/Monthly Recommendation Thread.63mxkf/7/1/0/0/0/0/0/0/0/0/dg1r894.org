Which is precisely why I feel failing the thing you spend the entire game attempting (and, more importantly, also undoing everything else you achieved while at it) is unsatisfying. You had this ability, and in the end the result is exactly the same as if you'd never had it, never started the game and made any choices at all. Nothing you did had any lasting impact or meaning.
