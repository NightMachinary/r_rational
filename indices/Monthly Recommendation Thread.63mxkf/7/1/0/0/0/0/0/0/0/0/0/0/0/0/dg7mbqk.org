Did you notice the 'either - or'? I don't really have a strong opinion on which way the story should be read (the idea in the former is that Max would do things even if she didn't have her ability - we don't know what the ordinary timeline would look like because we never see it, unless it's what we see at the ending) but there are exactly the two options I outlined and both are bad, in my opinion.
