That's the thing, this isn't a "rational" story. The [[#s][spoiler]] isn't scientific, it's magical/supernatural; it didn't really cause the mess, it was "magically" caused by the inciting incident in the bathroom, and the rest of the story is the universe trying to restore balance and put things back the way they're supposed to be. Or something.
