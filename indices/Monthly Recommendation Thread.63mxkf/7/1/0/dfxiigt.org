I found the [[#s][spoiler]] ending to be lacking depth, like they just made up whatever just so they could offer players a choice at the end. I was disappointed in that ending.

I found the "true" ending, where you choose to [[#s][spoiler]], to be narratively satisfying. It felt like the inevitable result of an internally consistent chain of causality, like this was what the story had been leading up to the entire time and that there was no other way the story could resolve.

It also felt heartbreaking. That's one of the criteria I use to judge the quality of a story. I feel like, if a creator isn't competent enough to make me to emotionally care about their characters as if they were actual people, they aren't competent enough to demand my attention. I wept twice during my first playthrough of Life is Strange, and a few minor things made me tear up; for comparison, I probably only full-on wept thrice in reaction to HPMOR, but it made me tear up more often. Life is Strange has some "hella" stiff dialogue (which isn't unexpected, seeing as it's about American teenagers and it was written by two French adults and developed by a French game developer) but it's still written well enough to trick my brain into empathizing with imaginary people, so the ending felt like it had weight. The ending certainly didn't make me happy, but I was happy with the ending.
