I found a story called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/infrastructure-an-illustrated-original-work.209283/][infrastructure]] that despite the amount of work that goes into it doesn't receive that much attention. it updates every few months and is guaranteed to have some pictures. the art isn't that good but you can see the work that goes into it.

Summary: some advanced robots are stranded on a magical planet and seek to return home. to do this they set out to uplift the humans to get the infrastructure necessary to leave.
