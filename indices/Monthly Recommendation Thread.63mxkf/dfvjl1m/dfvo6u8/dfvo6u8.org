I fucking love/hate Henry August. It has good/adequate world-building, and the image of the ouroboron society stretching forwards and backwards, iterating and growing I find very cool.

The writing voice is incredible. Henry has a very strong presence and I find the story addictive.

It's completely ruined by the conflict. The negative externalities caused by the antagonist's efforts are the problem, not his goal. The moralising of the main character about "YOU AM PLAY GOD" drove me crazy.
