A movie I really enjoyed a while back was The Beauty Inside, about a Korean man who wakes up on his 18th birthday in the body of a 40-year-old man. Then, the next morning, wakes up in the body of a 75-year-old woman. Every morning he wakes up in a new body.

It's about the life he pieces together for himself, the few friends he can keep, and the question of whether love can exist between people when one of them could be anyone. Not exactly rationalist, but an interesting and well-thought-out premise. I also usually don't enjoy movies with romances as their primary plot, but this was an exception.
