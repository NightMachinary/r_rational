Not quite rationalist, but the protagonist does have a ruthlessly efficient mindset: [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/saga-of-tanya-the-evil][Youjo Senki: The Sage of Tanya the Evil]]. An anime series about a salary man reincarnated into a war torn alternate history in the middle of its analog of World War I (more like 1.5, as the date is slightly later and the technology slightly more advanced, oh and there is flying combat mages). Excellent action sequences and music, lots of fun dark humor and black comedy, decent quality commentary on human nature, the only real problem is that the character designs leave something to be desired in some cases (Victoria's oversized moe eyes is the worst case I think).

But what really held my interest is the psychology of the main character. In his/her former life, Tanya was a salary man working in HR in a big company. Possessed of a calculating mindset, he felt no remorse at firing and laying off employees. After his death, he is confronted by god, who is offended at his lack of faith, and with modern humanity in general. Our salary man refuses to acknowledge this being as god. This "god" decides to reincarnate the salaryman in a world filled with suffering, in order to make him have faith. Reborn as Tanya, an orphaned girl in a war torn empire, Tanya joins the military and sets out to secure a safe, behind-the-lines, desk job. Unfortunately, her own competence, aptitude as a combat mage, and "Being-X's" (Tanya refuses to call it god in her mental narrative) meddling, see her sent into front-line combat over and over again. Tanya struggles against "Being-X's" meddling and copes by adopting the same mindset she held in her former life: absolute adherence to the rules of her organization, letter-of-the-law manipulation of said rules, and raw cunning.

So overall, not quite rationalist (Being-X seems to be short of an all-knowing god and might have been deceived if Tanya could learn to lose and would fake faith; Tanya often overthinks things and reads to much into her superior's comments, leading to her misinterpreting voluntary missions as demands), but certainly a lot of thinking and planning on the main character's part.
