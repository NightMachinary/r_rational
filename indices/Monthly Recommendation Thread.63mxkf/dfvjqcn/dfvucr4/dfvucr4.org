I'm not going to say if any of the following are rational or not. They are simply stories that I particularly enjoyed reading.

One Piece

Don't really read any Bleach or Hellsing fanfics. Can you recommend a few for me?

EDIT: I completely forgot about this Bleach fanfic, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-destiny-of-strife-a-hollows-quest-bleach.29076/][A Destiny of Strife]]. It's a quest where the players control a Hollow and there's very little overlap with the canon events of Bleach (even though they are still happening) which is why it sometimes feels like an original work. It's very far along with a very rapid update pace.
