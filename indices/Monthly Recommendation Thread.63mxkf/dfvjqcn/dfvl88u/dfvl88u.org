My favourite Bleach fanfic is ... not really rationalist in any way, and I really can't make an unqualified recommendation of it. I am totally aware that it will not be everyone's cup of tea. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10572048/1/Walk-Two-Lifetimes][Walk Two Lifetimes]] is a SI type of thing with a fairly Mary-Sue-ish main character, like unto such Naruto fics as Dreaming of Sunshine; Inasmuch as it has a plot and tension, it is mostly a romance story. A revised version of the canon Hisana / Byakuya romance is the center of the story. The story goes through some severe tonal changes as the story progresses, starting pretty dark and gritty and moving towards light and wholesomeness and comedy. It's got pretty good writing overall, though.

In a similar boat is Tozette's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8748340/chapters/20054959][Four Body Problem]] where everyone has PTSD from an endless and terrible war, and then a core part of the cast is sent back in time from a dystopic future to the start of Bleach with their mental issues but also their abilities. Then a bunch of comedy, healing, etc occur, with a side order of slightly ambiguous gay romance stuff. Again, /definitely/ not something that will be everyone's cup of tea. Again, not particularly rationalist.

I also liked comedy crossover fic [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443/chapters/11562568][There May Be Some Collateral Damage]] - a HP/Bleach cross where Ichigo ends up guarding Harry Potter. It's basically pure humor/crack, but I enjoyed it a lot without taking it at all seriously.
