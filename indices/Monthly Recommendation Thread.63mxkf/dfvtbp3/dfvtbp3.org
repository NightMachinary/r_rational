So normally I actively avoid deadfics, to the point where I regularly remove fics I liked and followed from my bookmarks because they haven't gotten updated in a few months. However, there's one fic I read in particular despite the fact that it was dead, because it was just so good. That being, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/2354/equestria-total-war][Equestion: Total War]]. If you can't tell from the name, it's an MLP:FiM fic. It's a fascinating depiction of warfare, and I'm just a sucker for darkfics that come from a really lighthearted canon, so long as those darkfics respect the original work.
