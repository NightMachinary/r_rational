I've had the pretty rough couple of weeks, so all my recommendations are mostly comfort food that's helped relax and distract me from my depression and anxiety. They didn't fix any of my problems, but they made the worst days more bearable. Neither of them make any attempt to be rational.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Uncanny-Valley-Tales-Lost-Chronicles/dp/149485287X][The Uncanny Valley]] is a very entertaining anthology of simple horror stories. Normally I only go for psychological and cosmic horror whereas this book leans more towards goofy ghost stories for children, but what sells it for me is the extremely tight pacing. Not one of these stories beats around the bush, the author knows how simple and straightforward these tales are so they all get right to the point without leading you on.

It's one of the easiest reads I've ever had and even when it wasn't scary it never felt disappointing because it was so pleasant to read. I would call it great, but as /just good/ stories go, this does exactly what a /just good/ story should do and delivers on what it promises. It's great if you want to read something simple and entertaining or give a child something that's just the right amount of creepy for them.

[[https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On][K-On!]] (first season) is definitely not for everyone, but for someone who needed something mindless to calm me down it was perfect. It exists purely to show cute anime girls hanging out and having a good time, with very little emotional or intellectual depth, but it's well executed for what it is. The animation is excellently directed with a surprising amount of visual storytelling, the characters are charming, the writing consistently made me smile or chuckle, and what little plot there is has good pacing.
