Hi, I would like to join the Discord channel if possible, but the link you posted here has expired, and there doesn't immediately seem to be one on the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] main page. Is there any chance you could send me another, please?

As a side-note, I just recently listened to your work on the HPMoR podcast. I thought all of it was excellent, especially Instruments of Destruction. I look forward to discovering more of your work!
