Your experience suggests that [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] is not, in fact, the sort of community that you're looking for. As is said in that community's sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  Fic submissions belong in the Weekly Sticky Submitting a Fic to the main page of this subreddit is considered self-promotion.

  Posting to the appropriate participation thread, most notably the Weekly Fic Showcase sticky, will keep the sub uncluttered and your fic on the front page for longer.

Why are you looking to a particular community for something that community is unwilling to give? Have you suggested to the mods that they hold a weekly recommendations thread, where people can request recommendations? When you go looking for fanfic recs, do you only post in [[/r/fanfic][r/fanfic]], or do you also post in fandom-specific subreddits?

Have you discovered archiveofourown.org's site search?
