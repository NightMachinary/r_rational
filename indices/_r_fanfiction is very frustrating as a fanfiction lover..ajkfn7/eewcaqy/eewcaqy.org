I'm removing this post as off-topic. This isn't the place to talk about other subreddits, especially if it's just to complain about how they're doing things or the views that their subs hold. Feel free to repost this in the Friday Open Thread tomorrow, which would be a more appropriate place for discussion, or visit [[https://discord.gg/5sutD3W][our Discord channel]].

(A similar post that was about how [[/r/worldbuilding]] or [[/r/magicbuilding]] is a good resource for [[/r/rational]] writers would be less off-topic.)
