I'll give a summary a shot.

The world runs on mana and elementals. Tinkers have constructed mechs capable of performing everyday tasks like hauling as well as more advanced ones like racing and fighting.

One tinker, Peter Tinkersmith, creates a mech capable of rearranging the runes that compose its brain in order to emulate a huge variety of different specialised mech functions, essentially granting it sapience.

Peter is killed by an explosion in his lab while his daughter (Jess) and the mech (Rob, possibly a joke about "Rob-ot") are out. The elaborate system of elementals and mana containment systems was circumvented; it was murder, probably by somebody who wants to harvest the mana from his aborted potential or perhaps cares about the impact of a universal problem-solver on the mech market.

Now a teenage girl and her mech "brother" are trying to survive and perhaps retaliate against an unknown foe in a world where murderbots are not only a thing, they're something people could build as a hobby.

If Rob ever runs out of mana, his processing core (brain, esssentially) resets; functionally, Rob dies and a new sapient mech with no experience is born. Unfortunately, Rob's processor core uses a staggering amount of mana, costing tens of thousands of marks; something which is hard to pay for when you have no formal training or history of work.

The quickest way to make that money is betting on a mech fight or race, preferably one you're in yourself. There's only so long you can do that before you die or become so successful that dangerous people start to take notice.
