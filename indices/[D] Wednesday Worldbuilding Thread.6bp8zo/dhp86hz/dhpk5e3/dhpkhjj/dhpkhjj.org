Yeah. I see the masquerade as something that's slowly falling apart as the vampires try to keep it cobbled together. A big catastrophe c. 1600 resulted in vampires becoming part of the common consciousness (before 1600 the vampire myth didn't really exist). So I'd imagine by 2050 vampires are "out of the coffin" so to speak.

My guess about how vampires "control the internet" would be that in the 1980s/early 90s, vampire doomsayers started pointing out the terrifying potential of the internet, and enough listened and got themselves involved in ISPs/etc that they are, for now, able to control what information is shared on the internet - they probably have many people working around the clock in Indonesia, Philippines, etc responding to data leaks that are picked up in languages that the workers do not speak, perhaps in shifts with content filtering and captcha-reading so that way nobody catches on.

But it becomes a more and more impossible task for them as more and more people use the internet, the dark web, etc. So the masquerade is going to fail - I just want it to last through the 2020s so I don't have to set my story in the '90s.

So the "light web" would be under control of vampires (and other supernatural creatures - there's dozens), /for now/, but Slayers would almost certainly have a network on the dark web that the vampires periodically infiltrate and scrub clean as best they can (likely not very well based on my limited understanding on the dark web, but they could use a compromised Slayer to leak bad information).
