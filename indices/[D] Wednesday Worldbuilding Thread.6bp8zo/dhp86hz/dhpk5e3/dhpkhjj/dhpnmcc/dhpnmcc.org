Hard to believe the vampires can systematically scrub the internet clean. But whenever I find myself building up an elaborate fictional infrastructure in order to prevent something some happening, I try to ask myself, does this actually need to be prevented? Usually stories are at their most compelling when they follow their premises to their logical conclusion, not rejigger the premises until they lead to the desired conclusion.

Are you sure it isn't perfectly acceptable to have a subculture on the internet that's aware of the vampires' existence? They can't do outreach effectively, because the moment they do anything in the "real world" they get killed. The media reports on it in the "Arts & Culture" section, how quaint, a modern revival of vampire myths.

The heroes see a vampire, but before going to the cops, make a quick google search to confirm they aren't crazy. The first thing they read is: don't go to the police, that's how the vampires find you. Also, start running, because there are vampires at google monitoring the relevant search terms. The vampire slayers don't find the protagonists, the protagonists find them.

Might be an interesting dynamic if instead of a faraway vampire-hunting team, they're learning the ropes from a vampire message board on the internet, though I'm not sure that's the story you want to tell.

An interesting idea, though which would probably not work well in the context of an actual story: As the masquerade loosens, the vampires impose a new rule: to ensure everyone's contributing to the communal need to maintain secrecy, the only "legitimate" prey are humans aware of the masquerade. This incentivizes vampires to hunt them down as effectively as possible, while in turn, limiting possibility for new exposure.
