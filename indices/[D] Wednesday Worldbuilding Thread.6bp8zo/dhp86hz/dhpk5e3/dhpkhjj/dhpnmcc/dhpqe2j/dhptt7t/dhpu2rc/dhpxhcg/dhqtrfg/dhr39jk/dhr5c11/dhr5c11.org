Haha, I always forget about the bat thing even though it's a perfect deus ex machina for all situations.

I'm not sure if a staked vampire shows up in an MRI as a mutilated corpse: I suppose it would, but it would be /weird/. Blood through the lungs, the alveoli look different, the digestive system seems to be full of putrified... gunk, like they had some horrific disease. Like, I can't imagine how vampire bodies doing what we've established that they do wouldn't show up in a high enough resolution scan, y'know? It might be more likely to have a doctor think there's an unidentified disease than supernatural forces at work, though.
