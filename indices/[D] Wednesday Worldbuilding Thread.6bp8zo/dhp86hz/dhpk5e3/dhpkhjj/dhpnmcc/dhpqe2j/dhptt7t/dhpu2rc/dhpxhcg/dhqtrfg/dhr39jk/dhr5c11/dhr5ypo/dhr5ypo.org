Well, unless the doctor's already in on the secret, the vampire looks just like a corpse at first. Then he sees the MRI, and it's just /weird/, as you point out...

...but unless he's already halfway to believing the story already, he's going to be looking for cause-of-death and all the weirdness is more easily explained as some strange mutilation, side-effects of some poison he's never seen, or (as you point out) strange disease, than as being a monster out of mythology. (Right until the 'corpse' gets up and rips his head off, which will happen as soon as he pulls the stake out and puts it in a little evidence bag for the police to take a look at).
