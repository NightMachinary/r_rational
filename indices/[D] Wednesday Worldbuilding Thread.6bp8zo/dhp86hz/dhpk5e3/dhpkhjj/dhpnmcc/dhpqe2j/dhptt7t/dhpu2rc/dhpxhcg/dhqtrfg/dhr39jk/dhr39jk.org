(a) if your cage has a single hole in it small enough for a bat, you're dead; (b) if your cage can be made to have a single hole in it the size of a bat by means of vampire strength, you're dead; and (c) you would have to take the vampire out of the cage to put him through the MRI machine, at which point you're dead. (I'm assuming a staked vampire shows up in a MRI as a rather strangely mutilated corpse).
