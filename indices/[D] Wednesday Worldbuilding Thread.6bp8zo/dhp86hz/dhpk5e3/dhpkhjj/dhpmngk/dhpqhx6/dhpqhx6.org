I'm hoping you mean fantastic as in "good", not fantastic as in "unbelievable", because I am honoured by that compliment!

Yep, the Bad Thing happened in Eastern Europe, around the year 1500-1600. Not sure what it was yet.

I realised that the vampire myth being new and vampires being old needed an explanation and at the same time realised that my conception of vampire society was a population of 10,000 people with 1,000 of them being over 500 years of age and the other 9,000 being in the 0-300 range.... which fit perfectly with the year 1500-1600.

Not sure what I want the Catastrophe to be. I've more or less decided that the Elders were all friends or colleagues at the time, and that they've all mutually kept to secrecy.

My favoured Catastrophe is, in VERY broad strokes, that a very old vampire managed to get all his ducks in a row and "take over the vampire world", he did some terribly unpopular things. He either did genocide on all the other vampires, and the Elders are his former allies, one of whom killed Very Old Vampire to bring about a new, fragile peace; or he was just being terrible, the Elders are his former opponents, who committed genocide on the Very Old Vampire and everyone who supported him (and for some reason he was popular with young vampires).

I'll probably change my mind about seventeen times and ultimately go with a plague, a fight with a different supernatural species, or just a particularly bad period of sunspots...
