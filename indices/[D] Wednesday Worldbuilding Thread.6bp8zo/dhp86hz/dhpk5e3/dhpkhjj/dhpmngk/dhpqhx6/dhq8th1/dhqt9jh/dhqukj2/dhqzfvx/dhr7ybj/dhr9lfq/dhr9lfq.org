I'm not sure I follow - you're saying the Old One is a vampire who is self-loathing, essentially, and thinks he should kill his fellow vampires? And the reason he's successful is because he /also/ happens to be old, or have some sort of power? May as well skip the middle man and just have a powerful human mage decide to go on a vampire-killin' spree...

It looks like if we have the Catastrophe reducing the vampire population to 1,000, and a population of ~7,000 vampires today, that the issue is finding ways to raise the vampire population enough, necessitating vampires who crank out new children as often as they can manage...
