  Searching for something maybe? Unless you need it to be specifically relevant to the plot, I'm not sure how much work needs to go into exploring the motives of someone who lived 400 years ago and probably died without explaining himself to anyone.
#+end_quote

It's the sort of thing that might come up in the society: for example, if he was getting revenge for a dead ex-lover, vampires might start hiding their social relationships from public eye. If he was looking for a magical artefact, the vampires might have made a pact to destroy all artefacts as soon as they are discovered. It's helpful to come up with a vague idea, you know?

#+begin_quote
  If you plug in 50 years for that, you get the population of vampires (before deaths from Slayers or failure to birth or simply not trying to have a kid) being 256 times whatever it was at the time of the catastrophy. That gives you (assuming 1,000 surviving vampires in 1600) about a quarter million vampires today, or one vampire for every 30,000 people. That's reasonable, but probably at the high end (particularly if you want to have Mages or Fae or Werewolves).
#+end_quote

Yeah, we've got mages and werewolves and all sorts of other wonderful critters. Werewolves are probably at the 1 in 50,000 benchmark in terms of apparent population density (and that's just people who are /currently/ werewolves, not including people who are yet-to-be-so...), though Our City has a special reason for werewolves to congregate there. (Essentially, think of werewolves as analogous to monks: there's a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Norcia,_Western_Australia][monastery]] that many werewolves live in, and it may be the only one of its kind in the country or even region).

But werewolves are almost entirely benevolent: very loving, supportive, nurturing society. Not proper pacifists but pacifist-adjacent at least. Two main werewolf characters are a lawyer who specialises in the supernatural (she's actually an ex-werewolf, but I don't want to go into that), and a veterinarian that has not had much character development - he was kind of created to be the OTP of another character so he may not even appear.

But I digress!

#+begin_quote
  Working backwards from the one-in-a-million figure, we get 6,000 living vampires today. That's between two and three doublings from the 1,000 in 1600 figure, implying that vampires can create a child somewhere between every 100 years (with a relatively high loss rate) or 150 years (with a relatively low one).
#+end_quote

I think we're probably looking at 25-50 years as the time between births with a lot of "promiscuous" vampires, since my main vampire is 1500 years old and hasn't even /considered/ making a childe. So I'd imagine there'd be a lot of variance in terms of individuals. Or that it's very common for a ~50 years dead vampire to go through a "mid life crisis" as people around them start dying, and then create a childe so they'll have someone with them always, or similar. Maybe a subfaction of vampires who are like the quiverful movement and believe that having a lot of children is good.

#+begin_quote
  It's worth noting that the decisive factor here is to a very large degree early survival. You can support even very high "birth" rates if vampires die within their first few nights most of the time. If you can make a new vampire every 25 years, but 75% of them die before they make a new one, that's pretty close to making a new vampire every 100 years.
#+end_quote

Baby vampires are actually pretty "safe" in that they haven't developed a lot of vampire weaknesses yet: they can go out in the sun with complete impunity to begin with, though once they've rounded out their first year sun exposure becomes almost certain death and they're barely able to stay awake when the sun is up. I guess you could call it vampire puberty.

    It's about a pint every 2 or 3 days.
  #+end_quote

  That's about the general blood donation level (I assume intentionally).
#+end_quote

Yep.

#+begin_quote
  It does mean vampires need some means of hiding their feeding. That's a /lot/ of blood loss victims (I think, I'm not going so far as to look up crime stats).
#+end_quote

Well, if you're only taking a pint every month or two, there's probably no reason to report it.

#+begin_quote
  Fortunately, there are a bunch of ways to do that. You could use mind magic to stop people from reporting crimes, control the police to stop the government from caring, or just rob blood banks and not worry about attacking people at all.
#+end_quote

They can't rob blood banks: vampires excrete waste products into the human blood stream as they feed, so they are dependent on the physical act of feeding (no /true blood/ for our guys!).

That said, it does have an upside: these waste products are nootropic and highly addictive. If a vampire feeds from you, you don't need much sleep, your senses are sharper, your memory is better, etc. These effects last about a month and then the withdrawals start. So a vampire will have a "herd" of people who feed them regularly - we call them janissaries. These janissaries can be addicted to the feeding process itself (it's highly pleasurable), or can be students, CEOs, etc looking for an edge over the competition. This allows the vampire-human relationship to have an element of mutualism in it.

It also means that these janissaries can be placed into positions of power like in the press, police force, etc - after all, they're /better/.

#+begin_quote
  This just seems either way better (if the copy has my memories) or way worse (if the copy is an infant) than creating normal vampires to me. Also, this has to share the same cooldown as normal spawning or things go insane. If you can make a copy of you every month, and that copy is also a superpowered badass, someone is going to do that and shortly thereafter conquer the world.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I think I'm erring on the side of "infant copy" or "memories when turned" side. The infant copy wouldn't be a proper infant, though - it's never going to "grow up", it just has a brain that never had its neural network properly trimmed to allow it to perform any useful actions. It's stuck forever unable to do so much as stand or eat. /Thank goodness/ it doesn't need to breathe.

Also, you don't need to wait a month between copies. Open your chest, cut half of your heart out, get a scalpel and make a thousand little pieces. Separate them a bit, and you'll have a thousand clones (assuming you're in a ventilated place that isn't at absolute 0: the raw materials and energy to build the body come from the air).

So, um, in light of that - we're probably going to have to stick with the infant brain. Even a naive human that has just been turned would be too powerful if the wrong person can make a thousand of them.

  how is there any kind of supernatural society if the supernatural population of Chicago can all fit in a highschool classroom together
#+end_quote

They send letters, and non-vampire supernaturals have access to a pocket dimension that is essentially a second planet where they can hang out. A centaur on earth is either on holiday or a weirdo who isn't staying on his own planet.

Here's a little excerpt from my story about letters, if you care to read it. Completely devoid of any context, too!

#+begin_quote
  Erlis, the vampire Duke in charge of the town of Columbus, had been receiving letters from King William of New Holland since long before Red had returned to his family home. The letters had started out as the casual probes that one often received from strangers. Erlis had thought himself lucky that a king - especially one as aged as William - had taken an interest in him and his lands.

  It was widely known that William and the Queen of Atlanta had been lovers long ago, and Erlis had assumed his had been part of a more generalised flurry of letters that William was sending to Dukes around the country before he paid her a visit. But when Erlis got a letter in May that announced the imminent arrival of a Reginald Dubois, he realised that William's attentions had been specific.

  The letter stated in no uncertain terms that Reginald Dubois was a janissary of William's and was so not to be interfered with. This came on the heels of his scandalous defeat in war by Duchess Elodia of Genoa. Rumour had it that William had fought Elodia to spare the life of a human servant. Erlis wondered if this Reginald Dubois could be the human in question. Had William sent that servant away to Columbus and given Elodia a substitute to execute in his place? If such a subterfuge was discovered, the scandal would burn still hotter.

  William wrote Erlis frequent letters, speaking mostly of alliances, of current events, and of scandals that weren't his own and occasionally including gifts that were slightly more extravagant than necessary. He would always include questions about his janissary.

  At first, he tried to make the questions sound as though they were asked to evaluate Erlis's ability to run the town. But as dozens and dozens of letters were exchanged, they became impassioned and personal: questions about whether Red was happy, whether he had any interest in the local wildlife, and even a few thinly veiled inquiries into whether he was courting anybody.

  If Erlis had a different sort of character, he would have used this knowledge to ingratiate himself with Elodia and her allies. If he played his cards right, he could use those bonds to gain control over a European town more prestigious than an industrial city in Ohio.

  Erlis was an ambitious vampire, but his ambitions were grander than that.
