  Brother Michael is clever and starts out meddling in politics, causing some powerful ones to fight to the death and all
#+end_quote

Well, of course. He also does the whole guerrilla warfare thing - whereby a small, well-coordinated force completely decimates a larger force by simply continually hitting where the larger force is weak, grabbing a quick victory, and vanishing before it can be made to pay for that victory. He's probably killed off dozens of vampires before anyone can figure out who it is that's doing all the vampire-killing in the first place.

  Instead of killing the Abbot, Brother Michael /converts him/ - and doubtless several others

Okay, this is a really good idea. (Though I'm thinking Brother Michael and his group are more the Spanish Inquisition type than anything else, and they probably watch their own group extremely closely for signs of 'heresy').

  Vampire duplication (discussed at length in another sub-thread of the crazy branching tree this post has become), /actually does make you a full copy of yourself when you were turned./
#+end_quote

...okay, this also works. It works especially well for Brother Micheal, because he (when he was turned) was just a few quick words away from deciding to kill all vampires. And, being a young vampire, he doesn't suffer from fish-out-of-temporal-water syndrome. (An ancient vampire who tries this now ends up with a duplicate who still thinks of a 'hard drive' as a long journey in a carriage and quite possibly hasn't even heard of America).
