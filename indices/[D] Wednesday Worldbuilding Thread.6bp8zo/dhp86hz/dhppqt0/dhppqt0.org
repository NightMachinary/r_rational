  Our Hero takes it to her police boss, who says, "I've noticed this sort of stuff too, but I've also noticed that whenever anyone notices this stuff, they wind up brain dead after a convenient car accident, so I've just come to accept we're not meant to know about it"

How about Our Hero goes to her boss... and he turns out to be the only Slayer in the city? (Of course she didn't know about it, he keeps it a /secret/)

Or she goes to her boss... and he nods, smiles, and quietly talks her into an appointment with the therapist to deal with these paranoid delusions. And then the therapist is a Slayer. Or, perhaps, his /receptionist/ is a Slayer, looking out for anyone who's seen enough to put themselves in danger.

In short, to have a nearby lone Slayer, who knows just enough to pass on a few warnings and keeps himself in a position where he's likely to meet anyone else who runs into any evidence of vampires. (He doesn't do any Slay/ing/ himself - his job as gatekeeper and warner-away is too important to risk such exposure).
