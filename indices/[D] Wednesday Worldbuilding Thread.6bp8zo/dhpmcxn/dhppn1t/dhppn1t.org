What if you don't start with a rookie, but with a complete outsider? Say, the story starts with the protagonist being found somewhere in the Dungeon, with no memory of how they got there.

It does raise an equally good question (why don't the trained soldiers just instantly eliminate what is either a monster perfectly imitating a human or a horrible breach of security?), but it allows you to have a true novice for the reader to buy into if you can justify that.

It also allows you a lot of latitude with the reason the protagonist ended up in there. Were they created ex nihilo by the Dungeon or something in it? Kidnapped by some interplanar monster? Touched an artifact that had somehow escaped military control? Abducted by a rogue faction of Dungeon-cultists (Lovecraft-style)? An amnesiac soldier?

And there's the additional problem: what if the protagonist isn't unique, and lots of people are inexplicably ending up in the Dungeon? Does the carefully constructed conspiracy start to fall apart, or do they step up their efforts in ways that may not be palatable?
