I have been looking at the [[https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?391379-setting-riff-Voices-From-Below-and-the-Long-Stairs][Long Stairs]] (informal) setting, whose basic conceit I really like; there's a hole punched in reality which leads to a vast and terrifying D&Desque Dungeon. The military controls it and regularly sends teams in to delve it for the impossible magic it offers our world.

Other bits I am less enamored with, especially the idea that this a result of nuclear testing and all nuclear nations have their own Dungeons. And anything that requires a full-on global conspiracy to work gets me more interested in the conspiracy aspect than whatever that conspiracy is trying to hide, so I'd probably keep the Dungeon as isolated and ultra top secret as possible so it can be covered by regular old opsec. And I would probably try to add in as much of an SCP vibe as possible, though with an undercurrent of that humanity, fuck yeah sentiment (in other words, there's this giant, terrifying thing that we don't seem to be equipped to deal with or understand, but we're going to try, dammit, because we're not content to just roll over and die).

The natural, easy start to a story is to follow a rookie going on his first delve with a colorful cast of characters as they explain the ins and outs of the Dungeon and its inhabitants. Of course, in the real world you'd throw a mile of classified reading material at someone first, assuming that delves were a regular thing, and while an ensemble cast which closely resembles a typical D&D party is great for stories, I have a hard time imagining that would actually fly if you were running something approximating a military operation. (Though I guess there are some historical examples to draw from, and the best argument against carefully planned and defined expeditions is that these don't actually work for whatever reason.)
