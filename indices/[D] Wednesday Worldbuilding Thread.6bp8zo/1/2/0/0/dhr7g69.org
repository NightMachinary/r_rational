Hmmm. As another possibility; every time someone goes down the stairs, he ends up in the same room he always does - but that room is not the same for everybody. So Thomas, going downstairs, always ends up in Room A; but if James goes downstairs, he always ends up in Room B, which may or may not be anywhere close to room A. (If multiple people go down the stairs at once, then they either take their eyes off each other for a moment - at which point they each abruptly find themselves alone on the stairs - or the stairs simply never end).

Then your ragtag bunch of heroes is simply a group of people who started with the same or nearby Downstairs rooms.

(Perhaps you can change your Downstairs room by going to someone else's Downstairs room and heading up the stairs from there. Or perhaps that has a chance of you ending up in the Russian facility... either way, if everyone leaves a small transmitter on a unique frequency at the base of their stairs, then it's possible for one person with the right equipment to tell which direction and how far other peoples' stairs are. Of course, it's equally possible for the Russian team to then pick up where your stairs are...)
