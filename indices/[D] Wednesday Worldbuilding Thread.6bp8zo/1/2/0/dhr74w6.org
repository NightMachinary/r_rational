I don't like dipping into the narrativium well too often; to me it can be really easy for a story to cross the line into "it's this way because it's a story, deal with it".

I'd want something more along the lines of an explanation for why the ensemble cast is better, or why proven squad training doesn't actually work in this environment. At a first pass:

- Success relies on ingenuity, improvisation, and adaptation, making drills less worthwhile (or actively detrimental)
- Magic items are all unique, which means that the tactical considerations of each squad will be (sometimes radically) different.
- The operation is being run as though backs are against the wall, and no one can afford to reprimand or replace seasoned delvers for lack of military decorum, especially if it doesn't matter much in terms of outcomes.
- Psychographic drift occurs after even a single delve, so there's not much point in doing screening beforehand.
- Larger teams have worse outcomes (could come up with a number of reasons for this), until you reach a certain minimum size where you can't cover all the jobs you need.

I'm not a hundred percent sure what the "roles" would be; in D&D it's usually meat shield, damage output, recon, healer, and wizard, with some doubling up depending on the classes involved. In the real world, I guess the equivalent is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireteam][fireteam]]. Mostly I think I would be massaging the Dungeon until doctrine dictated something approaching a ragtag crew.
