Some thoughts:

A mile of classified reading material is likely to be very unhelpful to a dungeon-delving rookie, even a rookie with a highly experienced military background. Military organizations are notorious for insane bureaucracy and labyrinthine paperwork requirements, often enforced by clueless desk-jockeys who outrank you. The difference between the reading material (and the training) and IRL dungeon-delving could easily be played for exposition opportunities.

There are also real-world precedents for teams of five soldiers or fewer, particularly in special forces, recon and similar stuff. Small teams are frequently utilized in urban environments and would be highly suited to a dungeon. These small teams have specialized roles. Examples include medic, sniper, communications, different weapon systems, explosives, leader, driver, speaking the local language... multiple people might have training in an area, so that a soldier could pick up someone else's gun and use it, but not to the point of complete interchangeability.

I can see loads of opportunities that could justify even more diverse hyperspecializations in your setting. Maybe there's at least one person in each team with zero training in magic or using magical artifacts; that way, there's at least one guy left standing when a nearby eldritch horror lets loose a psychic scream in the warp. Maybe sending in a team without a dude with a flamethrower is asking for trouble, given how many things only stop moving when you burn them. Maybe there's always a team member teetering on the brink of magic-induced insanity, because without one you'll never find the most valuable secrets.

As for the 'ragtag bunch of misfits' trope: the military is one of the few real-world contexts where I can see this as being plausible. People from almost any background can join and frequently end up in jobs very different to what they signed up for. I imagine that the teams in your setting would be composed of conscientious, intelligent people without glaringly detrimental personality traits (like proneness to anxiety attacks), but would otherwise be quite diverse.
