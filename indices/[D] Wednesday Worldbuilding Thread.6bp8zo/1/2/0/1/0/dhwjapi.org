Welcome back! Yeah, I've been reading about modern fireteam and squad deployments; it's a lot more common than I had thought. I've also picked up some war memoirs, since I think those will provide some creative fodder (and obviously if I wrote this story I would need to know more about the military anyway).

I'll have to think about the exact nature of magic. I do like the idea that zero wizards is not enough and two is too many, it's just a question of /why/ (wizardry causes insanity, or wizardry attracts monsters, or wizardry is dangerous and unstable, or etc.). But in part the correct justification depends on the shape of the story plot, and I'm not entirely convinced that I actually want to write this story (or rather, I'm convinced that I want to write the story, but there are other things I told myself I would work on).
