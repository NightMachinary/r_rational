  while an ensemble cast which closely resembles a typical D&D party is great for stories, I have a hard time imagining that would actually fly if you were running something approximating a military operation.

What if it's been proven that the dungeon runs on narrativium, that is, the ensemble cast has a far higher probability of success than the trained military team?
