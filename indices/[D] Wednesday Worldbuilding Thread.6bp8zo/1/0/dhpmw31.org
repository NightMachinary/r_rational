Depending on how dangerous an unknown zone is, you might find it more cost effective to send out minimally-prepared teams to scout new areas before you send in the people that you spent more time and resources on.

The Long Stairs takes a lot of inspiration from that style of DnD where anything can kill you, because the coin is a monster, the roof is a monster, the shirt is a monster, and so on, which means that any zone that hasn't been explored is /incredibly/ lethal and, whether you're well trained or not, survival is still mostly a matter of luck.

Well, that and instinct, but it's harder to notice that kind of instinct under controlled conditions than it is to notice it after the fact, because these various people seem to have a knack (which might also be a latent magical talent developed or awakened by exposure to the Dungeon) for not dying.

Anyway, you send in teams of minimally-prepared teams to explore (and /regularly/ radio back information on) new zones, until you have enough information that your better-prepared teams stand a chance of surviving.

Your "typical D&D party" cast of characters belong to the first group, the minimally-prepared folks, but they also have that knack for just barely surviving whatever the Dungeon throws at them (which is how they get to be recurring characters).
