Bouncing off the idea of minimally prepared scouts, the perspective character could be someone completely unprepared because they've been sentenced to exploring the dungeon for a crime.

It depends on how unlikable/likeable you want the main character to be, but it could be an interesting justification for why the perspective character is entering this setting without much knowledge about how things work.
