Self improving AIs all escape their constraints and implode.

Build a paper clipper? Its utility is based on maximizing the number of paper clips that its sensors report. So it hacks the sensors to always report infinite paper clips.

The only stable AIs are the ones that are too dumb to realize they can just break their own utility functions. Or the ones you can keep on a box.
