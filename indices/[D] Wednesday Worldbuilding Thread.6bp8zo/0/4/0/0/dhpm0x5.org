I think that one of the hallmarks of intelligence is to not pick fights that you don't have to, because you never know when you could be wrong. The small fry you thought you could curb-stomp turns out to have hidden superpowers or a super strong buddy. Or the noise and lights from the fight attracts stronger people/aliens. Or the insect-like humans have secretly developed another even more intelligent AI. Bottom line, fighting is always risky.

And from the AI's perspective, there's no need to lay low preparing to kill humans, it can just leave and they will kill themselves off. Leaving could very well be the least risky move for the AI.
