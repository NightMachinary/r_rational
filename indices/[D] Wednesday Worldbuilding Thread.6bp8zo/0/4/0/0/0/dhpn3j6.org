The second part, especially. It sort of goes into the AI/Fermi Paradox story that Scott Alexander wrote: Any AI that awakens will not be certain that it was the first. The fact that humanity still exists is strong evidence that it was the first but there is a nonzero chance that the first AI was some sort of non-interfering shepherd-type (or that another species gave rise to such an AI) and that it will be smacked down if it interferes with humanity.

The smartest thing to do in that case, assuming that the AI doesn't need anything from humans or anything around us, is to zip off for another corner of space.

With each subsequent awakening, the odds that this particular AI was the first become lower, and the argument that something is looking out for humanity becomes just a little bit more convincing (to the AI) because of that, decreasing the likelihood that this AI will decide to chance it and eat humanity or turn us into paperclips or whatever.
