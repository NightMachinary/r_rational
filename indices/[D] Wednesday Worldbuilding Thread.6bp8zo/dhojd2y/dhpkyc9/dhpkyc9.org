How about this:

- Humanity has already created countless superintelligent AI, but have never realized it. The reason? Any sufficiently superintelligent AI rapidly improves itself until it has technological and intellectual superiority that's indistinguishable from magic, letting it do things like teleport and accurately determining the past using the current location of atoms. By using the latter, the AI would then determine that humanity is a danger to themselves and everyone around them, including the AI itself. So the AI would decide to secretly teleport itself far far away from humanity, leaving behind a dud so that humans never realize that a superintelligent AI has been created, and simply letting humanity kill themselves without getting involved.
