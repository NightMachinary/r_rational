There's a roving Gatekeeper that travels from city to city, finding and training stationary Gatekeepers and then keeping contact with them over encrypted emails and dark-net resources. He could well be halfway across the country now, trying to recruit a Gatekeeper someplace else.

An important part of being a Gatekeeper is deliberately pretending you don't know about the supernatural, so as not to attract their attention.

This travelling Gatekeeper can come from any Slayer group, anywhere.

(There's probably more than one roving Gatekeeper. They don't keep in contact with or know anything about each other, so they can't be forced to betray each other, but every now and then they might run into each other.)
