Hmm. It's hard to decide whether the Gatekeeper idea or the "Slayers communicate via the regular internet with LOTS and LOTS of noise" idea is better.

Gatekeeper implies a more robust masquerade which is handy, but regular internet requires vampires to have less angelic powers and Slayers to be far less organised.
