Hmm, I like the idea of a "local" Slayer network - but I worry about things being too convenient. Like, if her boss happens to be the only Slayer - that's a problem.

The boss being part of the general supernatural network is better. I can conceive of Boss being planted by anti-vampire forces to funnel people who discover vampires "through the system" - and either gives them some sort of mind-wipe (to keep them safe), or recruits them. Call him a Gatekeeper.

It's a good one to marinate on - the problem is, if the anti-vampire conspiracy is too large, then we're in trouble - why haven't they used their reach to force the vampires out of the coffin, as humanity has clear advantages in Total War.

That said, perhaps Our City is one of the few places where the anti-vampire resistance is able to grow large enough to be a threat: the local Vampire King has become quite sympathetic to the concept of humans as moral subjects and might have higher thresholds of woke-ness before he kills them, and that might make Our City one of the few places where The Story could be told.

HOWEVER, that lone Slayer - where did /they/ come from? Do we ultimately have something that has been passed down through the generations, and this "Gatekeeper" (or the Gatekeeper that trained him...) was sent to Our City from elsewhere?
