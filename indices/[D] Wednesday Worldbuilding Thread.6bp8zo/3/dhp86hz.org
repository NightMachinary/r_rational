Urban fantasy setting. Although I've not watched it, think /Buffy the Vamprie Slayer/ - two young ladies find out that vampires/etc are real and proceed to Save The Town.

The problem: we want to maintain the masquerade rather than going all-out war where everyone is aware of everyone.

The easiest way to do /that/ is to say that the vampires have eyes and ears everywhere, so if Our Heroes were to report it to the police (and one is a police officer, so they would), the Bad Guys will arrange an /accident/.

So, we more-or-less want them to be discovered, somehow, by a team of Vampire Slayers in a faraway city, who warns them not to go to the media and gives them some basic instructions.

/How the hell can this happen/? Like, logistically? I could see the Slayers having a dark web forum where they share tips, or perhaps having something similar to a Sensate "archipelago" where everyone knows a couple of other people, and if someone goes "bad" the chain is split.

But how do they become known to the faraway Slayers in the first place? Originally we conceived of the whole thing being a Death Note style "higher forces" "choosing" people to "hold the balance", but we decided that we far preferred the idea of "wrong place wrong time" and "stepping up to take responsibility" because it gives the characters more agency.

The obvious answer is that Our Heroes post on Yahoo Answers or whatever saying "does anyone know what the hell this is" and the Slayer Network picks them up, but I think Our Heroes would go to the police before Yahoo Answers. So I'm at a loss.

Ideas for how to deal with this problem or lateral ways to go "around" it instead could be good. (e.g. been considering an alternate way to keep the masquerade: Our Hero takes it to her police boss, who says, "I've noticed this sort of stuff too, but I've also noticed that whenever anyone notices this stuff, they wind up brain dead after a convenient car accident, so I've just come to accept we're not meant to know about it" - but if that happened I can't help but feel the Rational thing to do would be to make up packets full of all the evidence you have and send it as far and wide as you can.....)
