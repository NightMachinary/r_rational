How is the masquerade perpetuated? Sure, a lot of people who discover this die, but that's only if they go to vampire controlled spaces. With the rise of the internet, information got decentralized, so people first reaction will be to go to youtube, to go to forums, to go to chans, to disseminate it in a hundred unstoppable ways. If vampires are always in a position to stop it, what kind of penetration are we talking about here? You get to a problem where there's so many vampires that a masquerade is pointless.
