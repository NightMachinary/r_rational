Yeah, I think evidence can be silenced quite a lot. But once you capture a vampire - and given that staking immobilises without killing, that's going to happen sooner or later - all of a sudden you have VERY compelling evidence provided you can get enough scientists to see the vampire in person.

The fact that in our system you can grow copies of a vampire from small pieces of their hearts (though maybe the Slayers haven't worked this out yet: vampires themselves have only known about it a few centuries) makes it even easier to provide physical proof. Grow a few dozen vampires and have a "sun show" for a series of respectable scientists with media connections. Neil Degrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Richard Dawkins, even magicians like James Randi, Penn Jillette or Banacek - all viable targets.

Maybe if we want to go lofty world-spanning stuff, that's what Our Heroes would become involved in - transporting vampire body doubles around the place to be viewed by whichever respectable scientists will listen, swearing them to secrecy, all to bring out a sudden lifting of the veil and all-out war.

I'd imagine the vampires would be expecting something like this to happen soon. There's probably a bunch of them conspiring how to get the jump on Slayers when it comes out and come clean with humanity.
