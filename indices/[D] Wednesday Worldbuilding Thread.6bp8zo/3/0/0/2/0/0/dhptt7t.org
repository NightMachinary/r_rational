[[/ohcomeon][]] "You call this /evidence?/ These pictures are clearly photoshopped - I don't know who you had doing the special effects on this video, they're really very good, but that's all they are is /special effects/. These old photographs purporting to show the same person cropping up through history are clearly different people who merely look similar - I have a cousin who looks /exactly/ like his father at that age, it means /nothing/ - and this discarded empty blood bag just means he's a creepy guy who steals medical supplies, not a /vampire!/ I mean, honestly, how would you /ever/ reach that conclusion!"
