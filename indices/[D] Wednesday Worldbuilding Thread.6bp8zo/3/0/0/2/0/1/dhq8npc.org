One alternative is to give the heroes some reason not to break the Masquerade either. In Stross's Laundry Files breaking the Masquerade means giving every single person with a computer the ability to call forth Lovecraftian horrors from beyond. Making that not happen is a pretty powerful incentive to keep up the Masquerade, even if you can break it.
