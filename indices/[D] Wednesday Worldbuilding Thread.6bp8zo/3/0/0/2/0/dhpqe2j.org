Hmmm, you make some really compelling points - I especially like the idea of there being an actual vampire subculture on the Internet. Vampires and their patsys would be spreading misinformation by the bucketload, so it wouldn't give Our Heroes the "instant win" button I'd be worried about (e.g. our mythology has vampires weak to gold rather than silver, but vampires propagate the silver myth even to the point of young vampires not being aware that gold burns them, and being too scared of descriptions of silver burns to attempt to test it, though they do eventually either figure it out or have a kindly mentor tell them).

The big issue is Our Heroes have evidence - but I suppose anyone that presents that evidence gets killed, and if they do it on Chans, dark web, etc, the vampires have enough influence to shut some of it down and discredit the stuff that survives by alleging it's all a slick photoshop job.
