  I'm not sure I follow - you're saying the Old One is a vampire who is self-loathing, essentially, and thinks he should kill his fellow vampires?

...let me explain by presenting a full-fledged scenario instead of merely a vague idea.

Brother Micheal is a monk. A small monk, in a small out-of-the-way Catholic monastery, somewhere in the early 1600s. Several of the monks have, in the past, made mention of feeling light-headed but amazingly clear-headed. The Abbot is unconcerned, in fact (if anything) he seems to think this is in some way a sign of special divine favour. Brother Micheal never seems to experience this, but he nonetheless holds his own in the monks' philosophical debates.

Now, as it happens, the Abbot is /not/ Catholic. He is a vampire, and the monastery is his private feeding ground. Brother Michael is an exception to the rule (of monks being used for food) - he somehow impressed the Abbot early on, and the Abbot is planning on turning him into a vampire. He can already keep up with the jannissaries mentally, he's obedient and respectful to the Abbot, and he works hard in the monastery's small fields to grow food for the monks. So, in the fullness of time, the Abbot turns him into a vampire, then reveals to Brother Michael the truth of the monastery.

But, in this, the Abbot has made a grave error; for Brother Michael's loyalty is not to the Abbot. Brother Michael's loyalty is to the /church/. And the Abbot has just revealed to Brother Michael how he, the Abbot, has betrayed the church over an extremely long period for mere personal gain.

Brother Michael has no special powers, beyond what is normal for a young vampire. But he has no special powers in the same way as Batman has no special powers. (And that's not his only similarity to Batman). Taking the example of the Abbot, he sees vampires as some form of demon - the very antithesis of what the church stands for. Rightly or wrongly, he also decides that it is his place in life to purge the world of this evil.

His exact methods are... well, I haven't thought that far. But imagine he has planning abilities on par with Batman, plus he's smart enough to go for other vampires when they least expect him, and to keep his identity well hidden for a very long time. He worries that he will eventually, inevitably fall and become but another demon walking the face of the Earth, so he prays often and keeps himself surrounded by the trappings of his faith (which gives a possible reason for the more elderly modern vampires to twitch slightly at the sight of a cross - not because it's lethal to them, but because they remember when it was worn by someone who was /very/ lethal to them).

Or, of course, you could just make the Catastrophe a human mage, that also works.
