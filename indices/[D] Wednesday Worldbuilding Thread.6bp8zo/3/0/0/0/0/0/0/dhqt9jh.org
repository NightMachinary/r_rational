Yeah, and Old One waking up is definitely a great option - I even more-or-less have An Unimaginably Old Vampire living in the pocket dimension that the centaurs, krackens, etc are all native to, so that's pretty convenient.

Just got two main issues with that:

- The Catastrophe happens to vampires everywhere: The Old One would need to reduce the vampire population /throughout the entire world/, which seems like a lot to ask of him. I suppose he can wreck shit up in Europe, killing all the vampires there, and the vampires who survived were in Asia/Africa/Australia/Americas.

- Most/all the young vampires need to die during the Catastrophe: I conceive of a world where 75% of the vampires over 500 years in age are over 1000 years in age. Maybe the Elders who survived did some unspeakable genocide in a food shortage?

It's hard to imagine a moustache-twirling Old One who'd want to do something that would leave the world as I describe it above. That's why I'm considering a masquerade breach followed by a mage developing a plague - young vampires are weaker and would naturally be more susceptible, though I'm not sure how we can say the Elders survived it - just luck seems a bit gauche.

I also imagine the pre-1600s masquerade was easier to keep with communication being slower and it being easier to kill people without drawing attention to yourselves. The vampire population may well have been smaller then in absolute size, too.

Then again, maybe not. I imagine a 1:1,000,000 ratio of vampire:prey now, but I like to think that's artificially small because the population is still recovering from its bottleneck (also, vampires haven't QUADRUPLED their population in the last 100 years as humans have). A 1:12 ratio of vampire:prey is the very limit of sustainability, so there's no reason in the ancient world the vampire:prey ratio couldn't have been 1:100,000 or even 1:10,000.

World population in 1600 was ~500 million, so the ratio was definitely higher if I want 1,000 old vampires to have survived that bottleneck. Then again: a 1:10,000 ratio gives us 50,000 vampires, which is only 5x what we have in the present day despite being an "all-time high". I might reduce the modern vampire population and give the ancient world a 1:100,000 ratio...
