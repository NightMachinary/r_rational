So before this Catastrophe, vampires managed to keep secret, right?

That presumably means there was some kind of masquerade in place beforehand. So for the Catastrophe, I kind of like "a really ancient vampire woke up from hiberation (/a la/ movies like /Blade/ and /Underworld/) and started wrecking shit with no regard for whether or not humans noticed". This is basically what you have, but it also gives you a built-in escalation hook for later on -- one of the Old Ones woke up and is killing people without caring who knows, now the heroes must uneasily team up with their former foes to defeat it.
