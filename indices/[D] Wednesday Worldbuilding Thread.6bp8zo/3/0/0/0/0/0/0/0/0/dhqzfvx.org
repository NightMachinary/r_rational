    The Catastrophe happens to vampires everywhere
  #+end_quote

  Possibilities:

  1. The Old One has some kind of shadow walk/dimensional travel power that lets him travel really quickly.
#+end_quote

The Old One would be able to turn into a bat and travel quickly that way at the very minimum, so that's a possibility. The Old One being motivated to go on a journey and commit genocide is the tricky part, though - like, what would a personality have to be like to want to do that?

#+begin_quote

  1. Vampires from across the globe come together to stop the Old One at some specific battle, lots of them die there.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's probably the most realistic option.

#+begin_quote

  1. A whole crop of ancients comes out of hibernation at once.
#+end_quote

Scary. I like to imagine power scaling somewhat logarithmically with age (so a 500 year old vampire could easily kill 5x100 year old vampires), so the idea of a crop of Old Ones would result in total genocide if that's what they wanted.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Most/all the young vampires need to die during the Catastrophe:
  #+end_quote

  I don't think this /necessarily/ has to happen as a result of violence, or even famine. Depending on how vampire demographics work, you could simply have bell curve shaped mortality rate where you're very likely to hit 1,000 once you've hit 500, but unlikely to hit 500.
#+end_quote

Oh, right. That makes sense. So the 75% of vampires older than 500 being older than 1,000 is because there's only 500 years between 500 and 1000, but there's 1500 years between 1000 and 2500 (a proxy for the "oldest vampire's" age if we assume the 75% figure). So a given vampire over 500 is more likely to be over 1000 than under it. Makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  Basically, older vampires need "more powerful" blood to survive.
#+end_quote

I'm familiar with that and while it works well for them, I'm not sure if I like it for our vampires. Thank you for bringing it up, though: it's so helpful to look at things from multiple angles.

#+begin_quote
  How realistic [different ratios of humans to vampires are] depends on a bunch of things. How hard is it to create a vampire?
#+end_quote

A vampire can only create a child every few years/decades/centuries (not decided), and it's a process that has a high failure rate (20-50%, probably). It's quite involved: the vampire has to drain the human of blood, cut open the chest cavity, find the right artery in the heart, /vomit stinky goo into the artery/, put it all back together as best they can, and apply pressure to the body (bury it / wrap it in cloth), wait a few hours/days, and then all done.

#+begin_quote
  How much blood do vampires need to survive (and why do they need blood at all)?
#+end_quote

It's about a pint every 2 or 3 days. They absorb the blood through their respiratory system as a) it's a far quicker route to the heart than the digestive system is; and b) their digestive system is co-opted for vampire reproduction.

I conceive of vampires as having two elements: mind (brain) and magic (heart). The human blood cells have some sort of ineffable magic quality to them which help to power the vampire's heart.

#+begin_quote
  How effective are Slayers at putting down new vampires?
#+end_quote

New vampires? As in baby vampires? They're stronger than people but quite easy to kill. Once they're 50-100 years old, no mundane human can really hope to hurt them unless they get lucky. I'd expect that Slayers are rare enough throughout history that they don't have much effect, and if they kill a young vampire, the old vampire that created them will likely replace them, assuming their reasons for creating the youngling still stand.

#+begin_quote
  Depending on the answers to those questions, you might expect vampires to return to carrying capacity either very quickly or very slowly.
#+end_quote

They'd return to carrying capacity /extremely/ slowly based on the above. However, there's a few ways we can make them come back quicker:

- A faction of vampires (it only need be small) decides that they need safety through numbers (e.g. to defend against the Old One if he ever comes back), and so they start making new vampires as quickly as they can manage

- You can grow a whole vampire body double from a piece of their heart - and this is foolproof and takes about a month. I'm currently trying to work out whether it's better to have the body double /somehow/ have a snapshot of the original vampire's memories at the point of turning (or the point of the heart sample being taken), or whether it's better for the body double to have a brain that didn't develop properly and thus a helpless "baby" level of cognition and activity. If people grow body doubles deliberately, it might be good to use the "keep memories (somehow)" one, because you could end up with a good chunk of the vampire population being made of doubles. Big Problem: I originally conceived of the double as being as powerful as the vampire they budded off of, but we could just as easily have them be as powerful as a neonate.

#+begin_quote
  Also bear in mind that at a 1:1,000,000 vampire/human ratio you need a McGuffin like the Hellmouth to explain why there are any meaningful number of vampires in the town where the action takes place. [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_Metropolitan_Statistical_Areas][Wikipedia]] says there are only two (almost three) metro areas that support a double digit number of vampires with those numbers. I guess I don't know what you're going for, but if you want anything like /Buffy/ or /Supernatural/ (where the protagonists can fight several vampires or other baddies in a small town), those numbers have to be at least an order of magnitude more dangerous.
#+end_quote

Nah, not going quite for those levels. I have a town of 3 million as being the main source of action and there are 3 vampires who live there. I'm taking a bit of liberty on the 1:1,000,000 number though as I conceive that there are vampires who live alone in smaller towns (e.g. population of 40,000) - but I'm not particularly married to any of that. There's only one vampire (later two as he creates a childe) in the town that has any level of importance to the plot. It's not a "monster of the week" sort of thing - it's more long-form, Slayer and Mage posture against Vampire and Ghoul with an ensemble cast. It's more of a supernatural romance type thing.

I'm hoping to start posting chapters of the first volume of one novel set in the universe at the beginning of June, but at this point it's in my coauthors hands as she needs to do the final round of editing. However, /that's/ set in WW2 Rome/Corsica mostly, and is a prologue to the Slayer and Mage posture against VAmpire and Ghoul with an ensemble cast story.
