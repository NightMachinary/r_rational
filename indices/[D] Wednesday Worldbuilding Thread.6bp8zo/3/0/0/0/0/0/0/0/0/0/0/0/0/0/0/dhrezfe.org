I'm liking the Brother Michael type of arc quite a bit. I'll let myself ruminate on it for a while.

--------------

Yeah, having Brother Michael do a /Sorcerer's Apprentice/ sounds great in theory, but as another commenter pointed out, it's so easy to munchkin that if we allow vampires access to this power, why is the world not populated by clones, who are continually fracturing in their allegiances and making their own clone armies?
