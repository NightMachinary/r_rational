  The Old One would be able to turn into a bat and travel quickly that way at the very minimum, so that's a possibility. The Old One being motivated to go on a journey and commit genocide is the tricky part, though - like, what would a personality have to be like to want to do that?

Searching for something maybe? Unless you need it to be specifically relevant to the plot, I'm not sure how much work needs to go into exploring the motives of someone who lived 400 years ago and probably died without explaining himself to anyone.

  A vampire can only create a child every few years/decades/centuries (not decided), and it's a process that has a high failure rate (20-50%, probably). It's quite involved: the vampire has to drain the human of blood, cut open the chest cavity, find the right artery in the heart, vomit stinky goo into the artery, put it all back together as best they can, and apply pressure to the body (bury it / wrap it in cloth), wait a few hours/days, and then all done.

Hmm...

So assume vampires can create offspring one cycle after birth. If a vampire makes children as often as possible, the population of vampires will double every "generation" (every time vampires become eligible to make new children).

If you plug in 50 years for that, you get the population of vampires (before deaths from Slayers or failure to birth or simply not trying to have a kid) being 256 times whatever it was at the time of the catastrophy. That gives you (assuming 1,000 surviving vampires in 1600) about a quarter million vampires today, or one vampire for every 30,000 people. That's reasonable, but probably at the high end (particularly if you want to have Mages or Fae or Werewolves).

Working backwards from the one-in-a-million figure, we get 6,000 living vampires today. That's between two and three doublings from the 1,000 in 1600 figure, implying that vampires can create a child somewhere between every 100 years (with a relatively high loss rate) or 150 years (with a relatively low one).

It's worth noting that the decisive factor here is to a very large degree early survival. You can support even very high "birth" rates if vampires die within their first few nights most of the time. If you can make a new vampire every 25 years, but 75% of them die before they make a new one, that's pretty close to making a new vampire every 100 years.

  It's about a pint every 2 or 3 days. They absorb the blood through their respiratory system as a) it's a far quicker route to the heart than the digestive system is; and b) their digestive system is co-opted for vampire reproduction.

That's about the general blood donation level (I assume intentionally). A human can give that every eight weeks (per [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Blood_donation][Wikipedia]], though that's a law rather than a biological constraint), which means you'd need around 22 people to support a single vampire. That's reasonable given the number of vampires you're postulating, though it does mean vampires need some means of hiding their feeding. That's a /lot/ of blood loss victims (I think, I'm not going so far as to look up crime stats). Fortunately, there are a bunch of ways to do that. You could use mind magic to stop people from reporting crimes, control the police to stop the government from caring, or just rob blood banks and not worry about attacking people at all.

  You can grow a whole vampire body double from a piece of their heart - and this is foolproof and takes about a month. I'm currently trying to work out whether it's better to have the body double somehow have a snapshot of the original vampire's memories at the point of turning (or the point of the heart sample being taken), or whether it's better for the body double to have a brain that didn't develop properly and thus a helpless "baby" level of cognition and activity. If people grow body doubles deliberately, it might be good to use the "keep memories (somehow)" one, because you could end up with a good chunk of the vampire population being made of doubles. Big Problem: I originally conceived of the double as being as powerful as the vampire they budded off of, but we could just as easily have them be as powerful as a neonate.

This just seems either way better (if the copy has my memories) or way worse (if the copy is an infant) than creating normal vampires to me. Also, this has to share the same cooldown as normal spawning or things go insane. If you can make a copy of you every month, and that copy is also a superpowered badass, someone is going to do that and shortly thereafter conquer the world.

  Nah, not going quite for those levels. I have a town of 3 million as being the main source of action and there are 3 vampires who live there. I'm taking a bit of liberty on the 1:1,000,000 number though as I conceive that there are vampires who live alone in smaller towns (e.g. population of 40,000) - but I'm not particularly married to any of that. There's only one vampire (later two as he creates a childe) in the town that has any level of importance to the plot. It's not a "monster of the week" sort of thing - it's more long-form, Slayer and Mage posture against Vampire and Ghoul with an ensemble cast. It's more of a supernatural romance type thing.

That's a whole lot easier to do with those numbers. It does raise some issues (for example, how is there any kind of supernatural society if the supernatural population of Chicago can all fit in a highschool classroom together), but it avoids the problems you'd have in something like /Buffy/ where one or more vampires is expected to be offed every episode.
