  The Catastrophe happens to vampires everywhere: The Old One would need to reduce the vampire population throughout the entire world, which seems like a lot to ask of him. I suppose he can wreck shit up in Europe, killing all the vampires there, and the vampires who survived were in Asia/Africa/Australia/Americas.

Possibilities:

1. The Old One has some kind of shadow walk/dimensional travel power that lets him travel really quickly.
2. Vampires from across the globe come together to stop the Old One at some specific battle, lots of them die there.
3. A whole crop of ancients comes out of hibernation at once.

Those all have advantages and disadvantages. Or, as mentioned, he can kill off all (or almost all) the European vampires, leaving Asian or African vampires to move in.

  Most/all the young vampires need to die during the Catastrophe: I conceive of a world where 75% of the vampires over 500 years in age are over 1000 years in age. Maybe the Elders who survived did some unspeakable genocide in a food shortage?

I don't think this /necessarily/ has to happen as a result of violence, or even famine. Depending on how vampire demographics work, you could simply have bell curve shaped mortality rate where you're very likely to hit 1,000 once you've hit 500, but unlikely to hit 500.

  It's hard to imagine a moustache-twirling Old One who'd want to do something that would leave the world as I describe it above.

You could borrow something like White Wolf's Blood Potency/War of Ages scheme (note: this may bear no relation to anything White Wolf printed, I am vaguely recalling a discussion someone had about fixing those mechanics). Basically, older vampires need "more powerful" blood to survive.

Your basic fresh-out-the-grave vampire can feed off normal humans non-lethally. Older vampires can only get sustenance out of humans by killing them (drinking the heart's blood). /But/, they can feed safely off of regular vampires. Even older vampires have to feed off of middle aged ones to feed safely. And so on up as vampires get older and older. This has the convenient side effect of explaining both why the Old One needs to kill all the vampires he can find (otherwise he starves), and why there are so few vampires in the 500 - 1000 age range (vampire society can only support so many members in that age range, and the older ones don't go quietly). It also creates a bunch of opportunities for tension and factional politics between vampires.

  Then again, maybe not. I imagine a 1:1,000,000 ratio of vampire:prey now, but I like to think that's artificially small because the population is still recovering from its bottleneck (also, vampires haven't QUADRUPLED their population in the last 100 years as humans have).

Maybe? How realistic that is depends on a bunch of things. How hard is it to create a vampire? How much blood do vampires need to survive (and why do they need blood at all)? How effective are Slayers at putting down new vampires? Depending on the answers to those questions, you might expect vampires to return to carrying capacity either very quickly or very slowly.

Also bear in mind that at a 1:1,000,000 vampire/human ratio you need a McGuffin like the Hellmouth to explain why there are any meaningful number of vampires in the town where the action takes place. [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_Metropolitan_Statistical_Areas][Wikipedia]] says there are only two (almost three) metro areas that support a double digit number of vampires with those numbers. I guess I don't know what you're going for, but if you want anything like /Buffy/ or /Supernatural/ (where the protagonists can fight several vampires or other baddies in a small town), those numbers have to be at least an order of magnitude more generous.
