  The Old One being motivated to go on a journey and commit genocide is the tricky part, though - like, what would a personality have to be like to want to do that?

Maybe he wasn't an Old One. Maybe he was a poorly chosen Young One - a monk, or a particularly pious nobleman, who saw vampirism as blasphemy and took it upon himself to eradicate it from the planet pretty much as soon as he became one; a strong, intelligent man (or woman) who identified more strongly with his previous human life than his new vampire one. (This might also make vampires a lot more cautious about making new children again, sharply reducing their population growth).
