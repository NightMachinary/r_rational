[[/rdnod][]] Riiiiight.

[[/sp][]] I really like the idea of Brother Michael and Abbot, though Brother Michael's lack of power when compared with /the entire vampire community/ still sticks in my craw.

Some justifications:

- Brother Michael is clever and starts out meddling in politics, causing some powerful ones to fight to the death and all

- Instead of killing the Abbot, Brother Michael /converts him/ - and doubtless several others - into seeing the light of the lord (aside: My Vampire is canonically catholic, so this might explain why he was one of those who managed to survive)

- Ultimately, as Michael and Abbot's designs on exterminating the vampire species come to the fore (first in the guise of "why not just kill a bunch of the younglings, more food for us, ah ha ha", or something), the Survivors band together, kill Michael and Abbot, and restore the balance of power: but as a result of all the terrible things they had to go through, they still are not terribly fond of all the religious iconography.

Another possibility:

- Vampire duplication (discussed at length in another sub-thread of the crazy branching tree this post has become), /actually does make you a full copy of yourself when you were turned/. Brother Michael is the first one to realise the implications of this, and makes an army of THOUSANDS of doubles of himself. No matter how much of an elder you are, you can't beat a thousand Brother Michaels who know all your weaknesses.

- As a result of this, making duplicates of yourself has become /extremely/ taboo and will result in death if you're found out

- Major drawback: making duplicates of yourself comes in /so handy/ that it's probably actually too powerful a power to put in even if there's a taboo about it.

- Extremely minor drawback: Body doubles being taboo will require an infinitesimal amount of retconning
