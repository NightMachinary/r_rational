Depends on the quality of the society, and how "against the wall" they are.

Are they good, lovey-dovey, and not yet against the wall? They'd probably have big hospitals, nursing homes, etc to make peoples' lives more bearable. Switch over to a more efficient diet (something soylent-like) to better feed everyone, strict rationing of food and water. Invest in automation to account for the lack of people to do everything from farming to actually fighting in the war.

The other end of the extreme is the "actually quite terrible people who are right against the wall and they know it" - people are killed at the first sign of illness, once they reach a certain age, etc. Fewer mouths to feed. Many would be used as kamikazee pilots or for high-risk espionage missions. The sick would be experimented on, holocaust-style.

Probably you would have a mixture of the two approaches: prenatal screenings and abortions of infected foetuses (maybe IVF done under controlled conditions), euthenasia once illness reached a certain point with a thorough autopsy, people being encouraged to enter voluntary vaccination / medication trials, etc.

Research would focus on broad spectrum things and other "quick wins" (probably? I'm not an expert so I don't know if it's easier to find broad spectrum things with a 30% success rate than a narrow spectrum thing with a 90% success rate).

Customs would probably change - I read a young adult book set in a future after a plague and bowing became the new greeting custom since hand-shaking spread diseases, so there'd probably be taboos about touching people, hand-washing would be very frequent, clothing may be made disposable, etc.
