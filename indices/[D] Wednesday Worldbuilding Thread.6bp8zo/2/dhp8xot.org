Watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNWWrDBRBqk][this]] video reminded me that there is something I should ask you lot for input on.

In my world there is a magical world war. Mundane technology is not as impressive as what we have in the real world, but with the power of magic one of the baddies invents dysgenic weapons. That is, she engineers parasites and diseases that seldom kill but which cripple horribly, whether by causing motor control issues, destroying the immune system, preventing people from using magic, causing depression, etc. Sometimes it affects the victim, sometimes symptoms appear only in any descendants they may later have, sometimes both. She develops many variants of these weapons and unleashes them all at once.

Now. If you're in a world war where it's far from certain who will eventually win, and it's likely the war will go on for another decade or more, how do you deal with the realization that about half the children born on your side are suddenly crippled and something like 20-25% of your adult population is alive but suddenly crippled? There are of course enemy spies running around sabotaging your quarantines and spreading the infections any way they can.

The targeted nation immediately try to develop treatments against the various parasites, of course, and have mixed results, and they also spread the parasites and diseases right back behind enemy lines, but what else? How do you deal with your own sick population? How does your country have to change to deal with the massive strain on your resources these people cannot help but be now?
