Some of the comments on the chapter page got me thinking... at first I was imagining that, since we know Cat's plan in advance this time, things will inevitably get mucked up (because there's no dramatic tension if the story simply plays out all this planning again). But now I'm considering that the plan will work but the fallout will be what really comes back to haunt Cat.

Also, if Killian is part fae, likely from the Summer Court, I could see her somehow becoming a victim to the after effects if Cat inherits a Winter Court royal title. This passage in particular:

#+begin_quote
  Killing her birth father on the field, she became a Princess of Winter only to find the horrible fate still dogged her: she was sent as as the champion of Winter to settle a duel, only to find the man who'd raised her to be her opponent. This evidently being a tragedy, she won again and destroyed everything she'd ever loved.
#+end_quote

... seems like it could end up with her being sent to duel a Summer champion and the Summer Court forcing Killian to act out the role. Or it could stay closer to exactly what it says, and somehow Cat's new role will end up requiring her killing Black ("the man who raised her"). Of course that's probably going to have to happen at some point anyway, so I guess it's not that much of a shock.
