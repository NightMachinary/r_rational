I think the problem is that the fae are mostly used to fighting other fae. They set the story up for Cat to fail. If they were fighting fae, then once that happened she'd be doomed to fail. But humans are less bound by stories than fae. She still can't win without the story on her side, but she can change which story it is even though it's already started. It's like you're a chessmaster who can see ten moves ahead, but when your opponent realizes they're going to lose in five moves they can just move around their pieces and pretend they made a different move five moves ago.
