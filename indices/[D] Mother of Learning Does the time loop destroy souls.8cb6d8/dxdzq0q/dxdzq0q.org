#+begin_quote
  The time loop mechanism completely ignores the part about souls being indestructible. When the pocket universe is destroyed, everything in it (other than souls tagged with a valid marker) is destroyed along with it. Souls may be indestructible to in-universe entities, but they still need a universe bound by appropriate rules in order to continue existing.
