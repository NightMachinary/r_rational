We saw with that one weird soul-eating flower that souls are more than just /units/.

They are complicated magical machines, with many moving parts on top of their 'core' and personally, it seems to me like people having things mixed up. A souls /core/ is indestructible, immutable, eternal. But 'you' aren't your core, your core is simply a part of you. Your shaping skills, personality, etc. are all embedded in the architecture of the rest of your soul, which we see is not even close to indestructible.

Thus, I would propose that the Sovereign gate /is/ reusing souls, but is not reusing them /wholesale/. It is stripping them down to their cores and rebuilding them from there following the template, much how it reconstructs everything else.
