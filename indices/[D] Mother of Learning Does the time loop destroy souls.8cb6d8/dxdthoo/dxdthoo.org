It's specifically stated that the world inside the portal is cut off from the divine, there is no contact with the gods, etc. That would include heavens/hells.

So even if the souls are real they are not going to an afterlife at the end of each loop. Presumably they are erased and then created again. Or possibly just reset and used over. If it's the latter they would have to be eventually destroyed at the end of the simulation anyway.
