We don't know if detonating your own soul actually destroys it. It could just use all available magic the soul produces to cause an explosion, but the soul still remains intact. I doubt the gods would enjoy the idea of villains who, believing they would experience some sort of punishment in the afterlife, are able to escape judgement by soul-suicide.

I do think the gate is creating new souls and destroying them, which is quite astonishing if you think about it. Even if souls can be destroyed by suicide, it has been stated that there is no known method of offensively destroying another's soul. This means the Sovereign Gate is the only known device usable by mortals that can create and destroy a soul. Which makes Eldemars research into it even more troubling. If mastered, the device has the potential of basically granting god-like powers to it's user.
