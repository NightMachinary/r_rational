Souls are a creation of the gods, so it stands to reason that they have the power to unmake souls if they so choose. It also makes sense for them not to want souls to get wantonly destroyed because they serve a purpose for handling people's afterlives, but the reasoning there becomes a bit fuzzy when you introduce a world that's producing hundreds of nigh-identical copies of every soul on the planet. The Sovereign Gate is pretty much the most powerful thing the gods ever put on earth, so it does make sense to me for it to be a bit of an exception as far as the gods are concerned.
