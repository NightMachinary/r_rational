It's good story, but a bit disjointed and I fell it requiers a bit of guess work on the readers side when it comes to explaining a situation, like the part with hospital and Tenzin and Lin freaking out.

Fell free to explain a situation and add detail to characters behaviors more often. Would be nice if there were more to dialogues than people talking.

Also I think I read a similar fanfic like this before, the penguin hobo sounds familiar.
