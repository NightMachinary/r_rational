I read in a work, possibly a Harry Potter fic, that technology didn't work around magic because of spacial warps that left microscopic tearing in pretty much everything. Something that didn't matter at all for a plant, hardly mattered to magical human life (who were more sturdy than magic-free humans), mattered just a bit more for precise clockwork like pocketwatches, but would slowly but surely decay any circuitry or microchips into tiny silicon bricks.

So a simple hand crank generator would work, and so would a lightbulb. But no electric computers.
