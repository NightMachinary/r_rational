What we consider science is our ability to discern the rules that govern our environment. What we consider technology is that which uses those rules efficiently to achieve some objective.

In a fantasy setting, the world can endlessly frustrate would-be scientists. The world might truly be governed by the whims of cosmic beings, or various observed forces might in fact be governed by machine elves. Scientists might need to take into account far more variables than in the real world (e.g. this light bulb will only function if you are a good person, except on days dedicated to the worship of the lord of darkness), which would at the very least slow development.
