What is "simple" about "Join together copper and zinc by means of a cloth soaked in brine and it will shock you, sometimes, if you touch it just right, until the mechanism gets tired and then never works again, and by this process you can replace candles somehow"?

In the real world, basic steam-driven aeolipiles were described around 15 BCE, and static electricity has likely been known since before we were H. sapiens. We proceeded to do absolutely nothing with this knowledge until the 1700s. The simplest, most plausible, /true/ reason is that people don't have enough information to have thought of it yet, and their metallurgy and infrastructure isn't good enough to make reliable use of it anyway.
