This is less about technology itself than the way wizardry normally works in fantasy worlds, which I feel is important to the question. Generally wizardry is a very intellectually challenging art that you can study for a lifetime without mastering more than a little of it, but clearly has huge benefits both to yourself and society. Therefore the intelligent members of these fantasy societies are more likely to study wizardry then say invent scientific fields. To put in terms that make sense for us. Why would you try to create a new field of study when you can became so useful to society by becoming a doctor, something that is guaranteed to be a useful skill. When the smartest members of your society are all becoming mages it is unsurprising that technological advances are stunted.
