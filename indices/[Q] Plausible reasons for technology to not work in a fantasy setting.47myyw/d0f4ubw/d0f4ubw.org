Well, one explanation I didn't see in this thread is existence of any semi-conscious force (that doubles as a Source of Magic) that actively impedes technology. If it allows something as difficult as instant healing or mind-control, it can't be that hard to identify anything with too high technology level and subtly break it. Or even completely prevent humans from noticing any possibilities of excess technological development.
