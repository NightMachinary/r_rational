First off, do /humans/ work in that setting? Humans are extremely complicated machines that can be destroyed by something as small as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water#Toxicity_in_humans][slightly increasing the weight of water]]. If they work, there's not much that will break. So if you want real-world humans to enter your fantasy world and not die, but then to find that their smart phones stopped working, that's not going to make a whole lot of sense.

If you're making the world out of whole cloth, with a race that physically resembles but is distinct from humans, then you can do a lot to justify it. Can water be boiled in your universe? Perhaps boiling it away requires far more energy than you're likely to get. Or maybe steam is extremely corrosive, and the machinery is likely to break down. Or maybe your world doesn't have a lot of metal, and can't spare enough to make trains.

And why do you say those fantasy universes have electrical phenomena? Because they have lightning? Maybe that's just Zeus throwing spears or something. Or maybe it's kind of like electricity, but there's no electromagnetism. Electricity stops looking as impressive if you can't send it through a coil and move stuff around with it.

But even then, any world with anything like people has self-repairing self-replicating technology.

It is fairly common for people to have magic resistance. You don't want someone to be able to kill people easily by causing aneurysms. It could be that magic keeps technology from working, but humans can live because they can keep the magic out, and they just haven't figured out how to keep the magic out of their steam engines.
