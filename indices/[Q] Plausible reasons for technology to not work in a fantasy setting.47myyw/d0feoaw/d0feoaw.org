There's an adult -- as in erotic -- web story that has a D&D-derived fantasy setting, called Tales of MU, where apparently one of the overdeities of the setting is actively hostile to some aspects of the scientific method. It's called 'Tales of MU', and is really long, but really well written. Link: [[http://www.talesofmu.com/]]
