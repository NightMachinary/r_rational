Alastair Reynolds wrote a pretty interesting explanation for this in his book Terminal world.

The basic premise is that there is a kind of 'space time tiling' shift that happens between various 'zones'.

humans and messy organics MOSTLY survive making these transitions if you go slow enough, don't go into really LETHAL places and take special drugs to help ease the metabolic shock of moving from one scale zone to another.

tolerance for traversing zones and even living in a particular zone comfortably seems to be hereditary or environmental in conditioning and thus people generally don't live their native zone if they can help it lest they become very ill.

It's not stated explicitly but I suspect cancers and genetic disruption is rather common for those that transit often in life and the symptoms of making too many zone shifts looks a lot like radiation poisoning (pretty much all the molecules in your body get shuffled over and over again very slightly).

higher precision machinery like microchips generally fail entirely unless their built explicitly to survive the transition (and generally need to be turned off when your crossing a boundary anyway). There is also a group which uses many different kinds of clocks with different precision requirements to function as early warning systems for when approaching boundaries that a human's physiology would not necessarily detect.

What I'm getting at here is that magic might have 'degrees of not like our physical reality' which a human/living body could survive slowly transitioning from one to another but are catastrophic to jump too quickly from one state to another.
