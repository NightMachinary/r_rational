One option is to add back the "+C" term so often missing from integrals back onto them - especially in Maxwells equations. If you can't turn mechanical motion of a magnetic field back into current, you can't make a generator. That "+C" term could often be negative, or vary, as long as the equation still works in situations that rationality call for as needing it.

Steam-wise, do you really want to anger the local water spirits that much by cooking them into air? I mean, they're not mad in the normal flow of things, but if someone exploits them regularly outside of their normal expected workload and lifestyle, they may just quit working.
