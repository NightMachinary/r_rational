Counterexample: /The Guardians of the Flame/ is a series of books by Joel Rosenberg in which a group of modern American college kids get sent to a fantasy world. One of the is a civil engineering student who, over the course of years, revolutionizes the world by introducing steam and basic gunpowder and etc. I might be looking at it through nostalgia goggles, but I remember it being well-written and a lot of fun.
