A lot of technology is invented when there is a problem that needs to be solved. However, this means that if magic can solve the problem more easily than through technology, then technology simply won't develop.

If a simple cantrip can make a floating ball of light, then you won't go through the 100+ failed attempts by Edison to make the light bulb.

In addition, a rarely noticed requirement for technology is mass production and intrastructure. A lot of times, people write stories about how someone from the present goes back in time and revolutionize society with their futuristic knowledge. *BUT* they often forget that most of technology is ruinously expensive unless it's common as dirt.

Building pipes for plumbing? Requires specialized skills to build it and maintain it.

Control of electricity for work? Requires a lot of equipment to harness it and convert it into something actually useful.

Plastic? Requires a highly refined and complicated process which is expensive unless you are producing plastic at the level of thousands of pounds.

Either way, most of common technology we see is only useful/profitable if it's implemented on a society-wide scale which is one of it's main strengths. Civilization requires technology to function and technology requires a civilization to implement it. It's a feedback loop which ensures actual technological development to maintain a civilization. Otherwise if it was easy for a small group to reproduce everything our society makes, then the world would be a lot more fractured into smaller groups and more anarchic in nature.

That's why there is so little technology in fantasy worlds. When there is magic which easily reproduces anything our modern-day society can make, we don't develop into a futuristic post-scarcity society but rather a medieval one where all of the power is concentrated into the hands of a few people (yeah we kinda have that today, but imagine a godlike warlord who can control your every action/thought as compared to a rich CEO).

I'm actually happy technology is so difficult to create and maintain on any scale other than that of a large society, because it either requires cooperation or extreme slavery to even function and we have eliminated slaves a long time ago.

It means that humans /need/ to work together for any hope of survival and it encourages cooperative personality traits to spread (go read [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZRPC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1][The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution]] if you don't believe me).

TL;DR - Yes technology may still work, but in a world where magic does the same thing more easily and cheaply, then there will be no motivation to create the technology. Even if technology can be more flexible and versatile than magic, it still needs to require a significant percentage of wealthy/influential people to agree that it's better than magic /and/ be willing use it when in the early stages it's going to be clearly shittier than magical alternatives.

It's the problem of convincing people to go for long-term potential on the order of generations over short-term benefits.
