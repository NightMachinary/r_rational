I can appreciate the value of pop books --- I have biology and genetics textbooks but still refer to my pop books on occasion --- but prefer them more for things like physics and engineering as the concepts in other sciences are simple enough, which also leads me to question the format of textbooks, especially for biology... because the cost of textbooks is too damn high, so I can understand that appeal too.

  because most people don't actually like to read papers and books have the advantage of being easily understood by the layman.

Most people should seek to change that as papers have the advantage of improving scientific literacy in a deep way, such as understanding methodology and its limitations and flaws in a study, granted they can get passed the pay wall. That is irritating.
