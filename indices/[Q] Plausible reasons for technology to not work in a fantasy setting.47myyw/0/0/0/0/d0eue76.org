I think they have a point, that civilization has impacted human evolution, and I always found it questionable that our brains have not changed since living in civilization. I am just skeptical of the finer details, especially considering the fields concerning the content are not reliable, and I find the information about Ashkenazi [the last for words... awkweeeeerd] Jews interesting.

My initial reaction is that it is convenient --- in a bad way, looking for differences to explain a difference and therefore finding a difference and concluding that difference is the cause --- but their IQ shift could also be used to argue against the notion of intelligence being fixed, and keeping in mind my link about the structure of the human brain being more sensitive to environment, a [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160225153817.htm][recent study]] suggests a link between brain structure and cognitive ability.

As for my gripe with pop science books, it is science reporting itself. One can read a book from a few years ago and think they are well informed (because of the way the information has been presented) but can be unaware of recent information that may challenge some of the claims in the book and/or provide a more nuanced perspective. That is why I prefer studies to pop science books.
