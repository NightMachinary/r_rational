I sort of agree with you about pop science books, but I think that this book has a lot of pretty reliable references to back up most of what it finds. Because most of the book is about finding examples of how humans may have changed in the last 10,000 years such as lactose tolerance and an IQ shift among Ashkenazi Jews (they make up ~0.02% of the population, but over 25% of Nobel Prize winners are Ashkenazi Jews).

So I think the book has found pretty reliable changes that can be considered to be the result of a genetic mutation and the authors use these changes as proof to challenge the idea that humans has stopped evolving since we developed civilization.
