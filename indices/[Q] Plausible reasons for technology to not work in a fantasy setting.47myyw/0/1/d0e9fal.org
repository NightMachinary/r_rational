Good explanation. I'd thought of this myself but it does require that magic be fairly ubiquitous, which rules out a fair number of fantasy worlds. I'd think that given the convenience factor and easy scalability of technology, some form of magic would have to be accessible to most households to prevent technology from being kickstarted.

Furthermore, if technology really does work but is repressed by the magic-using elite, so long as the world has a long enough history, it seems to me that technology vs. magic would necessarily have to be one of the major points of conflict. That's good for some storylines but doesn't thematically fit well in a story that wants to be pure fantasy but doesn't want to be stupid and irrational.
