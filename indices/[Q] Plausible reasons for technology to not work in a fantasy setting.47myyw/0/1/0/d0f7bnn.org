Think of it like this:

In our world, a rich mine owner has a problem: his mines keep filling up with water. He has lots of money to throw at the problem, so he looks around for someone he can pay to solve it. He hires an engineer who develops the first industrial steam engine to pump the water out of the mines. The engine is patented, and now access to steam power is limited only by one's ability to pay for the engine and it's fuel.

In a fantasy world, the mine owner looks around for someone he can pay to solve his flooding problem. He hires a wizard, who summons a water elemental to move the water out of the mine and binds it for a year and a day.

Most of the really world-changing inventions in our world, the ones that sparked things like the industrial revolution, were created by scholars of various sorts such as engineers and chemists, who were either rich themselves or were hired to solve problems by rich people. These inventions became commonplace and eventually reached the point of benefiting the common man because once invented they required no special ability to manufacture and operate, just training and resources. In a fantasy world it is wizards and alchemists (and priests and druids etc) that the rich go to for new solutions, and in contrast to the real world, the solutions those specialists come up with cannot trickle down to the common man because they require magical abilities at least to create, often to operate (or cast). Thus you tend not to get a magical revolution, because the "technology" of magic remains restricted to the elite.

If you want a technological revolution, though, it's fairly easy to justify in the form of a culture or subculture or even a powerful individual who distrusts magic and wizards and so spends the extra effort to create mundane solutions. Even better when those mundane solutions spread and are then improved upon by magical inventors, ex. "Ah, this clever fellow has invented a mechanical bellows device which an do work by heating water with fire. You know, I could get the same effect with an enchanted hot plate and a decanter of endless water and we'd never have to buy coal again."
