Also worth noting that early technological progress was very slow for a number of reasons in the real world, most of which still apply in the typical fantasy world like lack of universal education, lack of demand, slow communication between the educated elite, lack of cooperation between rival countries.

Interesting things can happen in a fantasy world if you allow one or more of those restrictions to break down and start pushing into an age of thaumaturgical rather than technological progress. Most don't go that direction though because it means doing a lot of work to nail down scientific principles behind magic to define the limits of that progress.
