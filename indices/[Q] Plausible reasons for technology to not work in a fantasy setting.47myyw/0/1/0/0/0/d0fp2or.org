One thing that REALLY bothers me regarding magic is how so few worlds have knowledge-sharing magic, that would allow, for example, to educate a layman to the level of a university professor with a single spell, or something like internet (but mind-to-mind).

It does make sense from the a story perspective (good luck writing a compelling story in that kind of world), but not so much in a realistic society.
