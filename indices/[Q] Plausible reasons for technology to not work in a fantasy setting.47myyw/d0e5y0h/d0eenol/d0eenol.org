Considering behavioral scientists exaggerate their findings (US more so) and behavior genetics is [[http://www.nature.com/news/smart-genes-prove-elusive-1.15858#/ref-link-2][not as valid a field]] as some would think, information released after the publication of this book, I will apply a greater scrutiny to this book when reading it, not that I think it is entirely wrong.

A [[http://phys.org/news/2015-11-nature-nurture-human-brains-evolved.html][study last]] year suggests there is something to civilization affecting our biology. Regardless, I am more critical of these pop science books.
