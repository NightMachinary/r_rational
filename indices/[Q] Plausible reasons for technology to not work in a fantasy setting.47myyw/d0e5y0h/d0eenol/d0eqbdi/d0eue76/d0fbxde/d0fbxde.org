Okay yeah, I get what you mean and I would also prefer to read a study done on the topic instead of a book, because studies are required to be reviewed by other people and books have no similar restrictions. But when I want to demonstrate a scientific point to people, I tend to refer to books instead of papers, because most people don't actually like to read papers and books have the advantage of being easily understood by the layman.

Granted in this subreddit, we have a larger number of people who /would/ read scientific papers, so I probably should change my references. Thanks for helping me to notice that!
