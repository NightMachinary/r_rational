You don't even have to go that extreme (which to be fair, would be pretty heavy, even Wish-level magic in most fantasy worlds) to have an extreme effect on society.

Most magic systems actually treat violating thermodynamics as a much easier problem than manipulating minds. Perpetual motion, or at least something practically indistinguishable from it, seems to be easy in most fantasy worlds, which should be HUGE. Getting easier access to more energy (human muscle, animal muscle, fire, coal, oil, nuclear) has been a major driver of technological progress, and magic undercuts a huge amount of that.

Communication is also a big deal. Even in the modern world getting messages to the other side of the world is a big deal. It requires high power transmitters and huge antenna arrays, laying thousands of miles of cable over land and sea, or expending gigajoules of energy putting satellites into orbit. In a magical world, it's as simple as casting Sending. Just the difference having a couple of magic mirrors in every university that can link to each other would be profound. The webcomic Dungeon Grind had a gag recently with a magical tome for dungeon delvers which was linked to hundreds of other tomes so that anything written in one appeared in all the others, and used it as a joke on Wikipedia and social networking. But just imagine if every magical library had a book like that. Imagine all the other ways a magical world could ape our modern information technology society.
