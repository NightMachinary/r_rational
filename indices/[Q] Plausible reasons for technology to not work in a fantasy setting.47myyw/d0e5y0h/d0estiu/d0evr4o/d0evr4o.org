Argh! I was tired when I typed that. I meant to say that it's now widely agreed that slavery is immoral despite the fact that we have children in far-off countries (or poor immigrants in America) working in sweatshops to make a lot of our goods. Still, there is progress (hopefully) to eliminate such practices.

If there is any other form of slavery that is considered to be legal, then I don't know of them and I would like to be told the harsh truth.
