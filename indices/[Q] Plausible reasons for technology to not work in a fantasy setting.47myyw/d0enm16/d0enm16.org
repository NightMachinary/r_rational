I built a fantasy setting that was on a young world, where we (and elves, dwarves, and what not) all evolved in the first age of life. So, there simply were no fossil fuels or petroleum. So a certain level of technology existed, but nothing that required gas, coal, or petrochemicals was possible. I know it's pseudo-scientific, but shit, guys, there were dragons.
