Sure, the main reason is because part of this subreddit are stories with transhuman themes which involves the idea that death is bad and we should all strive to maximize the quality of life as well as extending our lifespan. Your story about humanity's struggle to avoid Death communicates that idea in a very wonderful way.

Here's another story called [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html][The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant]] which has a similar theme.

Let me know if you want me to recommend other fiction to read and thanks for writing such a wonderful story!
