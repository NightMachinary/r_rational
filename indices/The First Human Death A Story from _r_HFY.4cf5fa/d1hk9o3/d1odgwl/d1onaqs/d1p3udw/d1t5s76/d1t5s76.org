I'd assume it is yes. Friendship is Optimal is one of the core fictions that fall under the rational category.

Others include:

- Harry Potter and The Methods of Rationality (Genre Creator)
- Luminosity (Rational Twilight)
- The Metropolitan Man (Rational Superman, Lex Luthor focus)
- Branches on the Tree of Time (Rational Terminator)
- Pokemon: The Origin of Species (Rati... You get the idea.)
- Team Anko/Lighting up the Dark (Naruto)

In terms of original stories, we actually have some really well written ones.

- Mother of Learning (Rational Groundhog Day Mage in Original setting. Extremely well written)
- Ra (Modern Magic as Engineering. Gets a bit weird. FINISHED)
- Shadows of the Limelight (Heroes and Villains gain power from Fame in a medieval setting.
- Worm (Modern Superheroes. Deconstruction. Makes 40k look bright and cheery.)
- A Practical Guide to Evil (Medeval fantasy. Tropes are actual laws of physical reality. Roles have direct power, and adopting an abstract Name grants superhuman abilities.)

There are also some fun short stories:

- The Cambist and Lord Iron (Economic Fairy Tale)
- Fable of the Dragon Tyrant (You've read)
- Three Worlds Collide (Uh, just read this.)
- The Sword of Good (Short Fantasy Deconstruction)
- The Last Christmas (Rational.. The Santa Clause? Kinda?)

There are probably a lot more that I missed, and some borderline stuff that debatably falls in the category of rational fic but that some of us still like.
