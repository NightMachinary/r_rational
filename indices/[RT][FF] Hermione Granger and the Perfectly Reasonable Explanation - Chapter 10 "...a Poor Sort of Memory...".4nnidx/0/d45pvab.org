I have mixed feelings about the whole time-travel direction, since it means that the plot would be less defined by Hermione's agency and more by having to deal with her future self --- along with possibly having to mess with her past self to create a closed loop --- and also I am not sure what it entails for Hermione's interaction with her peers and teachers: how much meaningful character interaction is possible if she is constantly scrambling to stay sane and in control of her thoughts and actions?

That said, these are worries about the future of the story, not its present or past: I've very much enjoyed what's been written so far.
