I have the /very/-high-level plot worked out, which is to say I know where I'm starting and where I need to end up. I just have to work all the middle parts out sensibly.

One hint is a lot of my titles tend to have double meanings (e.g. "Independent Study", because that's what Hermione is literally doing, but also she discovers someone else has been doing, with her body) - and that goes for the story title as well.
