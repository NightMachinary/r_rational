So, potential idea:

Hermione's Future Spirit is possessing only one side of her brain: The right side, the creative side. The side which controls the left side of her body.

She gets use of the whole brain while Hermione is unconscious, but otherwise cannot access the parts which allow the use of words or language, explaining her non-verbal communication. Easier control of the left arm explains why the notes were written with that arm.
