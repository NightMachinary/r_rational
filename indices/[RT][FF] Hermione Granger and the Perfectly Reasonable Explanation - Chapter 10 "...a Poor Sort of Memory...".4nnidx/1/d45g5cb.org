i love the idea of young hermione doing mental battle with her older memory packet. for all that young-hermione is outgunned, she can go to the library and look up new information without limit. Older hermione may or may not be limited in information acquisition, but certainly has constraints w/r/t goals and objectives. All that young hermione has to do is learn and attack, while old hermioine has got to curate the timeline while simultaneously fending off a fast-learning 11 year old with (tentative) access to their whole shared history.

cool.
