It's decent. A lot will depend on where it goes, and RobinDrew is better at some aspects of writing than others, but I'm continuing to read updates as they come out.

Hermione's definitely more ... autistic? ... than she has been in other fanfic incarnations, and she leaps straight to the heart of the issue on very little data, but it's consistent and it fits with her emotional core (i.e. she doesn't read "weirdly smart" so much as "smart and weird").

Plot is a little chaotic and confused, but I think that's on purpose, with explanations forthcoming (hopefully). Nobody else has really been a character yet, so far.
