All have action and adventure as their primary genre. So of course the individual combats will be the decisive factor for solving the story's conflicts and problems. It's like ranting that in strategy games the player can take control over each and every individual unit's actions and can see what's happening in various areas in real time despite not being in a technological era that could afford such level of surveillance and mind control.

You'd be more accurate to be ranting instead why the story plots of such actions games are so unrealistic (because it is an exploitation genre; because big companies are more suited to develop more popular games and they will also be the ones less caring about well-developed secondary aspects of the game; etc) and why other genres aren't as popular as the action genre (because the natural selection applied in the environment of our universe is a major factor defining our psychology, for which shooting things is the more entertaining thing to do).

If you're starting to get frustrated by the underdeveloped plot and realism in actions games and literature, then maybe your tastes have changed and you'd be enjoying things like literature about military logistics, biographies, or political history more instead? Also try works like /Game of Thrones/ and /House of Cards/.
