I'm not sure if they would fit, but Glen Cook's /Black Company/ series might work. The protagonists are all part of the eponymous mercenary company, and as such are deployed in the field by their boss, but within that they have to come up with their own tactics. While a part of the books deals with the clash of soldiers and mages in battles, it is far less prominent than in other works.

Though to be honest, I quite like the books and think they're woefully underappreciated in general and enjoy every opportunity to recommend them. You might want to know about my bias therein, then.
