The problem is that writing an entire story entirely centered around war and soldiers which breaks the cult of the warrior is stupidly hard. Best I can think of would be having [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist][the General or some other high-ranked officer]] be the focus character, with plenty of attention payed to how his logistical and supply situations affect his decision making. This will necessarily be action-deficient though, so it's only suitable for text-based medium.

Now, a small /snippet/ that defies the cult, as part of a greater story, is fine. A brief fragment of story where the side with good super-soldiers goes up against the side with good /everything else/ and gets creamed will work. But you can't make an */character-focused/ entire war story about that.

The fundamental problem is that defying the cult of the warrior *makes the individual soldier almost meaningless*, yet most traditional fiction *relies on* having a few "very important" character for the story to follow. Sure you can narrate the struggles of the army at large, but then you don't have a traditional story. ...

You have a /history book/.

EDIT: Not that that's inherently bad, I myself enjoy it. But I realize that Alternate History-esque stuff is not for everyone.
