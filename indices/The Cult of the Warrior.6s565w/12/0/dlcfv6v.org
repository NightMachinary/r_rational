I don't think it would be that hard honestly, because officers at every level are perfect counter-points to the cult.

Consider: These are people who aren't even allowed to do manual labor outside a warzone, who are not expected to routinely engage in direct combat themselves [1], who are expected to treat the men under them with a detached rationality - yet who dictate the flow of the entire battle with a few words. Without whom victory is nearly impossible, as the men lack cohesion, strategies fall apart, and everyone just runs around like a chicken with its head cut off.

The story can focus on the officer's tactics, planning, logistical cleverness, rather than the enlisted men's daring do and punching things. I've seen several anime that actually do exactly this, such as Log Horizon and Code Geass - where the protagonist is an abysmal warrior, but his superior skills as an officer make him utterly terrifying to fight.

Incidentally, if you want an example of doing this in reverse - watch Band of Brothers, episode 2. That battle in the trenches near to the end? Looked like a chaotic mess? It was actually [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%A9court_Manor_Assault][a master class in small unit tactics]] carried out by Lt. Winters with almost no prep time. His men overcame 3 to 1 odds against an entrenched enemy in a short time with minimal losses - largely due to his superior leadership and superb tactical acumen. Yet you wouldn't know it from that show, because it focuses on glorifying the warriors under Winter's command rather than Winters himself.

[1] This is, incidentally, why pistols and SMGs were historically officer's weapons. It was thought he would be too busy directing his men to use a rifle, and so his only need of a weapon was in a self-defense situation should he be isolated at close quarters.
