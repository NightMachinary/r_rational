I agree that this trope tends to get annoying. That's why stories like [[https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/][Strong Female Protagonist]] and [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/][The Gods are Bastards]] appeal to me, as the super powerful people who could beat anyone in a fight have to find a different way to solve problems. There's an arc in TGAB where Tellwyn, the immortal adventurer in charge of the university, sends her students to a small town to fix its problems, where the nature of the problems can't be punched. That was where I fell in love with the story.
