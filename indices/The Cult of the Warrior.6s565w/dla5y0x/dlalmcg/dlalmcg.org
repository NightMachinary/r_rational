That's definitely a recurring theme in TGAB. A whole bunch of super-powerful entities (dragons, gods, Tellwyrn herself) keep getting faced with the fact that the world has moved on and they're no longer the biggest fish in their respective ponds. They can neither afford to throw their weight around, nor try and remain apart. In volume 12, there's a conversation to this effect:

  "You aren't a matchless power anymore.” She hesitated, then continued in a bare whisper. “Nor am I. Nor is anyone. The dragons, as you mentioned, have realized it, and adapted. You yourself managed to bully Naiya into adapting, and her consciousness now so diffuse it's amazing you got her to even hold a conversation. You, though? You see the state of the world, you recognize this need, and yet...here you are. You problem is that you still think the rules don't apply to you, just because they mostly haven't until now. I'm afraid that much has changed.”

  “... your University is uniquely vulnerable... Whoever operates in this world must do so with great care, because everything they set in motion will ripple farther and faster than it ever has. Without subtlety, without strategy and restraint, a person or even a nation can easily be shaken to pieces by the vibrations she herself causes. But you? You have stubbornly kept yourself and your University separate. You've relied on your legend, your power and the threat of your anger to dissuade encroachers. And so, Arachne, you stand alone.”

  “It's time to join the world,” Kaisa said quietly, while Tellwyrn just stared at her. She stepped forward again, reaching out to place one hand on the elf's shoulder. “Our age has passed, Arachne. No one stands above it all any longer. Very few have that power, and soon none will; already it has come to pass that those who have the power do not have the luxury of exercising it as we once did. This is my last lesson---to you, to our students, to me... And to my sisters. They will not hear it; I can only pray you will, and that some of what I love can be saved from the future I fear.”

It's kinda funny to think that dragons, archmages, semi-gods, and /actual/ gods are getting hamstrung by the power of organized bureaucracy, but that's kind of the running theme of the series!
