The story of the Battle of Yonkers is that it was intended as a propaganda show of force by the higher-ups, who thought that the battle couldn't /possibly/ be lost given all the tech and firepower.

Then the fancy shrapnel shells, while far from useless, turned out to be less efficient than expected against non-humans. And the fancy communication system became a vector for loss of morale as soldiers reported anecdotal evidence of invincible zombies (their exact capabilities were at that point still poorly known). Then the troops routed, the failure of that show of force caused a panic, zombies got the chance to disperse inland and reach more population centers, and it took a while for the US to regroup into a proper government and military force again.

But every other paragraph of that chapter mentions how /if only the troops had been placed in better defensive positions/ or /if only they hadn't been wearing useless bulky gear for an extended engagement on a hot day/ etc. etc. the battle would probably have been won.

Basically it blames it all on overconfident commanders looking for a photo-op. Which may or may not be realistic, but it's definitely better than blaming it on the inefficacy of machine guns.
