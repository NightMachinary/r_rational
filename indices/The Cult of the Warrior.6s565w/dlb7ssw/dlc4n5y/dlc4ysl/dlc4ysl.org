Well the in universe justification was that the zombies were slow and exceedingly durable but headshots would stop them from moving almost immediately. In universe I think the problem with machine guns was that:

2. They would waste way more ammunition than semiautomatic rifles, which was a big deal because ammunition was scarce.
