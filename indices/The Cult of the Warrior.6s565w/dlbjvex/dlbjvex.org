Superior logistics win the wars. Hand-to-hand mystic warrior or bullshit self-repairing power suit with infinite fuel reactor don't need supply. They effectively have infinite amount of supply and don't have delivery problem. Supply is not so visible in modern local wars, but in WW2 it was main limiting factor. Panzer division fighting with six (6) tanks because there was no spare parts/fuel/ammo for the rest was not something out of ordinary in WW2. That's how guy in power suit with infinite supply or mystic warrior with power of 1-2 tanks can be worth panzer division. Add to that superior mobility, stealth and some karmic luck to hit critical spot and you can see how single mystic warrior can topple war-torn empire.
