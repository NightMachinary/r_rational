You're not wrong (particularly batman and buffy*), but there's something else you're missing: One-sided battles are boring.

- Except remember that time with the bazooka?

In an even more general sense; the smaller side must seek battles where the strategic advantage of the enemy isn't available.

So it does kinda make sense that it /does/ come down to a single warrior's punchiness... but only when the strategic situation is such that everything is rendered moot (which you want, if your strategic situation is vastly inferior).

Conversely, what now extra doesn't make sense is why the guys who DO have the strategic advantage keep putting themselves in situations where they lose it. In other words, it's not that SG1 is weirdly competent, it's that their enemies are weirdly incompetent at letting their strategic advantage get taken off the table.

There's lots of examples of individual humans having outsize effects, even on the strategic level; look at the history and players of basically any of the tech giants. Look at religions and other cults of personality. Look at "confessions of an economic hit man", assassinations.... Hell, even the way the US election eventually comes down to a rhetoric slugging match.

And actually, regarding assassinations; WWI started because of something like the punchiness of one dude. Now, without the rest of the gigantic strategic situation, it wouldn't have mattered nearly so much, but at some point there was a guy punching another guy [with a bullet]. The key moment was still more-or-less a warrior.

I guess the meta-theory is that only battles between warriors end up mattering, because otherwise the outcome is pretty much already known. Not only does that make for uninteresting stories, but it also means the events are historically unremarkable...?
