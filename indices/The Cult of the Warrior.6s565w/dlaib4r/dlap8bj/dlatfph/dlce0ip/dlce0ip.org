  He doesn't need to carry all that ordinance because he has high tech mini missiles that can each take down tanks.

Do you know why the Hellfire is 5'3'' tall? Because a rocket motor that can go 8km is very, very big. How far can Tony's tech mini missiles go? A few hundred meters?

  He strafes and avoids the chain guns, which we have seen him do multiple times, and completes the objective.
#+end_quote

We have never seen Iron man dodge computer-controlled anti-aircraft fire.

  I would also like to add that in his most basic armor he managed to avoid smart bombs with some minor difficulties.
#+end_quote

Modern missiles have what's called a no-escape zone, in which no amount of dodging or weaving can let you get away. The /only/ way to beat a modern missile like that is to stay outside it's no-escape range and dodge like your life depended on it (because it does).

Iron man doesn't have that option, he /has/ to get within brawling range for most of his effectiveness. Which means he has to get close enough that the missiles kill him dead.

  I honestly think that the tank you provided would be completely worthless against iron man
#+end_quote

A tank against Iron man would probably be completely worthless. It's not designed to track fast moving airborne targets. An anti air artillery vehicle, however, would probably reduce him to paste. Likely dozens of Iron men.

  and his mobility/size which modern weapons aren't built to handle.
#+end_quote

Our weapons are designed to hit fighter jets pulling maneuvers at the edge of human physiological capabilities. Unless Tony is a cyborg who's massively enhanced his ability to stand up to g forces, if a missile can hit a juking F-22 it can hit a juking Iron man.

  You say others have fallen into "cult thinking" but you ignore facts that don't fit your narrative.
#+end_quote

Look, I like the Iron man movies. They are really quite fun. But they are absolutely cult of the warrior flicks. It's built into every fiber of their being.
