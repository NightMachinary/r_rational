  Our weapons are designed to hit fighter jets pulling maneuvers at the edge of human physiological capabilities. Unless Tony is a cyborg who's massively enhanced his ability to stand up to g forces, if a missile can hit a juking F-22 it can hit a juking Iron man.

Well, there was that scene in the Avengers where he spins around the turbine trying to push start it. If we don't handwave that, he actually could maneuver much better than a net because he can ensure ludicrous g forces. Maybe he made an inertial dampener or something, it would explain that and a few other things.
