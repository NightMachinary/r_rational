You'll love-hate the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oD5BsBiOUw][final fight of Iron Man 3]], where the AI can control multiple flying suits in a very noisy 3D environment, understand orders like "stabilize that thing", and break suits down into flying body parts that can act independently then instantly reform...

And it fights by punching people. With disastrous consequences.

(No, this isn't a non-lethal thing - they're punched into falling to their deaths. I mean, Doylist-wise it /is/ a non-lethal thing, it keeps the deaths bloodless and off-screen, but.)

The entire fight is one long chain of awesome warrior moments that make no sense at all when you remember the options available to the warriors.
