  He doesn't need to carry all that ordinance because he has high tech mini missiles that can each take down tanks.

That ties into [[/u/j9461701]]'s point a little bit.

His /missiles/ are really freaking impressive. His /targeting system/ is an honest-to-god AGI. But it's the flying suit (also the arc reactor, which still counts as a warrior thing because it was built in a cave with a bunch of scraps) that gets all the press and keeps Tony awake at night.

Even when Ultron gets loose, with full access to Stark tech, it just builds lots and lots of knock-off suits. /Most of which carry no weapons but their fists./ (There are of course lots of good Doylist reasons for that, but.)
