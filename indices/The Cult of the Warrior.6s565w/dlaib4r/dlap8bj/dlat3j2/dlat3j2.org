  The effective range of the M242 chaingun on Bradley IFVs is over 3 kilometers. You think Iron Man can take one down from outside that range?

Oh totally. He's flying along on a hologram call with Natasha, and Jarvis pipes up "Incoming kinetic weapons fire sir". Tony asks Nat to hang on for a minute, and suggests that Jarvis take evasive maneuvers. He stops his forward progress and makes a 20-meter turn to head - shock! - directly at the weapons emplacement. He grunts from the acceleration as Jarvis jerks him up and sideways and down out of the line of fire, tracers whizzing by a few feet from the armor. Perhaps one scratches the paint. Tony calls up a missile the size of a toothpick which appears from under a hitherto invisible compartment, and it jets ahead, destroying the gun. He lands nearby, and walks over to confront the shooters. His mask folds improbably into the neck of his suit, but just as he begins to launch a diatribe the faceless attackers launch themselves at him and attempt to pull him down. He punches them out and flies off, resuming the dialog with Natasha.

That, or radar triggers a siren that appears on his HUD for about 1 second. Tony grunts "Huh?" during his call upon seeing it, and then Natasha's end shows a dropped call. The end. Unless some of the ludicrous energy capacity (both in explosives and in kinetics) of the suit fails spectacularly in the process.
