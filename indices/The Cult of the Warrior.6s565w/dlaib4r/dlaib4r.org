I take issue with some of your examples but the Iron Man example is just ridiculous. He was nearly killed by the most advanced fighter craft in the world on the first combat test of the suit. He then proceeded to destroy them by accident while trying to get away, he never even retaliated.

The suit is so powerful because it's ridiculously mobile and much more accurate than any plane but still carries the ordinance to punch through any armor. There's a reason why carriers quickly outclassed battleships.
