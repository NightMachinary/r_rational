Speaking as someone who finds logistics so entertaining that I have to stop myself from watching Let's Plays of city builders for hours, I don't think it's the plot the turns people off but the characters. Stories need to have characters that the audience can root for and/or relate to, and that's much easier to do when the story has an individualist focus.

In a Lets Play of Rimworld, for example, the player of the game is the protagonist you get invested in and want to see them react to the emergent phenomena in the game. Their monologue to the audience attaches character to the game world where the designers didn't so the logistics porn doesn't seem as shallow.

When you're trying to tell a story about a hero who happens to use logistics to advance the plot, that's much more difficult to get people invested in. Aside from the limitations of the medium where you can't or just shouldn't show viewers charts and numbers, you need to come up with conflicts related to logistics.

This is why I find simulation and strategy games so interesting, but never have fun actually playing them. It's enjoyable to see people attach a narrative to decisions about numbers, but I just want to experience a compelling narrative so having to make those management decisions feels like an obstacle to getting that.

So as far as writing stories about logistics goes, I think you need to plot it out like a mystery or procedural story. We're here to see characters solve intellectual problems in a way that can't be shown instead of told to us, so pick a formula for the pacing and draw people in with the details surrounding the main plot.

I watched Supernatural even though I found the monster hunting to be the least interesting part of the show because I liked the characters and side stories they ran into along the way. What makes whodunnits and police procedurals enjoyable is when the plot is used as a vehicle to take us interesting places.
