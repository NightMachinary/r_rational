I got hooked on YouTuber Quill18 for a while and wasted a lot of time watching Anno, before that I was a huge fan of the Yogscast Minecraft games, but the game I want to see more of is Rimworld since it has some amazing potential for emergent storytelling. I'm not too experienced with Let's Plays, though, since I soon realized I could be doing more productive things and cut myself off.

I think Let's Plays offer an interesting opportunity as a storytelling medium, but even in terms of media consumption there are stories out there that require less time and offer more enjoyment in return. Personally, I'd love to see Let's Plays become a performance art like pro-wrestling so it wouldn't just be my weird fetish.
