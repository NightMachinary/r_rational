Very good points. There are other things that minimize the cult of the warrior in the halo universe:

1. The flood are generally superior warriors to everyone. They lose the first time because the rulers of the galaxy build a super weapon that wipes out all sentient life. They lose a second time because they get glassed from orbit (on earth). They lose a third time with another usage of a super weapon. The flood also beat one of the few groups that were considered better warriors the Prometheans by superior numbers.
2. Internal strife and the fall of the priesthood class basically collapses the covenant alliance. They only become beatable by the humans because the humans are coordinating with the well trained naval forces of a splinter group of covenant.
3. The humans never win straight up brawls with the covenant prior the collapse of the covenant alliance. Master chief's mission in a lot of these cases are to conduct surgical strikes against the covenant, with the assistance of the general AI (Cortana) that you already mention.
4. The covenant also win quite often because of superior numbers. During the invasion of Earth they hadn't even known they were coming up on the enemy home planet but they brought a fleet that was still large enough to beat Earth's defenses. When the covenant found Reach and knew it was a human colony they brought an absolutely massive fleet, even if the technological advantage had been reversed they still would have won.
