I think their point is overblown, but valid as a critique of the idea of rational fiction. Not so much the implementation, so they're kind of building a strawman, but, still. The point about personal combat being a metaphor for ideological or thematic combat is valid, and it's important to consider literature (including games) as literature impacted by its genre and medium, not just as a depiction of events. Like, you can say "this superhero story is a bad piece of rational fiction because it involves a man dressing up and fighting crime, and that's somehow more effective than leveraging money and power to hire a small army".
