The latter third goes extensively into what a difference logistics and supplies make. America had the capacity to mass produce reliable, accurate semi-automatic rifles and full-body, bite-proof mesh armor. America also had the planning capacity to pull off a vertical, double-line march /across the continent/. It sucks, and it's hard and slow, but America reclaims territory with minimal losses.

That then get's compared to Russia using old Cold War stockpiles and a "fight like it's Stalingrad" mentality and taking /horrific/ losses. China attempts human wave tactics in the beginning, and makes the entire global situation massively worse due to their catastrophic losses. Even America has an example, with the ill-fated Battle of Yonkers, where the ordinance is crap against a foe that has flawless morale and immunity to +[phrase that describes the effects of a concussive shockwave on a person, which I cannot fucking remember for the life of me, even with google]+ hydrostatic shock, plus the massive logistical failure that left the soldiers pathetically short on ammunition to face off with the 8 million strong NYC horde.
