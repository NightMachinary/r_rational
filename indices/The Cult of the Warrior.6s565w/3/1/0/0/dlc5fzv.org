1) seems so very unsatisfying. Like - at some very early point you just have zombie pudding on the ground. And aiming in the general direction of heads should be enough.

2) I /might/ be able to accept that. Fully ramped up war time production is different than peace time storage. Still, given that ammunition has a rather long shelf life - and how critical ammunition is to any war effort - having a really really large storage seems like a no-brainer?

Oh well.
