I am at a loss here. My main gripes with zombe movies is that modern military is shown to always be useless against zombies.

Whereas the world wars showed that an entrenched machine gun nest ist basically impossible to capture by infantry - shooting hundreds of bullets per minute is enough to mow down anything made of flesh.

And you are claiming the exact opposite to be a good strategy?
