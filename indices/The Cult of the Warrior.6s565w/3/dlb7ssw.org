World War Z (the book not the movie) actually tackled some of your gripes about the zombie genre. Initially humanity was losing because modern weaponry wasn't suited for fighting zombies because they were too numerous and it was too expensive to keep firing explosives at hordes that didn't have to worry about morale and could withstand being dismembered. Eventually they realized the most effective way to fight the zombies was to make firing lines with rifles and constantly barrage them with headshots, opting instead for a Practical but Boring approach.

I can't remember perfectly but I think the book might have even emphasized the importance of logistics and supplies.
