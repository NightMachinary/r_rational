I'd recommend you read Joe Acrombie's "The Heroes" it has many of these elements but also incorporates a rationalist explanation for the Warrior Cult. Mostly being that at last one of the sides has a very militaristic culture that highly prizes combat feats.

Tactics, strategy, logistics, and politics all shape the battlefield. Yet in middle of a pitched battle the death of a single warrior could could turn the tides. Not because of the loss of their combat ability, but because of the loss of morale that went along with their death.

Consider, in real life most of the casualties in ancient warefare did not really happen during the heat of battle, but rather after one side had routed. An inferior force could inflect incredibly outsized damage if they someone how managed to break the enemies morale. The performance of individual warriors could thus have outsized impacts, especially if their companions actually believe in the Cult of the Warrior.
