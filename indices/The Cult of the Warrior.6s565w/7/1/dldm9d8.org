Was going to recommend Strong Female Protagonist. The plot premise is that Supergirl hangs up the cape and mask after realizing that most of the world's problems aren't punchable, instead volunteering at the fire brigade while studying at uni and trying to figure her life out. A lot of the plot revolves around finding out what her fellow child soldiers are doing to try and improve the world with their superpowers and their life choices.

Also wins my award for 'best handling of an ethical dilemma in fiction' with chapter 6.
