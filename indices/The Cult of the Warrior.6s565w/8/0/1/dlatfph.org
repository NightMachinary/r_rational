I don't remember exactly but does any of the bullets ever penetrate the suit or even cause any permanent damage?

Anyway, most of your issues seem to be that iron man isn't equivalent to heavy ordinance but while you're quick to point out his weaknesses you completely ignore his strengths. He doesn't need to carry all that ordinance because he has high tech mini missiles that can each take down tanks. He strafes and avoids the chain guns, which we have seen him do multiple times, and completes the objective.

I would also like to add that in his most basic armor he managed to avoid smart bombs with some minor difficulties. While no other countermeasures have been shown it would be extremely ooc for him not to build them into his suit.

I honestly think that the tank you provided would be completely worthless against iron man, not because he's some warrior fantasy, but because you've completely ignored his AI support (which he uses to dodge missiles), his upgraded armors (which withstand heavy arms fire in iron man 2), and his mobility/size which modern weapons aren't built to handle.

You say others have fallen into "cult thinking" but you ignore facts that don't fit your narrative.
