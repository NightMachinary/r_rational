  He was nearly killed by the most advanced fighter craft in the world on the first combat test of the suit.

The actual things that make the F-22 so powerful, like AESA radar, stealth, and beyond visual range missiles weren't utilized against him. Instead, he was engaged by the M61 Vulcan autocannon, first debuted 1959. This weapon is nearly able to /kill him dead/. And again, it's not even loaded with armor-piercing bullets because it's supposed to be used against thin-skinned aircraft.

  The suit is so powerful because it's ridiculously mobile and much more accurate than any plane but still carries the ordinance to punch through any armor.

And do you know what happens when he tries to close into visual range to utilize any of that stuff? He's shot to pieces. Radar-controlled anti-aircraft cannons are literally WW2-era tech, and as seen above - his armor isn't proof against even relatively light ordnance, let alone something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bofors_40_mm_gun][a Bofors 40mm.]]

  There's a reason why carriers quickly outclassed battleships.
#+end_quote

Yes, because carriers can attack from hundreds of kilometers away while battleships can only fight things they can see. Which of those sounds more like Iron Man to you?

The effective range of the M242 chaingun on Bradley IFVs is over 3 kilometers. You think Iron Man can take one down from outside that range? Or how about the Russian Shilka anti air artillery vehicle? How's Iron Man's chances against [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqcqfz21Plo][one of these]]?

The fact is industrial war is won or lost by armor. Planes. Artillery. Machine guns. Individual infantrymen, even super-infantry like Iron Man, simply cannot carry enough weapons or armor to play the decision role anymore. I mean a single hellfire missile is 5'3'' long - how's Tony Stark supposed to carry that into battle, duck-tape two to his feet like a pair of skis? For the record, Apaches can carry up to 16 hellfires on every sortie. /And/ a 30mm chaingun.

This is exactly what I mean by the 'cult of the warrior' though. That cult thinking kicks in, and suddenly all the rational objections just melt away in the face of good ol' fisticuffs.
