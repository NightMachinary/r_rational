I disagree with you using mass effect as an example of might/combat prowess trumping everything. Shepard happens to be the character responsible for everything, leading and making decisions, and the story is about him being in the places and battles where his actions decide the fate of the universe. It is not because he is the mightiest of super soldiers who can't lose. His team is vital and he couldn't do it without those who support him.
