[[/u/-Swimmingly-]] makes a fair point. My post is a bit of a strawman with regard to rationalist fiction, which I addressed in my opening sentence. Really my argument was pointed more at the concept, and in response to this OP. There's plenty of good rationalist fiction that strikes a good balance between verisimilitude and storytelling (which is why I'm subbed here).
