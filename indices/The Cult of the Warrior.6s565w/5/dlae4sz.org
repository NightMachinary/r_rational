Why are so many characters proficient in combat? Because individual combat is an ancient, obvious, intuitive allegory for ideological, internal, and thematic conflict.

This post helped me realise what my problem with rationalist fiction is: it basically gives up on storytelling in favour of some hopeless venture in simulationism, throwing the baby out with the bathwater in the attempt. Fiction is definitionally just made-up pretendy times, and not even the strictest rationalist approach can circumnavigate this fact: a rationalist fiction story is still a story, it'll never be a simulation, because whatever the storyteller is inspired to include in the premise is arbitrary.

Now, don't get me wrong, I actually sympathise with the central concern of this sub: I value verisimilitude (at least, in some stories), and often find implausibility for the sake of narrative grating. However, I don't think the solution is to do away with narrative devices, but rather to use them more deftly. I think it's important to remember that if rationalist fiction is nevertheless still storytelling, and as such kind of requires a point, and structure. Disjointed, rambling fake histories devoid of tension and drama are at least as bad as formulaic and implausible chosen-one epics loaded with cliches.
