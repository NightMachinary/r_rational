[[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Prediction_market]]

Eleizer suggests that prediction markets, as described above, would be a good tool to determine the answer to a question, or at least better than a smart guy going with his gut instinct. But in business, politics, and science, we routinely field our smart guy against their smart guy.

It's the same concept of fighting a war from the perspective of one super-soldier against an entire society, applied to resolving an intellectual conflict by one smart guy against a hypothetical enemy employing a prediction market. You'd expect much the same result.

As an aside, I'd put money in a prediction market against no major nation-states making a decision based on a prediction market which functions and creates results like that described in the wiki for at least a decade.
