I am wondering whether you've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685932/1/Instruments-of-Destruction][Instruments of Destruction]], a short story I wrote about the second Death Star which is almost entirely focused on logistics, and if you've read it, or you have time to read it now, what you thought of it as a prose/logistics hybrid.
