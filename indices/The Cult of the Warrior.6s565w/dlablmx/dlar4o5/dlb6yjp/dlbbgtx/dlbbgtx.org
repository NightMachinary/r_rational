I read it a while back, it's pretty decent. The only problem I have with it is that it's so short there's very little time to develop the characters, but it works well as a short story. Expanding it into a larger narrative is another matter, though, which is why I suggested adapting the whodunnit formula.

This story reminds me a little of Sherlock Holmes where the protagonist knows things we don't but still uses logical reasoning to solve problems in a consistent setting. To tell a longer story you should include the protagonist conversing with side characters to learn more about the situation.

We know from the start that the protagonist will figure things out, so what gets us invested is by having them travel around the setting and interact with other characters as they learn more about the problem they're solving. In the end, they hold a meeting where they present their conclusions to everyone.
