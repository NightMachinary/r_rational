I was actually going to bring up Halo as a counter-example. Granted, if one took only the games as presented you might have a point, but the books do a phenomenal job of establishing that the fight between humans and the Covenant is one of a much larger scale, and basically boils down to innovation vs imitation. The Covenant have had access to super-tech for millenia, yet they sit on it and worship its current state as perfection, considering any alteration heresy. Humans get their trash kicked in time after time due to bringing knives to a nuclear fight, but unlike the Covenant they invented all of their equipment, and it doesn't take too long for them to start reverse-engineering and /improving/ on the alien tech.

And I'd argue that 117 doesn't keep winning because of his serum or his power armor, but because /he crates around a general AI with him/. Cortana not only directly interfaces with the layer between Chief's brain and the armor, optimizing his reaction time, aim, and movement, but coordinates targets on a strategic level. He's not just shooting his way through anything that moves, he's shooting his way /through a path that an AI plotted out/.

Information security is another huge thing. Humans kept surviving, not because of the prowess of their super soldiers (who were only slightly more powerful than most Elites), but because they had policies such as the Cole Protocol that kept information out of enemy hands by destroying any navigational data banks mid-fight. Fleets get wiped out, but hidden worlds could keep going.

And you sort of brush it aside, but plenty of the SPARTANs /were/ wiped out due to fighting against superior logistics and tech. Hours before the events of the first game, a dozen of them were glassed from orbit, completely negating any fighting ability in exactly the sort of way that you say should be the obvious counter. The events of the games all explicitly take place on or around what is essentially holy ground to the Covenant, where they /can't/ just perform an orbital bombardment without violating deep-seated religious convictions.

Sorry, didn't mean to turn this into a rant. Video game stories in general have to focus on the actions of the player, and this tends to result in a biased power-fantasy story that is almost always going to look like the player's actions were the hinges upon which victory turned. Halo is one that on the surface does exactly that, but the expanded lore does a good job of saying "yeah, we turn shit up in a fistfight, but in spite of that billions are still dead and you can't punch a navy lol".
