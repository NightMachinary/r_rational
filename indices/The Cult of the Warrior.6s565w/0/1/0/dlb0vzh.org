I can highly recommend the first few books if you liked the setting. "The Fall of Reach" tells Master Chief's story up to the first game, "The Flood" is a bit of a mediocre retelling of the first game (only really recommended because of the alternate POVs and that it ties the other two books together), and "First Strike" tells how the Chief got from the end of Halo 1 to the opening of Halo 2.

I should probably reread them now that I've been exposed to rational fiction, now that I think about it, but they're at /least/ as entertaining as the games themselves.
