Not related to the story, but does anyone happen to know how to set a GravityTales account to /send/ email notifications for new chapters of things I'm subscribed to, but /not send/ notifications about other unrelated stuff that I'm not interested in?

All I can find in the account settings is a single checkbox for "Send Email Notifications" with no further granularity.
