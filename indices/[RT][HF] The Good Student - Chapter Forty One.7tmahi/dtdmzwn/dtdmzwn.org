Good to see this story updating again.

Quite interesting that in an effort to rescue Nic, Dizzy effectively sacrificed her own father. It seems like the demon invasion will happen regardless of what Nic did though this sounds more like a backup plan. I think the primary door was still meant to be open in Ransom.
