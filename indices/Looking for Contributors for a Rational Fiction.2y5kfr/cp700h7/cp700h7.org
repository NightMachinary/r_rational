Another rationalist, strong background in theoretical physics and mathematics. Could offer facility for realistic descriptions of inventions, rules for device operation, and general improvisations. I am still new to role-playing (only been playing for about a year now), but I have a strong imagination and enjoy writing.

Would like more information before I fully commit, but you've certainly piqued my interest.
