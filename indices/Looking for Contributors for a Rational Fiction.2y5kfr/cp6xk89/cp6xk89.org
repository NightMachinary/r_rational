This seems interesting, as long as it stays rational instead of rationalist. I'd be stepping out of my depth if I tried to write a rationalist. I will also warn you that I might choose to have my character act irrationally, on purpose, from time to time in order to be unpredictable - it's not entirely rational to be predictable in some scenarios. That would be very situational though, and wouldn't make sense for some characters, so it's not certain that I'd choose to do it.
