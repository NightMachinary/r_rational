Seems like an excellent way to write a rational fiction with characters that have deep thought behind them. I would volunteer to help but seems like there are enough characters probably... I can perhaps help edit or do some consulting on the world if you want someone to bounce ideas off of or help edit together some of the disparate pieces.

As for bona fides - Biology major, lots of experience creating worlds and rulesets, and work as a clinical therapist so have a lot of experience getting into people's heads.
