Just a suggestion given before I go further than the first chapter - would expanding the main villain's influence to the main character's close associates work? For example, for the main villain to have some quality or conviction that can probably be attributed to them, drawing in and/or subverting the MC's friend, little by little, whether by intent or by accident, until before they know it they and the MC are on opposite sides of some issue, and the MC only realizes this hypothetical villain's influence in hindsight?
