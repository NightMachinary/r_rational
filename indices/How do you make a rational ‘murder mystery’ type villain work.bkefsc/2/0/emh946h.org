I really liked this plotpoint in "Black Cloaks, Red Clouds", where one of the characters develops a jutsu that allows them to see backwards in time. This allows them to watch as another character taunts someone by revealing their identity just before killing them. I think this is a really cool concept because it highlights the fact that in a world with magic you're *never* safe: Even if there is no spell in existence that can hope to defeat you, tomorrow it may turn out that there is. So it's a really cool twist on the 'you should have just killed him' trope.

But in that story it only works as a gimmick, because it comes so out of left field. If I were to give that power to the hero right from the start, it could be really cool as a way to give them insight into the villain's past, letting them experience first-hand what their enemy went through to make them like this. But if I were to suddenly give the hero that power now, it would feel like an asspull, I think.
