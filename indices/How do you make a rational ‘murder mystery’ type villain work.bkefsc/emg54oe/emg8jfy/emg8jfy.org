This was just my personal take but I think that it would be interesting if the story developed to the point where the "shadowy puppet-master" simply isn't that important. You did a great job showing how all the actors that created this outbreak of war were motivated by their own individual agendas and perspectives. Is it really necessary to have a single hidden mastermind working in the background who is responsible for everything?

I think that you could have a great story in which the true enemy is the "darkness of the world". The hidden mastermind who arranged for the assassination of the Fourth Hokage and may have contributed to the current conflict can simply be another actor. Defeating him will not solve all the problems in the setting and may not even matter by the time the protagonists discover his identity.

I think it would be interesting if Naruto discovers that Danzo or someone like him was the one who assassinated the Fourth Hokage purely out of a desire for political power or a disagreement with the policies he supported. Naruto might feel some catharsis out of defeating the man who killed his parents, but defeating this individual will not meaningfully help Naruto fulfill his goals of creating a better world. The story can easily continue on after this individual is defeated as there will be many more actors who can serve as individual antagonists to Naruto in his broader conflict with the "darkness of the world".
