I have to confess I haven't read NTBS yet so disregard me if I say something that makes no sense considering the story so far.

That said, one trick I see used from time to time is to have a snippet from the point of view of the villain. He doesn't get named, but he may discuss some details of his plan with a henchmen and end up giving a one or more vague clues as to who he might be. The important bit is to use the opportunity to give weight to his words and establish him as what you want him to be. Dangerous? Brilliant? Planner of twists? Ruthless? It's up to you.

From them on, any ominous remarks, his actual plan, his identity and so on gets ripe for discussion.
