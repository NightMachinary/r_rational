You can make the villain's manifesto or political position public, and have the hero interact with that. They can have moral debates about how correct the villain's means or ends are. They can anticipate things the villain would want to do and try to preempt them. They can try to directly address the parts of the villain's motivation that make it villainous. The hero can discover that part of why the villain's motivation is villainous is because of (maybe justified, maybe not) actions the hero or his allies undertook.

That way, at least the hero gets to interact with the idea of the villain, if not the villain himself.
