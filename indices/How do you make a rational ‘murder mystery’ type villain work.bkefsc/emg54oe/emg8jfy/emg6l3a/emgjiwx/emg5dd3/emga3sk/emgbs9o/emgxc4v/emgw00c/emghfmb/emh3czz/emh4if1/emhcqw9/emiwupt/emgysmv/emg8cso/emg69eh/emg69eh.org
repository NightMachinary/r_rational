One way, if it's purely for some dramatic tension to pull the reader's attention to the bad guy, would be to have a quick flash-back (or flash-sideways, whatever) to a scene where the vilain is plotting, or acting on, or even just thinking about his actions. Show us that he really is being rational by going over things from his perspective (or her perspective). You don't need to describe who they are, or even spend a lot of time on it, just show some of the thought process in a paragraph or two before getting back to the main story.

(I might be way off because I haven't started reading your story yet, but that's one way to do it.)
