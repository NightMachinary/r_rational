In this setting, ridiculously powerful abilities are absolutely allowed, but they have to be the result of cleverness and not a simple increase of 'strength' or 'will'. There will never be a more powerful rasengan for example, but there certainly can be combinations of techniques or clever applications of existing abilities that have greater destructive power. And that's not even mentioning the extreme OPness of mind-control techniques and the like.

With regards to Sannin level brute strength being the cap - it's far below even that, actually. Tsunade has a fraction of her (ludicrous) strength in this setting, Naruto can only create 12 clones at a time and not a thousand, and so on and so forth. Also, there is no amount of 'power' that protects you from being stabbed in the back with a knife, unless you specifically prepared for that sort of thing by hiding your real body and using shadow clones or something. On the other hand, the abilities that people do have are used much more effectively, so e.g. even Kakashi with just the basic Sharingan can seem pretty Hax.

And just like in the real world, the best way to gain power is not through individual skill, but as a team. I've tried to highlight this through the Anbu especially, who are feared by everyone despite not being individually impressive. Zabuza versus Gato illustrates this pretty well, I think.
