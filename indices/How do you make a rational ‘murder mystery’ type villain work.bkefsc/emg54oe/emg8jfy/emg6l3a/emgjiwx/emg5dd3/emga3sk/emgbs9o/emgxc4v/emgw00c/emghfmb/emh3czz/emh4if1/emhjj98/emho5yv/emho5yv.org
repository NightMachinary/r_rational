Yeah I see where your coming from. I got most of the idea from the Metropolitan Man, where the story is from the perspective of the rational mastermind trying to deal with the sudden appearance of Power Creep in his setting. I thought it could be interesting to flip that script, and have it be a rational protagonist trying to become Superman so that they can safely take on the Lex Luthor of their world; but honestly power creep is what ruined Naruto for me, so you deciding to keep it out of your story is a decision I can 100% get behind. If its not too much of a spoiler, can I ask where your thinking about 'capping' the power levels? Are the Sanin the most powerful a ninja can get, brute force wise? Are some of Orochimaru's more... interesting shenanigans on the table, or is he going to be a bit more grounded?
