It sounds like you're trying to emphasize that this main villain's influence matters.

I suggested making his influence cause the main character to have personal stakes in his discovery/defeat, but it sounds like you don't think that's obvious enough? If his influence is more obvious though, then it should be that rational actors in a story would pick up on him more easily.

You did also suggest featuring this villain anonymously in a POV that's adjacent to him, but I'm personally not convinced that'll really achieve the meta-level hero-villain standoff that you're going for, rather than just be a transparent attempt to drum up interest in the villain. You also suggested building him up in the minds of the characters, but I think that also has a chance of coming off as a badly transparent narrative ploy. At the very least, a rational actor shouldn't be giving this main villain too much of the entirety of what thoughts they can spare away from the current crisis they're facing, unless they're the characters that killed off all the emotions and attachments that makes someone human.

It's also possible that you just let the main villain's influence pass over the readers' heads, then nail the reveal when the time comes and bask in self-satisfaction as the readers slap themselves in the head for missing all those signs before. But, well, that also doesn't feature the hero-villain standoff you want.

It may be that this is a case where you have to pick your poison, and go the way that most suits the story you want to tell.

Alternatively, and this is a sudden idea that popped into my head just now, you can make the relation between the main character and the villain more equal by having the main character do something that actually, unexpectedly, hurt the villain. Then have the main character frantically try to work out /how/ exactly they managed that so they could actually concretely better the world, if not outright reveal the villain, while the villain tries to have the main character assassinated at the earliest possible convenience. Or some variation of this idea.
