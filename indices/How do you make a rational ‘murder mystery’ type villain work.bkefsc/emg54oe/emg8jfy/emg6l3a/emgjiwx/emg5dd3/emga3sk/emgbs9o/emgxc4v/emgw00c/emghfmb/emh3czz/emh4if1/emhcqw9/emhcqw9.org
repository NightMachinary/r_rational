(I haven't read your story yet, so apologies if it doesn't fit. I'd just tell you what I would do.)

To have a good murder mystery, you have to commit murder.

Readers aren't usually as deeply invested in the story as the writer is, so you can't rely on subtle hints to make them curious. To make the reader care about the identity of the villain, you have to make him a threat. Pull on the emotional heartstrings of the reader.

My suggestion would be to have the villain attack a character, directly or indirectly. The character has no means of protection, outside of figuring out who the attacker is and stopping him. Now it's a race against the clock. Maybe they find the "villain," but some of the hero team think they have the wrong person. Now they're arguing over it, and the clock is still ticking down.

The villain could have even set this entire thing up just to distract them, so he could easily perform both a power play and a tactical move all at once. There will definitely be a lot or ruminating and speculating about who the villain is, some researching that lands some people in watery graves, and a general heightened sense of "what the heck is going on?"

Hit the heroes hard, and leave them scrambling. I think that's the best way to make a reader care.
