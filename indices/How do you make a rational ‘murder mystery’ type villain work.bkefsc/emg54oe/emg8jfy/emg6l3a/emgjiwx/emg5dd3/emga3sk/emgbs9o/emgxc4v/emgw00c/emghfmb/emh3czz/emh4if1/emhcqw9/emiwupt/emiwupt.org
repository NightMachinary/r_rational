I can answer from a story perspective, however the "rational" sub genre often enjoys reversing story rules to better show their characters intelligence so take this with as many grains of salt as you wish. Personally, I don't see good story and good strategy mutually exclusive so here it goes:

A good antagonist is the antithesis of the hero.

By this I mean that if batman represents order, the joker must represent chaos; MoRHarry represents humanism then RVoldemort represents an apathy toward humanity; etc.

-- the main character and the antagonistic force must be at odds.

The second key ingredient to a good villain is that they must desire the same thing as the protagonist.

Whether for fame, that special guy, or the mcguffin the protagonist and antagonist must be after the same thing to bring them again and again into conflict.

This, I feel, is where I would like to see more. Naruto is realized that the need to grow stronger will not be enough, yet he still cares for things enough to continue its pursuit. I can't yet point to a strong thesis for him. Similarly, I can't point to the strong antithesis of that. I'm also not sure what they're fighting over, just a vague and terrifying arms race.

The world you've made is fantastic- with terrifying foes and uncertainty everywhere. But on this I think there should be certainty: what the protagonist wants (and thereby define what the antagonist wants).
