I like the idea of the villain panicking about the world changing around them, but my preferred solution to the power creep in canon is to just not have it in NTBS. Solving problems by casting a bigger Rasengan is just lazy writing, IMO, and to drive that home Naruto never even learns the Rasengan in this story. The villain is the same way: It's not their sheer power that's scary, but their intelligence what makes them a threat. Now they can certainly be worried about new techniques being invented, but a rational villain wouldn't be concerned about a bigger version of the fireball technique: They'd be afraid of someone inventing a reality-reading, truth seeking spell or something along those lines.
