Awesome, I had no idea you were planning to read the story! I kind of figured you didn't like the slow start and gave up at chapter one or something. Are you waiting until the story is close to finished before reading?

Anyway, I think you're right - what's needed is for the audience to feel some kind of emotional reaction to the villain. The suggestion of using horror novels is a very good one - I'll check out Hybrid Theory for ideas. :)

Aside from that, I think maybe the issue is that only the MC and a few others really knows that the villain even exists. He's afraid to tell anyone else that he knows because he's a 12 year old boy at the start of the story and well, if the villain finds out he knows he just instantly dies (or his friends die). That might make sense from a rational point of view, but... it's *really hard* to get readers to care about something that most of the characters in the story don't even know about.

If it weren't for that, I could have the enemy hang over every conversation that hero & friends have like a looming cloud, kind of like how the Endbringers in Worm were introduced as something nobody wanted to talk about. But if an enemy doesn't exist in the minds of most of the characters then they also don't exist in the mind of the readers. And there's only so much introspective monologuing I can have the MC do before it gets tedious.
