...there's also a risk of a misdirection or proxy, and someone else takes the fall for an antagonist who is later discovered to have gone deeper into hiding... one could also sidestep the whole thing by having the antagonist seemingly-suicide in a way that leaves no identifiable body, maybe saying something about the public persona not being important, and rather not revealing that... one could then subvert that and have someone the protagonist knew never be seen again, with a plausible reason given, but the protagonist always wondering a bit about if that person could have been the identity-unrevealed antagonist... and then maybe if the protagonist doesn't want to lose that person if that person isn't the antagonist, chases that person, can't find that person, wonders if that person wasn't the antagonist, misses that person, then one day after the faked-suicide antagonist is discovered again and trapped and /this time/ the mask taken of, to answer the question of /were you the disappeared person/, and it is in maybe a more satisfying way than an out-of-the-blue reveal... of course there's the question of why disappear the public persona at all, if not revealed yet, but by the point that everything has been broken through that much it would be arguably foolish to keep maintaining a public persona in contact with the protagonist, at least when one can (try to) fake a plausible reason for disappearance and get far enough for safety and to start putting up new safety measures again. It would feel really stupid if you faked your suicide, walked into work the next day and had everyone staring at you and saying "Um, actually we got enough DNA to identify you... thanks for coming in as normal and letting us know that you're still alive to be captured...".

As I muse in sleepiness, I feel as though I can feel myself trying to write a torid (well, in reality hopefully such a fiction would be more interesting than torrid) love-and-hate romance mystery. I wonder if there are any already like that that I could read. Childhood friends with a deep shared history, on-good-terms acquaintances when older, each actually carrying out their own plots at cross-purposes secretly--actually this is sounding like Code Geass, except that has the viewer aware of both sides from the start. Actually that sabotages any effort I might make to look for such a fiction, since by nature it would be a reveal much later. Protagonist defeats antagonist, antagonist has said some things to try to convince protagonist, antagonist has faked death and public persona has disappeared from protagonist's life, protagonist is distressed and also troubled by the thoughts shared, tries to find public persona and can't, hopes that antagonist is alive, antagonist is better hidden, protagonist eventually finds signs of the antagonist still existing, has to defeat /again/ this time not out of moral conflict but because the antagonist would never risk contact otherwise (and at a sign of attention would have fled and hidden yet even more deeply), then after defeating unmasking, confirming the public persona, talking about the rest of the thoughts and motivations, protagonist's aims aligned with the former antagonist's, and then protagonist resumes the previous position while secretly working towards entirely opposite goals from those before, while the former antagonist stays hidden and secretive doing the same sorts of things from outside... each can be monitoring the other and trying not to put the other at risk by letting themselves be monitored, can have scenes where the former antagonist swoops in to pull aggro from the protagonist when the protagonist's changed motivations would have been outed, or the protagonist coming to the former antagonist's rescue... touching moments where they're briefly in the same room alone for a few seconds or minutes, and they smile at each other and have to part, fighting two sides of the same war and puppeteering events toward the same goals...

Digressing, it's fun to think that in both situations the surrounding organisation/society/government would be a sort of 'sleeping antagonist' in both phases. In the first phase, the protagonist would be white-hat, acting in the interests of the organisation, trying to retaliate about the attacks the antagonist are doing to and using the organisation. The protagonist and antagonist would both be manipulating things and trying to stay hidden, and plausibly trying to alert the organisation to the existence of the other, because the organisation would crack down on the activities of /either/... and in the first phase the protagonist might in defeating the antagonist bring the attention and power of the organisation to bear against the antagonist, while slipping in its shadow, and in the in-between stage the protagonist would be trying to find and corner the former-antagonist while both keeping the organisation unaware and keeping the antagonist manipulating the organisation unaware, and in the second stage the protagonist and the former-antagonist would both be trying to manipulate the organisation while keeping it unaware, but even with no one secretly trying to stop them, because of the nature of what they were trying to do (the more meaningful later-game effects) the organisation would perhaps suspect that the antagonist or someone like the antagonist (from when the organisation became aware of the antagonist in the first phase) was doing something, and trying to catch them, the organisation itself becoming the true main antagonist in that second phase... perhaps I should have called it the third phase, and the in-between phase the second phase.

​

This has gone off the rails a lot! I probably need sleep.

​

...though it occurs to me that, though I wouldn't be able to recognise the above sort of story by looking at the first chapters, someone who knew all the reveals could kindly give me spoilers so that I could read it out of enjoyment of the developments, rather than out of curiosity about the developments. Hmm.

​

That, and I suddenly feel I understand the existence of Suzaku/Lelouch and L/Kira BL fanfiction much better now. But there /has/ to be cases where the protagonist and the antagonist in a mystery or detective setting have a budding romance rather than a doomed romance... no, Conan/Kaito Kid would be BL fanfiction again... hmm, now I'm remembering Twig, with a certain person trying to catch (and then being caught by) a certain other person. Actually, maybe that's really close or even closest to what I'm imagining, in which case it probably inspired a lot of the imagination in the first place.

'This is too long' I'm told. Well, that's inconvenient. Splitting this into two comments, one a reply to the other--
