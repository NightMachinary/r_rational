May just be me, but when I'm working on a project or just working thought a technical book, Thinking about myself (physically) is not something I often do. I may think about things I need to do or may want to, but that's about it.

It' a little cheaty, but if you want a villain that prizes obscurity and is good at it, at some point the audience will need to know more than the protagonist or your villain will not get developed. You could just develop him fast during the final confrontation, but that's hard.
