#+begin_quote
  the problem with this tactic is that it's hard to create a meaningful scene if you're not allowed to describe the character it's about.
#+end_quote

Then do something meaningful. The villain wants to kill somebody -> have a scene where they (or a minion) plants a bomb in a place that character usually frequents. (If this was canon, and someone wanted Naruto dead, the obvious place would be the ramen stand.)
