Haha, that's a fun idea, but it doesn't lend itself to a very imposing villain. I mean, they're not very frightening if they're so injured that they don't even know who they are. Although, maybe if they were some kind of fractured Old God type deity, slowly trying to piece themselves back together as the story progresses...

There's definitely potential there - I love amnesia stories when done well - but yes, not something I can just introduce halfway into the story :P
