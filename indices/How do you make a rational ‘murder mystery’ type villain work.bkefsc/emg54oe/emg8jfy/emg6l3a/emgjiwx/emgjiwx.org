I think the problem with the villain in Ntbs is not that you've done a bad job making the readers care about him, it's just that there's nothing to think about. If you try to figure out the villain's identity it'll take you about 30 seconds before your only option left is to start playing guess who with Canon characters. One way to give the readers/main character some evidence to chew on, without breaking the idea that the villain is rational, is to have information which the readers/main character know to be false start to appear. The motivation behind the lie gives the reader some idea of what the villain wants, and that information can then shed light on past events, and give the reader a new lens to view the story with. The villain can stay rational though, because it's not hard to imagine a situation where deceiving the world is worth giving a small amount of information to a group that already knows you exist.
