My first thought is to give the protagonist an investigative tool that the villain doesn't know about. Like the Memento Mortem from Return Of The Obra Dinn, or (Ward spoilers) Kenzie's time camera, or whatever is appropriate in your genre. The villain doesn't cover their tracks against this new method, and leaks evidence. But they may be so generally careful that even this doesn't reveal the greatest evidence, and the signs might start drying up as they become aware of the protagonist's capabilities.
