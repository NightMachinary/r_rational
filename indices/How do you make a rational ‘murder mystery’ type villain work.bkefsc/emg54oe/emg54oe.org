When I took a stab at a "rational" (in approach, not necessarily motivation) murder mystery villain, I had them go to great lengths to cover their tracks, but leave clues behind unintentionally where they had incomplete information. E.g., they dispose of an item through a slot into what they believe to be a half-full waste receptacle of similar items, not realizing that another character emptied it a few hours beforehand--which both makes the item easy to pick out (as it's the only one in the container) and narrows down the time when it must have been deposited. You could probably do something similar with clues to the villain's identity that are only available to the hero because the villain didn't have the info necessary to erase them. It's an asymmetric kind of interaction, but it's something.
