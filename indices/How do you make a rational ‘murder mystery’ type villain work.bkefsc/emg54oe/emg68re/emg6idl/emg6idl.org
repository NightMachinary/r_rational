Haha, I totally would have linked it if I could! It's actually a text roleplaying game I wrote rather than the kind of story that exists in a linkable format. Players investigate the crime scene and surrounding areas and find clues like the above. Also, I love your idea of the villain indirectly betraying their biases through the clues they leave behind.
