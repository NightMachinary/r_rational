The Waves Arisen did that in an attempt to help build up Pain, and it *kind of* worked, but the problem with this tactic is that it's hard to create a meaningful scene if you're not allowed to describe the character it's about. If you write it from the villain's point of view, then it feels strange and cheaty if he or she never actually thinks about themselves - you're in their *head* after all, so why on earth don't you know who they are? And if it's from the perspective of a henchman or omnipresent point of view then it can very rapidly become cheesy, where you're describing an ominous silhouette going "GO FORTH AND DO THIS THING MY MINION" while standing in the shadows and weirdly refusing to turn on the lights.
