I definitely intend for the villain to be manipulative, though not necessarily in that particular way. Either way though, the problem remains that if his efforts are too subtle, the reader doesn't /notice/ them and it's just like he's not doing anything at all. Unless I am using dramatic irony like in HPMOR of course, where the reader notices but the MC doesn't, but in that case the problem again is that it risks making the MC look really dumb.
