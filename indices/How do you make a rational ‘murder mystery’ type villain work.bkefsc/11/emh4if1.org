Just an amateur spit-balling here, but I do have some knowledge of Naruto, so I'll try my best.

I think I know who the villain might be (at least, if your story is anything like canon), but ignoring that ,try this: Have the villain be surprised by the increasing escalation of power, and need to scramble to adjust their plans to it, and so mess up. It could even be a commentary on what it was like growing up watching Naruto.

In the beginning, when we all started watching the anime, demon hosts were the height of pure power, and most fights were won by trickery. The old 'strongest man on Earth' was literally just a guy who was really fast. No explosions, no chakra nukes, no nothing; all we really knew about him was that he was really quick and that, given this was a world of ninja, that made him over-powered. And even that was just a trick he invented, instead of anything innate. That's the world you seem to have established in NTBS. That's the world this rational villain seems to have been operating in for their entire lifetime.

And then gradually, over the course of the series the power levels keep on rising and rising, beyond what was established in the initial world building, until the point where, when I came back to the show after a three year break, it seemed ridiculous. When I watched, a bad guy would throw a knife at a main character, and they would dodge by jumping away. Now, people are throwing giant chakra bombs around, and people are dodging by /temporarily leaving the physical universe, or by temporarily establishing control of reality/ (I still firmly believe the canon Sharingan is just bullshit).

You could have your villain be just as surprised by that, as we were. Have them be shocked by what appears to be a systemic change in the world they've spent their entire lives operating in, where demigods and reincarnation and giant chakra trees exist. You could have them mess up by ruling something out as 'impossible' in their planning (because it truly used to be impossible), and then have it happen. Give them a real, vital reason to go out into the world and collect information themselves, because they're the only one in their organization powerful/stealthy to spy on some of the new, incredibly powerful actors without getting caught, and you can't make plans without accurate information. For example, it takes series skill to be able to spy on Pain in canon. Even Jiraiya, the Leaf's literal spy master (though that might be fanon) couldn't manage it. Rumors that the Rain Village has acquired a literal god as a ruler, and all the spies coming back empty-handed, could be motivation enough for the mastermind to get of their butt and go investigate personally, if Rain is somehow that important to their plans. That is, of course, assuming Pain isn't the mastermind.

Essentially just have the evil mastermind be just as surprised by the never-ending power-scaling as we were, so that them having to think on their feet and make mistakes becomes rational. The world of Naruto undergoes some pretty serious change in just a few short years in canon (from low level ninja fights to literal cosmic beings descending from the heavens to start the apocalypse); have the mastermind be just as swept up in that as everyone else.
