You could try to play around it a little bit. The fear of something is often greater than the actual thing. Make the "real" villain the protagonist's self doubts.

Maybe the villain reminds the protagonist of a past trauma? You could try hyping him up by talking about your main's backstory. "Oh, A abused me, A and the villain are so similar." Show how helpless the protagonist felt then and how he doesn't know how to escape the ouroboros.

Make the protagonist imagine, what it would do to his self worth, if he failed at stopping him. Make him feel responsible for the villain's existence. Kinda like Bruce Wayne feels that without Batman, there wouldn't be a Joker (That doesn't necessarily have to be true, but it can be from the protagonist's perspective.)
