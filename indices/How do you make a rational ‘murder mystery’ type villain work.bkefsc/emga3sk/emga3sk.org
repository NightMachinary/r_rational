I have insufficient knowledge of Naruto to give story specific advice (does canon Naruto even have a single villain?) but I do understand that it involves clans of ninjas fighting and that Leaf is both morally ambiguous and vulnerable to coup.

Well, maybe. It depends... mostly on whether they have any interest in public relations. Which they well might, if your story is ultimately about war and politics. Consider Osama Bin Laden. I'd say he was both sufficiently morally misguided and sufficiently motivated to play the role of an evil storybook antagonist, and he was at least rational enough to exist in the real world. The public was certainly pretty fascinated with him. He absolutely gave speeches / propaganda, taunted, etc. He did ultimately die (although I don't think his own life was his top priority, so it's not clear to what degree he /lost/). Maybe he's actually just the idiot who took the figurehead position. But if you are /openly/ an enemy of the protagonist, there are plenty of reasons to speak openly to them. Or at least openly speak to the public. Perhaps through a pseudonym or figurehead if you have a compelling reason to be /both/ secretive and open.

Also I think it /matters/ that you are writing a world where a powerful ninja is a military force in their own right (unlike our world, where a world class fighter can be defeated by two basic-training soldiers)

Note that your rational protagonist is showing up in person plenty of times. If your rational antagonist is able to accomplish their goals nameless and faceless, you need to give a good reason why they're able to do this because accomplishing a goal without involving oneself is harder than it seems.

THAT SAID if that doesn't fit with your character that's fine! You can just have the protagonist be upset about the smaller agents of the real antagonist, or tell the story of how they piece together who the real driver of events is. If that is the case, audience fascination with the antagonist themselves wouldn't be the important part of the story.
