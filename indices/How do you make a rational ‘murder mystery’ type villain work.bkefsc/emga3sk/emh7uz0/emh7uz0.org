Yeah, but this is a *murder mystery* type plot. Sure, I could have written a different type of scenario where the villain is happy to be out in the open, but that kind of defeats the point of having a mystery. Besides, it's a story about rational ninjas: It just makes sense to have a villain who relies on being unseen. And let's be honest, if you were living in a world where 90% of the people around you are supernatural assassins, you'd want to keep a low profile too.

That said, it's entirely possible for the villain to have a separate public persona, and I very definitely intend for the villain to be someone that the reader is already acquainted with by the time their true intentions are revealed. But the issue with that is that if you have the villain playing the role of a friendly old grandma for 90% of the story, it just doesn't feel satisfying to have them end up as the villain of the story. There needs to be real hero-villain interaction, in order to build up the conflict leading up to their ultimate confrontation.
