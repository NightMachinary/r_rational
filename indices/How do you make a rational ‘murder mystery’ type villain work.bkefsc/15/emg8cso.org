Disclaimer: Not an author (yet), nor have I read your story (though I want to). At the same time, I read constantly, and the expert fears the clueless beginner (or something).

1. There's a new villain in town, and he's an arrogant fuckwit making cliche movie mistakes. New guy is a) hired by the main villain as a proxy but it was a mistake, b) a new independent villain making too much noise. New guy gets silenced while the hero is investigating, leaving him baffled by the uncharacteristic silence. If we're going with A, then there's probably going to be several more new guys for that kind of mistake to slip through. Main villain might be branching out or suddenly needing the extra work. Problem: this might cause viewers to feel cheated about the new guy's sudden semi-explained death.
2. Write from the PoV of someone in partial or constant contact with the villain but isn't told anything, such as a maid. They'll pick up a few things, but ultimately have no idea of what is going on. Merging these obscure details with the protagonist's obscure details could lead to the audience having slightly less obscure details.
3. Write a chapter from the PoV of the main villain in an entirely new language unknown to humanity. Never explain it to anyone, to the extent that it will never be fully solved even centuries after your death. What little they somehow figure out can be cleverly utilized by you as intentional foreshadowing.
