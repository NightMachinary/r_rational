That's clever and makes sense, but it's more a way to make a rational villain vulnerable than to create real hero-villain interplay. Ideally you'd want the villain to make a mistake in a way that's directly tied to their personality, giving the hero an 'aha' moment where they realize the enemy has the same bias and motivation they do or something like that. Hm, that gives me some ideas actually - thanks!
