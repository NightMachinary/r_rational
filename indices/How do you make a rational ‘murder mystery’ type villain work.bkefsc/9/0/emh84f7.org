I set out first and foremost to write a good story, the rationality part comes second. The mystery part is not *essential*, but I do very much like the challenge of writing a story about a villain who absolutely refuses to cooperate in their own defeat, to the extent that the hero isn't even quite sure they *exist*. I've never really seen that done well, which is part of why I wanted to give it a try.
