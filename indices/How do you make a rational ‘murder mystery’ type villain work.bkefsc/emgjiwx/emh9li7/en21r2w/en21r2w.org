I read somewhere that authors almost universally overestimate the ability of readers to solve a mystery, because from their perspective whatever hints they've been dropping form a perfectly cohesive picture in their mind, but no one else can put them together because they aren't working backwards from the solution. On top of this, whilst the main character is likely to devote considerable time and effort into piecing together clues, readers just... aren't going to.

This makes things difficult for a rational mystery, because any solution that a character devoting considerable time and effort can't reach is pretty much impossible for readers to find, unless they have /considerable/ extra information.

I've actually seen advice for authors that states that to put together a compelling mystery for readers, the author should take absolutely no steps to hide the solution beyond just not saying it outright - the readers will have enough trouble piecing together what's happened on their own, without increasing the complexity of the task.

As for your story, I'm a reader and can sadly confirm that whilst I'm enjoying it, I've put very little effort into figuring out who the villain might be - as the OP of this comment chain says, there's just nothing to work with. There's not really any point in speculating without further data.
