Some options:

- The villain has a "evildoing" face as well as a "public" one, and the heroes start running into the villain under his "evildoing" face. (Remember Orochimaru going after Sasuke, while still being in disguise as the Kazekage? ) This makes sense if the villain needs to see to critical matters personally.

- Or, just with letters and messengers, the villain starts trying to recruit or convert the hero. After all, the villain is confident in their Eminently Rational cause and worldview, and can Rationally Perceive the hero's potential danger if not converted - or at least diverted. Can the hero use the villain's efforts to uncover the villain's true identity? Or will the hero be corrupted himself by his attempt to play along with this Eminently Rational villain?

- The villain's mentor is caught, or even turns himself in, and reveals to us the villain's past and likely plans. Alas, the mentor doesn't know the villain's current face. Learning the enemy's personality, we can start to guess who he might be - will the hero find out for sure in time? [Silence of the Lambs, and other 'key informant helps detective' plots.]

- Captured records or underlings makes the villain's larger plan apparent, revealing their personality under their "villain alias" even if we don't know their public name.

- The villain's bright young lieutenant becomes a "villain protagonist" POV, working against the heroes, following orders from their masked mastermind.

- Something happens to change the villain's priorities. New technology shows up; a key ally gets sick or dies; a foreign enemy gets interested sooner than the villain expects; a foreign opportunity opens that's too good to pass up, or that others will seize first if he doesn't. The villain gives up some secrecy versus the hero, starts accepting mistakes in disguise, in order to fight well on this "second front."

- The villain openly reveals himself in some way! But what is his plan? Why did he come into the open? Can we figure out his true intention before it's too late?

- We've figured out who the villain is, but we can't get anybody to believe us! Everyone else seems to be blackmailed or manipulated. How can we get enough proof to convince everyone else, before the villain decides we ourselves are too dangerous to let live? [Many 'palace intrigue' plots.]
