Idly thinking [Edit: Or rather, idly rambling]:

​

Where there is power of life-and-death, there narratively needs to be a higher priority not to make use of it. This could be 'The protagonist's blood or other MacGuffin is key to my plot, and my plot is more important to me than my risk of death! The world in my image, or nothing!', or it could be 'Argh, I know who and where the antagonist is, but I don't know where he's keeping the hostages that I would become the enemy of the world to protect, or who have vital/knowledge/powers/[MacGuffin] for my own desired future of the world!', or it could be 'Argh, I know who and where the antagonist is, but if I bungle the capture then the killswitch will go off and the whole planet will be exploded!' or similar...

​

The other side of that is a Kira/L situation, where both sides are protecting themselves through anonymity, and neither knows who is the one working against them. Of course, both could have seemingly-unrelated public personas, maybe even ones which have directly interacted (depending on the personal risk estimated by the characters), but for your preferences perhaps not directly leaving messages for each other. Here, both sides would be trying to use the /changes/ made by the other to trace back their mode of operation and originating motivations-and-identity. (Start with 'dunwhat', guess at the 'whydunnit', trace back the 'howdunnit' to get the 'whodunnit' while being informed about guesses about the 'whydunnit'...)

​

Keep in mind that there can be multiple levels, in that the protagonist can be in the power of the antagonist, and try to be worth more to the antagonist alive than dead, but /also/ taking more secretive actions which would get the protagonist killed if the antagonist ever realised what they were doing. Likewise with the antagonist--you can have a situation where the antagonist is in the protagonist's power and grudgingly cooperating with the protagonist against a third party that they're both most-strongly opposed to, but have the whole thing be the antagonist manipulating things behind the scenes, and even deliberately leaving the protagonist alive so that people who trust the protagonist aren't worried about the antagonist, and then you can have /another/ level in which the protagonist is watching all of this and pretending to be taken in while he lets the antagonist either contact all the people he needs (to be arrested in one huge sweep) or otherwise arrange MacGuffins in a way favourable for the protagonist's ends...

​

That last case, with multiple levels, is very fun to imagine but could be tricky to implement--you'd have to be very clear in portraying the multiple levels for at least one of the characters, such as showing what the protagonist is thinking about what the antagonist's truly thinking while the protagonist is talking with the antagonist and pretending to be taken in, and the antagonist is also talking on the surface level... it's fairly uninteresting if you're in a Watson position and have twist sprung on you one after another without getting to follow the thought process, and it's also fairly uninteresting if you know both sides' thoughts on all levels and there's no suspense or surprise about which one 'has the upper hand' at any given moment, but perhaps you could do a balance where each person's two-/multiple-levels of thought are phrased ambiguously enough that it's not clear to the reader which person's specifics are correct. That could be unsatisfying, though.

​

Ultimately, the 'neither side knows the other' is most satisfying for me to imagine (if I had to choose), rather than the surface-and-hidden thoughts of Kira talking with L in person. The chill that you feel when you notice things that have been done--(from a protagonist's perspective) you expected an organisation to do a certain thing, or the police to handle something in a certain way, or /something/ to happen according to your predictions, and it's... different. Surprise, disconcertion, at some point the realisation that the most likely possibility is that someone with some measure of power is doing this for their own unknown goals while keeping themselves in the darkness, and the question being /what are you going to do about it/ and how can you do so safely...

​

Hmm. I'm thinking now about how the ending can be satisfying rather than unsatisfying. Too much focus on unmasking the public persona of the antagonist feels as though it would be anticlimactic--'Successfully trapping and seizing the Ghost Mafia Boss who's been puppeteering everything until we mapped out his methods' sounds more satisfying than 'And the TRUE identity of the Ghost Mafia Boss was--unassuming janitor Old Man Giggers!'. In that sense, you don't even have to have the public persona be a known character: once you seize the antagonist, known by the antagonist's actions and plots throughout the fiction, you could have a note in the epilogue about what the antagonist's name and formative years were found out to be like in wrap-up investigations, or else told directly to the protagonist in an effort to convince the protagonist to /change their mind/ (which could also start a sequel, in which the former protagonist is actually convinced by the antagonist, and starts working against people on their own former side to try to undo the damage they did in the first fiction...).

​

Thinking about HPMOR, with faded memories, the impression strikes me that Harry seemed to spend a lot more time reacting rather than acting--he had an understanding that there was a mysterious enemy, and he had doubts about whether it was Voldemort or not, but most of what he did was trying to build stronger defenses against attack without reaching out and trying to work out how to (trace back and) get to his enemy. In this respect, Dumbledore did better--he at least set a trap, such that the enemy would definitely go the trap, definitely be trapped by the trap (averted), and /whoever/ it was be known to be the enemy by that they came to the trap to be trapped. (Pretty much, that is.)

​

Hmmm, returning to your original wording. Yes, in summary, rather than speculating about who the known-persona might be (if any known-persona at all), without the known-persona necessarily being at all important (and ideally it wouldn't be, as if your public persona is critical for your plots then you have a bullseye painted on you for both public and private enemies), arguably more worthwhile to have the Kira approach of where the protagonist/detective makes up a moniker for the antagonist and tries to either trace back their methods/(loose ends) or catch them based on their derived motivations/plans, or both.

​

...continuing to ponder... for murder mysteries with finite characters, the antagonist being a known character is pretty much Knox's First Commandment, this presumably gets weaker if dealing with large cities and if it would be foolish or otherwise improbable for the antagonist to come into close contact with the protagonist--ah, though it could be fun if two people have a special shared history or shared qualities, and then it's later a shock to them both that they were each other's nemeses. Easy to guess by readers, though, if the foreshadowing is clear enough to be meaningful.

​

....not a matter of 'it turns out the Ghost Mafia Boss was actually janitor Giggers all along' but 'it turns out janitor Giggers was actually the Ghost Mafia Boss all along'... argh, how to frame the thoughts...
