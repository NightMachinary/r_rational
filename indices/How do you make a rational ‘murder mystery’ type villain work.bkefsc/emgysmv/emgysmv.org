It sounds like you want a rational villain.

​

So the commit the murder in the first place, something was interfering with his rationality (eg: being drugged or drunk ....) or committing the murder was done to avoid some greater harm.

​

Lots of detective stories are "follow the money," or more generally qui benefacit animae (who benefits).

​

Could we have the "villain" be killing the person for a very good reason that is not initially known to the reader and as we go further through the book we are exposed to many good, but not good enough, reasons and ultimately find the actual motive?
