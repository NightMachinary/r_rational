This probably isn't good to set up late in a story, but:

Ninjas are assassins. If two (or more) ninja swapped targets, then they could arrange both the death and having a solid alibi. This might also be good generally, for matching up targets with ninja who are good at exploiting their weaknesses. (They also might be able to cover for each other during the time when they're doing the other's assassination, using the jutsu for disguise and "clones".)
