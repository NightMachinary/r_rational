What I find this genre sometimes lacks is that while rationality involves thinking things through and not holding the idiot ball, humans by default can make mistakes, or sometimes there's simply no perfect, right answer. Unfortunately, a lot of people assume a rational character is always a genius that is aware of all the facts and can always find the correct action or choice - which is rather the opposite, as a true rational character must accept irrational events and work around them, if it's lack of information, other characters not working in their best interests, a past mistake that is now undoable, or even simply failure to follow through; it's one thing to know what you need to do, and another to actually do it.

You can have a villain perfectly adhering to rational nature while picking an unfavorable choice, either due to a reasonable mistake that led to that decision, or because at the time of choosing there was no way to tell which choice would have been better, and now he's paying for that.
