I do think a 'darkness of the world' type antagonist is very interesting, and I definitely want to incorporate elements of that in this story (a lot of Naruto's internal monologue as well as the Fourth's mission is about exactly that.) The problem however is that this doesn't lend itself to a very satisfying ending. If the solution is a gradual increase in rationality for the world's populace, then there is no clear point where the story should end. Same if the hero loses and just... what, gives up? Not very satisfying!

Canon Naruto gets around this by playing with the same idea of 'darkness', but also having a big villain who represents that struggle who can then be defeated to unite the world. Of course, the author handled the end very badly, but the idea was there. I do think you can make a story where the villain is a concept work, but it wouldn't be easy...
