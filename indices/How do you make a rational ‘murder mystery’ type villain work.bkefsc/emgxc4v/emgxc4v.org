On mobile, so overly brief: I thought this was handled very well in /Hybrid Theory/ by Blade and Epsilon, to the point where I thought the story suffered when the protagonist gave the villain a name even in her own mind. It was a very effective nameless villain just by the villain clearly existing and clearly being very powerful and their true nature being very mysterious but known-to-the-author. It may be that the advice you want is from horror novels - how to make the reader scared of things that have no names. If the reader doesn't care who your villain is, my first thought is not that you haven't dropped enough hints, but that you haven't done enough to scare the reader and the viewpoint character. But your story is on my “to read” rather than “already read” list so I'm advising blind here.
