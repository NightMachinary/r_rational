Yeah, I was thinking that too. I did drop hints throughout the story about the nature of the villain, but I've always erred on the side of caution because I'm worried that I'll make it too obvious and the audience will go "oh, so that's who it is." But I think you're right: If I divide it up into more side plots, or have the MC investigate something that turns out to be a dead end, then at least there'll be *something* for the audience to speculate about.

*Slight spoiler:* What I think I'll do is that after all this, one of the characters goes and investigates all of the villain's sub-plots, trying to work out how this war started etc. That should give plenty of material to speculate about, I think.
