Fair enough! I think spacing is also an issue here: every 'main plot' scene that gives hints as to what's going on behind the scenes is several chapters and sometimes months apart. And like you said, usually those scenes are stuck in the middle of a whole bunch of other stuff going on.

I think you're right: Hopefully, once the investigation takes centre stage in the next arc/act, the mystery will start to loom bigger in people's minds.

Btw, the scene I was referencing was this:

  Hayate silently dropped to the ground and ran up to where his quarry had vanished, his exhilaration replaced by dread as he realized he had not been paranoid after all. The enemy had left no trace behind, except... he traced a finger down the stone wall, which felt strangely granular to the touch. He pressed his hand to the surface, and the whole segment collapsed in a cloud of fine dust that invaded his nose and mouth and nearly caused him to go down in another fit of coughing.

  With one arm guarding his face he descended down the narrow tunnel, expelling chakra from his feet to stop himself from falling through the dust. Before long a chamber filled with stone pillars opened up before him, but the ground was far too even to be natural and too bare to be intended for human use. He ducked his head to enter, almost having to crouch under the low-hanging stone that had to be the foundation of the Hokage residence, and that was when he saw his target: Something which he had taken to be a shadow was flitting from one support pillar to the next, draped in a black cloak and hood that blended with the darkness as though it were part of it, moving about and doing something to the walls -- and then stopped, and turned around. A baleful crimson eye blazed in his direction.

  ...

  Hayate tried to cry out in alarm, but he must have inhaled some of the dust because he went down coughing. One by one his shadow clones vanished, until he was the last one left. His hands were slick with blood.

  The explosive tags detonated with the fury of a thousand suns.
