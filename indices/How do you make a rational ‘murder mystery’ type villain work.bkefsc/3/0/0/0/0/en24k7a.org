To be honest, I'd actually forgotten that someone with a red eye had blown up the Hokage building, which I suppose is a sign of me not engaging with the mystery very much.

I might actually just be the wrong person to ask about this though - I wouldn't be speculating about Mistborn trivia, I'd just wait until the next book came out with the answer. I may not be your target audience for the mystery!

With that disclaimer, if I had to guess, I think the main reason is that so far the mystery feels like a background detail. Everything happening to our protagonists thus far has been almost entirely disconnected from it - you've pretty much outright stated that current events are only going as they are due to malign interference, but it's overshadowed /by/ those events - they're the story I'm engaging with. It's ideal for a rational villain hiding their identity, but I only have so many thoughts to devote to your story (lovely as it is) and they're all going towards what's actually happening onscreen. Trying to work out who the real villain is just seems both unproductive (there's nothing to go on) and a bit less important.
