Ok, but then what does invite readers to speculate? I mean, obviously if the hints are too obscure it doesn't work, but if it's immediately obvious what's going on there's no speculation either. How do writers like Brandon Sanderson do this? I remember endlessly speculating about every detail of his Mistborn trilogies and excitedly talking about it with other readers at the time. But when I think about it, stuff like Vin's earring didn't give the reader much to go on either: You just knew that she had it, you knew something about the mechanics, and she occasionally displayed an unusual power. That was it, and it was still enough to get me guessing. :s

HPMOR was the same way. A lot of stuff was really subtle or hard to guess, and everyone still speculated about it. Is it just a case of having a bigger fandom to discuss it with? Or is it more that the mysteries are more explicit, like how a guy in a black cloak shows up and attacks Hermione from her POV, and it just *feels* more mysterious than the Hokage building being blown up by someone with a red eye.

Or perhaps, it's more that in HPMOR there were just three real suspects (Harry, Dumbledore, Quirrel) and you already had a pretty good who they were and what motivated them, while in NTBS there's dozens of characters but they all have less screentime?
