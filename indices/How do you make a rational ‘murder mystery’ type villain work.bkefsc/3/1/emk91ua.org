  I think the problem with the villain in Ntbs is not that you've done a bad job making the readers care about him, it's just that there's nothing to think about. If you try to figure out the villain's identity it'll take you about 30 seconds before your only option left is to start playing guess who with Canon characters.

Nailed it. Or at least, that's the way it feels to me as a NTBS reader.
