the easy solution, is to assume one (or more) supernatural sources of powers. does not matter what excuse you use, as long as its internally consistent. i would recommend looking at [[https://archive.org/stream/MyRpgCollection/Aberrant_Corebook#mode/2up][Aberrant]] a superhero RPG that has a ton of setting material. their excuse is quantum (and noetic is another powersource).
