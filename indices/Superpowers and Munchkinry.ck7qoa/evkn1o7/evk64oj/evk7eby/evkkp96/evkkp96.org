I concur about supernatural being the way to go (as long as you don't go all Hancock with it). Since superpowers necessarily violate the hell out of physics, delineating the precise point at which you throw Newton et al out the window is probably a secondary concern. Also, most everybody accepts that it's all handwavey BS on some level (in Worm, for example, the nigh-omnipotent entities' plan to make themselves stronger by seeing how a bunch of ignorant and puny aliens use their borrowed powers to fight each other is hard to read as anything but silly. But nobody cares AFAICT, because we know it's just a device to enable the story.).

I'd focus more on making the powers interesting and standing out from the crowd, because the crowd in this case is enormous. Between Worm and the MCU, superheroes have hardly ever been more popular, with both readers and authors, but most of what I've seen stays bound within a fairly narrow set of tropes.
