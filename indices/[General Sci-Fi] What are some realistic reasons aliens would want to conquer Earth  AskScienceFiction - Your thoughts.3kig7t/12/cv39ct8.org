This is what I posted on the scifi thread:

Those that are better at reproducing in a species will become more numerous over time and become typical. So it can be assumed that whatever strange demographic effects novel memes and cultures can have on a species, long term it will resume exponential growth until all available resources are consumed. If the average weight of the human is about 50kg (guess) then the entire human population will be about 350 megatons. If the human population grows at a rate doubling every century (very slow) then they will multiply by a thousand every millennium (210=1024) So in a thousand years humans will be 350 gigatons after another millennium 350 teratons etc. In 7000 years that slow growth rate would lead to humanity having a mass of 350x1027kg Compared to the mass of all the planets in the solar system being 2.668x1025kg another millennium and humans will have more mass even than the Sun included 1.992x1030kg. So long before this point is reached there would be a strong incentive for any of these space habitats to migrate to another solar system where exponential growth could resume. Ignoring the speed of light continuing to grow 3 orders of magnitude every millennium would see humanity with a mass of 350x1042kg in 12,000 years compared to the total mass of the galaxy of 6x1042kg. So instead I think the question is not "why would they invade?" but instead "Why have not the entire mineral resources of the solar system been consumed already?" During the last several billion years during which complex life has been possible, to which I think the answer is: life like us is incredibly rare. Either that or: space faring is not really possible.
