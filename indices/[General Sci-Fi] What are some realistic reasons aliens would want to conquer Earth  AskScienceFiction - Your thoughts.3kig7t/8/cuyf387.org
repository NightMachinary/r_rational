In my mind, the three most likely reasons for aliens to want to conquer Earth are:

- First, Xenophobia. Incompatible species/ they don't trust us/ we smell bad/ we eat things that look like them/ Really bad experiences with other aliens before us/ etc.

- Second, Colonization. They are more advanced than us. We are taking up valuable space and resources. We steal valuable components and resources from them. We are a possible disease vector.

- Third, Religion or something analogous to it.

When I say conquer Earth, I mean eradicate humans. All they would have to do is look at our history (or perhaps their own if they were like us) and see that if they don't get rid of all of us, they might as well not attack us at all. Otherwise we're just going to use asymmetrical warfare against them in any scenario short of mind control technology or their-science-is-magic levels of technical disparity.
