I gave a similar answer in the original thread but didn't want to post it in this one for fear of contamination. General AI may just be very very hard, or it may be lesss economical than the fairly trivial task of coercing a bunch of already existing intelligent natives to do the work. This is unlikely to be repetitive manual labour, but more like complex construction, engineering and design work thats hard to automate.

  The real question, to my mind, is why they would try to conquer instead of just engage in trade.

Several reasons. Perhaps our current political and economic system isn't suited to their needs and they think they can run it more effectively. Why have any humans wasting precious hours on creating non-essential products when they can all be working for you? Also trade would over time increase our power relative to them, which might be bad, why give us the chance to reverse engineer technology or in other ways become a threat?
