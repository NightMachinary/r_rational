Sufficiently advanced trade is indistinguishable from conquest. Apple Inc. has more actual power over people's day to day lives than the Chinese military. (More money, too.) That was effectively the original plan in /A Deepness in the Sky/: sell the aliens space travel, portable electronics, perhaps a few cryptography algorithms, and you'll own a significant fraction of the planet's economy. Then freeze yourself for a few decades while the industry catches up with the new technology, and when you wake you can buy your very own city-sized starship.

Not significantly different, in my mind, from conquering the planet and building your own starship factories, except that less people die.
