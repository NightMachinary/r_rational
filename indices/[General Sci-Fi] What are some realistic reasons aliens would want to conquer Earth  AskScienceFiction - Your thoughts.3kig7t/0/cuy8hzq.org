It's interesting to me that most people assume that aliens which come to Earth would have no interest in actual Earthlings for the purposes of slavery. I suppose the thought is "if you have interstellar travel, you already have all the AI and robotics that you need, so why use humans". I'm not entirely sure that's correct though. After all, humans would technically have the capacity for interstellar travel via generation ship, if we really put our capital towards it, and we don't have unlimited robotics or artificial intelligence.

So imagine a species that is maybe twenty years ahead of our own in terms of technology. Either they don't care one whit about human life, or they're in truly dire straits, but either way they've decided that the need both the production and intellectual capacity of an alien species. That gives them plenty of reason to conquer Earth, especially if they're naturally disinclined towards cooperation. This is especially the case if they don't have a home to go back to for one reason or another, or if "home" is so far away that it's hardly worth thinking about.

The real question, to my mind, is why they would try to conquer instead of just engage in trade. But if you go down that path, I suppose you have /A Deepness in the Sky/.
