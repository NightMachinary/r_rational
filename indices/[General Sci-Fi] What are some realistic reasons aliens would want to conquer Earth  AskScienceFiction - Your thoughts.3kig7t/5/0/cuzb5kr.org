You know, I think I might have to argue with the notion that quasi-Friendly singletons are realistic. Just because /Prime Intellect/ and its spiritual successor are available to us, doesn't mean things really work that way.

In fact, I imagine, since these things are more like directions than locations, that if you switched on a UFAI, you would just get obviously Unfriendly behavior /really quickly/, because it would never condition on new information about the human operators' intentions. The degree to which this is true determines the degree to which we need to either Solve Everything Forever This One Time, or can use more gradual or learning-based approaches to solving the actual problem.
