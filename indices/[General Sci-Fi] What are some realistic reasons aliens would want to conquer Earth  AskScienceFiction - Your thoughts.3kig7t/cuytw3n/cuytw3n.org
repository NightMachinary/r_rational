The quartz-based alien lifeforms have been in communication with our trees for millions of years. Recently the trees asked them to come to the planet and help them reduce the number of a pest population that was causing global deforestation, and the trees offered a significant portion of Earth's silicon reserves as payment. The quartz-based life forms don't operate on our timescales, and neither us nor they can perceive the other as living.
