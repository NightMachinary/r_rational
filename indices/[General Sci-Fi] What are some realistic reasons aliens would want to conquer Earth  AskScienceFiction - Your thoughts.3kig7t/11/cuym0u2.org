Why do humans conquer things? Religion, Revenge (political showboatmanship), Resources, Glory

To me it feels like Colombus, Glory, Gold and God. Speculating on alien religion seems pointless as there is no information to think about. It is unlikely humanity has managed to offend another species that is hitherto unknown unless it is for moral objections (disregard for plantlife, and climate change etc.). In terms of resources, we don't have many that uninhabited planets lack. Our minerals, are not rare. Our organic compounds are the only thing likely to get us looked at if the aliens haven't seen them before.

My take on this is that we end up with Aliens like Cortes who see some of Earth's organic compounds and want to see all of them so that they can artificially generate more. It turns out to be cheaper to make humans do it than build machines, and so aliens try to conquer the planet because humans don't want to have the planet teraformed to support genetically modified organisms that just generate organic molecules for aliens.
