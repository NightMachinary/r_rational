I see a lot of arguments that resources aren't a good reason to invade the earth, that there's easier places to get resources elsewhere.

But if you're an alien ASI and the first/only known singleton, you might want /all/ the resources. Sure Mars is empty, and it'd dismantle Mars too, but eventually it'd want all those atoms the earth is made from.

Another potential explanation might be that this singleton sees us heading towards developing our own strong AI, and tries to wipe us out to protect its status as the singleton.
