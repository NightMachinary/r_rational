Conquest makes sense if they don't trust humans to implement their productivity improvements, and those improvements weigh up to the cost of conquest. Humans may not volunteer to be hooked up with a dopamine pump linked to the aliens' utility function, but such a device would probably improve productivity significantly for typical work-to-get-paid types.

Also, I don't see how trade would work without the threat of force from the aliens: the hosts could offer an extremely crooked deal if the aliens' are dependent on them for basic necessities.
