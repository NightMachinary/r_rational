We do not yet know how common liquid water worlds are. Even if they are reasonably common, it's still probably cheaper to establish a colony on an existing planet than build the equivalent surface area of habitable volume in space.

Room for population expansion is one of the most likely reasons for an advanced race to colonize and/or war with other races.
