Controlling the planet is one thing. Keeping humans from killing your people is another thing entirely.

See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footfall][Footfall]] which may not be entirely rational, but it's not completely irrational either.

But if you want 100% rational, look at how painful it was for coalition forces to stay in Iraq and Afghanistan. You might also look up how hard it was for the Soviets in Afghanistan, and they were FAR harsher on the Afghans than the coalition ever was.
