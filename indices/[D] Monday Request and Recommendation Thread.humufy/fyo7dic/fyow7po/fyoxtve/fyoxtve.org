When kindle started getting big several years ago (2010ish), I started buying a lot of books from them. My spending on books was easily 10x what it had been previously (from an admittedly very low level). Then, when they started increasing the amount of self-published stuff, their recommendations went to crap. I don't trust anything they recommend anymore and as a result, I buy far far fewer books than I used to (pretty much sticking to only authors I already know and like, I don't buy anything new on Kindle unless I have some other, non-kindle recommendation that I trust).

All of that is a really long winded way of saying I would love a sub like that that separates the gems from the crap.
