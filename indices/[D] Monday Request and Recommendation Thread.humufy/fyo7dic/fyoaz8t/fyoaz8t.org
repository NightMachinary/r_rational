It's not super rational, and has been recc'd here before, but I really enjoyed Scott Lynch's Gentleman Bastard series. If you haven't already read the first one, give it a try: [[https://www.amazon.com/Lies-Locke-Lamora-Gentleman-Bastards/dp/055358894X]]

It's fantasy/adventure/outwitting/snark series, with a few 'creative problem solving' moments.
