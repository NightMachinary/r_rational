the beginning would be the same song, but at the 4th "bee" the lyric deviate to ask practical question, slowly at first, at some point the music is more of a parody of modern society than anything else.\\
then someone ask the most obvious question : "bees ? there are humans outside, they are monstrous, what should we do about that ?" and the music stop dramatically.

at some point, there is a bee that ask itself : "we know everytime we say "bee" we get smarter, that why we have ritual song where we repeat it. But is it just us, or the entire world ? and if it's the world, how do we know when we are ahead and then stop saying "bee" ? "
