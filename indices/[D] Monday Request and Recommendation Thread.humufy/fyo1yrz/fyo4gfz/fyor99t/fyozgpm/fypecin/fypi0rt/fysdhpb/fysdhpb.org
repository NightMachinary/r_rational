Yes, I use libgen and have an ebook private tracker and seedbox, so there's no distinction in price or convenience between web stuff and published stuff. I typically pirate the first book in a series and will buy the rest if I want to read them, or gifts for others in paperback if it's really good. I'd recommend investing time and energy into a similar workflow if you're a big reader and you don't hold respecting copyright as a central tenet of your morality.
