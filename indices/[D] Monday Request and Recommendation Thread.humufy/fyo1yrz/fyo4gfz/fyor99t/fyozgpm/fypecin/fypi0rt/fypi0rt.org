Most published novels are free if you know where to look. Library genesis has +99% of novels in their fiction section.. Novels are particularly nice on mobile, whenever you're waiting in line or something you can just open the app and read a couple pages rather than playing a game or checking instagram.

PS. you should have ublock origins or an equivalent extension installed, although after checking they don't even seem to have ads so you don't need it for this but it's still good to have.
