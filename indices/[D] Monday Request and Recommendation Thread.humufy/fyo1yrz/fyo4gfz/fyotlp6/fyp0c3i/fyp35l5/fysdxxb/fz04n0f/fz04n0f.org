You can also try Alex Verus. It's an urban fantasy series set in London. Alex starts off sorta similar to Dresden (with a similar background as well), except without the antiquated views on women. His main power is to see the possibilities in the very short term future, which makes for interesting fights. There's also no bullshit like "I reached deeper into my reserves than ever before."
