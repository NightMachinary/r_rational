Speaking of Amazon, does anyone know of a self publishing recommendation subreddits? There are thousands of new Kindle books, most are really, really bad, but there are quite a lot that at least fall into the michael bay-style brainless entertainment category.

Looking for recommendations on [[/r/fantasy]] or [[/r/books]] or [[/r/sci]]-fi just gets you the same 10 books over and over again. I've had better luck here and on the litrpg and progression fantasy subs, but they aren't great for anything outside their specific niche and haven't found anything for sci-fi.

Here's my Kindle recommendation: Columbus Day by Craig Alanson. Especially the audiobook (same narrator as the Martian). Won't say it's a classic, but it's a good, funny space romp.
