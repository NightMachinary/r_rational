Three Body Problem. It's a really interesting story about the cyclical nature of trauma, and wraps it up in sci-fi mystery and galactical sociology. Also it's from a Chinese author, who has a very different lens to look at humans from. Very interesting bits about life in Maoist China as well. If there was any pro-CCP propaganda in the first book, I didn't notice it.
