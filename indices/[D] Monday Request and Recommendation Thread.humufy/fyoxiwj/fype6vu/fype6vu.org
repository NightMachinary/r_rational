  For example, my university has been trying, for several years, to figure out what its name change policies should be its systems and how it should change the system to implement those policies. The problem is that several people at the university don't want it to happen and have been stonewalling despite their claims of inclusivity. In this case, IT has gotten caught in between the fight of other people, and it's not really clear what IT should do in this scenario, or even if it should. This isn't the biggest of critiques, but I think that someone who is in IT should keep this in mind when they read this book.
