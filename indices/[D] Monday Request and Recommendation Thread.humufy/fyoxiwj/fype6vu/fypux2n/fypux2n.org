There's a few factors at play. I'll do my best to list them out, but I'm not sure I'll be 100% accurate about them.

To start with, this decision is about preferred names changes, not when a person gets their name legally changed. As far as I know, there are already policies for when a person gets their name legally changed, and there aren't any major problems with it.

Another thing to keep in mind is that, at least at my university, this policy is about trans people, since they're the ones most affected. Most trans people transition socially before they get a legal name change for several different reasons. Partially because getting your name legally changed can be a fucking hassle, depending on the state. There are other groups that would be positively impacted by this decision like: (1) International students who use a different name in the US because their names don't spell or pronounce easily in English, and (2) people who go by a nickname on a day to day basis. However, the group that has spearheaded this initiative the most are trans people since they have the most to lose on a day to day basis if this policy is not implemented.

And then there's the way the systems are arranged. Sadly, I lack some details here, but I'll do my best. As far as I know, the university has one central database where they store most of the student's information. The name listed in this database needs to be the legal version and they don't have a way to put a person's preferred name there. Add to that the fact that different systems the university uses will draw and supplement that information with their own. For example, the Counseling and Testing center draws on the database for some basic information and then they add on stuff of their own. Some of these subsystems allow for name changes. For example, students can new email accounts and ID cards with their names on them. The issue is that these changes are not synchronized with the other subsystems and the central database. One of the key areas this is a problem is with our classroom management tool Blackboard. It draws names directly from the central database and is often a required tool for class. Some classes will require to make a discussion post, and this post will be tagged with your name. This creates the situation where either (1) the person never tells anyone their preferred name or (2) leaves other students wondering why their preferred and legal names are different. Situation (2) often results in students being outed which, while not only deeply uncomfortable, creates a safety risk since any random bigot in the class could not choose to target them. This problem could also happen elsewhere if the subsystems don't talk to each other; I wouldn't know since my preferred name is my legal name.

And so we have a situation here where the primary beneficiaries are ones whose existence is controversial, whose experiences are ones that are usually not readily understood by the administrators, a complicated system for storing information, and legal requirements that the university has to satisfy. This has led to a stalemate where administrators have said that diversity is a priority, and yet they haven't taken enough steps yet. A few years ago the student body decided that they wanted this policy in place. At the time, the university said that it was a priority for them. And yet, for some reason, last year they went back to square one and decided that they needed to debate if preferred name policies are something that need to exist at all.

To clarify, I don't want to say that the actions of the people at my university are necessarily malicious. At least so far, we've had innocuous reasons for them dragging their feet. For example, when the student card issuing office decided to make a policy to let students put their preferred names on their IDs, the legal department objected claiming that they didn't want to print IDs that could be interpreted as legal identification but had a name that was not the student's legal one. Which is a little confusing because (1) Nobody ever assumed student IDs were legal documents, (2) this process had gone on for a while with no problems before legal complained about it. Am I to assume someone in legal did so with bad intentions? Probably not. But it's hard not to be paranoid nonetheless.

In the end, my guess as to why the university is dragging it's heels about preferred names is that it's a combination of several motivations: (1) It's hard and I don't want to do the work; (2) It's expensive and I don't want to spend the money; (3) It could be a legal problem and I don't want to handle it; (4) I don't understand the problem; and (5) trans people are icky. The thing that sucks is that the people in the university who are responsible for this issue haven't been completely honest about why they've been dragging their heels.
