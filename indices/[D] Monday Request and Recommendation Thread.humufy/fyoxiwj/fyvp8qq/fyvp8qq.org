RE: Security

I often tell managers -- "Security is a cost you impose on yourself to impose a (hopefully) much bigger cost on your enemies." Relentlessly pound the word *cost*. And make sure that you put time -- "OK, doing X security feature will mean each developer does one less hour of work a week. Are you OK with that?"

Security is (often) necessary, but a) its not a panacea and b) its not free.
