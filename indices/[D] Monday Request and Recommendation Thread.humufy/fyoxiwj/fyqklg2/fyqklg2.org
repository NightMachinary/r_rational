English translations of [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/lord-of-the-mysteries_11022733006234505][/Lord of the Mysteries/]] have just begun on the final volume of this excellent rational-adjacent work. It has also been reviewed [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fyo4sf/review_lord_of_the_mysteries_a_chinese_online/][here]] by fellow [[/r/rational]] posters.

Chapters after the paywall are available [[https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/2759458.html][here]].

The premise of the series is about a regular person being transmigrated into the body of a suicide victim living in alternate Victorian England with Cthulhu mythos, SCP-like superpowers derived from supernatural creatures and Hermetic rituals. There's strange anachronistic technology and common phrases from Earth in the new world due to a previous transmigrator hundreds of years ago who shamelessly plagiarised everything. There's also plenty of cultural references in the plot to Bloodborne, Pirates of the Caribbean, Sherlock Holmes and The Count of Monte Cristo etc. but they're done with style.

The most stand-out quality of the work is the excellent research and effort by the author in setting up the background and worldbuilding. I've found no obvious plot holes and no inconsistencies in the setting after multiple readings. There's foreshadowing in Chapter 1 that is only fully revealed 1000s of chapters later. All the "mysteries" clicks into place at the end of each volume, especially the ending of Volume 1 which I highly recommend personally experiencing. It's where I became from being interested to totally hooked.

Please note: the plot starts off slow before Klein becomes a Nighthawk and the translator's choice of words from Chinese->English are somewhat inelegant. I hope the excellent plot, characterisation and background by the writer shines through to keep you engaged, though.
