I don't agree at all that it is disappointing, even if it is short. The author said in his notes that he refused to sacrifice the intelligence of his antagonists, meaning they wouldn't conveniently wait for the MC to complete all his preparations before attacking. So once the end game begun and the first domino fell, it finished quickly with minimal padding. To me, it addressed all the major mysteries remaining in the plot that is not obviously setting up for the sequel, so it is not extremely rushed. I can elaborate further on this if you want.

The final arc to me is the culmination of the MC's subtle character development as well as the central theme of the webnovel. Spoilers: Klein's personality revolves around paranoid levels of preparation and careful “cowardice” but also death-seeking recklessness when it comes down to the wire, which is once again on display here. His recklessness is so extreme it stands him apart from the other powerhouses of his pathway group (Kotar, Zaratul, Botis, Zoroast, Amon), who are all similarly paranoid “cowards” but nowhere near as Foolish. The Fool tarot card shows the character running headlong towards the edge of a cliff while a dog barks at him, and this is basically what Klein is.

The bittersweet theme of humanity's (Klein) triumph over the supernatural (Amon) by valuing some things more important than their own continued existence is a fitting conclusion to everything that happened in eight volumes of plot, from humanity testing random potion ingredients on themselves before the perfection of proper formulas and rituals risking madness and death, to Captain sacrificing himself for everyone else in Tingen, to a mortal mother's concern for her daughters over her own life. Klein defeats Amon despite Amon's thousands of years of experience as an almost unkillable Angel is due to the fact Klein is willing to bet his own life to see his life goals fulfilled, and Amon's only goal is the preservation of his own life.

It is a good ending, and although in the back of my mind I wanted the novel to last longer I also understood why it ended there.
