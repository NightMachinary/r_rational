Any books on amazon you folks would recommend? I admit I overlooked kindle in favor of webnovels for the longest time, and the only things I've gotten are the Daniel Black books and the Cradle series. There is just a daunting amount of books on there and it's difficult to figure out what's worth a read and what's not.

I mostly read fantasy, but I wouldn't mind a couple of scifi books.
