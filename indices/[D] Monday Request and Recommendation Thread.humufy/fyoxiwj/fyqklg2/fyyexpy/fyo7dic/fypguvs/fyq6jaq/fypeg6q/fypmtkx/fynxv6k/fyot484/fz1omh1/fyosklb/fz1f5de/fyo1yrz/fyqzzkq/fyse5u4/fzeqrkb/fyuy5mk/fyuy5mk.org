Sunshine by Robin Mckinley is a likely candidate for the origin of the whole genre, and is also better than basically.. all of it.

For atypical examples of the genre, look to Stross, and this pretty interesting collaboration set during the inter-war period [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0749S93V5?ref_=dbs_s_ks_series_rwt]]
