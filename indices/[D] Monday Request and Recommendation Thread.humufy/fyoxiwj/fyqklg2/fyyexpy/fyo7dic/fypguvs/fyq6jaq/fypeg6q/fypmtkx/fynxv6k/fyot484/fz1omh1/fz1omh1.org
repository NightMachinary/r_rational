I found this: [[https://www.edisonrex.net/comic/issue-1-cover]]. It's a bit like a rational version of Megamind but that description on it's own does a disservice to them both. Edison Rex is fairly Lex Luthor like figure and his success in killing his hated foe leaves him with no one to blame and the realisation that someone will need to do his job, with that in mind he decides to be a hero, the rest of the comic is about him realising that there's more to becoming a hero than a single decision and becoming more honest with himself about his own actions. It's been on hiatus for a while and shows no signs of changing but it completed the main charicter arc so that's okish. Possibly not rational overall, considering it's a marvel/dc parodyverse there's only so much a good author can do.

The main charicter is not rational but prides himself on his rationality and I think a quality exploration of this is something that fits will on this sub.
