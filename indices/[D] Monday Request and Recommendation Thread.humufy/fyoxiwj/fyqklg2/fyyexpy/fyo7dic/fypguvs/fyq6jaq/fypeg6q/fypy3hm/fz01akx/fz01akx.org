I actually started reading this after finishing farseer, but I had to stop because of time constraints at the time. I will go back some day, after collecting all three books from thrift stores. It's far from perfect, but I don't really think I've read a better character study than from Robin Hobb. She can write characters in this way that I've never seen elsewhere.
