Oh, I was mistaken. I thought this one was by the same guy who did [[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/comics/first][Transdimensional Brain Chip]] and [[http://spacespy.thecomicseries.com/][Accidental Space Spy]]; the freewheeling narrative, plentiful alien life, and goofy 4th-wall breakage are quite similar.
