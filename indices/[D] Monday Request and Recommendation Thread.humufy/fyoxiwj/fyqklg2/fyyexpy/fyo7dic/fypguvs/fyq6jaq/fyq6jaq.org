A conversation with friends a few days ago sparked a memory of a short novel I read as a child called [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24875.House_of_Stairs][House of Stairs]], which left a massive impact on me for years afterwards. It's all about psychological experimentation from the point of view of the subjects, very dark, and involves the characters rationally working their way through their predicament.

It strikes me as something people here might enjoy. Would highly recommend, even though it's aimed at a younger audience.
