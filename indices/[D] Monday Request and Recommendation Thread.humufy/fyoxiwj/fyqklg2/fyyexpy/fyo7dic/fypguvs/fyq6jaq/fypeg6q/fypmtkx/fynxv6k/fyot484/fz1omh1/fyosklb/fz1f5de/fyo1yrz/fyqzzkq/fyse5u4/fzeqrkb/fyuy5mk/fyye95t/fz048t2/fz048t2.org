You've probably heard of Dresden Files in that genre, but I think Alex Verus is a better read than Dresden. Alex is sort of similar to Dresden except without the annoying backwards view of women. The world itself is darker. Alex's power is to see the possibilities in the very short term future, which makes for really interesting fights. The series really picks up after the first couple of books, and delves deep into politics and personal power later on.
