First Law series by Joe Abercrombie is great. I'd start with one or two of his standalone books, like Best Served Cold, as they're written a bit more tightly, then go back and taclke the original trilogy.

Dresden Files is quite good, just skip the first two in the series and start with the third, you can come back to them once you're hooked. People pretty universally agree the series starts properly around book 3.5. Urban fantasy but kind of a standout.

For something short and fun, try the first five Amber books by Roger Zelazny. (You might enjoy books 6-10 but they're pretty much gary stu fanfiction written by the author.) The rare amnesia plot done well, and the conceit is just cool.

If you'd like some really strong prose writing in a fantasy setting, try Kay's Tigana.
