[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30483/polyrhythm-time----a-bards-tail][Polyrhythm Time -- A Bard's Tail]] is an interesting deconstruction of competence porn. (Despite the word tail in the title, it's not a furry fetish type story. He has a tail, but it's utilitarian.) The MC makes wildly suboptimal choices for surviving in another world because he's obsessed with drumming, but makes up for it by having a better than normal capacity for practice. This reminded me of a nonfiction book [[https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise-ebook/dp/B011H56MKS][Peak]] I had recently read (and highly recommend), which is about how expertise forms.
