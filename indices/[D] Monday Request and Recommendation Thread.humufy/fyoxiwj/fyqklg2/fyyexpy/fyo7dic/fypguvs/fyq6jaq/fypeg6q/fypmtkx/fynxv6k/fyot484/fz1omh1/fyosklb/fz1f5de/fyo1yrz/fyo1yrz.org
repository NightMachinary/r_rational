Hey guys, last week I finished reading A Thing Of Vikings and I'm looking for something of similar length or longer to read, preferably fantasy, that it's either *finished or regularly updated*. I've already looked into everything on the tvtropes, the wiki, top web fiction, the first 20 pages of royalroad's active only ranking and the most popular stuff(mostly quests) on sufficient velocity, I haven't really checked space battles out. If it's a translation I'm only interested if the grammar is at least a 7/10 because I tried reading release that witch and it was impossible. I have also gotten recommended forged destiny and purple days and couldn't get into either of them. thank you very much.
