I think the only way you're likely to find what you're looking for is if you write it yourself. Pokemon fanfiction is already not that common or popular generally. Requiring that it be 'realistic' narrows things down quite a bit. Requiring such specific subject matter narrows it down further. Once you add the requirement that it be good enough to be worth reading, you're probably going to be left with nothing that fits.
