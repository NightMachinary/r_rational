Brandon Sanderson's cosmere works are enormous, currently just over 3M words total with another 500k inbound by the end of the year. Both finished and regularly updated, in that he has a few self-contained stories completed (Mistborn Era 1, Elantris, Warbreaker, various novellas), a few others in progress (Mistborn Era 2, Stormlight first half), and many more to come (Mistborn 3 and 4, Elantris continuation, Stormlight second half, Dragonsteel).

Stormlight is the "capstone" epic fantasy series, on the scale of LOTR or Wheel of Time. Mistborn comes in shorter books & arcs, and is my personal favorite; it also has the amazing quality of shifting genres between arcs--the first era is your standard medieval fantasy; the second is steampunk-Western; the third will supposedly be cyberpunk.

I really can't recommend Sanderson highly enough. I rep him all the time in this sub.
