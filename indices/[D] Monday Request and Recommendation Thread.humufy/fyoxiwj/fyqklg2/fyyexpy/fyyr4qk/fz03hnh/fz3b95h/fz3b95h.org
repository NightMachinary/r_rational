I really like Greg Egan, including the more abstruse recent stuff. I read his books first for the plot (natural philosophers have to boot-strap to real physics in time to save their world, boot-strap etc. plus politics, expedition stumbles across society that uses drugged slaves), then again for the fictional world-building (vacuum-hardened aliens in a spinning habitat orbiting a neutron star, amorphous blob-people whose bodies use light instead of electrical signals, vertical flat-land with echolocating head-lizards!), then a third time for the real science (relativity and space, relativity and time, relativity and space-time). It's very rewarding.
