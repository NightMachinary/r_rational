Any good manga / manhua recommendations ? It's been really hard for me to enjoy them lately, they just feel so lacking compared to fiction. Maybe I'm having a string of bad luck but lately I've been dropping them frequently, mangas I've read and enjoyed for years just getting so bad I had to drop them.

​

Ones I'm currently enjoying: Peerless Dad, OPM, Dungeon Meshi, World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs, and Heresy. There are others I follow but they are currently meh, not bad enough for me to drop them but not good enough for me to particularly enjoy them.

​

Anybody has been or had a similar experience or any enjoyable recommendations ?
