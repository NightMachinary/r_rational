Greg Egan writes scifi taking in universes with warped physical laws. Most of his works can be found in his [[https://www.gregegan.net/][website]], and each work has accompanying papers and notes for the kinds of mathematics and physics that follow from those warped physical laws. IIRC there's a bunch of differential geometry involved. I haven't read his works, but they seem to have gotten mostly positive acclaim.
