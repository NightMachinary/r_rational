Might be worth continuing onwards. Each book is semi-independant, so that particular issue doesn't necessarily factor in the following books.

As for the gods, it's not that they're fragile, per se, but that it's a not so subtle allegory for leveraged debt. It's not that gods /have/ to put themselves at risk, but it's so very tempting because the benefits can be considerable when things are going well. Considerable enough that they risk being outcompeted it they don't partake (the gods having been soundly defeated by modern practicioners a generation or so previously). A real life example might be something like Toys R Us, who went bankrupt in large part because they were restructured with a lot of debt during a takeover.

But again, if that's not your thing it doesn't really factor so much in the later books I've read.
