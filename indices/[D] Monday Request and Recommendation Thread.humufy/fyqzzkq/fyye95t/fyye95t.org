I would strongly recommended Max Gladstone's /Craft Sequence/ here. It's not just urban fantasy, but a very thoughtful take on urbanism and modernity through the lense of fantasy.

It's a setting where magic has been systematized in a way that much resembles modern corporations and finance, examining how such vast and complicated systems can run into the human element. The first book is about two teams of necromancer-lawyers competing over who gets to resurrect a dead God, with a murder mystery about how and why he died in the first place. They're all pretty good and strongly recommended.
