Oh man, it's Ulf guy! I am consistently impressed with a) how good a writer he is, b) how big an imagination he has, and c) how engrossed I can get in his stories despite potato art.

EDIT: Nevermind, it's not Ulf guy. If you liked this one you should definitely [[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/comics/first][check him out]] though. Similar warning to the above poster--the story & worldbuilding are worth the simplistic art.
