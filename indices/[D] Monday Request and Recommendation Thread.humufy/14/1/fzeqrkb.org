If you're looking for 'uplifting' urban fantasy, there's two books by C. Chancy that were quite enjoyable. Book one is 'A Net of Dawn and Bones' and book two is 'Seeds of Blood'.

To quote the author regarding book one: This book was written because I couldn't find anything like it on the shelves. ...No, seriously. After the umpteenth time picking up yet another urban fantasy that looked promising but on closer skimming had the Designated Protagonist choosing the Sexier Evil, I kind of snapped. Part of the fun of any story is putting yourself in the character's shoes. But these shoes I not only didn't want to slip into, I wanted to set them on fire. Where were the good guys? The honest cops? The ordinary people choosing to do the Right Thing, no matter how hard it was? Where was the belief that there is a Right Thing; that there is Good, and Evil, and you pick the side you're going to fight for, even if the heavens fall? In short - where were the heroes? I assure you, if I were in on ground zero of a vampire versus werewolf blood war, my thoughts would not be centered on, omigod the two main supernatural guys are so darkly yummy in their hellspawn black leather. They would be, stake, silver - where are they and how fast can I reload? So here they are: an honest cop, a half-demon, and an ancient heretic who just might be a saint. Out to kick butt, save lives, and hopefully save souls. Welcome to Intrepid, North Carolina. I'm hoping to stay awhile.
