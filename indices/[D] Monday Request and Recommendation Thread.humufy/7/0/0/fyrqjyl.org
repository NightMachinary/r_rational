I'm not the person you're responding to, but I would be interested in recommendations that fit the description of the focus of this subreddit, what people call "Rational Fiction".

From the sidebar:

  Characteristics of Rational Fiction:

  "Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people in honest pursuit of their goals, as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.

  Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

  - Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  - Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  - Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

  - Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.

  - Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

  Presence of these particular features is not necessary: overall impression of the work is more important.

  Adjacent tropes: Rational stories tend to include certain narrative elements. Though their presence doesn't make a story more rational, this community highly enjoys them. Most important ones include:

  - Fair-Play Whodunnit: story's mysteries could be solved by attentive readers ahead of time.

  - Absence of Deus Ex Machina: established story rules are never broken.

  - Deconstruction: genre tropes are re-imagined in a more realistic manner.

  - Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit their world's rules in creative, non-intuitive ways.
