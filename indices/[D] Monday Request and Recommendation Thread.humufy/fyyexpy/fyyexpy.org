After reading the linked here 'I became a [Biologist] in a fantasy world!', I became fascinated by the unapologetically high bar for knowledge within the field required to really follow the nature of the world and story. Does anyone know of any other stories where external knowledge is written into the fabric of the text? I don't just mean bringing in real world philosophies or aesthetics, I mean actual proper knowledge of the sorts of problems that people in the real world spend large amounts of time trying to understand. Not that I'm against explanations, but I'm interested to see what people can do when they don't spend time explaining things.

I guess I'd only really consider myself capable of reading them within the fields of math and biology, so I'd be more appreciative of those, but I'd be interested to see if anyone has any examples in other fields to.
