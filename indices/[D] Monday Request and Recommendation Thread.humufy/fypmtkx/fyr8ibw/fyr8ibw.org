These are ones I like, with varying levels of otome

Manga:

My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! - Lighthearted, sweet, funny (laughed out loud)

Death Is The Only Ending For The Villainess - High-stakes, most otome-y

Beware of the Villainess! - Lighthearted, funny faces/ memes, otome-y in satire ways

AO3:

Please fix the story! ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23987140/chapters/57699619]]) - also very otome-y but also much crack

Reforming the Romance Novel's Male lead ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20221516]]) by the same author as above- funny, crack-y

(edited: sorry - i pressed tab on accident and it posted before I was done)
