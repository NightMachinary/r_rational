Otomeisekai, the genre, is basically full of the manga/manwha equivalent of harlequin romance novels. You're not going to find the next great work of fiction among its titles. It's trope-y bodice-ripping female wish-fulfillment. That's pretty much the entire genre.

What do you consider "actually good" within the genre? What series have you read that you like? that you disliked? And what did you like/dislike about them? Are there tropes you enjoy or tropes you hate?

Being the creator of the sub, I've read the vast majority of titles that are listed in our [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OtomeIsekai/wiki/series][wiki]], so I might be able to suggest something if I know what you consider "low quality" versus "high quality" while keeping in mind you're standing in front of the harlequin romance section at the bookstore wondering why you can't seem to find quality literature (aka temper your expectations a bit).
