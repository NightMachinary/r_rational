The Tawny Man trilogy by Robin Hobb, which is a followup to the Farseer triloy, has a relatively major theme of the main character being older and grappling with the various life changes that entails (among many other things, it's not /the/ main thing, but it's definitely prominent).

I can't give a full throated endorsement since the series definitely has some issues (it's not bad, just far from perfect), but it's the thing I've read that comes the closest to what you are looking for. I originally read the Tawny Man trilogy without having read any of the other books in the series or in the universe, so it can be done, but there is a lot of background that will make more sense if you read them in order. Which will also give you images of the main characters at different points/ages in their lives since all three are separated by somewhat large time gaps.
