Reading Tawny Man first is definitely not optimal, in my opinion. The best way to read the trilogies is to read the first one, then either read the side stories in release order or wait at least a year to read Tawny Man, to get that feeling of the passage of time that makes the books what they are.

But really, the whole thing is a major time and emotional investment, and I can't promise that it's worth it. It's definitely not a perfect series of books. The real draw is the introspection that makes emotional ties to the characters very easy to form.
