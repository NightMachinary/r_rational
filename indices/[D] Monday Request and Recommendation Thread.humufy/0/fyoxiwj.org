Based on a recommendation few weeks ago, I read /The Phoenix Project/. It's a book about IT practices and how they should integrate with the rest of an organization. The book is written in the context of a failing company that is basically falling apart and the new IT manager has to keep things together. Overall, I think I have to give it an 8/10 recommendation

Things I liked:

- The problems faced by the company, for the most part, seemed realistic. The sense of panic was real because the authors obviously faced many of these issues in their own careers, and were able to depict that despair on paper. It made the book feel a lot more grounded than a lot of other business books tend to be.
- The book describes a pretty good list of what IT should focus on in order to be effective. In particular, it's focus on constraints was particularly good
- The focus on IT being essential for an organization to enact its goals was good. It's an effective argument to convince higher ups to care about IT and make sure that it is present for important decisions
- I found their ideas on the role of security to be interesting. They make the point that security should be considered in the context of the things an organization does, and in context of the companies values and that security shouldn't be applied as a never-ending sequence of patches. Ultimately, I don't know enough about security to analyze this part of their argument, but I thought it was an interesting argument nonetheless.

Things I thought could be improved upon:

- The only big critique of this book that I have is that it treats values as something that an organization has by default. The book doesn't really consider the possibility that the organization might not know what its own values are, or that certain people in an organization might lie unashamedly about what their values are. For example, my university has been trying, for several years, to figure out what its name change policies should be its systems and how it should change the system to implement those policies. The problem is that several people at the university don't want it to happen and have been stonewalling despite their claims of inclusivity. In this case, IT has gotten caught in between the fight of other people, and it's not really clear what IT should do in this scenario, or even if it should. This isn't the biggest of critiques, but I think that someone who is in IT should keep this in mind when they read this book.
