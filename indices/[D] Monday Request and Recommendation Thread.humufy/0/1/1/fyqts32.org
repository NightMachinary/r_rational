To put it another way from what AcceptableBook said, it's very easy to stonewall something while /saying/ you want it to go ahead. "Oh, before we implement this, we need to figure out XYZ." "Well, I definitely think this is a priority, but I need to talk to Mike from Accounting and Jane from Legal and Jack from HR, to make sure this is feasible." "I'm glad we cleared those roadblocks, but someone raised a concern about XYZ. We'll need to get that sorted before we can proceed."

Each objection is fine on it's own; it's only in aggregate that you can see that they're (maybe) stonewalling you.
