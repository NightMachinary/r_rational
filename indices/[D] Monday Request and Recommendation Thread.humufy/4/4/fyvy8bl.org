Beck is phenomenal if you love music and the experience of going to a show. It's got so many references, both hidden and overt, to rock and pop music from the 60s to early 2000s. It's about a kid who finds out he can sing and joins a band and all the struggles along the way. Great fun.

Monster is a slow burn thriller about a Japanese neurosurgeon in Germany that slowly becomes ensnared in a plot to catch a serial killer former patient of his. The art is so good and Naoki Urasaws is probably my favorite mangaka of all time. In that same way, 20th Century Boys and Pluto are so unbelievably top-notch.

Holyland is a coming of age story where a milquetoast teenager escapes into the world of street fighting. There's no shonen action sequences here, it's a brawl through and through. I haven't read it in years so I can't presently vouch for it, but I remember enjoying the portrayal of depression.
