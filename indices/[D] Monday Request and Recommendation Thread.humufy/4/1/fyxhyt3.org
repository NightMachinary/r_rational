/Hikaru no Go/. Protagonist stumbles on the ghost which haunted (according to the story) the famous player Shusaku, Fujiwara-no-Sai, whose only desire is to keep playing Go until he perfects the Hand of God. Great characters, addictive, inspiring sports-ish manga, with the Death Note artist (different writer). A great tragedy in a way.

/Astro Boy/. After the death of his son, Dr. Tenma builds a robot child to replace him...Tezuka is a perceptive writer, and this turned out to be more interesting and intelligent than I thought it would be.

/Parasyte/. Chilling classic. Brain invading organisms take over humans and feed on humans. One of them fails and ends up attached to the protagonist's arm. The dynamic of the compassionate protagonist and the cold-blooded survivalist parasite works pretty well.

/Toward the Terra/. Jomy is living in a dystopia he didn't realize he was in and escapes brainwashing with the help of the Mu Soldier Blue, only to discover that he himself is such a telepathic Mu. Meanwhile, the AI running said dystopia has selected the man for the job of wiping them out. Fairly complex characterization of the villain is probably the high-point of the series. Also Blue is awesome. Shoujo-styled art is another plus.

/Area 88/. Mercenary pilot story. A mature exploration of war and killing, though a bit soppy at times.

/Berserk/. Dark fantasy, brutal, but also deeply touching. Deals mainly (I think) in themes of trauma and wished-for reconciliation that may never come. Fair warning, the first few chapters are not so fun, and it gets exceedingly dull (in my opinion) after the brilliant Golden Age arc. However said arc is possibly the best thing that ever came out of manga.

I highly recommend the /Yu-Gi-Oh/ manga if you've never had any exposure to the series or if you've only seen the altered english anime.
