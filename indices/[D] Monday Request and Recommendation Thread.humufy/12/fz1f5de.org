Does anybody know of ANY rational Warrior Cats fics? Or like, even semi-rational? Or like... even, say irrational but still readable?

Already read all the stuff by Prin Pradius (though it was years ago, who knows if even that stuff still holds up...), but basically everything else I've looked into has been unreadably bad, or incomplete and not updating anymore.
