I started reading it from this recommendation, and I just caught up. I'll second the recommendation, and add that the alternate physics is treated like /physics/. There are hints of a complete, well-developed system that the characters aren't exploring because they're busy surviving.

For example, when they say "Oxygen doesn't exist, you draw sustenance from Lavi via your lungs", it isn't just flavor text. There are predictable implications from that, which become clear later.
