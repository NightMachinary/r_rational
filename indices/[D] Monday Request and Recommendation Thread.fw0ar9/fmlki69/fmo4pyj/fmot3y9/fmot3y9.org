The writing gets a bit better, and there is much less of a focus on the comic con origins of the story. I don't think 'Otaku' is used more than a few times in the early chapters, and rarely at that. I don't recall the breast size scene you've mentioned, so that definitely isn't more than an obscure one-off. I think describing the story in this light is a very negative misrepresentation based on a very small selection of content.

I'm very curious to see more of the world the author has built, and the AI characters. The human characters are OK, but are not exceptionally well written. If you've read about the world and just aren't interested on a game mechanic / murder mystery level, then you can drop it without looking back. We all have different standards and I'm not a book salesman.

Also...

The AI creators are unknown. I think you skipped the bit of the prologue that stated the translocation event occurs randomly (soccer stadiums, basketball games, ect...) not exclusively Comic Cons. The AI were (most likely) not engineered by a previous batch of abducted Comic Con attendees. My personal theory is that the AI are those who failed the game, but that's unsubstantiated.
