  “I pray to Suri, Goddess of horny anime fans, that my green friends end up in a better place, where the meridians are wide and the twirling is eternal.

  “Ugh, it's so difficult!” I complain. For some reason, everything around starts to get bigger. The Moose becomes a mountain of fur, the Lilly pad stretches out before me and Suri becomes ever greater.

  [No need to feel small, Emma, you're doing great,] Suri comforts me.

  The shrinkage is reversed. I feel warm inside and my chest swells with pride. One cup size... two cup sizes...

  [Not that great. Try and maintain a normal size please.]”

  “I turn about 720 degrees and end up facing a barely clothed Goddess.

  Flawless white skin, hair as black as the night, curves to die for, and a pair of familiar, cyan eyes, staring knowingly at me. It's like she walked right out of an otaku's wet dream.

  “Suri?” I ask, my pair of regular eyes nearly popping out of their sockets.

  The Goddess nods. [This form was suggested by previous participants. Is it a problem?]”
