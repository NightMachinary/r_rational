  The shrinkage is reversed. I feel warm inside and my chest swells with pride. One cup size... two cup sizes...

I think you might just be fixating a little too much on this... It's a symbolism/trippy dream sequence, her chest is swelling with pride - if you take that literally it means she is becoming more and more barrel chested as the size of her upper body increases.

Is it the usage of the phrase"cup sizes" that is throwing you off? Would "I feel warm inside and my chest swells with pride. 5 inches... 10 inches..." have been better? It doesn't have nearly as good of a flow or comedic effect.

When someone references that "her chest swells", I don't think it's possible to not make some connection to the fact that women have breasts.
