As a Team Starkid fan, I'll agree TGWDLM was pretty darn good... but I did not enjoy "Black Friday" nearly as much. The songs weren't nearly as strong, there were too many plot lines to devote attention to specific characters, and the best of the jokes were really just references to previous shows (especially TGWDLM). It was worth watching, IMO, but it was definitely not one of my favorites.

I would put "Twisted" up there as my favorite, tied with the Harry Potter musicals (more as a fan of the series than for how strong they were in any particular way). TGWDLM was great too, though I'm not sure I like the Hatchetfield spin-offs it has set up if "Black Friday" was any indication. We'll see how "Nerdy Prudes Need to Die" goes (rumored to be their next musical, though "Working Boys" may get a stand-alone release first).
