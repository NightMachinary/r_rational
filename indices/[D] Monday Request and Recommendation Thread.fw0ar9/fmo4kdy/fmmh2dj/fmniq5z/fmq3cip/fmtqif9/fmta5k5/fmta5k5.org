What exactly did you find in it so it blew you away? I don't mean to be rude, I am just wondering. While I didn't exactly /dislike/ it, I found it only mildly enjoyable and not much more than that. To be frank, I had the same reaction to /Dr. Horrible/ back in the day, so that should've tipped me off.

I'm quite curious!
