I have to say, I've never really understood why so many people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] like Twisted so much. I really like it's premise, but the execution was just very sub-par. It's been a while since I've watched it, but I remember my main issue with it was the constant jabs at Disney through world building elements that made literally no sense. It leans much more towards contrarian, or subversive fiction than full on rational fiction. Not to get too semantic here, but I'd barely even call it rational-adjacent. The only similarity between Twisted, and true rational fiction is Jafar's more intellectual approach to policy. I'd like to see a rational fic with the same premise (Jafar as a small time city manager trying to reform his country using evidence based policy), but where Jafar must figure out ways to politically outmanoeuvre his political opponents, and win the common people's votes and support.

tl;dr: Rationality is the art of winning. Jafar is the biggest loser in the land, and the land is a world building exercise in roasting Disney. Thus, Twisted is not rational, nor a good story.

EDIT: To be fair, I did like Twisted's depiction of Jafar as an idealistic intellectual, facing problems that challenge his core beliefs and are not suited for his intellectuality. Certainly it makes sense how many on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would identify with this aspect. But, he never actually solves his problems! The best he can do is take the necklace his wife gave him and “believe that magic is real”! And then he's shown a path that'll make all his problems go away. This is not rational.
