For something I haven't seen recommended here before that hits the immortality seeking protag niche, take a look at ‘The Tragedy of Prince Hamlet and the Philosopher's Stone, or, A Will Most Incorrect to Heaven.' It's a full length play inspired by an omake from HPMOR. [[https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Philosophers-Incorrect-William-Shakespeare-ebook/dp/B0061Z9KWM]]

“ACT I

PROLOGUE

KING CLAUDIUS

"Grieve not for the dead.

It shows a will most incorrect to heaven."

What may we make of him who birthed these lines,

and, in his mad stinking London,

committed them to paper and the voice of me, his villain?

Was our Shakespeare a Will most incorrect to heaven?

Had he the liberty, what Hamlet had he writ?

A true opponent, not just to me, but to the natural ordering

of the spheres and of the mind?

A youth, perhaps, who though as cautious as could be in action,

were o'er-rash in fantasy.

Exit CLAUDIUS.”
