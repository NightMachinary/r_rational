It's been awhile since I've read Dream Drive, but I don't think I have anything that's very close to it.

If you're looking for a nsfw Litrpg, I've enjoyed [[https://chyoa.com/story/The-Gamer%2C-Chyoa-edition.12004][The Gamer, Chyoa edition - Funatic route]]. Another commenter also liked neo-kenka's route. It's kind of annoying to read it on their website so I used [[https://github.com/theslavicbear/Ebook-Publisher][this tool]] to download an epub copy

I've also enjoyed the [[https://www.amazon.com/Mask-Template-Monster-Celestine-Chronicles-ebook/dp/B07DWY9ZXD/ref=sr_1_3?crid=37N0IGY7CNQC4&dchild=1&keywords=celestine+chronicles&qid=1586288830&sprefix=celestine+chron%2Caps%2C159&sr=8-3][Celestine Chronicles]], though it's got some... unusual kinks. Audio book is great though.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Good-Intentions-Elliott-Kay-ebook/dp/B0054E8QYE/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=good+intentions&qid=1586291166&sr=8-3][Good intentions]] is another good option, though it has no game elements.

I have a hard time finding nsfw books with magic/scifi elements that are of a decent length.
