I am in search of several different recommendations:

- New sites for webfiction other than RoyalRoad, AO3, Fanfiction.net, Fimfiction, Storiesonline, and Novelupdates. Especially looking for any blog webfiction that isn't on other websites (like [[https://www.themagineer.com/][The magineer]] or [[https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/][Taint]]) or fiction that is on websites you wouldn't expect ([[https://www.literotica.com/s/dream-drive-ch-01][Dream Drive on literotica]])

- Long (>500k words) web/fan/erotic fiction you've read. [[/r/rational]] readers tend to overlap with my interests even if it's not rational

- Any sci-fi/fantasy that covers if magic/crazy super-tech were introduced to current day society and how that magic/tech changes life. Effectively "the singularity". Most novels seem to skip this phase of the process and jump to 100 years later after most of the changes have already happened.

- Anything pro-immortality that isn't the villain. Preferably with a real chance of getting it

- Looking for stories that give the feel of the main character being surrounded by dumb-ish NPCs and abusing that fact. Examples of this concept would be HPMOR, With This Ring, Harry Potter and the Natural 20, or Two Year Emperor.

I try to define my entertainment based on whether or not I was entertained, not whether or not the content was objectively good. Junk food entertainment is fine, so don't feel like you only need to suggest books with no typos or excellently crafted plots. It's enough if you found enjoyment from it.
