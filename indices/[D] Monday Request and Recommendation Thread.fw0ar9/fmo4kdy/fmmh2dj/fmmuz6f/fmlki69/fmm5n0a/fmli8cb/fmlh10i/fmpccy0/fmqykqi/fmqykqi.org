If only LotM had an even better translator it would've been a great work worthy of adaptation to other mediums, I think.

Don't get me wrong, the translation is still far better than MTL or an amateur blogger working in his free time, and the best thing about the translations is the sheer speed and consistency of updates by the sole translator (20 chapters a week, 2000 words per chapter, minimal padding). I just wish there was a professional editor that went over the translations to correct all the issues that bugged me as I read.

*Edit:* Read your review, can't disagree with it on most points. From sharing the story IRL with other book buddies, most people only got fully hooked after finishing Vol 1, Vol 2's pacing dragged a bit too long during the middle, some less attentive readers didn't like the information overload from earlier chapters but acknowledged they were necessary for the payoffs hundreds of chapters later. Most agreed the fights are short as they should and brilliant, even if the author cheats a little with 'Unspoken Plan Guarantees' to give Klein a better chance (which also has in-story justification). He's a paranoid one, our MC.

I do think the main group of characters are more interesting than you give credit for, though. I never find myself bored wondering when the viewpoint would be switched back to Klein's. The focus on the value of money early on is because Klein is a penny pinching miser who constantly spends himself into poverty for reasons, which is often humorously contrasted with the near-infinite wealth of another character in the next paragraph.

Klein's character development is rather minimal as you said, more like someone near the end of their character growth arc and given opportunities again and again to show what sort of person he really is. He doesn't change much since Vol 1, but the repeated situations he keeps finding himself in fleshes him out realistically as more than just some reader self-insert.

And yes, strongly agree that the most satisfactory part of LotM is how it all fits neatly together at each climax and the excellent use of foreshadowing.
