I didn't mean to give the impression that you were saying the characters are bad, if you read regular mainstream stuff I can understand that LotM's characters can feel lacking in some areas (though I feel this author writes characters better than same mainstream fantasy writers like Brandon Sanderson).

Audrey has always been one of my favourites, but it's true she has improved a lot recently, the Hvin Rambis arc is a good example. Maybe it's how much of a slow burn LotM is or because the author is still improving but at 1000+ chapters I feel I have a far better impression of the characters than when they were first introduced.
