Does anyone have recommendation for a Youtube news channel?

I'm looking for something similar to the [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClFSU9_bUb4Rc6OYfTt5SPw][Philip DeFranco Show]], that has some of the same qualities:

- A non-partisan-ish coverage of political events; if there are two or more conflicting sides, I want a summary of what each side believes, not "here is why X is wrong and Y is right".

- A focus on international news and major events; if possible not too america-centric (PDS is not that great here; there's a lot of internet celebrity gossip and it's very american-centered).

- Short videos with decent density of information. I don't want to watch a vlog, I want to spend less than 20 minutes a day knowing whether the US is going to go to war with Iran this week.

(in the meantime the PDS is pretty good, but I'd like to have multiple news sources)
