  Does anyone know any good books with a realistic take on the life of an average person during various time periods, like prehistoric, roman times, medieval, etc.

Documentaries on specific time periods tend to have this. Also some youtube channels. A few months ago I was researching falconing to see if it could be used interestingly in a story and came across a lot of videos of mongolian eagle tamers. Really cool stuff. Most of this though you'll find from doing research on specific things you're interested.

Hardcore history podcast is fun, you can find it for free if you look hard enough.
