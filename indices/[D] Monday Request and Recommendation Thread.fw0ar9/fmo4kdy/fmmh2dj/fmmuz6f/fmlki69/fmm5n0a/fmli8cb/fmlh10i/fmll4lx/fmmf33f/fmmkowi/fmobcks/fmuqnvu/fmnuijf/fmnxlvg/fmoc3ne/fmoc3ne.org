What are the best manga that you recommend? I'd prefer something with good worldbuilding, action or art; doesn't have to be rational just not full of contrivances.

I liked Blame!, Gantz, One Piece, HxH, Jojo, Made in Abyss, Liar Game. Didn't like Naruto, Qualia the Purple, Pandora Hearts, Berserk (sorry), Tokyo Ghoul.
