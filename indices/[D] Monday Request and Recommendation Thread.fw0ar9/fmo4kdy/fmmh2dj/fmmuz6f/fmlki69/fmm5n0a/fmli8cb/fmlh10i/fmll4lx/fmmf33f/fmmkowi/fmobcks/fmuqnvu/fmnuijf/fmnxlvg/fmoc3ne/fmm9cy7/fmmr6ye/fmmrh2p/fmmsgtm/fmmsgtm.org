It starts on chapter 3, it's a crucial munchkin for the first book (and it's a slow burn throughout it), honestly it's one of my favorite parts of the first book, but it doesn't really go anywhere till much later (like at least chapter 30+) I will admit.

But no worries if it isn't your cup of tea.
