[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul][Error of Soul]] by Materia-Blade has a soul bond between Harry and Hermione. It does a good job of showing them both adapting to the others thought processes without just throwing them immediately head-over-heels for each other. The author's fairly active in the worm fanfic scene as well, so they're at least familiar with rational-adjacent work, though I don't recall any exceptionally explicit munchkining in this one.
