Yeah, the whole thing peaked way before AO3.

Try [[/r/HPfanfiction]]? I found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/38lbft/what_soul_bond_fics_are_worth_reading/][this thread]] from [[https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=best+harry+potter+soul+bond+fanfics][googling]]. And [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zwqbw/lf_the_best_of_hetero_soul_bonds/][this one]]. It's a start.

Also [[/r/NarutoFanfiction]], i'm sure there was a cross pollination between the fandoms.
