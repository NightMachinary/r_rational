I have two requests, I hope that's alright.

I'm looking for books with a forward momentum, high energy and highly intelligent protagonist, like HPMOR and the Vorkosigan books. I gather that Harry was based on Miles, so it seems to be a pretty rare concept in fiction. Does anyone have any recommendations for books like this?

Does anyone know any good books with a realistic take on the life of an average person during various time periods, like prehistoric, roman times, medieval, etc.

Granted average person lives are probably too boring for a story, but at least somewhat of an approximation. A fantasy twist or alternative history is fine too, as long as it gets the feel of those time periods right. Things like social lives, how towns and cities were built up, what kind of authority figures were around, family composition, such things.
