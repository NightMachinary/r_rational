The mansion of E. Brilliantly complex and fascinating worldbuilding, I dunno if I'd call it rational but it's certainly not irrational. I highly reccomend it. Don't be put off by the art, it doesn't really improve but it always communicates what it needs to communicate. If nothing else it will serve as inspiration.
