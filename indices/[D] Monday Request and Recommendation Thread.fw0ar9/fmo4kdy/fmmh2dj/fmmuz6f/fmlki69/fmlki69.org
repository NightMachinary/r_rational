I have been reading [[http://webfictionguide.com/listings/i-am-going-to-die-in-this-game-like-dimension/][I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension)]], the author mentioned re-branding to something like 'The Whispering Crystals' if you've come across this post later on.

The story is essentially transported -> survival game, in a world with different physics. There are stat screens; and the writing is solid. I'd argue that, while there are story-like elements and the rare bit of deus ex machina, the world and the characters follow the tenets of [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

I'd recommend it if you enjoy Delve.
