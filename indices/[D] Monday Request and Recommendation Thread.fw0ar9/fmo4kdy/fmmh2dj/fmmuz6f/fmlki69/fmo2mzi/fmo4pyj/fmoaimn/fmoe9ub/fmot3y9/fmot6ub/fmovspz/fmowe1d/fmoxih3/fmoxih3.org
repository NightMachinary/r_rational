Right, the Skilldream. Yeah that is [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]] material. The MC isn't a lesbian and there shouldn't be Ying-Yang shenanigans between her and an AI crystal, so there's no in-story justification for this beyond the assumption that Anime Goddess dreams are prevalent among Comic Con attendees. Future Skilldreams are less explicit, but are basically the same. I can understand how the unnecessary sexual stuff would be a deal breaker.
