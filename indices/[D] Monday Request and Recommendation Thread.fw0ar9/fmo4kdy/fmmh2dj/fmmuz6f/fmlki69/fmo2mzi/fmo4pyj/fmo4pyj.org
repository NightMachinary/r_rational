I tried to read this but the author used the word â€˜otaku' and assigned a females sense of self worth to the size of her breasts in a scene with an AI that was designed by the transported people from a comic con. Understand the implications here. It was... weird. Is it great later on? I might be able to keep going again if there's something more to look forward too :<
