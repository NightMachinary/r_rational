Yeah it's just, as I said below, kind of unnecessary misogynistic sex-stuff. That's it. The anime-goddess is mostly the part that gets me, to be fair. It's just weird. I guess any hint of people being all ‘oh save the women' or ‘only men can fight' or whatever is a super pet peeve of mine. Maybe because it reminds me of how terribly pervasive that outlook still is, despite everything. Who knows.
