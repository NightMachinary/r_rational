Uhn. After all my time in the internet I have come to associate it with that subculture of people that can be classified as â€˜nice guys'. The overenthusiastic for anime people that go too far in their interests and have body pillows and stuff. It's just, it's a term that means obsession and it just goes too far. I can generally ignore one-off things in fiction but whoever is writing that seems to be doing it from the perspective of someone who is that kind of personality but is trying to make a character that isn't by leaving all the things like it around them instead of as their actual character. It's kind of a subversion but it's played too weakly for me to find it engaging.
