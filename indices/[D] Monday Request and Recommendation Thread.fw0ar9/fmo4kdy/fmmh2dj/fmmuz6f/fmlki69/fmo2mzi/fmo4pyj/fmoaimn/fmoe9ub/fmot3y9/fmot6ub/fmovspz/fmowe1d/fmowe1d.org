The main AI in the beginning said her form in the dreamscape was suggested by people who had passed through previously. It mentioned her being an â€˜Otaku's wet dream' or smthn in the same section. (All quoted in one my other comments in this thread.) Very weird. Also the old people and the women staying behind in the beginning and the uncomfortable implications of the protagonist being an auburn-haired big-chested young woman. It feels very much like SI/wish-fulfillment/weirdness to me. I guess there was just too many of those moments in the first dozen chapters but I'm not an, uhh, anti-book salesman. Thanks for the info regardless.
