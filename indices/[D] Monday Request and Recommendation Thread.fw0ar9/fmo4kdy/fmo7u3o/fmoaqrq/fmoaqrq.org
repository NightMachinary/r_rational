Most of the generally recommended fiction...

Mm, the list is too long. It's too much to expect the casual observer to read so I was kind of just hoping someone would have read something interesting lately that wasn't too well known or had slipped through the cracks.

The most obvious ones are: Delve, Worm et. al., He Who Fights Monsters, Something Healer, Cradle, Ra, Unsong, most of EY's stuff (HPMOR et. al.), 14, Gilded Hero, Metropolitan Man (ehh), etc. etc.

Edit: Weird Sex stuff shows up a lot. Or if not sex stuff it'll just be really weird and uncomfortable. And I know I have a lot of triggers on that front but I can't get past most of them if they're one off. But when the character is thinking with their dick more often then their head or they're getting ‘serviced' for no particular reason or one of their skills is ‘talk with women' I just can't. It's too much. I don't like all that stuff in my normal fiction :<
