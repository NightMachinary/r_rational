Just checked your posts and saw you already read Mother of Learning, which was gonna be my rec, and Worth the Candle, which while it definitely has some extremely weird and uncomfortable moments deals with them pretty well.

Long shot, but [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl][Dungeon Crawler Carl]] has zero romance and I've been enjoying it lately. It does have some prurient jokes in the game text sometimes. For shorter recs, you could give [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/][The Northern Caves]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498][The Library Unpublished]] a try, in that order. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][CORDYCEPS]] seems like the kind of thing you might have already read.

I think you might've got less of a "can't find good non-sex stuff" problem and more of an "already read every good rational fic" one. A lot of people in these threads seem to have that problem, including me. (Maybe write some?)
