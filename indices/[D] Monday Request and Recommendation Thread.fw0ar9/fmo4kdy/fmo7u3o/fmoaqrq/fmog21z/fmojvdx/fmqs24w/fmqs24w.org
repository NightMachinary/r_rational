If you want something not entirely rational I may have a few things.

Ar'Kendrythist is super long, starts off like Delve but becomes its own thing very quickly. Same level of worldbuilding and consistency as Delve (though not as much math). The main protagonist is a middle aged dude, so anything romance related takes a long time to appear, much less happen. Character development is well done, and the author has been pretty respectful about how he approaches character relationships in general. Heavily recommend.

River of Fate is a xianxia written in native english. It's pretty good, and the characters actually seem like they think before making decisions. It does the mystical aspect of cultivating well. Zero romance so far.

Chronicles of Fid is a good superhero trilogy about the world's biggest supervillain, Dr. Fid. It's not as self-consistent as Worm, but for what it sets out to do, I found the story to be engaging and Fid's character to be interesting. Zero romance.
