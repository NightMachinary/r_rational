Most of Brandon Sanderson's stuff is reasonably rational or at least adjacent. But my recommendation in general is, go for published books that are known to be good. They tend to be rational adjacent, that's what makes them good, imho it has more to do with the authors intelligence and care than with an actual intentional desire to make their stories rational..

​

The book of ancestors by Mark Lawrence is great and has a powerful non mary sue female MC. Published books tend to have less sexual or misogynistic stuff, because they are meant to be sold.

​

You may also be able to find a 'booktuber' with tastes similar to yours and read some of their recommendations. I like Daniel Greene, even though our tastes aren't exactly the same and he's kind of ignorant when it comes to foreign fiction, the books he likes tend to be good.

If you don't want or can't pay for books you can get them for free on library genesis. Here's a link, [[http://gen.lib.rus.ec]] search around if you don't trust it. It's a site made to freely distribute scientific publications and books in general to the world, and there's a fiction section.
