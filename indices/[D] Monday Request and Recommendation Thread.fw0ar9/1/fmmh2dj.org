I have discovered [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrxKX44qBJ0][The Guy who Didn't Like Musicals]] on this subreddit and it absolutely blew me away. The same team has recently released a new one, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqt4_tHLSB4][Black Friday]], and it's also absolutely incredible.

I wouldn't call them rational or rationalist fiction, but this is the best thing I have discovered in the last few years, and I wanted to share in case you haven't heard about it.

They're Sci-Fi Comedy Horror Musicals, which is a pretty crazy mix, but they're /so/ good. Imagine Dr. Horrible was 2 hours long, and every minute of it was exactly as awesome. Just watch the one from the first link, I fell in love with it in since the first song.

The same team has a bunch of other musicals, they're also pretty great, though not on the same level as these two. The others worth watching are:

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5mkyhYMaQ8][Twisted]] - the Aladdin told from the perspective of Jafar
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOblLPsAK_U][Firebringer]] - how humanity has discovered fire
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAi0XQPgXmQ&list=PLC6A915952D67F112][Starship]] - Aliens meets Little Mermaid.

I have also enjoyed [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmZhMeY5L44][Holy Musical Batman]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd3aJl930YE][Spies are Forever]]. They're also quite delightful.

Lauren Lopez stars in all of these musicals and she's amazing, absolutely steals every show she's in. Check out [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_U1iYqdkyU][this scene]] from Spies are Forever(even if you aren't planning to watch the whole thing). All the actors in this team are talented, but damn.
