For anyone who really likes the book and never read the original Lesswrong posts, there are a bunch of sequence posts that didn't make it into R:AtoZ for various reasons that could be of interest as well. Reading in chronological order of publishing could also be of value, and you can also enjoy the original comments to get an idea for how they were initially received and what kinds of questions and discussions people had at the time.
