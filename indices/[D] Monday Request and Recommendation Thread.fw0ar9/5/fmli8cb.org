If you haven't yet, try checking out the OG work on rationality, [[https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality][Rationality: From AI to Zombies.]] I've just finished my second read through, and going back and reading HPMOR has been /so/ rewarding.

It took a while for my brain to get used to the lack of narrative (it's non-fiction), but after I did, I found that it was still a very engaging read.

I've been plotting out this fanfiction in my mind and in my journals since last October. I'm only gaining traction on it now because I've actually started putting work onto being able to make smarter decisions myself, and I'm therefore becoming more able to write characters making smart decisions.

10/10 would reccomend.
