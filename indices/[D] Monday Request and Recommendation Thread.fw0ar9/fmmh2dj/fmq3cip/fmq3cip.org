I didn't realize there was an entire series of these!

I thought Twisted was pretty okay, though my favorite parts were only vaguely gestured at and it spent a lot of time making thoughtless jabs at Disney (there are so many valid reasons to have a problem with Disney; none of which Twisted seems aware of).

I just watched The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals though, and it blew me away. I think [[/r/rational]] will pretty consistently get a kick out of this one.
