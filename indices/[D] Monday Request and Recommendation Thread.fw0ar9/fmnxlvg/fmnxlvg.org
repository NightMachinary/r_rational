any good fanfics?

looking for good rational fanfics, preferably don't step too far away from the original world but its fine if there are new characters/things.

Some things that i've read that i've enjoyed (and am looking for more like):

-My hero school adventure is all wrong, as expected (my hero academia)

-Scorpions Disciple (naruto)

-Erased potential (my hero academia)

-lighting up the dark (naruto)

-pokemon: the origin of species (pokemon duh)

i've read a good deal of other fanfics from the worlds of naruto and mha but any recommendations would be great.

i would prefer some kind of getting power/training stuff but doesn't have to be that necessarily.

also, no harry potter fanfics please i have read most of them.

thanks in advance!!
