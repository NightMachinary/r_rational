I've got a few, although most of them aren't /that/ rational.

Man off the Moon is a mass effect / Fate extra crossover with Nameless as the protagonist in the ME universe. It follows nasuverse rules really closely, plus the main character does some cool things with his powers. Pacing has issues at times but it's forgivable for how fun it is.

As expected, the confession they want is wrong is an Oregairu/Love is War crossover. Done really well imo. Hachiman and Shirogane are best friends, which makes for some great chemistry.

Ex Synthetica is a Worm fanfic with Taylor having the power to make and control nanobots. Really fun, and Taylor uses her powers pretty well.

Greg Veder vs The World is a Worm fanfic with Greg getting gamer powers. Better than 90% of gamer fics out there.
