Just caught up to DCC and it was pretty interesting. The writing is fairly consistent and the distasteful humor is only over used in the kind of â€˜this was never edited' kind of way, maybe... Let's say it was engaging enough to overcome its flaws by a slight margin, at least in my opinion. It's unfinished and unless there's time skips in the future it's timescale is looking to be very, very, long so I guess I'll check back in a few years.

Thanks again! On to the next one I suppose...
