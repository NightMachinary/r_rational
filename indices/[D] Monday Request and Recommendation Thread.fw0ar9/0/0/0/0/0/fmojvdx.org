Yeah your... right. The stuff I've been reading lately has been full of that kind of stuff but it's probably just been some bad luck. I've read so many rational and rational-adjacent fictions. I'm kind of sad the well is starting to dry of stuff that isn't low-FanFiction quality. WtC was a little weird but it's well written and engaging, I took a break to numb the pain and awkwardness of her death but came back to catch up on the updates.

Thank you for the recommendations! I haven't heard of them so hopefully they're engaging.

And on the topic of writing... I used to write a lot of FanFiction plots, nothing published of course but I'm pretty sure it's in the 100k+ word range in total. Which is kind of wack. Proof is easy, I know words on the internet are cheap, if it matters. I haven't been particularly inspired for a few months but even before that I could never convince myself to commit to writing anything. It's a lot of effort and I get distracted really easily. My grammar and spelling skills are also pretty messed up from all those years of reading not-quite-edited FF so I'd probably just feel bad and rewrite everything 10 times. I wrote this stupid plot for BNHA, some romantic fix-it-fic, and then rewrote it 7 times. It was after that I realized I'd run out of ideas for that fandom, felt about not working on my original ideas, and well, here we are now much later with no updates.

So, uhh... 50/50 chance you'll see something not under this pen name out eventually.

Edit: On a side note; why are there so many harems?!? ^{yada^{yada^{power^{fantasy}}}}
