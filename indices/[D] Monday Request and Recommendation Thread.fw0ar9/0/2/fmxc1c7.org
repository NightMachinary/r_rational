I've been reading The Wandering Inn and while it has some sex in an interlude, it's given a healthy and normalish treatment. Overall, it's great!

It's set in a rationalish fantasy world, and the protagonist finds herself stranded in the wilderness fighting off monsters. She eventually fixes up an old inn and becomes an [inkeeper] (with levels).

It's a very satisfying plot/character progression. I just typed up a huge summary as an edit and lost it to a browser crash. The author is also puts out a lot of quality work very fast.
