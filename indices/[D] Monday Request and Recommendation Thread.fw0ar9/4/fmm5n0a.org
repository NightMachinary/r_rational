I've been reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst][Ar'Kendrithyst]] for the past month or so. It starts off sort of like Delve, where a middle aged dude and his daughter get isekai'd into another world with magic and a "system." It quickly becomes its own thing though. I highly recommend it.

Things I liked:

- The characters are all well written and three dimensional. There is a lot of good character development, as well as meaty relationships.

- Worldbuilding is great. Veird is a well developed place with believable history and vibrant environments, which are shown well when the characters visit those places.

- There is a good balance between the powerful protagonist and his powerful enemies, not all of whom can be defeated by purely physical means.

- The magic development + the magic of Veird itself is really interesting.

Things I didn't like:

- The main character faces a moral/personal dilemma which can be sort of hit or miss. For me it was more on the miss than the hit. I will say that it makes sense given his character though, so it doesn't seem unwarranted.

As for requests, I've got two. Anybody have recs for big meaty stories, preferably 200k words or more, that have a bunch of time pass? One thing I've noticed with long stories is that the pace is almost always really slow. I want a long story with a significant amount of time passing between the beginning and the ending (or the latest chapter I guess).

My other request is for stories with hivemind protagonists. Something like Zorian from Mother or Learning, or Taylor from Ex Synthetica, or the virus from Biomass Effect. Bonus points for using the hivemind in interesting ways (other than just a supercomputer).
