The Long Price series, by Daniel Abraham (Book 1 is "A Shadow in Summer") is excellent. It's well written with believable (imperfect) characters who act in line with what they believe instead of what the author forces them to do.

It's a well-developed fantasy world that's undergoing some very major changes throughout the series. It mostly follows the same ~6 characters throughout, with about a ten-year timeskip between books (for a total of 30 years across the series).
