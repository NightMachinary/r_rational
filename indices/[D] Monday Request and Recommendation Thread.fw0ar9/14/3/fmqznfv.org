Since you like /Blame!/ have you tried any of Tsutomu Nihei's other manga? They all have high quality art and action scenes set in dystopian futures. In particular, my favorites are /[[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=888][Biomega]]/ and /[[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=2629][Abara]]/.

For decently-rational manga in the suspense/action genre, a few of my favorites are:

- /[[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=1000][Parasyte]]/

- /[[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=930][Eden: It's and Endless World]]/
