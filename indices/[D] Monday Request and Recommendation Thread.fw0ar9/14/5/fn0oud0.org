Teppu is my favorite manga. It's pretty rational, all things considered, and short enough to read in an afternoon.

Basic premise is taking the traditional sport manga and flipping the personalities of the protagonist and antagonist. The main character is unlikable, skilled without working for it, and enjoys making other people suffer, while the antagonist is the wide eyed, happy-go-lucky, "practice and friendship is the most important thing", hero you normally see.

I know this sounds incredibly edgy and irrational, but it really isn't. The main character grows a lot, and you start sympathizing with her as you learn more of her past. The author is well aware of all the tropes and pitfalls, and never tries to make her indifference or abrasiveness good traits like normally happens with edgy protagonists.

Give it a shot. The first chapter is enough to decide if you like it or not.
