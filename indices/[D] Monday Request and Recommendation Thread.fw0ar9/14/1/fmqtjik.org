I really liked:

- Ajin

- Vinland Saga

- 20th Century Boys

- Real

- Blade of the Immortal (art more than makes up for the story)

- Oyasumi Punpun

- Kokou no Hito

These are probably the best I've ever read. Most of them are completed too. If you don't mind me asking, why didn't you like Berserk?
