Spice and Wolf (economics, character driven, historical, romance) Great slow build romance with realistic approach. No idea if the economics were rational, but they seemed reasonable to me. Most novels have a nice complete story arc to it so it's easy to get closure even if you don't read all 17. Fully translated with a sequel series

So I'm a spider, so what? (Comedy, isekai, decently smart protagonist, gamelit) Greatly enjoyed a non-human protagonist. The MC didn't make many of the glaring mistakes others in the genre do that I could tell. And it was pretty funny at parts. Up to volume 8 I believe.
