Great review! I found myself agreeing with pretty much all the points you made. It's one of those stories that I've kept up with constantly since I started reading it several months ago... it helps that newly translated chapters seem to be released in batches of 3-6 daily, giving a constant trickle of new content.

Two questions:

1. You said there are "1068 chapters," but as of this morning I'm on chapter 1106. Do you mean these were the number translated when you made your review? Do you know what the number of (untranslated) chapters are? I'm wondering if new chapters are coming out daily and are translated and posted soon after.
2. You mentioned "wait for the anime;" is there anything about an anime release, or was that +you lampooning+ just a joke?
