That was the last chapter posted to the site I used at the time of the review yeah. I don't know the number of untranslated ones, but judging from the wiki the plot has advanced significantly since 1068.

The anime thing was just a joke, but I wouldn't be surprised, much worse and less mainstream appealing garbage makes it, and LotM has already been published as a light novel and manhua so it's the natural next step.
