A month ago someone recommended Lord of the Mysteries here. I read through two million words and wrote a longer review so you guys can decide if it's for you.

tl;dr: The translation and start of the story are both really bad. However, the novel's got amazingly well crafted worldbuilding and pretty clever fight scenes, and for me that made up for the awkward Mandarin-to-English issues. Barring some Deus Ex Machinae, it has enough sidebar features for me to call it rational adjacent.
