I have to agree, LotM's characters are some of the best parts of the story. It's fun reading how Klein drags the cast with him as he progresses with power. In most Chinese web novels it's almost a feature of the story how the MC leaves the side characters in the dust and they subsequently become forgotten.

They also very distinct voices and interesting character growth, to the point that they could have their own novels. A good example would be how Alger changes his position in the organization.
