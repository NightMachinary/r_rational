Do you know any stories where two (or more) soulmates are munchkining their connection?

I know that depictions of soulmates in web novels/fanfiction differ wildly from story to story, and I don't really have a specific definition of this term in mind. Basically, how I imagine my request is: two (or more) characters have a magical connection, preferably romantic, and they make the most of it in an intelligent way.
