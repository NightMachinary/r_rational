There's a work of at least rational-adjacent fiction that I think I must have seen on this sub, because I don't know where else I would have seen it, but I can't seem to track it down.

It's an MLP fanfic, though IIRC nothing in the story actually depended on the MLP universe (I followed it without knowing anything about the setting). There's a temple on the edge of the desert with some writing on the walls from 50,000 years ago and some people in the area who remember old legends not to go near the place. The rest of the plot as I remember it (major spoilers) is that they break into the temple and go exploring while they wait for an expert in ancient languages to fly over, but when the expert arrives they translate the message as saying that there's a sealed horror at the end of the tunnel that should never be breached, and to leave this message in the reader's language to warn the the next civilization. The people who have explored are finding themselves deathly ill at this point. I think it was implied but not stated to be radiation in there? It had to be left alone for a million years, or something.
