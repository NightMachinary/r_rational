  I'm looking for books with a forward momentum, high energy and highly intelligent protagonist, like HPMOR and the Vorkosigan books. I gather that Harry was based on Miles, so it seems to be a pretty rare concept in fiction. Does anyone have any recommendations for books like this?

The books that feel most similar to the Vorkosigan series (which is one of my favourites) to me are mostly in the genre of urban fantasy - The Dresden Files, by Jim Butcher, October Daye, by Seanan McGuire, The Rook, by Daniel O'Malley, or Alex Verus, by Benedict Jacka. I'd describe the main feature of these books (shared with HPMOR and Vorkosigan) as being "Cheerful mayhem, often against an epic scope". A more action-y series is Worm, by Wildbow (web serial, free online).

I'd be curious to hear of other good works in this space.
