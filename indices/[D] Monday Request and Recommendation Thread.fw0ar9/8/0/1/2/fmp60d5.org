Not gonna get a denial from me, mate. The other day there was a guy creaming his trousers at the idea of this virus leading western countries down a more authoritarian/collectivist path. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/fo3q5e/coronavirus_quarantine_thread_week_three/flffch3][Link]]. Strange how the comment is so innocuously informative at first, and then it does a completely unexpected jackbooted about turn into fascist apologia...

But that's humanity at large, right? Actually humanity is even worse, because it's full of idiots *and* it's unmoderated! Regardless, things aren't going to get better if we just ignore their existence, and are ignorant to their arguments.
