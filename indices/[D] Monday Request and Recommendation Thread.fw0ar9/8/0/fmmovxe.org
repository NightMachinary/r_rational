I have no idea of a youtube channel, but if a subreddit might serve, check out [[/r/TheMotte]], particularly the Weekly Culture War Roundup threads. It's a spinoff of [[/r/slatestarcodex]], which was itself a descended or inspired by lesswrong.com, from which [[/r/rational]] is also descended by way of [[/r/HPMOR]]. So it's kind of like staying in the family, heh.

[[/r/TheMotte]] is definitely not all rainbows and unicorns (especially if you go against the center-right/libertarian grain) but it's full of smart, articulate people and the moderation team is competent and strict without being heavy handed, and as a result the discussion tends to be interesting and fruitful. If nothing else, as a social democrat I find it a good way to sharpen my arguments and streamline my thinking, as many of my friends lean towards "tech bro" libertarianism.

One caveat I would give you is that "hearing what the other side is thinking" may make you more well-informed, but it will not make you happier for it. It may even negatively affect your productivity. I believe there is research supporting that, but since I'm on a phone and can't provide any, consider it anecdotal.
