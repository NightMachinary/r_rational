I already posted the rational-iest to this thread; I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension). I found it on TopWebFiction with 5~ votes a few months ago and enjoyed the premise enough to keep up.

I'm recommending TopWebFiction as a place to look for content, not for content listed, because if more people use the site then perhaps we can better utilize the ranking system to sift out the turds. And there are more turds than not on that list, but I'll refrain from badmouthing them.
