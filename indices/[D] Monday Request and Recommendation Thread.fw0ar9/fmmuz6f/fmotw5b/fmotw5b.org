If you're unaware of TopWebFiction (vote / rank site) then it's worth checking for new entries every couple of months. A lot is objective trash, in my opinion, because the voting system is suboptimal and does not deliver comparative rankings for anything other than popularity. But it's a good place to find a wide selection of stories that have long-active authors.

And there are stories I've enjoyed in the lower rankings.
