The first three books of the Cradle series which have been recommended here before, are [[https://www.willwight.com/a-blog-of-dubious-intent][currently free]].

I picked up the first book in a previous promotion, and really liked it. So if you've been unsure whether or not Cradle is something you would like now is a good time to see.
