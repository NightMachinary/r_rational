There's a time and a place for everything. I'm saying I'm not going to read this story because of how it handles the sexual stuff. It feels clunky to me and the rest of the story isn't enough for me to just ignore it and keep going when there's a chance to be more that will make me groan in disappointment.

I know that sex is a large part of human nature, that it always has been. There's just so many fetishes out there and it's such a personal thing, an author dabbling in sexual content is as likely to scare someone away as they are to draw them in, even if it's just vanilla near-fluff. For example, I just read Dungeon Crawler Carl and it was chock full of so many references to a foot fetish, which personally disgusts me for a number of reasons, that I'm surprised I managed to get through the current content. I had to back out and let my mind wander a few times before the raw ‘ugh' of reading it faded away and I could get back to the kind-of-sort-of-not-really-at-all rational-adjacency of the dungeon crawl. If I backed out of every story that had something disagreeable in it then MoL might have been the only fic here I ever finished. (On review the fact that Zorian did the typical ‘not-trusting-anyone' thing that always causes me second hand emberassment I might have ducked out of that one too... I just wouldn't read anything. And that would be very, very, boring.)

Also the ultimate response to any ‘in-story' explanation is that the author had a reason, or lack of one, for including or not including something in their story. It's up to them, at the end of the day, because what matters most is that the author is making something they enjoy and if they pandered to everyone's whims there wouldn't be a story. That stuff felt unnecessary to me, personally.
