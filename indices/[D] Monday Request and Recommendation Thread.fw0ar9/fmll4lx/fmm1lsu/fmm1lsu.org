Reborn: Apocalypse has very high forward momentum, although the most recent volume did not portray it as well. The premise is that a cultivator goes back in time after humanity gets destroyed by another species. His goal is to make sure humanity survives. If you know about Cradle by Will Wight, this is like Cradle + Death Note. Not very rational but very fun.
