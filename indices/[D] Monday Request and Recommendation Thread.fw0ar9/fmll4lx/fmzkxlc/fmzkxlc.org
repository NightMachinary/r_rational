  Does anyone know any good books with a realistic take on the life of an average person during various time periods, like prehistoric, roman times, medieval, etc.

Have you read Ken Follet's stuff, e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth][The Pillars of the Earth]]? Medieval saga about a town in England, and the people jostling for power in it. Protagonists are minor nobility, farmers, merchants, or builders. Content warning: lots of violence, some graphical sexual violence in some chapters.
