  New sites for webfiction other than RoyalRoad, AO3, Fanfiction.net, Fimfiction, Storiesonline, and Novelupdates. Especially looking for any blog webfiction that isn't on other websites

topwebfiction.com and the [[http://webfictionguide.com/][WebFictionGuide]]

If you've ever wanted to browse stories on wordpress blogs like you might look through lists of titles on those other sites, these are the place to do it.

Also going to second [[https://fiction.live][fiction.live]]. It's awful to search through and sometimes tends towards more quality porn than quality literature, but there are absolute gems hidden there among the muck.

And don't forget, there's a lot of decent writing on SB/SV/QQ.
