There's an interesting erotica called The Gamer, found on chyoa.com (it's like a text based adventure website). Follow the route written by neo_kenka. It's like an erotica version of The Gamer manhua. I both recommend and un-recommend this. It's interesting in how it explores sapient creatures created by the MC's system, and their dubious existence (are they automatons? do they have free will? Are they philosophical zombies?). There's some sorta deconstruction going on also with the MC's charisma and libido stat(which is ever rising), as well as his role as The Gamer (his origin and purpose). And the mc's build is really cool, it's like a mix between dimensionalism and summoning. Also copious amounts of sex and bodily fluids, hence the un-recommendation. Really interesting if you can get past that though.
