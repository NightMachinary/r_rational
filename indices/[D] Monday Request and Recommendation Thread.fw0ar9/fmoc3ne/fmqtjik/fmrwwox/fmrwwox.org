  If you don't mind me asking, why didn't you like Berserk?

I read up to the end of the Golden Age arc. The only good thing the manga has going for it are the relationship between Guts and Griffith which I admit is pretty good. But the rest of the story is just feels like a typical manga with just a lot more gore and sex. Nothing else impressed me: the worldbuilding is standard pseudomedieval, the romance weak, the fights are mediocre with just Guts slicing everyone with ease (granted on that last one I went into after reading much more clever fight scenes from Sanderson which might have made me biased).

In particular, I can't fathom why people praise it for the art: while it does quite a few detailed scenes it's not much more so than most other popular series and IMO the characters look meh because the artstyle is obsolete 80s style. And the arc ends with a literal Deus Ex Machina with Guts being saved by Skull Knight. Maybe subsequent arcs fix those things but I googled 'best Berserk arcs' and most people seemed to think the Golden Age arc is the best so I decided to cut my loses right then and there.

Thanks for the recs though!
