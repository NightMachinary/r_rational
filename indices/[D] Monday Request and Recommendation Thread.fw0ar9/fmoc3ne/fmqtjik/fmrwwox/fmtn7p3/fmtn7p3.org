Ah I see. If you didn't like it by the end of the Golden Age arc you probably won't like the rest of it. I guess the reason many people, me included, really liked it was because the end of the golden age arc is such a drastic change for all the characters. Besides a lot of people compared it to the Red Wedding scene from GoT, which I can't disagree with.

As for the art, honestly I have to disagree. I think the style is perfect for the tone it wants to convey, and the amount of detail for even the minor stuff is what carries it forward. While other manga would reserve a lot of detail for the two-page spreads Berserk does that for almost each page, which is why chapters take a long time. You'll see what I mean if you just browse through the latest chapters, and Miura has been doing that for at least 150 chapters. The only artists I've seen who put that much effort to singular panels are [[https://imgur.com/a/JMbki][Kaoru Mori]], [[https://imgur.com/r/manga/DFU5r][Shinichi Sakamoto]], and [[https://imgur.com/a/FEzuRN2][Yusuke Murata]].
