"Having to face consequences for a wrong committed a long time ago" is also a story trope, often one that leads to a "Redemption equals death" story. The absolute /worst/ that could have happened would be that the Wicked Enchanter survives the war, completely redeems himself and became a good person, never raping or torturing anyone after that, in which case the Red Axe gets to become the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist][Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist]], an archetype that /often wins/ (despite being an /antagonist/ archetype). Much more likely, the Enchanter will die in the war against the Dead King, or, if he doesn't, he'll revert to his previous behaviour fairly quickly and the Red Axe will get to hunt him down completely scot-free.

So, the Enchanter will be either be dead, or legitimate prey, fairly shortly, and all the Axe is being asked to do until then is /prioritize the war against the greater evil/. Not to let bygones be bygones, not to forgive and forget, just to put the grudge on hold /until the existential threat is dealt with./
