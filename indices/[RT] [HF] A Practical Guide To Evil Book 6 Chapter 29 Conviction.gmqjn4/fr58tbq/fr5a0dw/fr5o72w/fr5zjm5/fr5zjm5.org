Wat

Literally nothing about Calernia or Creation suggests that is the case. No one becomes immortal or unpunishable because a shift in the overall narrative has occurred.

The end of the DK's story is just that, the end of the DK. It would usher in alongside it a new era of limited Named conflict if Cat gets her way, but nowhere in the Accords nor in Cat's mind does that say Named cannot be punished for their actions.

Cat herself would be the first one behind Red Axe to stab the Enchanter once the Truce was over, even under the accords.

There's gonna be a fuckton of Named conflict once the DK goes down or is put back in his box. Old greivances will be executed the second the T&T is declared null and void. I give Cat even odds of getting out of the declaration without being wounded by someone on either side. And a 100% chance Cat proceeds to gank at least one villain.
