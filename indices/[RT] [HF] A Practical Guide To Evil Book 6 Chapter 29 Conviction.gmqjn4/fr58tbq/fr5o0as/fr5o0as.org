  The T&T don't ask for heroes to make compromise with Evil, they ask for heroes to make compromise with evil, which is of course a much harder ask.

They are literally asking for heroes to choose the lesser of two evils, /for now/.

The Dead King has done far worse than the Wicked Enchanter did; sure, it's not fair to let the Wicket Enchanter get off scot-free, but is it any better, in any sense, in /any universe/, to let the Dead King get off because you can't /delay gratification/ until the Dead King is dealt with?
