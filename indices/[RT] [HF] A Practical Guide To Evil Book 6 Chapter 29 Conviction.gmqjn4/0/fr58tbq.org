I think Red Axe legitimately has a pretty good point. The T&T does in fact protect absolutely hideous people from the repercussions of the things they've done - and it means that they will face no punishment, even after all of this is over. This is a world based on story logic. Do you think that the conscripts that helped in the war to kill the Dead King will be punished at the end of their duty? No, they'll get off scot-free. That's the end of the story. The end of one era and the start of the next necessarily means the creation of a blank slate - and stories crossing between the two are going to be far and few between. Cat never really grapples with this; to her, the only thing that matters is killing the Dead King, even if it involves letting a rapist live. Cat's new era and blank slate have real costs and the costs are all the people, usually villains, who have killed or raped countless people getting away with it in the end. The T&T don't ask for heroes to make compromise with Evil, they ask for heroes to make compromise with evil, which is of course a much harder ask.
