Let me know how Cat would have reacted if she was raped and then told that she mustn't seek retribution against her rapist because it would be too inconvenient. It is simply a fact that the blank slate of the T&T will create a blank slate that the Accords are based on - absolving people of their crimes from before it. Cat created a world where people like the Wicked Enchanter will get away with everything that they ever did before - and the only hope for justice is that they get caught doing it again, in the future. Cat's expectations are that people should ignore whatever injustice was done to them - you must of course think of the greater war effort and do whatever is necessary. The whole sum of Red Axe's point is that the T&T weren't actually the only thing she could have done, it was just the easiest solution and the one that would give her the largest number of soldiers. There are flaws to that approach and to pretend otherwise is absurd.
