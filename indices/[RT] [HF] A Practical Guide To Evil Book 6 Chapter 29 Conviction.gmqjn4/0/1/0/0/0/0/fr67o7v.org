  Let me know how Cat would have reacted if she was raped and then told that she mustn't seek retribution against her rapist because it would be too inconvenient.
#+end_quote

I suppose "inconvenient" is one word to describe "The Dead King is given free rein over a large portion of Calernia."

And I certainly can't think of any character who has an arc of "she horribly wronged Cat and uncounted other people" and passed through "Cat stopped seeking retribution against her because it would just be too inconvenient to not have her around on Cat's side."

  It is simply a fact that the blank slate of the T&T will create a blank slate that the Accords are based on - absolving people of their crimes from before it. Cat created a world where people like the Wicked Enchanter will get away with everything that they ever did before - and the only hope for justice is that they get caught doing it again, in the future.

I've been thinking about the literary concept of redemption a lot recently. What would it really take for me to say the good that a person has done really should be remembered more than whatever atrocities they've committed? I can't say that "risking their life to save the world" would be /enough/ (certainly not if they went right back to their old habits), but I'd at least say it would make a good /start/.

Named, in this universe, are tremendous force multipliers. Losing the Wicked Enchanter (and, almost certainly, the Red Axe as well) won't single-handedly lose them the battle against the Dead King, but having two fewer Named could cost /thousands/ of non-Named lives. How many /more/ people than the Wicked Enchanter ever harmed are going to die because the Red Axe couldn't prioritize?

  Cat's expectations are that people should ignore whatever injustice was done to them - you must of course think of the greater war effort and do whatever is necessary.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say "ignore" (more like "live with"), but /yes/. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few: it's a concept that any "hero" should be familiar with.

  The whole sum of Red Axe's point is that the T&T weren't actually the only thing she could have done, it was just the easiest solution and the one that would give her the largest number of soldiers.
#+end_quote

Sure, they weren't the only thing. I'll throw you a bone and say that they might not have even been the /right/ thing. But, in the situation Cat was in, it was the best solution that she could come up with.

And if the Red Axe had /offered/ a better solution, one that allowed both a non-Pyrrhic victory against the Dead King as well as a more sturdy moral ground to build upon when the war was over, I could respect her for that. Instead, she's just trying to burn the Truce and Terms to the ground and tell Cat to "do better or be cast aside."

And the cost of that, of discarding the Truce and Terms without replacing them with something at least /nearly/ as acceptable, would be heroes and villains turning on each other and all of Calernia falling under darkness. Would that be justice? Would you and she /then/ be satisfied that the debt to her had been repaid? Because /that/ is the price she not just was willing to be paid, but was /trying/ to be paid. And that sounds more like the act of a villain than any hero I'd name.

  There are flaws to that approach and to pretend otherwise is absurd.
#+end_quote

No one is "pretending otherwise." I've used the idea "lesser of two evils" several times in this conversation because it is an illustration that yes, Cat's method of solving this has flaws. It /is/ an evil to sweep the harm that people have done under the table, in the name of fighting a different evil; who could possibly deny that? Letting someone like the Wicked Enchanter skip merrily away from the deeds they've done is /absolutely/ evil. But it's a /necessary/ evil. And I would like to see any sort of argument that you have that it's not the lesser one.
