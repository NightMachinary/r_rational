The PGtE world is based entirely on stories. The end of the story of the Dead King and the start of the new era that Cat envisions is essentially offering a blank slate to the rapists and murderers that some Villains are. Like, the T&T is the foundation of the Accords and the T&T is a blank slate for all those villains in question - so when all this is over, those villains will get off for free because that is how a blank slate works. Cat can say all she wants that she wouldn't care if they died after the fact but the reality is that she is completely ignoring the story momentum of the T&T and the fight against the Dead King and what that would mean if it all works in the end.
