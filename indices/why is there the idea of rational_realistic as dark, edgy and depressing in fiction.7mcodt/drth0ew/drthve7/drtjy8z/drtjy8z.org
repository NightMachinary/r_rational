Well, I think Mother of Learning is kinda optimistic. The world is far from crapsack, civilization is progressing steadily. Yeah there is a looming doom, but isn't there one in real world, too?

Same with Oh This Has Not Gone Well - despite some bad parts, it's mostly about wish fullfilment and having lots of friends admiring you.

  why is there always a villain?

It's easier to make conflict interesting. I was a dungeon master (pen&paper RPG kind) and the best way to lose players is to stop giving them challenges. If everything they try to do succeeds, 1 hour later they don't want to play anymore.

But it's not always. For a story without a villain see Alice in Wonderland for one example. Solaris by Stanis≈Çaw Lem, or Memoirs Found in Bathtube are another. Actually Lem had quite a lot of these, now that I think of it. He mostly writes about how impossible to understand everything is :)

I don't know why people don't write rational takes on these. Maybe they are plenty rational already?
