Here some things that may help:

- Focus on the small (not too small) man and their happiness, like good food, a companion, new places to know, booze. the world is cruel, but we are always working to lessen it. Imagine undertale, having fun at sans's puns, or eating at grillby's the "world is a game and we can die, so why even worry?"

- Focus on the people who care, there is pockets of good faith in the world, focus them, family and friends are 2 good starts, make a story like "the Last of us". the world is broken, love and friendship is not.

- Discover the good part of people not considered good. even the soldier who killed many loves his family and his dog, and he does charity as a way to deal with the pain of his past job, the Persona and Yakuza series do a good job at it.

To put it simply man: "the world IS dark and edgy, but our relationships and some enviroments are not. Do not white them fleeting or worthless, show them and how with a bit os smart and intelligence of its inhabitants, you can maintain them." Boom. Happy rational/realistic story.
