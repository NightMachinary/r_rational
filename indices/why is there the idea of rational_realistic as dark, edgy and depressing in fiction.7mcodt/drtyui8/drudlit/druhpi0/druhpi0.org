I suppose at that point the question is what direction does that rational fiction then take? Rational fiction centers around the characters being smart or perhaps the setting being smart. If you take a situation with little conflict and problems to solve, how do you show that it's "smart"?

I think it's very possible; I just think it's much more challenging than simply "Use smarts to fight something."
