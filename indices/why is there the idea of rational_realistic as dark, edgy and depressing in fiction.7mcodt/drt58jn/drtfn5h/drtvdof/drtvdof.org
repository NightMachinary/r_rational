I guess it also depends on what the MC is struggling against. If he is struggling to, say, cure disease then that could reasonably be positive since diseases aren't intelligent enemies that fight back rationally (ignoring disease resistance). But if a weak rational MC is struggling against a rational super-villain then it is unlikely for that villain to lose. To give an overused example, Hitler lost because he made enemies stronger than himself, not because he was 'destined' to lose.
