Consider many of the narrative tropes that are commonly part of "uplifting" narratives:

- Underdogs can win through triumph of will/spirit/likability
- Virtue is rewarded (and its corollaries: cheaters never prosper, villains always receive their comeuppance, etc).
- You can achieve anything you want if you believe in yourself, try hard enough, persist long enough, etc.

Most of these run counter (or, at a minimum, are orthogonal) to rational principles.

- It's irrational to bet on the underdogs: the underdogs, /by definition/, are the ones we can expect to lose, and yet when it comes to winning the football game in the third act of the movie, the most importance thing seems to be pluck and scrappiness, rather than competence. In real life, it's surprising if the characters who seem the weakest at the start of the season turn out to win the championship, but in most (non-rational) narratives, it's practically inevitable. Also, in many "rebels vs the evil empire" stories, there's an undercurrent of "the bad guys lose because they're stupid" (see [[http://www.worldconquer.org/evil_overlord.html][The Evil Overlord List]]), and once you remove irrational traits from the villain, you are left with a story where the powerful empire easily and predictably crushes the weak rebels. (One could argue that a story where "the villains lose because they're stupid" works in the context of rational fiction, since it allows for a story where the main characters are able to win through superior cunning, but if the villains are really that stupid, it leaves us with the glaring question of how they rose to power and maintained it before the heroes showed up. Hence, most rational stories that tell the classic "brains over brawn" story focus more on making the heroes smart, rather than making the villains dumb.)
- Virtue certainly has its rewards, but there's no reason that petting a dog in act 1 should, as a logical consequence, result in winning a big football game in act 3. Yet "small acts of kindness" early on are often a (narrative) indicator that a character is about to perform well at some sort of unrelated task. This might be understandable if act 3 was about the main character being tested on something directly linked to traits like charisma (e.g. you can draw a logical connection between being courteous to the waitress and bantering with the bellhop in act 1, and then later succeeding at a big interview in act 3), but there's no reason that the villain's personality defects should lead to him being worse at throwing a football (as so often seems to be the case).
- The majority of the time, the obstacles that lie between you and your goal go beyond things like sheer willpower. No matter how much I want it, I'm never going to explore the moons of Jupiter. And there are some times when persistence doesn't make you a good person at all, e.g. love. (As Mary Robinette Kowal has pointed out, most rom-coms could actually be viewed has horror movies if you took out the laugh track.)

One of the easiest way to avoid non-rational tropes is to intentional subvert them, which George R.R. Martin often does. e.g. Ned Stark is noble, honest, and many of the other things we associate with a "heroic" character, and rather than being irrationally rewarded (good things happen to him for no reason other than that he's a heroic "good person" who "deserves it,") these traits are ultimately his undoing, as he is blind to the scheming around him (and unwilling to scheme himself). Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that "virtue is (inherently) punished," I think the message is more that "many of the traits that we associate with virtue tend to suggest a certain kind of naivete which is easily preyed upon by those who are less burdened by notions of what is 'noble' and 'right,' and 'good intentions don't mean much if you don't have the ability to back them up.'" (Simply inverting the trope from "virtue is rewarded" to "virtue is punished" would be just as irrational.) Subverting these kinds of narrative tropes in this way tends to produce narratives that are darker.

None of this means that rational fiction has to be negative and cynical. And in fact, the nature of certain narrative tropes being orthogonal to rationality means that they can be compatible with a rational narrative: petting the dog won't make you any better at throwing a basketball, but it certainly won't make you any /worse/, so it's okay for our protagonist to pet the dog and then throw the game-winning basket so long as it's not implied that the fact the basketball victory is the universe's way of giving the protagonist a sort of cosmic reward for good behavior.

There's also a lot of cases where things like persistence and optimism are not /sufficient/ to achieving a goal, but they can still be /helpful/. For example, Mark Watney (The Martian) doesn't succeed /merely/ because of how hard he tries; his cognitive skill as an engineer and botanist are critical to his survival. But morale is also a critical part of keeping him moving from day to day, so The Martian can tell us a story about the triumph of the human spirit while also being a rational story where scientific knowledge is key to surviving the barren wasteland that is Mars.

You can also preserve the appearance of some of the "feelgood" tropes simply by adding a few causal links between them. e.g. "character was nice to a little old lady in act 1, rewarded by the universe for good behavior in act 3" isn't rational, but you could have "protagonist performs a small act of kindness for a background character in act 1, that character later comes back to help out when the protagonist is in a jam," and preserve the logic (assuming it's foreshadowed properly and executed in a way that doesn't strain credulity) while still feeling warm and fuzzy because we saw someone behaving well and then experiencing good consequences. Again, this still has to hold up to a certain amount of logical scrutiny, and thus the execution matters: if protag is nice to a bellhop at a New York hotel in act 1, and then flies to San Francisco and just happens to encounter that same bellhop in in act 3 (who is on vacation in San Francisco his brother and randomly encountered the protagonist out of the millions of people in SF, for some implausible reason), then we're going to call foul, but you could arrange things in a much more narrative plausible way by making the settings of "small act of kindness in act 1" and "reward in act 3" more geographically proximate.
