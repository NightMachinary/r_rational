great assessment

yet, there is space for happy and realistic stories, there are some rare manga I read that had people in a post apocaliptic world that is pretty rational (not perfect thought) where there is a heart warming story of people working together to achieve happiness, same with some LitRPG, but even if they are somewhat famous, I fail to see where the stereotype comes from, and why we stick to it so much, come on!

There is something happening, in other posts I ask why there is so many stories about isekai in a game world, but why it's so rare to have a story where there are normal people playing a game and having fun in a "realistic manner" (or comedy, like netoge)... maybe the trope is making momentum to this idea, and this momentum helps the trope, in a vicious cicle. but again, why not change?
