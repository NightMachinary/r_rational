I think another possible reason is that there's simply a strong overlap between people who like "rational" stories and people who like dark stories. Someone could write a simple slice-of-life series that has a general upbeat tone to it that focuses on a rational main character, but the rational community doesn't want it. It probably has been written somewhere but we don't know about it because it wasn't very popular.

I'm not sure what a light rationalist story would look like either. Stories where the protagonist gets presented with overwhelming problems pretty much have to be dark; if it wasn't dark then the problem wouldn't be overwhelming. But if the problem isn't overwhelming, then it's pretty easily solved for a rational protagonist and it's not an interesting story. I mean a great deal of conflicts in light stories are caused by lack of communication, and while good communication isn't a Less-Wrong style "rationalist" strategy, it is something that any protagonist who's just generally rational would do.

This is just all off the top of my head though. It may be totally off base.
