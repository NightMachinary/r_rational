Well... Good Read, But Like You Said, It's possible to have feel good moments and be rational, and there is stories where it happens, yet, they are rare, I like some approaches of some manga slice of life where it can't be more realistic yet have good moments, but i fail to see these kinds of literature here and in my native language to go well... i question, why?
