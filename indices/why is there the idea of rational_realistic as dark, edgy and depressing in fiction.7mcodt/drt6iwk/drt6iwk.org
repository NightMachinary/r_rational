Because most fiction is hopelessly idealistic?

Reality *is* darker, edgier, and more depressing, so any work that attempts to add realism, such as rational works, tends to be darker, edgier, and more depressing.

Disclaimer: I'm dark and edgy and very depressed. I might be projecting onto the world. ^{But I doubt that.}
