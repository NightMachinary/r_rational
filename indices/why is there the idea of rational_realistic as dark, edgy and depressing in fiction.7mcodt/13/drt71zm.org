I'd love some recommendations of lighter happier rational stuff too!

I personally love Friendship is Optimal verse because it has such a good ending... but many people think it's a horrific ending so.... who knows. I do think the fact it is ponies makes it lighter and happier at least in "flavour" if not in substance.

[self involved aside] I'm partway done with a supernatural romance novella that is pretty light and happy compared with other stuff I've read here, and I have a werewolf concept I'm thinking of writing up next that basically turns all the werewolf tropes on their head (my werewolves are quite old and collectivist/co-operative/nurturing) - but the fact my werewolves are all pretty light and friendly and supportive of one another makes it very, very hard to write up a plot that includes them as a focal point because their reaction to problems is "let's get into a big group and discuss it" and that tends to solve problems. Unfortunately it's pretty likely that none of this stuff will be available to be read any time soon so... let's get some recommendations people!
