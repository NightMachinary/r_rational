I have a recommendation, make things small,

make a person, a couple or a smal group who is down to earth, and intelligent, and put they in real and relatable situations and narrate how they get over it.

In your idea:

-werewolfs live in a hard world, and are mostly extinct in the west because of the church, but now the things changed and they are not considered a danger anymore, yet there is not many anymore, just some families.

one young wolf tired of the stagnant and old world look for a forest on the east kingdoms with his girlfriend, considered a safe heaven for their tribe but abandoned because of old persecution, considering its safe to go back now.

Narrate how they live their life in the jorney, how they maintain a relationship, show the amazing fantasy world, and show their cooperative and happy life, even in almost extinction and (lingering) prejudice.

there you get it, rational, realistic, AND optimistic. even if the forest is no more, you could consider the trip and friends on the way a good story.
