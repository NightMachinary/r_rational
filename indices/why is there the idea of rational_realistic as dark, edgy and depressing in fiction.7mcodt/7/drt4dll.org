Part of the reason is that real life can be depressing. Realistic fiction tries to include consequences that would happen in the real world: CPR hardly ever works, being knocked unconscious can give lasting brain damage, PTSD is a real thing, friendship doesn't give you magic powers, random Evil-Corp contractor probably has a family to look after and is just doing what he can to make ends meet. When you take away the Cartoon-Mustache-Twirling-Villain and implement a Could-be-a-Real-Person-Villain (as rational fiction is want to do), you inevitably have a mess of motivations, consequences, and problems that don't have easy solutions. That is dark and depressing, yes, but merely a result of the premises and rules of rational fiction. Rarely is rational fiction edgy for the sake of being edgy.

Darkness is everywhere in the real world. If your story is focused on solving real problems, you have to look at that darkness to show why it needs the light.
