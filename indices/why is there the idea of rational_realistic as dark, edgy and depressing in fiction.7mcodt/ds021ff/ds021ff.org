Well, the simplest answer is that making things darker is most obvious way to give your story higher stakes and make it more intense. The worst things are the more important the success of the protagonists is. In Home Alone the peril is in the thieves robbing the house and... maybe killing Kevin? In the Goonies the Fratellis are established as murderers early on and their willingness to kill the kids to get their way is made more explicit. They're both the same type of movie, but the Goonies is made somewhat darker and more intense by upping the peril.

And more importantly one of the biggest pitfalls amateur writers tend to fall into is their desire for their story to be taken seriously as cool, intense and important, even if doing so is detrimental to the kinds of stories they want to write. This is why so many amateur works of fiction will, like, turn from light hearted fun to darkness and despair on a dime.
