well we have many original fiction, and I fail to see the optimistic side of rational.

and why is there always a villain? why do we focus so much in the bad things? we could just have some story that focus on a love story of 2 people working together in a rational and cruel world for a dream, like make a bakery or a objective like to go to a certain place, this seen interesting and fun. yet, rare.
