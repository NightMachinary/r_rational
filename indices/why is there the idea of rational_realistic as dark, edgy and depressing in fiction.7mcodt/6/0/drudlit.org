good point,yet, I would like to see otherwise, rational does not mean it has to be all that outside of our perspectives, why couldn't we make more of a good love story like spice and wolf? or a good adventure like log horizon where instead of dealing with "isekai" its just politics on a online MMO server (those who play know what happens)... or, why not a comedy like Netoge, without all the coincidences, but instead just innnocent love from far apart like, in different countries, and wacky friends, that like to interact? (I am showing my otaku side, I know)

I am kind of tired of all this dread, don't we have already enough darkness on the news? I like rational way of thinking, but a bit less of shade and darkness would be cool!
