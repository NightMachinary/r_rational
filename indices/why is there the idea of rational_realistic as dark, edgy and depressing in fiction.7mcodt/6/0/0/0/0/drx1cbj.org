When I speak about conflict, I mean it in a more general sense. It's not always a literal fight or war or what have you. Stories can't really exist without conflict. That's what makes a story a story.

For example, the conflict within Sherlock Holmes is the mystery. The "who dunnit?". "Who killed Mrs. Peabody?". That's the conflict. It's Holmes vs. the criminal/the lack of knowledge he's given by the crime scene.

And yes, I agree that the idea of rational is to have characters making rational choices. That's what I was getting at with the "smart" comment. I wasn't saying that to imply that they'd be doing the mental equivalent of parlor tricks. What I'm saying is that I feel it's naturally more difficult to apply rational thinking to those sorts of genres. Think about if you tried to write a rational love story. It would be so easy for so much of the "magic" that makes good love stories /good/ to be lost because being rational is all about acknowledging reality and there really isn't any "magic" to speak of. But stories themed around the "magic of love" definitely sell more and feel nicer than stories in the "neurochemical reactions combined with social convention and availabilitty" vein. I think it's certainly doable to have a compelling, rational narrative about falling in love, I just think it's very challenging.

I understand your desire for less grimdark stuff; I do. Sometimes, it's just not the funnest thing to read. I 150% agree. It's just that, based on what's popular and what usually has rational fiction written about it, grimdark is what you're going to get because reality /is/ grimdark. That's how you win in the real world, by doing things that would make a decent person's stomach turn because you're looking at the big picture. For example, the drone strikes sanctioned by Obama's administration. Obama's considered one of the better presidents America's had in recent years by a wide margin (and I completely agree with that statement!). However, on the flip side, he also signed off on hundreds of innocent foreign civilians' deaths because, on some level, he (or someone in his corner) felt that it was worth it in the grand scheme of things. I'm not saying that's good or bad; I'm not saying he was right or wrong. But anyone can agree it's pretty horrifying. That's a jarring, horrifying part of a great man's legacy in office. And there very well could be more.

So in these stories we have, that grow to span issues that affect their respective cities/countries/worlds, you're going to have horrifying stuff. Because sometimes you've got to do horrifying stuff to win. And rational protagonists are usually all about winning since win conditions at that level of conflict are often on the level of "preserve the human race". And any rational person knows that it's foolhardy to go into a fight with one hand tied behind your back, which is essentially what people do if they're not willing to do "horrifying" things on some level.
