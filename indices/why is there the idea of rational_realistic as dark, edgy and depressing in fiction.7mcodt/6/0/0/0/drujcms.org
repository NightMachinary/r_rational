well... I may be wrong, but... if you consider love, everyday politics, and comedy to be against the idea to show intelligence, well, I think it would be really sad.

Consider that most fiction here use these as subplots in a darkened or edgy way,

And to be precise, the idea of rational in this subreddit is, to have characters and world follow rational thinking, no "mirrors and smoke" without a reason.

And even if its to show how smart or intelligent someone is, you can do it without this stereotype, like for example some of the shows I mentioned before, (except Netoge) and let me ask,

Sherlock holmes and many of his alikes are considered inteligent, yet they have mostly no "big" conflict by your stnadards... and yet they are rational... I fail to see what you meant.
