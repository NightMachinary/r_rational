I think the main reason this occurs is because, in most of the conflicting situations you're presented with in most narrative structures (specifically ones meant to entertain in genres like action/adventure, mystery, horror), you've got heroes and villains and some evil plot to foil.

In typical fiction, we can look the other way on things like "Why DIDN'T he just shoot James Bond?" or "Why is there a countdown?" and other typical tropes.

But rational fiction is all about being intelligent and acknowledging those things. And not ignoring them and leaving holes in your story. And, unfortunately, that means a lot of the darker implications of conflict acknowledged in rational fiction whereas typical fiction may gloss over things or present them in a more rose colored light.

Take, for example, Power Rangers. It's about a team of brightly colored guys and girls kicking monster/alien butt. With mega robot battles more often than not. In populated cityscapes.

You're never going to hear about the dozens if not hundreds killed as collateral damage in those giant robot battles. You're never gonna hear about when the Megazord fell on a school and killed a bunch of kids that didn't evacuate in time. You're not going to hear about how the Green Ranger has PTSD from nightmares about getting eaten by aliens, which is something that could totally happen to him. (To be fair, if you DO hear about mental health issues, it will be with them getting resolved in a 2-3 episode arc or the person in question getting on a bus)

But it would be remiss of a rational story to not acknowledge things like that. And so, a lot of the darkness that's glossed over in a typical piece of fiction is brought center stage because it's something that logically /would/ occur and it should be acknowledged if you're trying to stick true to writing a rational piece of fiction. Even the lightest stories have dark, dark implications/side effects that should be acknowledged in a rational fic, especially if your leads are the type of people to both notice and care about that sort of thing.

TL DR: Most fiction has dark implications that they gloss over. Rational fiction doesn't have that luxury and, thus, they tend to be darker on average.
