Yeah true, is there a need to not be dark?

Consider, this reddit, there is no place where it says it has to be dark.

And for most of it, I think that the rational approach is kind of cheerful, it is like there is always a good ending...

I just do not understand, why the stereotype and why some authors stick to it....

I do not know many stories but what would you indicate that are nor dark or depressing, but are rational or at least a bit realistic
