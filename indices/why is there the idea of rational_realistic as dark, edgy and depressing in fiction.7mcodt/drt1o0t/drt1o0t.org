It's important to note that the majority of the rational fiction I've come across /intends to be positive at the end,/ but doesn't flinch away from the darkness in the middle.

Like, if you were telling the story of human history from 10000 years ago to the year 2000, that'd honestly be a fairly positive and uplifting ending, but it would be dark and depressing for a /lot/ of it.

AFAICT, most rationalist fiction follows this same pattern. Things do come together, but they come together in /spite/ of the darkness, rather than being cheerful all the way through.
