Yes. It could also be true that because rational people have a consequently higher chance of ostracism they might channel evolution born angst into their writing. Thus making the literature /actually/ darker.

Honestly not a very testable hypothesis though. Writers of any genre probably have a higher chance of ostracism (self-induced or otherwise).
