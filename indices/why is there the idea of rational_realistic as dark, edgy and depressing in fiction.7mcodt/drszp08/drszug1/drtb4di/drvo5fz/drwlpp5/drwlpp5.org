Sure, that's fair. But the difference is in the way they act, not in the people that react to them. The idea that critical thought causes you to be seen as an edgy downer, and that this is somehow inevitable, is a self-serving falsehood I think.

Contrast Sam Harris when Steven Pinker: Both are pretty rational-minded people, but Harris is seen by the left as an edgelord because he blithely ignores political reality, while Pinker spends more effort on sounding nice. So I feel that "we get seen as edgy because people are dumb and can't handle the truth" is exactly the kind of edgy nonsense that causes the problem in the first place. Even though there is a kernel of truth to it.
