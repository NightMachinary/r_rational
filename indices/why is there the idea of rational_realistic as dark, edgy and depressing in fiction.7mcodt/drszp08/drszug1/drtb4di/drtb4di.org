Oh come on, that's way too self-serving. There are plenty of brilliant people who carry an aura that people find genuinely inspiring. Nobody thinks Elon Musk or Stephen Hawkins are edgy downers, even if they do talk about the world possibly ending - in fact, people find that kind of thing exciting!

However, many Less-Wrong types are prone to depression, and have difficulty getting motivated to do anything, and so of course they're not inspiring like Elon Musk. And yeah, if Elon Musk were a bit more rational he would probably be more doubtful about his own Mars ambitions, and in turn that would make him less inspiring, so sure there's an inverse relation there. But it is way too self-serving to say that the problem is with everybody else being too fundamentally irrational to appreciate our brilliance.
