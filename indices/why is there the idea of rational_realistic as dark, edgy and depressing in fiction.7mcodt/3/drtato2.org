I get what you mean. This is a common trope with Naruto fanfiction (MFD being the worst offender, IMO), where you often have a crapsack world even though it isn't necessary: A world with rational use of chakra could easily be awesome to live in, after all, given certain assumptions. However, I think this is because a lot of canon just has objectively aweful things in it which are just glossed over, and so when you're writing a deconstruction it just feels natural to want to explore those aspects of the world instead.

The same is true for other settings: e.g. Metropolitan Man is darker than canon Superman because it is deconstruction of what is ultimately an escapist fantasy.

However, Stoppit is right that this is a general flaw with aspiring rationalists: I think it's more than just PR, I think it's actually the case that most new rationalists find it exciting to point out all the way things suck. It's essentially a type of reversed stupidity where people will take society's "emotions are more important than fact, always be nice and optimistic and people will like you" and invert it into "the world sucks and most people are too stupid to realize it" in order to show of their intelligence.

It's actually a huge challenge to convince people to A) look at the world for what it actually is, and B) remain positive about fixing all of the problems, and it's an issue that shines through in our fiction as well.
