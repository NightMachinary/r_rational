Hmmm, anti-nihilist as in being genuinely bright and optimistic despite the world sucking? I think Dr. Stone counts. And I think other stories including the Need to Become Stronger, The Waves Arisen and even Marked for Death have moments like that, of the main character saying "screw the odds, I'm fixing this". Heck, actually, I think HPMOR totally counts as anti-nihilist. It's not always realistic, but there's certainly that very strong sense of "we can do better, we will do better, just you wait."
