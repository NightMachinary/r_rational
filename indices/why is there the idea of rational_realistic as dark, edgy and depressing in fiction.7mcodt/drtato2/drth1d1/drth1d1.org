there is a trope about it, its called anti nihilist and the ubermensc in TV troupes, but I fail to see works in that manner, even here, do you have a example?

I would like to see a world like that, and there is in other contexts, for example, there was a manga with a rational and pretty depressing apocaliptic world, with a pretty down to earth character (and pretty much rational), but the story is a heartwarming story about the love and friendship, even in this barren world, why can't we have more of that?
