True, but most of the time life is boring. So it wouldn't make a great story to make things too realistic.

To me it started to feel all the same, with no exploration of the world, hardly any improvement on powers or strategy, and very little going on except for disaster after disaster. Which lost some of the appeal of such a unique world, when it could have been about fist fighting or a war with guns.
