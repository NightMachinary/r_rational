She doesn't actually end up as a Ward. The author's endnote suggests that the original purpose of writing was to show that she very easily could have ended up a Ward. Then, after the first chapter, he turned it around to show that even if it looks like she was going to become a Ward things could change again. The underlying idea was to show that small events can have disproportionate effects on life outcomes, I guess.
