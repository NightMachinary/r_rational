Having read through the Calling Card portion, this seems like a retread of /Worm/ in pretty much every sense except she happens to be a Ward now. Maybe because I wasn't enthralled with /Worm/ to begin with, but that's not enough for me to want to keep reading. Is there something more that /Cenotaph/ brings to the table?
