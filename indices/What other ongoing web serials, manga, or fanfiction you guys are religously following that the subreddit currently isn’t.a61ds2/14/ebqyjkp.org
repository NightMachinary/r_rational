Check out the "monthly recommendation thread" posts. People post large and well explained lists there. The most recent one looks like it was an active one too.

Here's two other tips: To find longer/completed works look at older recommendation threads, since they will have had time to get long or wrap up by now. I also recommend checking out the fanfiction/fictionpress favorites of some of the great authors here, since they also tend to have good general tastes even outside their works. Like Alexanderwhales, EY, and Daystareld off the top of my head.
