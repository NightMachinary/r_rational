[[https://wanderinginn.com][The Wandering Inn.]]

It has some rational parts but for the most part is very irrational. The basic premise is a country performs a ritual to summon [Heroes]. A side effect of that ritual is that various humans arrive all over a world where people have classes and skills but no stats. The main character Erin is one such human who stumbles upon an abandonded inn and becones it's innkeeper. Adeventures ensues as she's forced to deal with adventurers, guards, friendly monsters and hordes of monsters. It's a stereotypical world where Humans, Drakes, Gnolls and the hive minded Antium are the principle races. There are also various mini stories that focus on other people dropped in to the world who generally have unique or rare classes like [Doctor], [Clown] or [Emperor].
