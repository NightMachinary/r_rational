Currently, the manga subreddit is going crazy over Solo Leveling. Nothing innovative, but the execution of the story and art is pretty good.

Outside of web stuff, I continue to religiously wait for the Cradle series by Will Wight. 5 books (out of potentially 12+) are out and the author has been releasing them about every 6 months.
