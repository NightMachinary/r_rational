- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]] is fantastic. Hilarious story about a selfish, man-eating, shape-shifting monster with completely different values from humans. A lot of good jokes, great narrative voice, and excellent prose, so it's really well-written. Also follows a lot of the writing conventions [[/r/rational]] is particular about: always in-character characters, no idiot ball, Magic A is magic A, etc.
- I'm usually reading whatever [[https://www.royalroad.com/profile/3091/fictions][Andur]] is writing at any given time too. He has a bunch of completed stories. Definitely not rational, but all very fun.
- I also follow Forty Millenniums of Cultivation. It is (used to be?) a bit more rational than any other eastern fantasy novels, but even if it's gotten more and more far-fetched and ridiculous lately, it's still enough fun to keep me reading.
