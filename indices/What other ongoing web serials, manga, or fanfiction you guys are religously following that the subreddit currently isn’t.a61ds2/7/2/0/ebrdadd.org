It does, the time on the 'spear world' (later revealed to be called Tellus) is a bit of a hard turn into that Genre, but Xianxia was always one of the major inspirations of the series, and I feel like it fits well with the system and it's methods, as all the system in LoRG is, is an interface that controls the progression of 'cultivators' under it's influence towards its own ends, it takes that turn because Randidly sees through that and tries to work past the system, which as I said, is actively Malicious.
