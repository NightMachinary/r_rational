definitely, the characters in Shanghai are pretty great, Richard sticks around and is his normal borderline psciopathic self and Gwen's Dad is a constant source of cringe and laughs as well, Gwen remains her rather naive and generally too well-read self and the new characters are entertaining in their own right, the series remains the kind of mindlessly fun romp it always was.
