Had to look that word up on urban dictionary. For anyone wondering: vore => voraphilia => people-eating (fetish)

The way I look at it, the "monster vs enlightened" terminal value gap is something that the [[/r/rational]] community should be able to appreciate. I like how the author never lets you forget that even though these things may have reached human level of intelligence and some are even able to adopt human appearances and act like humans flawlessly, they are absolutely NOT human in the only way that rationalists really care about: their mind and their values. I don't think it's really played for fetishistic delight, but that's just my opinion.

The only /repetitive/ vore is him summoning and eating his succubus familiar as a snack, but since her body is that of a demon, it's kinda like eating a ghost or a body made of ectoplasm rather than flesh. Sure, there's people-eating going on here and there, most of them innocent bystanders, but the /depictions/ of it aren't usually that gratuitously disgusting. It's always framed in such a way as to be normal (since in the monsters' value system, it /is/ normal). If you were to replace the words "human" or "elf" with "beef" or "cow", the descriptions would be totally PG outside of certain more exceptional cases.

That said, if it triggers you, it triggers you. But I'm not exactly a huge fan of splatter in general, yet I don't have a problem with ELLC, so I just wanted to post this as a counter-opinion for anyone considering whether to try it out or not. It's probably not good for the very squeamish, but it's not the kind of thing where you can't enjoy it without having deviant proclivities either.
