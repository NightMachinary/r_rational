I don't remember if I've plugged this before but anyways, I believe everyone here should read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ring-maker-worm-lord-of-the-rings-alt-power.517894/#post-34102846][Ring-Maker]]. It has the perfect Tolkien feel applied to Worm. Themes and character development are very strong features of this work and it is one of the best crossovers I've read.
