Lol. And yet for some reason I felt jerked around less by Worm. I think it's a question of expectations. Of course your favorite characters will die in Endbringer attacks, but why should experienced adventurers forget the possibility of traps when they've already fallen into one, not aim for the weak spot, not succeed in hitting the enemy with a door or capitalize on its weakness, and after all that, still fail at keeping it from destroying everything that you've spent five or six chapters ramping up to?

I seriously felt cheated.
