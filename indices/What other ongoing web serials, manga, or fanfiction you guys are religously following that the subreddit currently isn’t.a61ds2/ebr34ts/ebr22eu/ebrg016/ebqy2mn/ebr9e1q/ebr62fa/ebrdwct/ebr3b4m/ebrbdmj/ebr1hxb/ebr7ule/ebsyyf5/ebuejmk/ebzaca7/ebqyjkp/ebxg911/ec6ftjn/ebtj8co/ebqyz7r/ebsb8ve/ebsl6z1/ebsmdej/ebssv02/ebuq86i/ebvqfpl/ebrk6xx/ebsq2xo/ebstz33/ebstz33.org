From the [[http://curioustale.org/the_curious_tale/after_the_hero/prelude/about][about page]] of the entire series:

#+begin_quote
  Here told is the tale of the night the Hero fell, the night that Galavar and his Guard set in motion the fate of the world: the Prelude to After The Hero.

  After The Hero itself tells the tale of Galavar, the ambitious stranger from the desert, who sets out to fulfill his life's dream of ruling the world of Relance---not to plunder it, or set his people above the rest, but to lift up civilization into something finer. Can such a thing be done? Can such a dream be made real without becoming a nightmare?

The prelude, which is a complete ~280 story, starts with a setback. Galavar - ruling in a desert town where he and his followers are hiding away, building up resources for their ambitions - is attacked by a large army lead by a Hero from a neighbouring country. They survive; but damage is great, and their plans must compromise. This strains the relationships within Galavar's closest following - the Guards, and between them and the deity (Sourros, God of Logic and Wisdom) whose patronage they've been leveraging.

The Great Galavar, which is the incomplete serial story currently at ~40 episodes, is about Galavar's backstory. It starts at something like a college in the country of Ieik, where Galavar is educated and trained. During a local feast, it is said the patron god of Ieik - Sourros again - occasionally speaks to his people, but that has not happened in years.

During casual conversation with a friend, they discuss why that is; Galavar cheekily suggests that they ask the god directly.

The god answers.
