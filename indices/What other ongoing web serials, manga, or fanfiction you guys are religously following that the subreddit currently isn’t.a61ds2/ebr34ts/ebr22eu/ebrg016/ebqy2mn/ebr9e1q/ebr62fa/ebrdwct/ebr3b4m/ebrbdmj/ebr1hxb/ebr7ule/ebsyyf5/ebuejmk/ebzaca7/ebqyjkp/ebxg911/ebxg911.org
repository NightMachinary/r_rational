I love [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/103897/Dr_Stone][Dr. Stone]]. It's not strictly speaking rational probably but still plenty of fun - taking all the tropes of shounen manga and applying them to a genius science-savvy kid trying to rebuild civilisation in a post-apocalyptic scenario in which mankind has been knocked back to the Stone Age.

I also love [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/90125/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen][Kaguya-sama, or Love Is War]], which is absolutely not rational, but if you're looking for extremely funny and occasionally sweet romantic comedies, well, you couldn't really possibly do any better. Ballin'.
