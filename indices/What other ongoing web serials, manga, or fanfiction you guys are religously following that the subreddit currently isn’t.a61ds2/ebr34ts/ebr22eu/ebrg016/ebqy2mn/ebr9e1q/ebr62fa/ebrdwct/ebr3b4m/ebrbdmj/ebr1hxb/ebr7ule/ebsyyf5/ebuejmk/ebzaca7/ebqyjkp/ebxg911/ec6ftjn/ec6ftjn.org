Too many to list, but here's just a few:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]] One of my favorite webnovels, be warned however that it is /extremely/ NSFW.

Best to read it without spoilers, just try and make it through the first chapter and you should pretty much immediately be hooked. But here's a more detailed description, for you to read after finishing chapter one.

It's about a mimic who, mostly through sheer luck, becomes sentient. It is, however, still fundamentally a monster- as such it lives only to fulfill it's utility goals of "Acquire Shiny Things" and "Eat Tasty Things". Get's more interesting the longer you read it, though I can't really say how without spoiling it. Let's just say that he won't be satisfied staying in the starting dungeon forever...

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]]

The best quest-type story I've ever read, not counting Homestuck. This actually is brought up on this subreddit sometimes, but not often. A lot of readers are scared off by needing an account to access the site. Anyway, it's about a girl on the verge of suicide, who one day gains typical "The Gamer" style abilities, but the twist is that it's locked into the genre of "Erogame", meaning that everything sort of revolves around sex.

Man, I don't even like MLP. But with that said, this is still one of my favorite stories. It's basically a "Human in Equestria" story, but the human in actually a villain, and the longer they spend in this world, the more it resembles their shitty fannon. Discord, spirit of disharmony and chaos, decides he has to do something about it. The story itself is basically his journal, chronicling his attempts to fight this living Mary Sue.

The best Homestuck fan comic in existence. I know it seems kinda boring at first, and that it seems like you get the joke, but I /BEG/ you to at least read up to Rose's introduction before judging it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][Re:Trailer Trash]]

A story about a girl sent back in time, who resolves to live a better life than the one she had originally. MC is ridiculously competent, but in a good way, rather than a Mary Sue sort of way. Kind of inspired me to try and exercise more, actually...

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21368/the-dungeon-traveler][The Dungeon Traveler]]

Generic, but fun. It's your run of the mill "MC is a living dungeon" type of story. The gimmick is that the dungeon teleports to new locations all the time. Kinda underselling it here, but I can't think of anything else to say about it...

EDIT: AAAAAAH! I forgot!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]

I have no idea how to describe this! Or how to recommend it! All I can really say is, this is the most... /unique/ Harry Potter fanfic in existence.
