[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11209/the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound][The legend of Randidly Ghosthound]] is a series I follow rather religiously, I'm a $10 patron on the authors patreon mostly because his patreon reward is like 60+ chapters more reading, and discussion in his Discord. It's a very fun series that is a great example of the Litrpg Genre, with a very interesting take on the 'system' that is present in such series, mostly as it's system is both working towards its own goals and actively Malicious. The MC is rather fun, as he is the opposite of what most Litrpg MCs are, he is awkward, impatient, antisocial and just generally a loner, and stays that way, improving without changing these core aspects. It's a fun series, if you like it's genre.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles][Metaworld Chronicles]] another series that is just plain fun. It's a bit of a self insert fiction in which the Main character, previously a successful business woman in Sydney 2017, is drawn into the body of an alternate universe version of herself that exists in 2001, a the world has magic and monsters, ruled of by the mages that are the only hope of fighting back the existential threats to mankind. I like this series partial for its endearing character, it's initial Australian setting (an uncommon setting, and welcome for an Aussie), it's unquiet and entertaining implementation of D&D magic as its magic system, with great restrictions and interesting variations, and a rather well thought out and explained alternate history.

I wouldn't consider either of these to be rational /or/ rationalist at all, but I very much enjoy them, and they are the main series I wait for each week.
