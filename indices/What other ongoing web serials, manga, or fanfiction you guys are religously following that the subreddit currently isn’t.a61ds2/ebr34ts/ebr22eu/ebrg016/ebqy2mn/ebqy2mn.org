[[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][/The Order of the Stick/]] and [[https://goblinscomic.com/comic/06252005][/Goblins: Life Through Their Eyes/]] are the only regularly updated fiction I am following that don't get updates posted in this sub. Neither is particularly rationalist, although both make a point of deconstructing the Always Chaotic Evil trope as applied to goblins (in fact, /Goblins/ was one of the inspirations for [[http://web.archive.org/web/20090907010946/http://lesswrong.com/lw/169/the_sword_of_good/][/The Sword of Good/]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky).
