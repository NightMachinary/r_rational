Yeah, I think you're right--most of what happened really wasn't fair. But I guess we have to take [[https://imgur.com/a2juCK4][God's word]] on that subject.

The part that really kills me is knowing that since Pasqualo never double-died, Ally spent who knows how long in Hell not knowing where he was or what had happened to him, and probably eventually got incinerated by hellfire still not knowing. That and when I realized on rereading the comic that Aurora knew Pasq was going to sacrifice himself for her in the rebooted universe, and explicitly, desperately did not want him to do that, and died knowing she was helpless to prevent it.

On a more positive note, check out [[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlBppRLXgAAT4iq.jpg][the sketch I got in my copy of Book 6]]. Canon ending IMO. Freeze frame, roll credits.
