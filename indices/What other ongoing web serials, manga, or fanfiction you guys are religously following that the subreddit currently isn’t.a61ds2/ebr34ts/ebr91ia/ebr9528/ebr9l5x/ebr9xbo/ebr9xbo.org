Given that you like those, I'd suggest Unsounded, Lackadaisy, and Paranatural as the first to try. Paranatural has a similar emphasis on the complicated interpersonal dynamics of an ensemble cast, Lackadaisy has the "band of misfits" thing going on, and Unsounded has an OOTS-like feeling of a vast world and expanding story-scope as well as an SSSS-like feeling of mystery. But of course you should dive into any that sound cool!
