If you are a fan of The legend of Randidly Ghosthound, I am going to plug my own recently started LitRPG, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21353/esper-search-for-power][Esper: Search for Power]] as another story you may like. The protagonist is largely rational, or at least tries to be, and is placed in a fundamentally irrational set of circumstances. I thought that tension would be interesting to work with.
