Here's a few I follow:

- [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][OOTS]] has already been mentioned. In essence, it's the story of a party of adventurers trying to stop a powerful lich from obtaining world-threatening macguffins in a setting loosely based on D&D mechanics, but that barely scratches the surface. It starts out as a gag-a-day strip but quickly develops an engrossing plot and a richly characterized ensemble. It has a lot of well-executed "wham moments" and brilliantly handled character development throughout. You don't need to be familiar with D&D or tabletop games to follow the plot, although it helps with getting some of the jokes.

- [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html][Unsounded]] is possibly the overall highest-quality webcomic I've ever read and also deals with some themes relevant to this sub. The complexity of the worldbuilding is extremely impressive (especially if you follow the creators' Tumblr, where she answers questions about background details that don't make it onto the page), and there's a really cool, consistent, fleshed-out magic system that functions similarly to computer programming. The premise is hard to summarize, but basically it's about a dead-ish man whose soul is trapped in his decaying body for reasons he doesn't understand, tasked with escorting the young daughter of a crime boss to a distant city, and...it kind of seems like the story will ultimately be about uncovering and comprehending the very underpinnings of reality? Time will tell. (Also, highly reliable 3-updates-per-week schedule.)

- [[http://www.sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=1][Stand Still Stay Silent]] is a postapocalyptic story inspired by Finnish and Scandinavian folklore. It follows a band of misfits on an underfunded expedition to retrieve old-world books from the deadly Silent World, a region abandoned by humans after a global plague. It is not remotely rationalist, but has beautiful (or sometimes grotesque) art and rich characters. One of the main ensemble is autistic-coded, for those looking for representation (though the author has said he won't be officially diagnosed with anything in the comic). One "book" of this comic has been completed and the second one is in progress (4 updates a week). See also the creator's "practice comic," [[http://www.minnasundberg.fi/comic/page01.php][A Redtail's Dream,]] which is fantastic in its own right.

- [[https://www.lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=1][Lackadaisy]] is a Prohibition-era story of similar quality to Unsounded, but with a tragically much slower update schedule. It's about a speakeasy struggling to stay afloat admidst the dangerous schemes and shenanigans of the criminal underworld. Meticulously researched for historical accuracy, gorgeous sepia-toned art. Also the characters are all drawn like cats but I don't think they're actually canonically cats? You wouldn't think it would work, but it does.

- A lesser-known one is [[http://www.doomsdaymydear.com/comics/1735998/title/][Doomsday My Dear]], which is about an an alt-universe UK where a mysterious plague paves the way for the rise of a totalitarian state. Kinda slow to update, but I love the art style and the characters feel very human.

- [[http://gobolatula.com/ithurts/][IT HURTS!!]] is crude, bizarre, silly, sometimes offensive, and overall about as far as it gets from being rationalist. It's also one of the most sincere and relatable takes on depression and anxiety I've ever read, and did things to my emotions that I would never have anticipated, and it's somehow also consistently hilarious and the plot goes to some really fucking cool places. Give it a shot! (The characters use slurs in the beginning because they're shitty middle schoolers--if it bothers you a lot, start 60ish strips in, they decide to stop using them around that point. Also don't read the comments if you don't want spoilers.) This comic is complete, although there's a sequel comic which absolutely should not be read or even read /about/ before reading IT HURTS!! in its entirety.

- [[http://www.paranatural.net/comic/chapter-1][Paranatural]], currently on hiatus but returning Jan 1, is about a boy who moves to a new town and discovers that he can see spirits--and that his new school has a club for kids like him. The art and writing are really goddamn funny, and the character dynamics and conflicts are very well done and have caused me /a lot of feelings./

- [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/][Strong Female Protagonist]], currently on hiatus, is pretty close to rational compared to most of the others on this list. It's set in a world where a generation of kids developed superpowers a few years ago, and it follows a young Superman expy as she tries to, A., figure out how to do good effectively on a global scale when all she really excels at is punching things, and B., figure out what "good" actually /is/. Lots of lengthy ethical debates, occasional creative superpower use, exploration of the social-justice implications of superpowers.

- [[https://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/kill-six-billion-demons-chapter-1/][Kill Six Billion Demons]] is about an ordinary woman from Earth who is transported to a strange, alien place with a mysterious artifact embedded in her forehead. Before long she's making friends with angels and picking fights with some of the most powerful entities around. Cool art, very cool worldbuilding, lots of action. Sometimes the authors' notes contain excerpts from in-universe texts concerning history, folklore, religion, etc.

- In the world of comics that actually cost money, I've been following [[https://www.comixology.com/The-Unbeatable-Squirrel-Girl-2015/comics-series/33143][The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl,]] which is written by Ryan North of Dinosaur Comics. It's lighthearted and very funny, with a focus on finding diplomatic solutions to conflicts that satisfy everyone (and failing that, creative out-of-the-box solutions that use available resources in unexpected ways). Also lots of of philosophy and computer science jokes, and there's a graphic novel that's a fun take on the "utilitarian character tries to take over the world to impose a benevolent dictatorship" trope I see occasionally in rationalist fic.
