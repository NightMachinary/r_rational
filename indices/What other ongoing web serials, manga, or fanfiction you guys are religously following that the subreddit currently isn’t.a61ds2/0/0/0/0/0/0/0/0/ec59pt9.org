That is good timing! It was really sweet, and a wonderful piece to end on.

One niggling thought that bothers me a little about the story is the "It's not fair" vibes. I really thought that would turn into the main story arc / moral somehow. I'm not trying to criticize the story though, because I think it says more about me than the author. It just... What happened /doesn't/ seem fair! :((( sniff sniff
