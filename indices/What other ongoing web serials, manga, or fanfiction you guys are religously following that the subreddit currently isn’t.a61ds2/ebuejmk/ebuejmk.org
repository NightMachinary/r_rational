No mention of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJenkinsverse][Deathworlders]] yet?

Hard Sci-Fi story set in the near future in a universe where humans are about the strongest of the intelligent species, but helplessly behind in technology. Focusses primarily on a core set of characters, but dabbles in basically all genres: Horror, sci-fi opera, romance, detective stories, military fiction...

Accompanying the main work (~1 million words) are various fan creations, some of which have attained canon status, and saw characters incorporated into the main story. That's why I linked the story on TVTropes, where a rough reading list can be found.
