I'm reading [[https://www.lezhin.com/en/comic/appetite][Appetite]], because I am complete garbage for weird romances and Appetite is a slow-burn love story between a cannibal monster and a suicidal teen who has agreed to be eaten once he's a little older and will be a more magically potent meal, so that his death will mean something. As somebody who once agreed to give bone marrow 90% because it was the right thing to do and 10% out of the faint hope that something might go wrong and I'd die in a way that seemed less wasteful than outright suicide, it's really easy to identify with the latter character's headspace.

It...kind of changes tracks later on and isn't entirely what I was hoping it would be, but it doesn't take much of a time investment from me so I'm willing to keep reading in order to see how it all ends.

If you have access to normal comics, either at a local shop or online or through a scan site, then you may also like *Dwarves*. Each issue is 60-70 pages long and follows the life (or part of the life) of, uh, a dwarf. The issues stand on their own feet but where the series /really/ shines is in the way that it becomes a multigenerational epic. Several protagonists have been the children of protagonists from previous issues, and other protagonists have reappeared in supporting roles. There are two other series in the same setting, /Orcs & Goblins/ and /Elves/, but I found the writing and stories to be far worse and no longer follow them.

You may also enjoy *Uber* and *Uber: Invasion*, a WWII/superpowers comic. In the early months of WWII, it turns out that Germany was working on a way to give people (very specific) superpowers. This is sufficient to turn the tide of the war /temporarily/, but they had a mole who was able to get some of the relevant information out to the Allies, who begin producing their own supersoldiers, and the fact remains that Germany is still on its last economic leg, which is posing its own problems. The comic makes no effort to shy away from the more gruesome aspects of war (as the writer, Kieron Gillen, mentions in one of his afterwords, war is a horror story and war /with superpowers/ would be even more so). Murphy's Law is in full effect and plans go right just about as often as you'd expect them to. Finally, the narration appears to be sourced from a history book (or several) from some time after the war, though we aren't given the title (or titles).

My last recommendation is *The Black Monday Murders*, a noir/horror series by Jonathan Hickman. In the Mormon temple ceremony, Satan is explicitly linked to capitalism, and money is the means by which Satan "rules with blood and horror." Jonathan Hickman is not a Mormon and Mammon is more an ancient god than a Christian demon, but the underlying theme remains: black magic requires human sacrifice, and capitalism with all its excesses is the means by which this is carried out in the modern day, with the occasional detour into sacrifices of the more conventional kind (early in the first issue, we find out that the bankers and brokers who supposedly committed jumped out of windows during the Wall Street Crash of 1929 did not commit suicide, but were thrown out to keep the magical consequences of the crash from hitting the people at the very top).

It is the only time that you will see someone pay a dreadful price to ask questions of a god, and ask something as banal as "What causes a market crash?"
