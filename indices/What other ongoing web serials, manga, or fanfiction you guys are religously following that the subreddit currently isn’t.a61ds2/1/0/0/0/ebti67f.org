It's not /that much/ bigger, but they're all (or mostly) focused on that one story. The biggest serials posted here don't have the focus of the entire subreddit, only a fraction of it, and I know in some cases there are serials where readers only use this subreddit for that one specific story, and ignore everything else that ever gets posted here.

So [[/r/parahumans]] is more active, true, but it's /also/ more focused.
