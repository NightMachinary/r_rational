If you mainly liked Worm because Taylor was able to lverage her brilliant tactical mind and creatively use her (and other people's) power to solve absolutely hopeless situations, liking Ward isn't a given.

The protagonist is a lot different in her mindset, her approach to PR, and in her combat style. Much more introspective, too.

I love it, but Vicky isn't Taylor, and that drives people away.
