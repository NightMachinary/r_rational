I had an interesting conversation with Wildbow about that once. He made a sort of self-challenge out of deliberately writing himself into corners so he would be forced to find clever solutions to getting out of them. It's the sort of thing that takes guts - I'm not sure I'd be brave enough to do it in a web serial where I can't change what's been posted if I can't figure out a good solution - but it paid off really well for him.
