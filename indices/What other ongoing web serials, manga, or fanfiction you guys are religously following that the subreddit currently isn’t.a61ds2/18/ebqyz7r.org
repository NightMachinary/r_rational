Digimon World infamy which is on it's third thread right here [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/digimon-world-infamy-3-the-heir-of-alphamon.707374/]]

and is at something like a million and a half words over the three threads it's been on. Quest that i would say is about as rational as you're gonna find being made up of the continuity snarl that is the digimon canon. Very much an action-y battles type thing, might not be your thing.

​

Destiny of Strife a bleach quest that updates a couple times a week and is a quest on sufficient velocity here [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-destiny-of-strife-a-hollows-quest-bleach.29076/]]

again another action-y battles type thing with a decent if irregular focus on character interactions.

​

The tales of Paul Twister has that kind of dropped into a fantasy world and tries to uplift it kind of thing it updates sporadically at best but has a very well thought out world building type thing. does the action and is kind of adjacent to the whole worth a candle fic that usually reviews well here.

​

the xy adventures comics i check everyday uhh warning kinda extremely homoerotic and fanservice-y which if not to your taste should be avoided, but is a very slice of life cutsie kind of thing [[https://blackadventurescomic.com/]]

​

Life ore death a mistborn/young justice crossover that has a feruchemistw/atium misting spike that I just love for the way that the Main character is very orange/blue with the more traditionally morals-ed cast. Also mistborn crossover so like given the constraints and the /rules/ of a Brandon Sanderson work which I love. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/life-ore-death-dc-feruchemy-young-justice.35443/reader]]

also that's on spacebattles too but the reader mode for sufficient velocity has more entries per page so that's why i linked it from there.

​

Olivine Romance on Ao3 uhhh this one is a little more explicit in the sexual sense so uhh heads up if that's not your cup of tea. but it's a pokemon fanfic based on Jasmine the steel gym leader from johto it rather recently started into it's second book so minus it being a huge mass of writing now is a great time to start reading it lol.

​

soo uh none of that is particularly what i would consider rational fic but i do check them religiously.
