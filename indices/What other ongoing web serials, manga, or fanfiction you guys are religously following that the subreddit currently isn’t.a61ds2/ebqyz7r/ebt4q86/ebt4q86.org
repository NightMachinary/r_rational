is the digimon story as lighthearted as the life ore death story? I started reading that one and was enjoying it a bunch but gave up on it when it became apparent how obsessed the entire YoungJustice seemed to be with never taking life of people trying to kill you and dropped it shortly after the mind control arc; it seemed absurd to me the way they reacted to the MC killing soliders who were shooting at them and would of killed them if she hadnt saved them; similar to why I dropped dungeon keeper ami after the whole fairy arc
