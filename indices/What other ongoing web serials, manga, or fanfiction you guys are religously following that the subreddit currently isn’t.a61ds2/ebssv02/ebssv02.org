I am reading [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/][Now You Feel Like Number None]] and I love it.

It's a very well-written, story-driven Bleach quest about an arrancar in Aizen's army. Updates tend to be long and frequent.

(Bleach's worldbuilding for those unfamiliar: The standard-destination afterlife is a dimension called "soul society". It is a conservative feudal-japan oligarchy with vast slums. The ruling class is sequestered into a walled district with its own army of ghost samurai wizards - "shinigamis". Individual shinigami vary vastly in strength. The strongest few are granted the title of "captain" and their individual physical power actually constitutes the real power of all of soul society. Three of these captains have defected with plans to supplant the withdrawn "soul king", who is isolated in another inaccessible dimension.

To achieve this, they have subjugated a third dimension, "Hueco Mundo", populated by strange, twisted ghosts - "hollows". Hollows are driven by a constant hunger to consume other souls. The invading captains have removed this hunger from the hollows they conquered by spiritual surgery and turned them into something more human and more usable as soldiers in the process - "arrancars". The quest follows one such arrancar as she tries to get by in a society created for the sole purpose of fighting a single war.)
