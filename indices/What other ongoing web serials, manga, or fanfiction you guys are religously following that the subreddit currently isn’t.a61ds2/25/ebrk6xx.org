I keep an eye on The Curious Tale ([[http://curioustale.org/the_curious_tale/after_the_hero/prelude/prelude_introduction][prelude]], [[http://curioustale.org/the_curious_tale/the_great_galavar/archive/001-Prologue][serial]]), but alas the author has been struggling financially, and so there haven't been updates in a while (.. since 2015 :P).

Still, I think the story is something people in the subreddit may appreciate.
