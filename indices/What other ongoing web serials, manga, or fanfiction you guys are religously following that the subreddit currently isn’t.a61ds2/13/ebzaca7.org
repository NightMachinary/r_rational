Check out [[https://www.schlockmercenary.com/][Schlock Mercenary]] - the author Howard Tayler could not find an artist to illustrate his stories so he picked up drawing from scratch initially, so the art is atrocious in the early books but progressed nicely all along since. It's extremely well written, in that protagonists and antagonists all have believably reasonable lines of thinking and credible motivations, the shattering effects of disruptive technology are very much explored and not downplayed (lifespan extension, teleportation, uplifting, mass-duplication, AI singularity, etc. are mainstays of the worldbuilding).

It has racked up several Hugo nominations, and is also notable for never once having missed its daily update in its 18 years of publishing, not even when [[https://tech.slashdot.org/story/08/06/01/1715247/explosion-at-theplanet-datacenter-drops-9000-servers][the datacenter hosting it exploded]], caught fire and was subsequently flooded.
