[[https://mangadex.org/manga/20723/witch-hat-atelier][Witch Hat Atelier]] (mild self promotion disclaimer): a seemingly-lighthearted classic high fantasy story with gorgeous western-inspired art. None of the characters are strictly rational, but their goals and motivations are presented in a strongly realistic and compelling light, especially the antagonists'. Not a lot written right now, but what's there is extremely captivating.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/#post-9354450][The Last Angel]]: a more or less rational-adjacent original sci-fi story that has an enjoyable and believable take on A.I. and how governmental bodies deal with them, among many other plot threads of political intrigue, war games, and character drama. Complete with an ongoing sequel.

Lastly, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/man-off-the-moon-fate-extra-x-mass-effect.641011/][Man Off the Moon]]: an ongoing Mass Effect+Fate Stay/Night crossover. I've always been a sucker for the fic premise of "Shirou Emiya wanders into someone else's plot and promptly derails it", and this scratches that itch quite nicely. Rewards a deep knowledge of both series' lore, but still introduces everything well enough you can go in blind.
