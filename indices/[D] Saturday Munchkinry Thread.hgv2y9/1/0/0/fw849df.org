Broadly speaking, you do indeed regenerate with higher capacity. For example losing a lung will make the current lung much tougher to lose, and as it struggles to oxygenate the whole body it will adapt to become massively more efficient and powerful.

As a rule of thumb though, the more traumatic the injury the more wild the adaptations can be. The loss of both lungs may turn the body into a tree like lifeform where the body doesn't need lungs to oxygenate. It could just as easily transform into a lifeform that doesn't require oxygen.

The problem with the laser/radiation thing is that all adaptations are permanent and cumulative. You would adapt to the radiation, then the dead man's switch. The power adapts to any harm, which includes damage done by other adaptations. I imagine that the threat of turning into an invincible "rock" would be enough to stop any abuse of adaptation feedback loops. Your best bet would be to use a series of progressively more powerful lasers to damage the neurons, and once you're immune to lasers of very high power try other methods (like cutting, vibration, blunt force, etc.)
