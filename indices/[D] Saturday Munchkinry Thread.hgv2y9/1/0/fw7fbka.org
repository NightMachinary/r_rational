Let's start with the assumption that you can do far more with an excellent mind than with an excellent body.

First, I wonder how far "adaptive" goes. If you are damaged in a way that reduces your capacity, do you regenerate with more of that capacity? For example, if you lose a lung, does your lung grow back with more capacity to protect against the possibility of future loss of the other lung, or just harder to lose? If the former, and "capacity" is broadly enough defined, targeted brain injury could increase your capacity to think in ways the targeted regions supported.

However, this requires a few things to go right at once, and we may imagine our power may not be so accommodating. So second, we look into other ways to protect our brain from damage by first damaging it, even if it doesn't directly translate into an abstract notion of capacity. Oxygen deprivation comes to mind; I imagine some potential adaptations to that could result on greater capacity of some kind. If there are drugs which have permanent negative neurological consequences, those might also be good candidates, especially if they can be injected such that the brain is the /first/ line of defense (so that the adaptation doesn't happen in other systems, such as the liver). If drugs work, you could avoid finding an undesirable local maximum by varying types of drugs; some days you overdose on stimulants and other days on depressants, some days hallucinogens and other days anti-psychotics.

However, these might provide incremental progress, but not life-changing progress. What you really want is not entirely unlike a neural network, in which a bad decision has consequences directly down the line of neurons most responsible for it. We probably can't get that granular, but with a PET scanner and a series of lasers, it might be possible to target /areas/ engaged in certain sorts of activity if they lead to undesired decisions.

This also depends heavily on the power's understanding of "adaptive". In order to avoid adapting to the lasers, you might have to pair it with some system that a) requires radiation to operate and b) causes harm by ceasing to operate; sort of a dead man's switch that goes off if, say, you adapt radiation-resistant skin. I don't know if an adaptation would be reverted if it caused harm like that, but if the system were operating continuously, it seems plausible.
