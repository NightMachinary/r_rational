Perfect precision you say?

Could you write out the times table for all pairs of 10 digit numbers, and thus gain the ability to instantly multiply any pair of 10 digit numbers by remembering what you wrote for that specific pair?

Could you take it one step further and essentially memorize anything you can write down?

Could you learn to draw pictures, so as to capture visual images in terms of your movements needed to draw the image?
