Imagine a tiny fraction of the population has the power to know when someone is deliberately lying to them. 0.1% at most. These people find their way into the professions you'd think - journalists, judges, lawyers, business of every kind. A lot of them are just consultants selling their services to whoever needs a lie detector at the moment.

You don't have that power. However, you seem to be the first person (whom you know of) who can lie without triggering their lie detectors. How would you use your 'immunity'? If you are caught in a lie news will certainly spread that people with immunity exist.
