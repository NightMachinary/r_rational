Well, you still have millions of schizophrenics, who genuinely do see and hear things nobody else can. They are wrong, of course, it's their brain being broken, but some of them are still going to be charismatic, persuasive, and sincerely convinced that the voices belong to powerful supernatural forces. A generation or two down the line though it's going to be hard to find any priests, but I would definitely expect at least flairups of religion here and there.
