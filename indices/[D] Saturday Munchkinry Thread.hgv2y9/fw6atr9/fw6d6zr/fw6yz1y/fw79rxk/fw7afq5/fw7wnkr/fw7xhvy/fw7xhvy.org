(1) Lack of spiritual experiences = "God is testing you, isn't that cool? Just have faith and keep going and you'll be rewarded for it." Sometimes called "the long dark night of the soul" when writers want to get poetic about it.

(2) Back in Hoseph Smith's day, you might get drunk or eat some totally-not-psychotropic substances and literally see God the Father and Jesus Christ walk into the room, or just knock your brain into an altered state with meditation, proper framing, etc. and see the same thing. Wasn't /common/, but it wasn't unheard of, either.

Nowadays, though, spiritual experience = "nice feeling in your heart" and even major church authorities (Mormonism's equivalent to Catholicism's cardinals) have said in recent decades that they've never experienced a miracle.
