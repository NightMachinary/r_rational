It depends how this power interacts with insanity, self deception, and sincere false belief. If it normally read insanity and self deception as lies, then this strategy works. If however, the insane and deluded can already work around the lie detecting power, you aren't really unique other than being less insane than people that have already pulled your con before.

From the original post "deliberately lying to them" means that people that are genuinely deluded probably already beat the lie detecting power, so society probably already has a way of ignoring religious nutcases.
