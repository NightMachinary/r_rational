Hmmm... so you have to lie about things that can't be delusions or mistakes?

Establish a mining company, buy up lots of land, then claim to have found an utterly massive amount of precious metals at one of the sites.

Lie detectors believe you are telling the truth, because the odds of you being delusional or mistaken are way too low. So your company stocks skyrocket, and you reap massive profits.

People will later discover you were lying, but by then you have run away with large sums of money.
