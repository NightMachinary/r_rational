  You don't have that power. However, you seem to be the first person (whom you know of) who can lie without triggering their lie detectors. How would you use your 'immunity'?

First, be caught out being able to lie, in a public way that cannot be denied. It's possible (and even probable) that there are other liars out there who have some stake in suppressing the idea that lying is possible.

Once the cat's safely out of the bag, volunteer for scientific study and lobby for political reform.

The political system of the world that you describe wouldn't have any defense against corruption, beyond asking politicians whether or not they're corrupt. If there are liars, the system needs to be reformed before people can worm themselves into positions where they can lie, and be believed, and cause damage by doing so, because this will obviously happen sooner or later. If this has already happened, which you have to assume, the urgency is even greater.
