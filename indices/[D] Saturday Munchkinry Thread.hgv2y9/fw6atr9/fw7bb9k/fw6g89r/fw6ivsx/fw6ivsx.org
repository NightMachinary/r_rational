I (and many fanfics I have read) had assumed from the usage of portkeys and other artifacts that apparition has some hard limits. Apparition is apparently uncomfortable even over short distances.

I'm hesitatant to directly quote JK Rowling, given some of the other gems she has dropped on her twitter, but she states: [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/799666899021766658]]

  There's a limit to how far you can Apparate. Inter-continental Apparition is very dangerous!

This means it is possible but dangerous. The Harry Potter wiki notes that Voldemort had to first fly by broomstick over the sea before appariting to Malfoy manor, thus even for a powerful wizard with a clear motivation to, apparition over long distances isn't worth it.

Even if you could manipulate your reference frame in a way that transferred speed, I would assume it would be limited by the range of the apparition, thus the Earth's rotation around the sun, much less the Andromeda galaxy, would not be usable frames of reference.
