The equator spins at about 450 meters per second (1,000ish mph)

Which means Apparition from the north pole to the equator give you a magical speed boost to one side. I feel like there is a ton of possibility there. And that's before we start looking at orbital speeds of the earth around the sun... And the sun around Sagittarius A...
