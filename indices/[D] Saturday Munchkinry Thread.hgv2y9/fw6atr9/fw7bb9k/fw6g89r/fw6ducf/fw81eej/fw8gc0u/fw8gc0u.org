  The power supply must be appropriate to the system; electricity or fuel or horses or *slave laborers* are sufficient.

Err... so you have mass mind control powers then? As in, as long as you can trick someone into being part of your transit system, you can control their every action?

For example, you can trick someone into carrying you by pretending to be injured. You could get inside a burning building, then the firemen would carry you out. Once you are carried, do you now gain control over the "firemen" transit system? Control firemen all over the city because they are in a sense, an interconnected transit system?
