This is a good question. I think what separates firefighters from a slave-powered transit system is that the primary purpose of firefighters as an organization is not general transportation of passengers.

Ambulance services, though, are part of a network dedicated to transportation.

There must be a vehicle for your power to control; the vehicle's motive system is controlled by your power but not the driver or other staff of the system. You would have mind control of the horses and the slaves as they pull your chariot, but not their driver, and not the horses or slaves when they no longer pull the chariot.
