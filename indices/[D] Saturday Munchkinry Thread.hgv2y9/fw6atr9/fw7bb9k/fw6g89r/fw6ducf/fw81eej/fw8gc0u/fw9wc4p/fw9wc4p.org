So, I hear there's this guy employed by the train station. Every morning, he rides the train in to work. When he gets there, he writes out and presents a report on the train system. Pointing out every last little thing that's wrong, or needs fixing, in the entire network. No-one knows how he finds his info; the train company just pays attention to his reports.

There's a guy employed by the bus company on a similar basis, but he only works afternoons. Some sort of special arrangement.

.../surely/ they're not the same guy. Surely?
