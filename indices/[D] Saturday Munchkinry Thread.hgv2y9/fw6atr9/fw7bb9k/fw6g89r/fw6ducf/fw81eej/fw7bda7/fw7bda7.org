This may have been done before in some form, if so I apologize.

Someone with an eidetic memory is able to recall an image with extremely precise, accurate detail after seeing it once. The term is also used to refer to being able to remember other sensory details.

How would you munchkin having an eidetic kinesthetic memory?

The ability to memorize and recall physical movements with perfect precision and accuracy for the rest of your life after only performing them once. There are no cognitive trade-offs for this power. There are also no limits to how many of these memories you can store. They'll all be consolidated into your muscle memory ready to be recalled as you choose. Note that they'd have to be attached to a stimulus to become unconscious reflexes.
