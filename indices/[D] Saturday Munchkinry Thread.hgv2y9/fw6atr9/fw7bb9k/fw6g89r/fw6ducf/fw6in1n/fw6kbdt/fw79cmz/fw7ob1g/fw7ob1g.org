[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies][Newton]] thought the Temple of Solomon had various mystical properties in it architecture including golden sections, conic sections, spirals, orthographic projection. More generally [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_geometry][sacred geometry]] varies across culture but typically includes various symmetries, geometric proportions, and geometric shapes in art and architecture.

The more significant proportions, symmetries, and shapes worked into the architecture the more mystical power it can channel and the faster it can channel it. Some features might conflict, while others synergize together such that it would be an entire field of engineering architecture to optimize it.

Thus, a standard hospital would require at least some renovations. It would probably be more efficient to construct an entirely new building.
