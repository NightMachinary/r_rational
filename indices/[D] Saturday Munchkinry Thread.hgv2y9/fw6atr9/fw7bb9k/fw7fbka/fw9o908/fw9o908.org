I haven't read Worm, but I think this would have to be extensively tested to see how it works and get a better understanding of the underlying mechanism and how to predict the changes that might result based on that. For some example tests (which hopefully will be done with anesthesia):

- Do severed body parts or does spilled blood regenerate at all or display any anomalous effects? If not, you might be an amazing blood and organ donor. However, if there /are/ anomalous effects, then, could your donated blood or organs regenerate a person who receives them? There are likely many terminally-ill patients who would be happy to volunteer for a clinical trial with this. Even if it's not medically useful, you could still provide a consensual [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa][HeLa]] substitute which might even have industrial applications if it can be cultured into useful products.

- What happens if you receive an organ or tissue transplant? Does the transplanted tissue gain the regeneration ability as well? If so, does it retain that regeneration if it's later removed again? Could you do organ rehabilitation on behalf of other people?

- How far does this regeneration apply? Will it affect hair or nails when you cut them? What about the upper layer of dead skin cells? If there's no regeneration of these, then any hard non-cellular growths that you don't want could probably be safely removed without triggering the regeneration.

- What happens if someone amputates the tip of your pinky finger, leaving just a short flap of skin at the bottom, and then sutures the flap over the end of the nub and puts a cast or brace over the tip to block regrowth for a few days or weeks? Will the fingertip still regenerate after it has already 'healed'? In a similar vein, what happens if you pierce an earlobe and then put a silver wire through it to block the hole from closing up? In other words, is there any way to prevent unwanted regeneration of living tissue?

- Do you actually get stronger if you get injured in a variety of ways? For example, what would be the comparative difference if you had one pinky finger cut off, burned, frozen, crushed in a hydraulic press, dissolved in acid, tourniqueted to death, poisoned with black widow venom, irradiated, and finally belt-sanded off, versus another pinky finger which is just cut off nine times?
