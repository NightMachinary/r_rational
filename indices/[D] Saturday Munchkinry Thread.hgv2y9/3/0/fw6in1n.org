I mean obviously every hospital would immediately become a highly sanctified space and work lot better without any real changes; they already have all sorts of purity rituals going on all the time, with every person ritualistically cleansing themselves between jobs and every room and every tool going through a purification ritual multiple times a day. The fact that these rituals work even if there isn't any magic doesn't make them stop being rituals.

The real change you'd get, IMO, is synthetic corporate religions.

Like, every McDonalds would become a ritually sanctified space oriented around producing the best-tasting food possible out of the ingredients, while using the cheapest and fastest purification rituals (probably only what's legally required of them by law).

Then there'd be the markets and subsidiary activities around religions. You'd have corporate religious consultants, who'll sell you a training and materials contract for the Church of the Machine God (guaranteed to improve factory productivity by 20% with at least 90% employee buy-in), you'd have religious engineering as a field of study in order to figure out how to purify on the cheap, you'd have basic research into religion in order to figure out theoretical questions (is space pure? if we launch a space station, can it be an eternally sanctified and pure temple? if it can be an eternally sanctified temple, can it generate oxygen indefinitely via some sort of Maxwell's Demon-style probabilistic CO2 cracking?)
