Sacred geometry, ritual purification, various ritual maintenance, and usage of materials with symbolic importance together can imbue large structures with a mystical/magical power that can be used to work various "miracles". These temples can be made as small and temporary as a tent (primarily used for recharging minor artifacts), but large structures tend to work faster and allow more potent effects.

For ritual purity think of the regulations observed by ancient Israelites or of Shinto ritual purity or of modern clean room standards. In general, it seems different ritual purity standards can work, although any given temple needs a particular standard of purity, i.e. one temple that uses a procedure based off a clean room will get messed up if someone ignores the clean room procedures while obeying Golden Dawn ritual purity standard.

Among the miracles:

Empowerment of artifacts. Objects treated with rituals taking hours to days can be empowered with various effects. More powerful object must be recharged at temples.

- "Probabilistic" effects most easy to empower and require minimal (recharging possible outside temples) to no recharging. I.e. someone with a cancer that has a 20% chance to go in remission has their cancer go into remission. This couldn't heal someone with below a 5% chance. If used to light a fire, would only be able to help mundane methods, for instance a spark from flint catches just right. Think of placebomancy from Unsong.

- Subtle, minimalistic interventions can go for several rechargings and/or be recharged in the field. I.e. Can heal cancer with only a 5% chance to go into remission. If used to light a fire could spontaneously heat and ignite a sufficiently flammable material.

- Direct intervention for more powerful effects require recharging, often after every use. This refers to everything that adds in an easily measurable amount of mass/energy to the world. I.e. directly destroying a tumor or generating a fireball out of nothing.

- Direct Subversion of metaphysical or physical rules might require artifact to be used within specialized temple and specialized ritual. I.e. bringing back someone that recently (past 3 days) died of cancer. Altering an object to burn without being consumed or damaged.

Other effects:

- Actualizing miracles within the temple without first empowering an artifact is slightly faster but slightly harder.

As to relationship to various religions and belief systems:

- Imitation of miracles and myths from various religious text makes miraculous effects easier to achieve. This counts for both end result, aesthetics, and method of actualization. Meeting all 3 of these makes things about one step easier, i.e. subtle to probabilistic or direct subversion to direct intervention. I.e. if you wanted to make it easier to bring someone back from the dead fully healed, you might crucify, them stab them in the side with a spear, bury them, wait 3 days, and then they would be resurrected but bearing scars.

- For words/prayers spoken, the actual higher power named seems fairly interchangeable, even for a given temple. I.e. a Wiccan that observes the ritual purity sufficiently well could use an otherwise "Shinto" temple to call for the intervention of the Triple Goddess efficaciously. Even atheists can do things like call on the shared collective unconscious of humanity. It has to be something they at least partially believe in, but other than that "faith" isn't really required.

Some hard limits:

- For resurrecting the dead: Slightly longer than 3 days without preparation before hand, 9 days if prepared before dying, much longer if they avoid truly "dying".

- In general, can't extend life indefinitely. Maintaining ritual purity might push the amount they can extend their life, but requires increasingly stringent purity standards for extending longer.

Some common examples:

- Water to wine to blood. Easy enough to perform in tents or minimally optimized temples.

- Granting super strength to someone that follows a particularly strict standard of ritual purity (i.e. Samson effect)

- Making object that perform their default function better: I.e. a knife that stays sharper and cuts better, a flashlight that always seems to catch what you are looking for in it's light, etc.

- Emergency equipment: Artifacts might expend their charge on a single use, but for a single use emergency equipment this might be okay.

A few prompts about munchkining:

- Miracles to imitate that are most exploitable?

- Most economically viable mundane applications?

- Most valuable impossible to otherwise achieve applications?

- Application most valuable to you personally?

- How would this play out in various historical settings?

How would this play out in the modern world if it was discovered/demonstrated in recent times?
