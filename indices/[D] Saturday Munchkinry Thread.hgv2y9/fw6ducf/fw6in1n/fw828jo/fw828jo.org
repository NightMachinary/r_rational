I wonder if the miracles are recursive? Can you make an artifact that can use up its own charge to power another artifacts'? You could then just make miracle batteries and have them dropped off at any place needing to use miracles. If so, could you enchant water or electricity as though they were artifacts with this property? Then you could just pipe the miracle juice to wherever you need to fuel miracles. Or could you even have these artifacts charge other artifacts remotely, wirelessly?

Also, what happens when you pit one artifact against another? Suppose the police have an artifact flashlight that's awfully good at finding criminals trying to hide, but suppose the criminal has an equally charged hooded cloak that makes them less likely to get noticed? Does whoever have the more powerful enchantment win?

Can machines or programs perform rituals? Can machines aid rituals? Does it depend on sentience, or being alive? Could a trained dog, or engineered yeast, perform a ritual?
