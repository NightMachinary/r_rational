  Sacred geometry

Can tiny two-dimensional structures count as sacred geometry instances? If so, then use photolithography to make massive numbers of them, increasing power.

Can it spontaneously cool? If so, it would be a HUGE help to cryogenics, since that last fraction of a Kelvin is extremely difficult to remove.

Ocean fertilization, agricultural fertilization, cheap feed if you can find an animal that can survive off of those fluids alone.

Can you make a processor whose stochastic algorithms always seem to find correct solutions more quickly than expected?

Also, can robots perform miracle rituals? You mention that the miracle worker needs to believe in and invoke something---can e.g. convolutional neural networks trained on ImageNet believe in and somehow invoke dogs?
