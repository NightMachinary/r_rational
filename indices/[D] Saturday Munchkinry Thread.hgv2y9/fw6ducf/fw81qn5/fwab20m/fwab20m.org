  Can tiny two-dimensional structures count as sacred geometry instances? If so, then use photolithography to make massive numbers of them, increasing power.
#+end_quote

Yes, that should work. Quantity of sacred geometry would hit diminishing returns at some point... but at the very least it should be possible to fit the equivalent amount of a sacred geometry of massive temple into a shack.

  Can it spontaneously cool? If so, it would be a HUGE help to cryogenics, since that last fraction of a Kelvin is extremely difficult to remove.
#+end_quote

Yes. This is exactly what I was trying to think, stuff that is extremely tedious/difficult to do with technology that a slight bit of miraculous intervention can expedite.

  Can you make a processor whose stochastic algorithms always seem to find correct solutions more quickly than expected?
#+end_quote

If you have a sufficiently random source of randomness, and the randomness is appropriately used in the algorithm, that should work. It's probabilistic, so it falls under the doesn't need recharging level of mystical power usage. It might not be exactly consistent in how much faster it is... if the algorithm has a 20% chance of finishing with x time and a 5% chance of finishing in y time (without intervention), then the actual time will vary between x and y.

  Also, can robots perform miracle rituals? You mention that the miracle worker needs to believe in and invoke something---can e.g. convolutional neural networks trained on ImageNet believe in and somehow invoke dogs?
#+end_quote

Theoretically possible, but tedious to implement. The convolutional neural network would need a "body" sufficient to carry out rituals including miscellaneous gestures, movements of objects, some spoken phrases. For every action that is part of the ritual, the network would need to be trained sufficiently to have a "belief" in it. So it wouldn't just need to "believe" in dogs it would also need to have an internal symbolic reasoning which relates those beliefs in words/gestures/ceremonies. And it would all need to be a single coherent thing, not a bunch of independently trained networks.
