Exploited with portals in [[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/][Saga of Soul]].

  It happened far too quickly for Downfall to realize what was going on (or defend against it). One moment, a portal was opening, aimed at him from a distance of about twenty meters. The next moment, devastation.

  /Really, it only makes sense. The two ends of a portal are always stationary in relation to each other. But if you pick two geographic locations in the world? They're anything/ */but/* /stationary!/

  The news choppers filmed as the blast erupted from the portal before Soul, hitting Downfall all but instantaneously - like a column of solid devastation reaching to the ground, causing it to explode in a spectacular splash of water and gravel.

  /Because you see... The Earth is revolving eastward, and it's/ */round/* /. So at any moment, you and the patch of Earth you're standing on are going in one direction... while the patch of Earth on your antipodes is going in the/ */opposite/* /direction./

  /And the funny thing? It's going pretty fast. The Earth has a circumference of over 40,000 kilometers, and a revolution period of 24 hours. That means every spot on the equator is moving at a speed not too far from half a kilometer/ */per second/* /./

  As the dust began to clear, the cameras filmed the large steaming crater that had formed in the street; Downfall's body, badly mangled, laid on the crater's rim. The Golden Knife wasn't anywhere near him.

  /Which begs the question: What happens when I, in Japan, open a portal at the equator, somewhat to the East of South America's coast? And about half a kilometer below sea level?/

  /Answer: The most obliteratingly badass water cannon ever. Because, sure, tapping into the Marianas Trench provides pressure... But then, the water still needs time to accelerate. Here, the water is/ */already/* /going faster than a bullet. And this kind of speed means hundreds of tons of water crossing even a small portal in a single second. An energy yield measured in gigajoules, in/ */hundreds/* /of gigajoules./

  /And the scary part? That wasn't my best shot. I can think of an alternation on this technique that I'm still afraid of using due to collateral damage. For now, though.../

  Downfall's body twitched weakly as Soul landed right next to him, and affixed the anti-magic manacle to his arm. She then pointed her index at him. "Junior goddess of kick your ass."

Although if you can only do it on yourself, it's rather a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2hM1tyEL0U&t=89][single-use trick]].
