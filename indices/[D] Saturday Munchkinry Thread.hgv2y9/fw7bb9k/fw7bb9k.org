You have the powers of [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Crawler][Crawler]] from Worm. It can be summed up as very fast permanent adaptive regeneration. If you get cut, your skin heals back tougher to cuts. If you get burned, your body heals back more resistant to burns, etc. You still feel the pain, but only at first. Your body will slowly adapt to that too. This can and will add mass to your body, and make the shape of your body inhuman over time (by the time we see crawler in worm, he's a van sized six legged monster).

This adaptation works on /everything,/ from dimensional shearing to mental attacks and time bubbles. However, you have to keep in mind that too much of one type of damage could turn you into an invincible "rock," so you have to constantly find new ways to damage yourself in order to become stronger and more durable.

Say that you start off as a normal human being of good mental health. How do you use your powers as Crawler for good (i.e. not evil) while balancing your mental health as much as possible?
