Yeah, being unable to cast spells was too harsh of a result. There's no way for that to be a reoccurring obstacle and still have the story progress. If the damage was less severe, then it might have been able to be permanent, but as it is there isn't any way for Z&Z to do anything significant if their ability to do magic is significantly impaired.

Maybe if the damage was something like having constant bodily pains? Or some form of numbness, partial paralysis, or even memory loss. Those could have been things that stayed throughout the story, and acted as a real consequence for the previous chapter's mistake. Even if the damage slowly healed over time, or they needed to learn something to fix it, it would have been better. Instead there wasn't any way for them to do anything meaningful while they healed, meaning that from the reader's perspective not much time was spent on the consequences.

As an alternative, what if Z&Z needed to use crutches for the next few chapters, but they otherwise could function normally? It would be a real consequence that the reader would be reminded of, and very clearly see the results of that.
