That could have been demonstrated by having the ailment normally be permanent, but through Zorian's alchemy he makes it heal in a few months. The author controls everything anyways, he can have Zorian improve the situation from "permanent" to "a few months" just as easily as he made Zach's ailment go from "he may not wake up for weeks" to "he'll be fine in a little bit".

It doesn't matter how skilled a character is, if the author wants the audience to take injuries or setbacks seriously, we need to actually see the negative consequences of said setbacks. As it is, we were shown about as much story time spent on QI's attack's recovery as we had for Z&Z recovering from the injuries the Grey Hunter inflicted on them.

The number of restarts remaining decreased, but that's a classic example of "tell don't show". A number that barely any audience member was tracking anyways got decreased by some amount. The plans didn't change, their ability to enact those plans didn't change, and not only did Z&Z not have any permanent consequences, they even have improved due to the injury.

I know that we can't know the contents of the rest of the story at this point, but would the rest of the story have been significantly changed if the initial number of restarts remaining when they started tracking had been 5 fewer, and this whole subplot of QI injuring them was skipped? The thing with being injured with the Sword Divers made Zorian substantially less aggressive in gaining Aranean knowledge, and gave him a motive for revenge. He also started carrying around better suicide bomb things. The result of the current injury seems to be "Hey, let's try mind magic this time", something that would have been about equally likely to be thought of beforehand.
