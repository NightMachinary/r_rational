!delta. I don't feel the same gravitas with this as I felt with the Sword Divers death, which I still remember quite well. Although I will note that Zorian said without his soul and mind training, the damage could well have been permanent as his soul restructured his mind to integrate his loop memories.

In all honestly, though, I feel we'd be talking about this differently if these previous five restarts had occurred over three or four chapters where significant work was done despite not being able to do magic themselves. That would feel like serious consequences had occurred. Maybe it could go into depth about convincing Xvim sans magic---or perhaps Ilsa instead---then using whomever they recruit to help rescue Alanic and Lukath. Then they could find more to join their cause who would help them move goals forward in unexpected ways. It would be a five-month masterclass in minioning.
