You make a good point. I did hesitate to tag the author, however my memory and organizational methods are entirely inadequate and I don't trust myself to bring this point up at a later date. I know the author puts typos into a master document for use once the novel is over. I'm tagging the author with this comment as it's related to that editing process---indeed this comment was not a question at all but rather a recommendation.

To the author: I apologize if I'm being annoying. I don't have a good sense for these things.
