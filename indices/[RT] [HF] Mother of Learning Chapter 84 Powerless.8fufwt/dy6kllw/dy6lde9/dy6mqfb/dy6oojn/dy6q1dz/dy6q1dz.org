The source of damage for Zach and Zorian was the same, so I feel that by examining his own soul, Zorian was able to make remedies tailored to the damage. On the other hand, the potions could also just be aids to quicken the soul's natural recovery process rather than treatments for the specific type of damage sustained---analogous to the effect of good nutrition on the body.
