I don't think the primordial itself is looped. It's pretty clear that as powerful the Sovereign('s?) Gate is, it's not strong enough to loop anything more than what's within this "earth plane": spiritual planes, and therefore probably primordial dimensions, are off limits. When Silverlake inspected the summoning setup, she said that it's going to the same place, but from a different perspective: thus it's likely that connecting to a primordial within the loop actually connects to the linear-time extra-loop primordial, and the "different perspective" is because the loop dimension is located in a different meta-spatial position. The primordial is probably really confused about why these femtosecond-long gates keep pinging it at incredible frequency.

On that note, I strongly suspect that the reason for loop crash isn't something inherent to the primordial, but the time-speed differential between the primordial-dimension-body and the loop world.
