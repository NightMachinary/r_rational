The discovery of the soul tether allows them to try (and fail) the heist once in a restart now.

Where before they would be harassed by the eagle riding royal dickwads, now they break the tether and continue through other plans of the restart even if they fail to get the dagger. They now have 19 attempts to get into the vault on their own.
