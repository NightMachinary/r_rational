Why did Zorian get a critical failure when trying to convince Xvim? Even if he couldn't persuade him right there, he should have been able to tell Xvim the instructions for some super rare spells, including some which are unique to Z&Z like the modified Gate spell or the shield spell with ridiculous shaping requirements. This should have at least been enough to get Xvim to take his story seriously.

For that matter Zorian managed to convince Xvim of the time loop before without access to advanced knowledge/magic, though that took a couple of days and he didn't ask Xvim to cast any spells.
