Zorian may have grown a just a /little bit/ too set in his routines when it comes to convincing Xvim about the time loop, and acted too quickly and aggressively, not realizing not not being able to back his words with magic makes him much less credible to people's eyes...

Or that's what I was thinking, at least. Maybe I just didn't think things through well enough. I'm not infallible and it happens sometimes. Since it's not critical to the plot of the chapter, I ask for your suspension of disbelief in the matter.
