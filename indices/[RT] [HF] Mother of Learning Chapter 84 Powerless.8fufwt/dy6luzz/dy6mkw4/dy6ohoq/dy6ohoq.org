This is a great idea: If Zorian can render QI mentally powerless for the split second it takes someone to toss a coin at him, then QI is out of commission until he can find a new body. This would be enough to get the crown and dagger in the loop. Out of the loop, this solution is a good fall-back if they can't find a way to end QI permanently---though it might only buy them a little time as we know from a previous chapter that QI has extra bodies nearby.
