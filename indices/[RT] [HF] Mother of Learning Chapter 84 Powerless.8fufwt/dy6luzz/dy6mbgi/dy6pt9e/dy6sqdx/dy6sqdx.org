  they just dismissed it because it was unlikely to work but that doesn't mean it won't work.

What would it take to convince you that it won't work? Testing it? Zach /has/. He's tried to throw objects at QI a bunch of times, and QI literally handwaves them away.

And as for having him underestimate them, to even make the attempt, they would have to appear as nonthreatening as regular academy students. Which means shutting down some portion - quite possibly a large portion - of their activities, since those activities were enough to actually attract QI's attention and have him seek them out. So making any realistic attempt at tricking him into grabbing a thrown object has a significant opportunity cost. It's not at all a free shot that they're ignoring; it's a time and resources sink with no realistic prospect of a payoff.

Mind magic is a much more feasible approach. Since he's apparently not a psychic (based on his attack on Xvim), his only adequate defence against Zorian is Mind Blank. If Zach can dispel that, then QI can't just wave his hand and push Zorian out like he could knock away a soul coin. Either he goes mind-to-mind with Zorian and likely loses, or he evacuates and likely drops the crown.
