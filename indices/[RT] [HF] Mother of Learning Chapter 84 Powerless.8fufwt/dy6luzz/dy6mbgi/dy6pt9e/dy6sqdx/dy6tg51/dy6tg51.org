The only reason qi met them was because their activities concerned him. They wasted multiple loop not trying it out in which he wasnt suspicious and I repeatedly emphasize they don't need to throw the ring. Literally said it in bold and you still going on about them doing it themselves.

The author most likely wants it done THIER way and not some anticlimactic coin trickery which has no evidence that wouldn't work within the rules of the universe other than them stating "Oh it won't work". They never even tried with other ppl and utterly dismisses it because of it breaking the authors narrative. Like I said, use the lich's arrogance against him like the first time it worked since it's not like the lich is going to be wise to the trick across loops. They don't need to beat the lich at all just get the crown and they are finally understanding that this chapter instead of all the time wasted before.
