he can just give it to someone and tell them it works on liches. i don't mind if the author makes it impossible but they never attempted to try instead of doing nothing at the end of the multiple wasted restarts(making the coin shouldnt be too hard and just give it to someone and hope for the best). if it works then awesome but if it doesnt its not like they invested too heavily
