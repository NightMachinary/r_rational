Maybe you're right, but I never got the sense that Z&Z were able to spy on QI enough to compel someone to touch him with a coin. To agree with you, however, it would have been cool to see Z&Z spend time trying similar tactics unsuccessfully a couple times just to convince the reader that they weren't overlooking these kinds of strategies.
