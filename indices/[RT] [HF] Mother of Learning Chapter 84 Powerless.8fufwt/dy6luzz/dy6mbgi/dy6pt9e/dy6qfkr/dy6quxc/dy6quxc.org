Well they got him by relying on his arrogance so it won't be farfetched to try the same thing again but with even more vulnerable target since it doesn't NEED to be them to flip the coin to the lich. They could even mind-control someone on lich's side or a student. They should've done it way before when they knew lich had the crown instead of doing nothing at the end of the loop where lich invades.

Tbh Its an easy solution thats dismissed because the author wants the lich to be defeated in their own way instead of relying on that coin trick instead of just doing that at the end of the loop instead of wasting so many loop doing nothing to the lich even by proxy.
