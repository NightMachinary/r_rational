+I don't like the title of this chapter...+

Nevermind, the chapter title was a bit overdramatic. Fitting, but overdramatic nonetheless.

Tbh, I don't think it's such a bad thing for them to have taking their time off. I mean, it sucks that they were forced to lose those restarts but it doesn't hurt them to remember who they are doing those things for as well, and to rest their minds a little.
