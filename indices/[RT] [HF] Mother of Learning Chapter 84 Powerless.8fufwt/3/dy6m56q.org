"Oh no! Zorian is dying!"\\
"Oh wait, he's recovered (mostly)."\\
"Oh no! Zach is missing, his soul damaged beyond compare!"\\
"Oh wait, single spell tracked him, and soul cure worked with no long-term effects."

This was underwhelming, frankly. Any potential danger was quickly hand-waved away, and the only consequence they suffered was losing a bunch of restarts.

Back to the grind, I guess. Not that I mind- it's just a shame this fearful moment didn't last longer. It was a change of pace, and I thought we'd see more fun interactions between Zorian and others.
