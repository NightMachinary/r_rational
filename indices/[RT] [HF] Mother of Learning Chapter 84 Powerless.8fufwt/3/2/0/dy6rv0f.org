I agree a more permanent or longer lasting effect would have been nice, but to be fair, Zorian is so accomplished that I wasn't surprised by the result. Zach /would/ have been screwed out of commission for longer if Zorian hadn't been so proficient with soul magic, alchemy, and had collected information from someone like Sudomir who is well-versed in soul damage. Zorian worked long and hard for those skills---like fifty chapters---so I'm okay with him knowing what to do. It may seem like what QI did to them was dealt with anti-climactically, but I feel this chapter was the natural culmination of years of disciplined training.
