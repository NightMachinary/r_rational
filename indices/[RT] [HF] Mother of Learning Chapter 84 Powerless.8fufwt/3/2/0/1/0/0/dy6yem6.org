  I don't feel the same gravitas with this as I felt with the Sword Divers death, which I still remember quite well.

Precisely the point. It didn't really change anything.

  In all honestly, though, I feel we'd be talking about this differently if these previous five restarts had occurred over three or four chapters where significant work was done despite not being able to do magic themselves. That would feel like serious consequences had occurred. Maybe it could go into depth about convincing Xvim sans magic---or perhaps Ilsa instead---then using whomever they recruit to help rescue Alanic and Lukath. Then they could find more to join their cause who would help them move goals forward in unexpected ways. It would be a five-month masterclass in minioning.

While that is one solution to the problem of this chapter, I don't think it's a great solution. It would kill the pacing, and I don't think that taking a multiple update break (translated into multiple real months of time) from using magic in a story where the magic is one of the most interesting focuses. Maybe if they had never been able to convince any of the people around them before of the time loop, and they had a few restarts where they focused on doing so rather than training, but at this point it would be really slow. It's barely even mentioned at this point how they convince their teachers of the time loop, so going back to spending a lot of time doing so would be annoying.

That said, I do commend you on offering a way of showing real consequences to Z&Z not being prepared for QI's attack. And I think it would have worked fairly well earlier on in the story. Just not at this point.
