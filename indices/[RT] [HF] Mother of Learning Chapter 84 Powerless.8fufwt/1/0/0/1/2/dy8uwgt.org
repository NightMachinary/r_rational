I could see that if Zorian only had access to/tried a single soul remedy and it worked. But he used three different ones, presumably to cover as wide as spectrum as possible. For all we know two of the three could have been complete duds, spiritual placebos, and the last potion did all the heavy lifting in regards of accelerating the natural soul-recovery process.

The point is that Zorian didn't gamble all or nothing on a single cure, and it is more that reasonable to expect Sudomir to collect various methods of soul repair and have tested their efficacy given his plan and hobbies.
