Zach's soul has a marker on it, but nothing indicates that that's super rare. And their soul injuries seem to be pretty standard "something blew up on my soul" kind of issues: no indication that QI's soul bomb had unique effects.

Really if you're okay with generic healing potions that work on various physical injuries, I can't see how this is that different.
