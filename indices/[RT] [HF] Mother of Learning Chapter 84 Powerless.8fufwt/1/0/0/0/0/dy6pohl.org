I agree that this solution makes sense---at the beginning of the chapter I was thinking, "I wonder if Sudomir's mind had any information germane to healing soul damage." I would, however, suggest that during the final editing process of the book, this information about soul healing be moved to a much earlier chapter. Chekov and all that. [[/u/nobody103]]
