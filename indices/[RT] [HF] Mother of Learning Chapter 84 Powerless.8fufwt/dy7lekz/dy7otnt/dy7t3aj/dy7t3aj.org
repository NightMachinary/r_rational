Fair enough. So here I go.

WARNING: THEORY BELOW. MIGHT BE SPOILER IF CORRECT

One of the main issues that Zorian has to solve is about the fact that if he gets out of the loop, the original Zorian is still there with his own soul, so our Zorian has to find a way to get his body back without killing him. My theory is that he will use some form of soul magic to become something similar to a shifter (but having his own soul twice instead of two very different souls). We're told as early as chapter 29 that "shifters are people with two souls", and it seems to me to be particularly appropriate to the matter at hand.
