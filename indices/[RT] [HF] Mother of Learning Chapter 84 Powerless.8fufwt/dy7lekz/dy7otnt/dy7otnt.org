You can make a [D]iscussion thread ([[/r/rational/comments/8cb6d8/d_mother_of_learning_does_the_time_loop_destroy/][example]]), but posting here is absolutely fine, especially if the chapter has some new information relevant to your theories. I mean, what's the point of having these threads if not to discuss the plot and fan theories?
