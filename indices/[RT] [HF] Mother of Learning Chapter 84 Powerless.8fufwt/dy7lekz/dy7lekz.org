Hello guys,

I learned recently that there was a thread on this subreddit each time a chapter came out, so here I am.

Do you guys also discuss theories about where some plotlines are heading? If you do, do you have a dedicated thread for that? I have some ideas but I don't dare to post them directly in case I'm right and it ruins the fun for someone...
