I'll agree with [[/u/eSPiaLx]] that it would be very, very nice to get some slice of life chapters/sidestories to MoL. However, I also agree with you - I'm eager to see the story move onto the next stage after the end of the time loop.

I actually enjoy Zorian's school setting and classmates to an unreasonable degree. I'd like to see much more of it - but not at the expense of moving the plot forward. The time loop has gone on for long enough. Just something to keep in mind for the future when you're looking at publishing MoL - a few sidestories would do a lot for fleshing out this world and the side characters. I'd especially like to see more of the wolf-girl in their class.
