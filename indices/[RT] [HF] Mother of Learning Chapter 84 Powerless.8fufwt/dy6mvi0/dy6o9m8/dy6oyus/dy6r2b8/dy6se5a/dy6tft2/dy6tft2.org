I think if you ever publish MoL in a novel format such scenes would be a great way to slow down the pace a bit. Right now we're having breathers forced upon us by the 3-4 week gaps between chapters so non-plot chapters will make the wait doubly as long. But without those, a chapter with zorian re-approaching his classmates could provide great insight into his character growth and would actually end up helping the pacing massively imo.
