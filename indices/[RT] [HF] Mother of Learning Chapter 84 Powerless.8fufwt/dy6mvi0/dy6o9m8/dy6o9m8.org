I agree---I found Zorian's inability to convince Xvim extremely odd. Xvim's code, Alanic and Lukav's deaths, in-depth knowledge that only arch mages would have---and indeed knowledge that is based on novel research like the gate spell that can be casted without help from the destination, the advanced shield spell, Zorian's spell formulas and item schematics . . .

I feel even without magic, it would be enough to at least not get dismissed instantly by Xvim. But perhaps Xvim was so incredulous so quickly that Zorian got no chance to prove himself further.
