  But RR had access to the master key, I think

Very unlikely. It's pretty hard to gather the five pieces, especially with QI wearing one, and RR didn't have to deal with the Gate being barred. I gather that the Controller doesn't normally need the Key in order to leave.

I'd agree, though, that it would be possible to test control magic and experiment on the primordial without completely letting it out.
