  On that note, I strongly suspect that the reason for loop crash isn't something inherent to the primordial, but the time-speed differential between the primordial-dimension-body and the loop world.

Remember that Primordials contain an entire world inside them. So unlike measly human scale pocket dimension creation, it's possible that a primordial entering the time loop stresses out the Sovereign Gate and causes an automatic shutdown and restart in the same way that the time acceleration chamber shuts down when they try to bring the Imperial Orb with them.
