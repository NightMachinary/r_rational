Huh.

Unrelated to this chapter, I just realised what RR was probably up to, optimising the invasion over and over again.

If we assume that he owned that robe (since he had it easily available at the start of the month when he attacked Zach), and is thus an inner-circle cultist, then he actually wouldn't care all that much about maximising damage. But it didn't take him long to drop off tips to the invaders, and a more effective invasion would give him more time to work on the cult's true objective.

Remember how Zorian didn't think that their mind magic would be good enough to actually overpower the primordial? /What if they had someone who could try it over and over again in different ways, recording what worked well and what didn't?/

We now have a motive for initiating the loop early. Not a divine failsafe to contain the primordial, as some have suggested, but a secure laboratory to determine how best to break it out and put it on a leash.
