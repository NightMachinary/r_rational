  Now, you would think that after 50 times of this happening, House would realize that his track record for accuracy of initial diagnosis is literally 0%.

If you include randos he treats at the clinic in 10 seconds with one glance at them, his accuracy is pretty damn high. If you also make a sensible assumption that not every patient House treats with his whole team is shown in an episode, you could figure that you are only shown the most "interesting" cases, while behavior of the characters is tailored towards an "average" case. People in-world have no way to guess if a case is going to be episode-worthy except in retrospect, so they can't change their behavior to reflect it. Overall, this hardly should impact your suspension of disbelief. Other issues in the show might, but not this one.
