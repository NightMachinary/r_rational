If I wrote r!Animorphs I'm not sure I would have included the gods or the Chee, but then again, I'm not sure how much of a choice there was, given the nature of Visser Three.

Anyway, I didn't intend to bash any rationalist fiction with my comment... I like all the works I listed there, and it's fun to see the lengths authors go to in order to get around the probability problem. And I will never not love r!Animorphs with all my heart.
