If it weren't for medium constraints, rational fiction as a category wouldn't need to exist, because then "good art" would be usually indistinguishable from "rational art," and it would be exceptional to find a work of art that was good /and/ irrational, except perhaps in comedies.

Rational art sets itself apart by saying, "I will either justify or avoid the usual constraints placed by the medium," even at the expense of narrative, and therefore attracts people that get bugged by the usual baked in irrationallity of most works.
