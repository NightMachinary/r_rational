It is a consideration and trend, but I think you overstate the necessity of the tropes. For instance, House's accuracy problem is largely due to an outside-context problem: the parts of his work life we see are subject to selection effects where the main content is the complicated cases; the (simple) problems he gets right at first are pulled out only in sufficient quantity to give commentary on his work ethic. It's not realistic to expect the character to consider as evidence the chronology of the problems with regard to the commercial breaks.

And from the list: #2 is probably something else, because the aliens are hominoid even when they are not likeable; #3 is usually at least lampshaded by some sort of contingency; #5 could just have easily been an extraction by the mooks or an emergent environmental hazard (and sometimes is!); #6 is probably closer to 30-50%.
