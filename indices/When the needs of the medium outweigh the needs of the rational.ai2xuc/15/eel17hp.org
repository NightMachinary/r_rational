There's something to be said for more complex and lengthy stories tending to be more in depth and realistic because of it. But there are also cons to overly long stories, that's why books have editors, and why choosing what to cut is as important as choosing what to add..

​

It still bothers me seeing military commanders not using helmets in battles just so we can see their faces.. Give them a special accessory, or focus the camera on other more interesting things than a guy barking orders, or just give them helmets and see if people complain..

​

Also seeing kings and important people leading troops in the front (without helmets). Yeah it looks good, look at that the good guy fights with his men while the villain stays behind and gives orders. Well the villain is being rational in this case, he's not risking ultimate loss for a slight boost in morale.
