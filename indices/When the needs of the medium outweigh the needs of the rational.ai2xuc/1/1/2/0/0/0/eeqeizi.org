You have successfully convinced me that my thesis as originally stated was too strong. Good talk!

I will say one more thing, though.

#+begin_quote
  ...fails to defend a cornerstone of the thesis, which is that the proposed "solutions" - idiot balls, characters to fail to learn anything, characters who are way unprofessional - are directly the result of the issues. I'll grant they're the most obvious solutions, but they're not necessary...
#+end_quote

I don't want to directly identify any of these shortcut "solutions" as inherently bad (and I don't think you're doing so either). Sometimes there is a theme which the writers want to get to, and so the audience is willing to accept the shortcuts as a means to the destination, like they accept cardboard props in a stage play. Insofar as "better shows [have] much fewer of them", I think the difference between good and bad writing here is what takes the audience out of immersion (as I mentioned in the original post). As many have pointed out, including myself in the past when we were rewriting the sidebar, rationalist fiction is a stylistic choice that puts maximal weight on /not/ using shortcuts. That doesn't mean the alternatives are necessarily bad writing... and most people here already agree with that, I think, but some people still think that rationalist fiction is perfectly synonymous with good writing. I wanted to explore more explicitly why that wasn't the case.
