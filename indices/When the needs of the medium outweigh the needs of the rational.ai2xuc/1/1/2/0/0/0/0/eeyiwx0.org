Well, that's a better outcome than I can usually hope for. Thank you for listening, I suppose, and being generally good about all this.

This is late, because I've been away from reddit for a day or two now, but I mostly wanted to confirm that I am indeed hesitant to call a trope "inherently" bad - though my preferred phrasing is that /all else being equal/, shortcuts are undesirable by some nonzero amount to almost everyone. However, all else isn't equal, since a work has limited resources, and that amount may be very small indeed - certainly often smaller than the liked-ness of whatever other trope or theme they make way for.

(And if I'm being really pedantic, I'd insist on saying the audience accept it like they accept limited world building in a short story, since I do consider the stage props issue genuinely, qualitatively different.)
