  My thesis is this: many (perhaps most) stupid things that happen in [otherwise good] fiction are the inevitable result of the constraints imposed by the medium and genre.
#+end_quote

That is /very/ generous.

Medium constraints and willing suspension of disbelief are valuable concepts, but this reads like an attempt to shovel every shortcoming of fiction ever into the "medium constraint" pile. It is a true (and sometimes useful) observation that various incentives and constraints affect storytelling, and it's certainly a /better/ model than "plot holes are caused by evil typewriter goblins who hate consistency". It is not a blanket defense against criticism. Stretching the concept as far as is done here, it comes off as "Have you considered that writing good fiction might sometimes be difficult?"

--------------

We might, to begin with, consider my favorite example of an acceptable concession to medium constraints, Aliens Speaking English. This has several important properties.

- It has no bearing on the plot. Unless Earth-humans are involved, which they every so often aren't, (see Star Wars) it doesn't matter what language the aliens are speaking, so long as they're all speaking the same language, which is reasonable enough if there's shared history.

- There's a clear in-universe/medium divide. We can easily imagine the exact same events transpiring, except with the characters speaking Klingon, and then having English dubbed over it. That is, what we're seeing is not what's happening, and the difference is obvious and specific.

- Going against the constraint is hard. While some subset of sci-fi purists might prefer aliens speaking Klingon with subtitles, it's actively detrimental for much of the audience.

- Going against the constraint does not add much. While some subset of sci-fi purists might prefer aliens speaking Klingon with subtitles, it adds little to nothing for the overwhelming majority of the audience.

These are, I think, useful heuristics for when something gets a pass as a medium constraint. Less-than-exact stage props similarly tick off all criteria - they're not plot-relevant, the audience can picture how it's supposed to look, and most people accept that it's not that important.

Most of the examples given here fail to have some or any of these properties. All of them (save part of 2, and 1 if they're not discovered) have significant bearing on the plot. None of them (except sometimes 2) let us picture the same story being told with the constraints removed - if you replaced the unprofessional, insubordinate characters with professional ones, you would have a different story.

Going against the constraint is sometimes hard, but not always. To borrow your terminology, these limits /really/ aren't fundamental.

- A competent villain will have failsafes and plans B that allow them to come back for round 2 without the main characters being incompetent.

- If you have one or two episodes where the initial diagnosis is correct, and the conflict comes from some other source, and imply that this actually happens off-screen like 90% of the time, it's just rarely the focus of an episode - then your initial diagnosis accuracy is suddenly 90%.

- Why are the main characters being sent on the dangerous mission? Presumably, because you wrote the story about someone who's /supposed/ to go on dangerous missions. Either this is someone in-universe unimportant (they'll still be important to the story, of course, since they're the viewpoint character) or the dangerous mission is important enough to warrant sending important people.

- Why are the characters being unprofessional and insubordinate? Is it impossible to write character drama about competent people, or aren't you a good enough writer to do it believably?

Finally, these are not meaningless changes, and stories are almost universally better for surpassing them. Nobody really cares that aliens speak English in Star Wars, or that sword prop #6 could have been better crafted. The fact that everybody is incompetent, nothing makes sense and the plot hinges on everyone making stupid decisions? Best as I can tell, people /notice/.

People might feel more invested in a character drama if they feel conflicted themselves, as opposed to doing their best to ignore the obvious resolution or stupid "wait I can explain" gimmick used to make any of it happen. Browse through [[/r/AskReddit]] and you will find /pages and pages/ of complaints to this effect. They might actually be impressed if the villain pulls escapes as daring as the heroes'. "Lower decks" series are currently showing promise.

Us at [[/r/rational]] notice it more than most, that's a given, and maybe that's why we're somehow in the position of defending the ideas of "disliking plot holes" or "being annoyed with incompetent characters" to the entire rest of the internet. We are not, however, a statistical aberration - we're simply at the far end of the bell curve. Lots and lots of people are annoyed with plot holes and incompetent characters, and wish writers would wisen up to the idea of working around them, or improving them.

Evidently, enough people are satisfied with stories where all these issues are omnipresent and glaring to generate an endless torrent of it. It bears repeating, however - the fact that "90% of fiction is crap due to market forces" does not change the fact that 90% of fiction is crap. Pointing out these forces, while sometimes helpful, is not in itself something that should change our opinion of these works.

(And since nobody has said it, I do have to point out that very rarely will you see us earnestly complaining about the plot holes in the latest summer blockbuster, except perhaps as a self-aware intellectual exercise. We are, largely, aware that most of the market is catering to people other than ourselves, and if we sound upset it, it's because it means there's less fiction we do enjoy.)
