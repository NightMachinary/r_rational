  We are not, however, a statistical aberration - we're simply at the far end of the bell curve. Lots and lots of people are annoyed with plot holes and incompetent characters, and wish writers would wisen up to the idea of working around them, or improving them.

  (And since nobody has said it, I do have to point out that very rarely will you see us earnestly complaining about the plot holes in the latest summer blockbuster, except perhaps as a self-aware intellectual exercise. We are, largely, aware that most of the market is catering to people other than ourselves, and if we sound upset it, it's because it means there's less fiction we do enjoy.)
