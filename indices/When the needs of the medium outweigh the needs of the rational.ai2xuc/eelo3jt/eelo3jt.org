I agree, a lot of these are just constraints of the medium and I try not to be pedantic about them. I'd rather watch an entertaining movie that wasn't perfectly realistic than a perfectly realistic one that wasn't entertaining.

The one example on your list that really ticks me off when I see it is the "head trauma is an off button" thing. I think that trope is irresponsible and dangerous. When I was a kid, I thought that was actually how it worked, and kids are idiots who will try to knock themselves out on purpose to see what it's like. There might be adults who /still/ think that's how it works, because they absorbed their understanding of "what head injuries do" from TV and movies and never happened to come across information that contradicts that understanding, and those adults might think they or a loved one doesn't need to go to the hospital when they very much do.
