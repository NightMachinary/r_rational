I think you have a good point with "constraints of the medium" (the medium of visual movies) for point (1). For point (2), I would add that we want humans to play important alien characters, which is again a constraint of the medium.

Not feeling so good about your other points, though. (4) and (7) sound like constraints of the /genre/ rather than the medium. By definition, in a slasher film, you have your slasher slashing rather than using a gun. By definition, in a drama, you have your characters being dramatic. And this is why those genres probably aren't that popular with this sub.

For (3) and (5), I'm not really sure what this is a constraint of, but I don't think it's a hard constraint of either medium or genre. These are just examples of why writing is hard. Nobody ever said writing was easy, and definitely nobody ever said writing rationally was easy.

And (6) doesn't seem like a good reason at all; you could just have people not get hit in the head.
