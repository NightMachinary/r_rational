I agree? It's always seemed obvious to me. Ordinary media puts the needs of /narrative/ first. It's best exemplified by [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim][Bellisario's Maxim]], which states that one shouldn't analyse elements of a story too deeply if they're not /important/ to it.

Story elements must be sensible enough that an average person who doesn't actively try to second-guess them recognizes them as sensible, but as long as /this/ (very low) standard is met, the authors don't care about sensibility and instead optimize for emotional engagement, compelling character arcs, pacing, themes, entertainment value ([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfIndex][rules of cool/funny/scary]]), et cetera. You rightly recognize them as orthogonal to sensibility: the heroes /could/ call the backup team first, but that would trivialize whatever danger awaits them, which is boring. (Naturally, it also applies to written fiction.)

Whereas rational fiction puts the need of simulationism/intellectual agency first, to the detriment of the narrative if needs be.^{1}

I /think/ this sums up your point?

^{1. Well, not exactly. Rational stories still need to be entertaining and emotionally engaging, it's just that they need to this /and/ sensible at the same time, which makes them harder to write.}
