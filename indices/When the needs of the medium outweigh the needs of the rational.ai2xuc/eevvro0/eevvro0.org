Sort of tangential, but I have a rule of thumb about willing suspension of disbelief:

You get to ask your readers to do it /once./ Like, if you take The Matrix, once you "swallow" the whole humans-are-used-as-power-and-plugged-in, pretty much /everything/ else makes sense and emerges naturally.

Bad fiction asks people to suspend their disbelief more than once (or more precisely, it asks people to suspend their disbelief at some point /well after/ the initial setting has been accepted).
