Good writers would come up with ways to deal but the fact of the matter is that people watch TV to allow their minds to shut down and recover from daily stress, or scratch a social itch that modern society doesn't leave time for, or another one of a handful of reasons that have nothing actually consuming a story. In that vein, tv station managers don't want to pay for good writing when cheap writing leads to the same number of ad impressions and ad managers don't want to work with tv managers who have different opinions or priorities than that.
