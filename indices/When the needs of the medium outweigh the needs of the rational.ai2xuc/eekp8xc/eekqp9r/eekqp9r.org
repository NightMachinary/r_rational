Well, this is part of my point. What I'm trying to get at is that the medium of presentation itself can present /fundamental/ limits to how rationalist a story can be. You /must/ see the actor's faces in a film so that the actors can act (if you want it to not be boring; yes, there are exceptions, yadda yadda). What you're describing is what I would call a /genre constraint/ as opposed to a medium constraint. Fiction not in the rationalist genre certainly goes more for emotion than other things. But I'm wondering if the medium of writing itself poses subtle limits to what sorts of "rational" plots can be conveyed well. Possibly there are no limits. My talk of "serialized thought" is me conjecturing on this.
