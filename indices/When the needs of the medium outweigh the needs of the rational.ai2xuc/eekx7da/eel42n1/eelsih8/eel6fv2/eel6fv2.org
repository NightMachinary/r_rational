The next more-general subject I like to consider is the economic consequences of art distribution systems upon the kinds of art that get produced.

The most salient recent example is the effect of widespread streaming on the structure of TV shows. If, after the first airing, the subsequent viewers of a show are going to see reruns in arbitrary order in syndication, you're going to get a lot of shows that follow the episodic format you describe -- a format in which it is indeed very difficult to storytell rationally, although a time-loop story might be able to do it. When you know that most viewers are going to stream every episode in order, you start to see a lot more long-form storytelling, a transition that I'm sure you've noticed in the fifteen years since House and SGA started.

In this view I think you have the causation backwards. It's not that stories are irrational because of medium/genre constraints -- it's more that we have the conventions of medium and genre we do because we have a society that demands irrational stories. This is particularly apparent in film because, being expensive to produce, the medium is subject to a strong pressure to dumb things down for the widest possible audience.
