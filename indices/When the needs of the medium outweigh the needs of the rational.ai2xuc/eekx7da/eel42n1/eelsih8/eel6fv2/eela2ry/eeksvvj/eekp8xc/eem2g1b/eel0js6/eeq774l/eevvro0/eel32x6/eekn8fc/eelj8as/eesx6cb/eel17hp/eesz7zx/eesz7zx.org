Why not? That's exactly what Alexander the Great and the Persian emperor did respectively. Till the Macedonians carved their way towards said Emperor, forced him to flee and thusly demoralized the whole enemy army. The Persians called him a demon-king, so it did work out for him. And Alexander just really enjoyed fighting and killing (though, that's less of a 'good guy' trope).
