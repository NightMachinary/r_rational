For a positive example of TV writing:

I think StarGate SG1 occasionally has very sensible writing. I think, it's because SG1 is more military sci-fi and Atlantis feels more like a sci-fi adventure sometimes. I think SG1 shines, when they emphasize strategy, tactics and occasionally diplomacy. They often avoid the idiot ball, because they're falling back on discipline, teamwork and established hierarchy. This scene (SG1 just stumbling over Apophis and deciding to kidnap him) for example I remember very fondly as an example of excellent SG1 writing.

I also think SG1 shines because the characters fit their role very well. O'Neal is the pragmatic Seargeant type, Daniel is the linguist, Carter does the physics, Teal'C is the native guide. But they all know how to shoot, all have military training and they all work out.

They Goa'uld are technologically superior, but they're kinda soft, having only each other to fight and being parasites, who mostly stole their tech to lord it over peasants. And they're full of themselves, really like to hear themselves talk and often reveal/brag about their plans. They're like a bunch of trust fund kinds larping as evil war lords. But they feel realistic enough. And realistically the most over the top-ones get offed first. SG1 has like a dozen seasons and suffers from humanity power creep and at times terrible writing, but especially the Goa'Uld arc feels solid.

SG1 doesn't enter each new planet with artillery, tanks, nuclear weapons and an infantry regiment, because they're very much aware, that they don't want to start a fight, that they might not be able to win and that they would rather try to win hearts and minds first. But when they do have to go all-out, they don't hold back, which is very satisfying.

I think, it's easier to write plausible stories when the protagonists are under intense dtime pressure and with limited resources in novel situations with no obvious right answers.\\
I think Atlantis doesn't have as good a team. Shepherd is neither as charismatic or funny as O'Neal, McKay talks too much,too fast and is terribly immature and it kinda feels like the alien girl and the alien guy have not much reason to be there. I think McKay talks more than all the other three combined. I find that SG1 had a grittier more realistic feel, but in Atlantis everything is shiny and full of technobabble. Not that either show doesn't have it's shining moments or absolutely terrible episodes (especially when the writers decided to turn O'Neal into Homer Simpson for some reason).
