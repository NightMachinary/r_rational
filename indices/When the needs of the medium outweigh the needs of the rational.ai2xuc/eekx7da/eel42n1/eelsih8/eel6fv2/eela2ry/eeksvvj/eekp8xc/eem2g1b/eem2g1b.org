I think you're overestimating how fundamental medium constraints are. Both Law & Order and The Wire are serialised TV shows about crime and law enforcement, but they differ drastically in to what extent they're willing to use dumb unrealistic tropes. The Wire is amazing but requires way more effort and engagement from the viewer (and the writers: a lot of The Wire is based on the showrunner's experience of being a crime reporter for years), whereas the Law & Order franchise is the TV equivalent of a Happy Meal: you get the same predictable experience every week, but you don't need to be a sophisticated consumer to get something out of it, and the writers just churn out episodes based on whatever's in the news without needing to do much research.

Of course, it also helps that The Wire was on HBO, so there was less pressure to keep individual episode ratings up and more time to build an audience, so I guess you could say that the medium of prestige subscription TV is less constrained than the networks.

But look at written fiction: almost none of the medium constraints you identify apply, yet a lot of pop fiction still uses idiot plotting and dumb tropes. Look at the most popular fiction hits: Twilight, James Patterson's output, Dan Brown, etc etc.

To be a big hit, a novel has to sell to a lot of people who don't usually read fiction, so it helps a lot to pander to the less sophisticated reader. A lot of readers want comforting familiarity in fiction, so writers can be rewarded for regurgitating the same tropes over and over. I'm sure someone could write a groundbreaking, rational romance novel, but that's probably not what will sell in the romance novel market.
