  Avoid situations where medium and sensibility come into conflict.

I would call that fundamental, because some plots just don't work. But of course, as you point out in 2-4, almost anything can be made to work, with some effort.

Indeed, and I guess I'm really looking for examples of "rationalist" plots that writing can't do /elegantly,/ but other media could. One might say that nearly any medium of fiction like film or writing is... ah, "Turing complete" ? ... with respect to the stories it can tell, but no medium can handle everything well.
