I'm not sure who said it, but one of the basic ideas that improved my ability to enjoy film and television (particularly works that my younger self might have dismissed as "irrational") is this: when the script and the shot are communicating different things to the audience, the shot wins, because film is a visual medium. My young take on film was that the most powerful person on any production was the screenwriter, because they have the ability to control the plot, and what the characters say. Now, my take is is that the director has the most power, because they control how those things are delivered to the audience. The Social Network isn't an Aaron Sorkin movie as much as it is a David Fincher movie. (An even bigger-brain take might be that the editor has the most power, because they decide how everything is cut together. For a humorous example of this in action, see [[/r/recut]] trailers, like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvfI8vUuJ04][this one for The Notebook]] where editing turns it from a romance into a thriller.)

There are a lot of movies that I enjoy even though they don't necessarily work 100% on a plot level, but I let myself be sad when the score tells me to be sad, and I let myself be scared when the shot tells me I'm supposed to be scared, and I grin during the action scenes and laugh during the funny moments, and I end up having a good time as a result, even if the details of the fiction may not always add up. (As you note, this is called "the willing suspension of disbelief.") Annihilation is a perfect example of a film that I enjoyed tremendously on the strength of its visuals and pacing and tension, but whose plot immediately begins to unravel if you start to tug at it. If I'm not willing to believe what the director's shot and the composer's score are telling me, then why did I walk into a movie theater in the first place?

  In the medium of writing, are there any constraints analogous to the visual need to see the main character's face in a movie?

Cross-talk is very common in real life and very hard to represent on the page. Whenever a character on the page gets interrupted, they will often immediately stop talking and cede space to the interrupter, instead of continuing to speak over them for a few sentences before maybe trailing off. (If you want a good case study in why most written stories don't have any cross-talk, trying reading a transcript for an interview/podcast/panel discussion that has even small amounts of cross-talk and you'll quickly understand why -- a lot of podcast transcripts I've seen will actually sequence things slightly achronologically as a concession to the idea that complete sentences are a lot easier to parse when you're reading them one at a time.)

On a similar note, written characters tend to talk in well-formed, grammatically correct sentences. Even among well-educated and articulate people that I know, people often start talking without having the complete sentence in their mind, and sometimes they'll trail off or stop in mid-sentence to re-phrase what they're saying. Or sometimes they'll end the sentence in a way that technically isn't a full sentence, but still contains all of the information that they intended to convey. In written fiction, it feels rare for a character to do this.

Even in cases where a character speaks grammatically incorrectly for stylistic effect (such as to communicate to the reader that they are feeling awkward and uncomfortable, or that they are not a native speaker), they will still be consistent in the way that they misspeak, following their own laws of grammar. (See, for example, Yoda from Star Wars: he's not "speaking English wrong" so much as he's speaking his own dialect that has its own rules.)

  It's not common to see characters who do the equivalent of staying at home and watching TV because they can't decide which movie they want to go to. Or at least, I don't know of fiction where things like this happen.

These things usually don't advance the plot, unless the plot is specifically focusing on something like a character's struggle to overcome an executive function disorder. There's also a lot more focus in stories on external conflicts than internal ones, because it's a lot more interesting to read about someone having an argument with their boss, or having a fist fight in an alley, even though the biggest struggle of their day might be finding it in themselves to crawl out of bed in the morning.

In a story, we expect every scene in the story to somehow advance us toward a goal of some sort. The author, simply by putting a piece of information on the page, has decided that that piece of information matters to the story they are trying to tell, even if in the service of some goal like "building atmosphere" or "pacing." In most stories, every conversation or decision achieves something that matters to these things that we call "characters" or "plot" or "setting." Every time we see something on the page, there is an implicit question of "what is this bit of description telling us about the world, or the characters, or the plot?" In fact, one of the characteristics of good writing is that it conveys a lot of information in each sentence: a small bit of description of a simple action might inform us about the character performing the action, the world that they live in, and also somehow be relevant to the plot. But everyday life is full of "useless" actions that don't advance or signify anything meaningful or significant. (Even if there is a scene where "nothing happens" because the author wanted a scene where "nothing happens" to be there, /that/ is significant, because the author wanted to set expectations for something happening and then crush those expectations by having nothing happen, maybe to build dramatic tension, or to communicate something about the character's state of boredom, or pacing, or whatever.)

When a character in a book notices that their shoe is untied and kneels down to knot their laces, it's because the author wanted that scene to do something, like maybe draw our attention to something a character notices on the ground when they kneel down, or maybe that they're the kind of fastidious person who always wants to make sure their shoes are properly laced. Whenever I stoop down to tie my shoe, it means that my shoe was untied, nothing more. Notably, this is probably why most stories don't have scenes where characters go to the bathroom, and most meals are skipped over: these things happen all the time, but those scenes probably wouldn't advance the story the author is trying to tell.

  When writing a character from the inside, there is a general pressure to make their mental state more sharply defined than is realistic, so that the reader isn't bored with descriptions of vagueness and indecision.

This story is coming from my memory of one of Brandon Sanderson's fan panels at a convention, so I might be getting some details wrong, but: When Brandon Sanderson was writing an early draft for The Way of Kings, one of the things he struggled with was the fact that Dalinar seemed indecisive, constantly battling with himself internally over the question of whether the visions he was seeing were real, or whether he was going insane. He eventually decided that this conflict of questioning Dalinar's sanity worked better as an external conflict, so he created the character of Adolin so that instead of Dalinar having internal monologues where he battled with himself, he had a son who he could argue with. His beta readers agreed that the story worked much better when certain questions were litigated between two different characters instead of having the argument take place entirely within Dalinar's mind. It's more dramatic and entertaining to read, but I'm not sure it's really truer to life.
