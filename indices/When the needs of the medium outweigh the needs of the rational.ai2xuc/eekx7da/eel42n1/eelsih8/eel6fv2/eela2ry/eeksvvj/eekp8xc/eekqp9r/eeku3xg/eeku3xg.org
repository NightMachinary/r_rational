Ah. I see.

  the medium of presentation itself can present fundamental limits to how rationalist a story can be

I disagree. You can always:

1. Avoid situations where medium and sensibility come into conflict. (Don't have scenes where the character's face will be disguised. Skip them, write around them.)

2. Let sensibility win, and regain narrative points in some other way. (Characters stay disguised, but the actors put extra effort into tone of voice or body language.)

3. Modify the medium. (Characters stay disguised, but you're using some bleeding-edge camera tricks or 4D video technology to show actors' faces anyway. Or we're watching from the PoV of one of the characters, who /infers/ the others' expressions even though they're hidden.)

4. Justify medium constraints. (Characters don't /need/ to stay disguised because of <insert sensible justification>. (It's probably a corollary of 1, though.))

It's harder to do any of these things elegantly, though, compared to just having the characters take off their disguises, and most of the audience doesn't care in any case, so it's usually not done.

And sure, some of the constraints are harder to go around than others (e. g., [[/u/Kuiper][u/Kuiper]]'s point about characters speaking in grammatically correct sentences), but it's by no means /impossible/ in any case.
