  This is a case of competing optimization processes producing inadequate equilibria, or at least different equilibria than what is expected here on [[/r/rational]].

I'm all for working inadequate equilibria into everything, but this one's a stretch. There's such a thing as overfitting.

Otherwise... yeah, what you're describing is essentially non-rational fiction. Rational fic is all about trying to make an interesting story /without/ the shortcuts.

(whether or not that's possible seems to be addressed by the other comments)
