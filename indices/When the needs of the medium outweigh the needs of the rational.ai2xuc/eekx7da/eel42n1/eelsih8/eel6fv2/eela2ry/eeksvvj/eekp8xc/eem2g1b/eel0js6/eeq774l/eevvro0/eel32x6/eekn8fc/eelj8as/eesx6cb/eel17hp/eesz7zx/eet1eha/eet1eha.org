This is a complex subject but the scholarly accepted reason for alexander's immense success included many factors including a big technological advantage (his enemies couldn't deal with the phalanx). He was a genius, talented, lucky, and an statistical anomaly, he's not average nor representative of anything.

​

Yeah you can argue he won because he led his troops as a cavalry leader, that's probably not true though, specially when you consider the time(s) he almost died because of it and was saved by his men.

​

It's a risky tactic with low upside, in general intelligent military leaders led from a vantage point where he could get the full picture of the battle and it's many other advantages, not from the frontline with limited visibility and poor communication and coordination capabilities.

​

It's more of a tv and book trope than a real life thing.

> The Persians called him a demon-king, so it did work out for him.

​

They called him that because he destroyed their biggest temple and killed several of their religious heads.. He was never a good guy to begin with. I mean zoroastrians still hate him today.
