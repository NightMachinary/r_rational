I don't find this very convincing.

While it's likely that lazyness contributes in the form of writers not bothering to consider if the tried and true methods still make sense, and producers being unwilling to put money on something that takes risks by assuming they can ignore convention, that has little bearing on why those conventions exist in the first place and just assumes they are no longer relevant.

Also, Several of your own examples are wrong, or misrepresent the issue.

1. Han and Luke being bad at sneaking is distinct from most cases of the trope as usually the infiltrator is suppsoed to be good at it. If writers followed your advice in general we'd instead be debating how ostensibly expert infiltrators can't shut up when sneaking and suck at acting.
2. Limitations of money are part of the limitations of the media. And as your own point alludes to a story like say Babylon 5 with a dozen or so recurring aliens, half the core cast being aliens, and a TV budget, can't go that rout and be effective.
3. Actually the fact that the Rebels let Luke, a random farm boy with no training, fly in a combat mission is an example of this. It's highly irrational to not at least make him do a qualifying run in a simulator before trusting him to not get in the way in combat, but because he's a main charter the rebels issue him a ship and he gets to be in the climactic battle.
4. Vader flat out chokes a dude at a briefing until Tarkin reigns him in. That's neither professional, nor an example of not escalating to violence. The execution in Empire is also highly unprofessional even by executed as an example standards.
5. The trench run is itself complete nonsense. It's an out of context remake of a WWII attack on a dam. The rational attack pattern for the stated objective would have been to aproceh the exhaust port directly and fire a 0 defection shot at it not maneuver down a trench full of AA guns and try to bak your torpedoes 90 degrees into it. Failing that, when Wedge disengaged and the TIEs didn't follow he should have re-engaged and attacked them from behind.
6. Inventing a stun setting is just the Sci-fi equivalent of "I knocked him out with a martial arts move, he'll be fine" This is not an example of avoiding the trope.
7. Yeah, as irrational as slasher flics are, that random teens weren't packing heat when the went to makeout point isn't a strong example. Though splitting up probably is.
