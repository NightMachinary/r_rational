  Also, Several of your own examples are wrong, or misrepresent the issue.

The irony is that you accuse me of this while going on and doing it.

1. Them being bad at this doesn't negate my point. They were goofy and such due to inexperience and for comedic relief in the film. You can still do the /exact/ same thing with someone skilled. They merely need to use some of the body language and verbal catchphrases of the character doing the infiltrating. Or just purposefully surprise everyone, like the face mask pull-off done in the original /Mission Impossible/.

2. This makes no sense. Please elaborate how what you wrote here in any way contradicts what I said, because I'm not seeing it. I gave you examples of non-human aliens giving a convincing performance while also having unique character and not speaking English. You did not counter this. Babylon 5 actually does a similar thing. If you've watched it, you can easily tell me the behaviors and attitude of, say, Vosh, but in the case of shows like B5 or Star Trek, they /actively mention/ the existence of translator technology.

3. Actually, the writers already handled this. Luke back on the farm talks about how he flies in his spare time, and plays with a model of the ship he flies. At least twice later in the movie people refer to his flying skills. One even says "Luke here is the best bush pilot on the Rim!" They didn't /show/ him flying before because they only had so much budget. So they referenced his flying skill in dialog with other characters or even his own. He mentions he has no problem hitting Womp Rats, which are the same size as the target they need him to hit. Thus, when the end battle comes around, it makes perfect sense to have him take part in the battle, and we can have him fly decently well because it is part of his backstory (unlike, say, Rey in the new movies who can just magically fly good with no backstory reasons). This was an example of /good/ foreshadowing.

4. Yes. Remind me where Vader's position in the Empire is? What is his military rank? He's not a General or Admiral or Captain or anything, he exists outside their system. He acts professionally up until the point where he can't reign in his own anger, but he /listens/ to those in authority (in this case, Tarkin). Ignore the rest of the rank structure, though.

5. Sure. How many blaster shots do you want to dodge simultaneously? Because unless the answer is /all of them from every single turret out to the horizon/, it's probably a good idea not to try that trick. /Everyone/ thinks of the "attack it straight on" approach. I did as a kid, too, until I actually sat down and thought about it. The Imperials wouldn't really bother with overkill until they realized what the Rebels were doing, but by then they were too close for a proper response. But if they went straight for the port? Everyone would know. The Wedge thing is a good idea, though. Of course, if he tried that with Vader, it wouldn't work so well.

6. It is a perfect example of averting the trope. You talked about receiving brain trauma from a knockout blow to the head. Sci-fi addresses this with a 'stun' setting on their weapons. What's the problem?

7. In most Slasher films they split up because the couples want to be alone together. It's part of the original Slasher concept--the teens are doing immoral things they shouldn't be doing, and the 'monster' is their punishment. It's been so long that most of that is forgotten, however, and writers simply follow the trope out of laziness instead of coming up with compelling reasons as to why they do this.
