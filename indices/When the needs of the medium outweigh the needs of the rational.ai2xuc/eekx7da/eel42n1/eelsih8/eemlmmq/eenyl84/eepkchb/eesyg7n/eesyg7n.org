1. Vader is part of the hateful, dark and edgy power elite (that's quite literally, how they see themselves). He's not a professional leader of men, he's more like a high-ranking Nazi, which often enough were incompetent and eccentric. Nazis existed outside the existing state and army infrastructure and frequently disregarded it's norms. Sounds realistic enough to me.
