My *ANTITHESIS* is: Writers tend to be lazy, and once a convention is settled on, it tends to be used by everyone out of convenience, rather than put forth effort to write something better. It's easier to replicate than innovate, and carries less risk.

Having said that, I will address the first six of the seven points using /Star Wars/ as an easy example. A previous poster used it for one example, but with a little thought, I realized it actually covered most of them.

1. Han and Luke used the same Stormtrooper disguises. They only took them off when they were in a room without any enemies, and later to prove to Leia who they were. In both cases, they had a distinctive walk and body language that seemed out of place--this was both to cue the audience in, and to demonstrate that they were really /BAD/ at sneaking and had to use other methods to achieve their goal.

2. In most cases, the real answer here is due to limitations of money. You COULD create some six-legged ant-thing, but it's easier to use rubber-forehead aliens. In Star Wars, however, you have two 'aliens' (R2 and Chewbacca) who are both visually distinctive from humans and also happen to not speak any decipherable language at all. And yet, due to their body language and the actions and words of characters around them, they convey individual personalities quite well. Obviously, this can't be done for an entire movie (well...), but it can certainly be done with at least one or two characters in most, if the writers actually put forth the effort.

3. There are countless scenarios where the main characters get into trouble or risk their lives. In most cases, that's because they are /the only characters who can do the job/. Even so, when properly written, that doesn't stop the other characters from putting forth the effort. A great example is at the end of Star Wars--at least two dozen Rebel pilots are seen volunteering for the Trench Run, even knowing its probably suicide. Han flat out refuses to be there at all. And we get to see many of them die, on-screen with faces visible no less, on this otherwise hopeless mission until the guy who can actually achieve it is able to do so.

4. All the high-ranking members of the Empire act like perfect professionals, at least in public. They often have conflicts with each other due to differences in opinions (Vader VS Tarkin on the usefulness of the Death Star, for instance), but this almost never results in a shouting match or outright violence--at least until its execution time. In the case of the Rebels, they disagree all the time. They are as 'professional' as can be, but since the writers wanted them to be able to argue with superior officers, they put that where it would make the most sense--in a less-professional organization where such would actually be able to happen. A cunning writer would have a cop story with this, but use it for the plot--perhaps that cop district is corrupt and 'on the take', or maybe its not very successful as its members are not following proper procedure.

5. We see a reversal of this, where the villain has a hero stunned and carried off. We also have the garbage disposal scene as to why the heroes weren't followed and finished off directly. The closest example that would apply in /Star Wars/ with the heroes being the active choosers of this trope would likely be where Vader keeps ambushing them on the Trench Run. They COULD attempt to dogfight him above the surface, but they would get torn apart by the turrets and his fighter squadron--and that assumes they know about him (the first group certainly didn't). In all these cases, the people involved are acting as rationally as can be expected. In most well-written movies, there is either a moral or time constraint built into the narrative that prevents the villain from being offed by the hero. The 'good' hero is against killing a helpless foe, or they have very little time to accomplish their real goal and the villain is just a distraction. This helps to distinguish them from the villain, especially when there is a 'We are the same' speech coming up later.

6. They used a stun setting. No, seriously, this was addressed in the first couple of minutes. Minus that, other another method used to render near unconsciousness was a telekinetic choke. Rather than club the heroes like baby seals, the writers used a little bit of creativity here. In most cases, the 'head thump' is used as it's easier to write, and less traumatic on the characters than what realistic methods would require (being choked out or made to bleed until they pass out is a much more gruesome method that nonetheless works in reality)... but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of other ways to knock a character unconscious or at least remove them from a conflict without it being lethal. That being said, I'd like to see this happen in a movie, with all the consequences it entails. That would be smart.

Alright, I can't really address the last point with /Star Wars/ simply because it /is not/ a Slasher movie. This one is different as it's so specialized, but the answers are still simple. I will use a sci-fi Slasher movie as an example of how to do exactly what you asked, however, and further prove that most writers are simply lazy.

1. Most Slasher films involve school-aged teenagers. Generally, they don't have much access to guns or military training, and their social interactions with each other aren't usually the most rational--for obvious reasons. So what happens if you decide you want to genre-shift this into, say, Sci-Fi, but actually use military people with guns and put them in a scenario where they still get murdered as effectively as Slasher kids despite using reasonable tactics? What would that look like? Well...It would look like /Predator/. Last time I checked, it was pretty popular.

Most stupid things that happen in movies or stories are generally due to stupid mistakes or outright laziness by the writers. While the medium does impose limitations, there are plenty of ways the creative can get around that. Even if it's just in a single film. In most cases, the goal isn't to write something 'great' and 'new', it's to write something 'good enough' for the movie makers to turn a profit. As long as they get more money out than they put in, they will consider it a win, and the laziness will be rewarded.
