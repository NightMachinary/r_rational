  this reads like an attempt to shovel every shortcoming of fiction ever into the "medium constraint" pile
#+end_quote

Perhaps I tried to ask too much of my bracketed statement "[otherwise good]" in the thesis. I added that at the end when I realized that my post might be construed as explaining /all/ bad fiction in terms of medium constraints. Anyway, I think there are three types of effects here: medium constraints, genre constraints, and plain bad writing. The interaction of all three things produces most fiction. The numbered points actually deal with a mix of medium and genre, and I should have been clearer about that. Some constraints are pure medium (like #1), some are pure genre (like #7), and some are a mix.

  the fact that "90% of fiction is crap due to market forces" does not change the fact that 90% of fiction is crap. Pointing out these forces, while sometimes helpful, is not in itself something that should change our opinion of these works
#+end_quote

Well, I think it should change your opinion of /some/ works. Sometimes things that look like bad writing are there for other reasons, and with a shift in mindset, you can enjoy the work for what it is. Do I wish that more fiction tried to hold itself to higher standards and creatively work around its constraints? Absolutely, which is why I frequent this subreddit. But a lot of fiction is good for what it is in spite of not doing this.

  To borrow your terminology, these limits /really/ aren't fundamental
#+end_quote

After factoring in budget, time limits, premise, story arcs, actor contracts, etc., some of them pretty much are. Suppose, for a moment, that there really is no one besides your main characters to go on dangerous missions. Eventually your main characters will go on dozens of missions in which they barely make it out alive (premise and story arc constraints - the story needs excitement or it is boring). Probabilistically, they should be dead after twenty iterations of this, because no one can win a coin toss 20 times. Thus any kind of story where characters are exposed to lots of risks requires a suspension of disbelief by necessity, and essentially all rationalist fiction has to bend over backwards awkwardly trying to find a way around this problem (HPMOR had prophecies, r!Animorphs has gods tipping the balance, Mother of Learning resets every month, Worm shoehorned in like 5 different worldbuilding reasons why everyone hadn't already killed each other, etc.)
