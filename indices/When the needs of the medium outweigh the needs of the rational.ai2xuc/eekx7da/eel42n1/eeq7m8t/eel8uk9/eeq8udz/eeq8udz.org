  r!Animorphs has gods tipping the balance
#+end_quote

The biggest factor in protagonist survival in r!Animorphs is that the protagonists avoid fights a lot. The characters get caught in less than ~10 lethal fights over the entire series, half of them planned in advance with the odds stacked in their favor.

But yeah, for the other half, the story kind of goes the extra mile to keep them alive, with (so far):

- Friendly super-powerful pacifist robots.
- Healing through the morphing power.
- /Resurrection/ through the morphing power.
- Two literal /divine interventions/.

And yet, r!Animorphs is on the realistic side. Like, if I read about their experience on a Wikipedia page, I wouldn't be /too/ surprised most of them survived the war.

Compared to Worm, Pact, HPMoR or PGtE, it's pretty conservative.
