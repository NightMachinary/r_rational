  Insofar as we hadn't considered the difficulties before, yes.
#+end_quote

Full agreement there.

#+begin_quote
  there's honestly a limit to how many layers of second-degree effects you're allowed to pile on
#+end_quote

These aren't second order to film, they are part of the medium of film by necessity. Every film has a time limit, limited budget, story arc that needs to be somewhat appealing to human psychology, etc. I think many common tropes arise as writers try to solve narrative problems within what they can do with their resources. These tropes then get abstracted away and wielded poorly by mediocre writers. But many times they are necessary and inextricable (unless you have infinite budget and time, or just avoid certain classes of stories that people like).

#+begin_quote
  The limits you discuss don't seem that fundamental to me
#+end_quote

In the sense that they can be worked around in principle, they are not fundamental. In the sense that certain narrative difficulties arise specifically due to presentation format, I would call those difficulties fundamental. If we taboo the word "fundamental" I would say that certain stories are difficult (but not impossible) to tell in certain forms of media, /because/ of the media format. (Or genre format, or story type, etc.) Under a limited budget, difficult often becomes impossible.

  "qualities the industry is currently bad at"
#+end_quote

I agree that even with the effects I just mentioned, the film industry has very suboptimal writing, likely because the studios want to pander to wide audiences and so give the writers checklists of things to have in the film, whether or not those things are logical. And of course, some people are just bad writers.

#+begin_quote
  this example was not in the original post
#+end_quote

I had it in mind when I wrote the Stargate example, though I framed it differently there.

#+begin_quote
  In this post, the idea is expanded way past that, which is why I'm hesitant to take it seriously
#+end_quote

If I were to rewrite the post, I would ax most of my examples and talk specifically about the contrast between visual and written storytelling, and which things are difficult to do in each as a result of format. That's what I find most interesting here - things like a strong pressure to see actor's faces, or tropes writers use to get around limited budgets that aren't inherently bad when done well, or the difficulty of conveying realistic speech in writing.

#+begin_quote
  Or, you can do as Stargate did, and outright acknowledge that the universe the series takes place in is one of a handful where everything ended up mostly all right
#+end_quote

I like to call that the "Anthropic principle of storytelling" - if the characters didn't make it, you wouldn't be telling the story. This is a pretty good solution to probabilistic problems in stories, though in rational fiction there is pressure to give a stronger justification (which is one of the things I really like about rational fiction - it's fun to see what kinds of worldbuilding need to be done to make events not implausibly unlikely in the setting.)
