I do understand if this wasn't the debate you came here to have. Still, /as your case was presented/, I think a lot commenters (myself included) are averse to the idea that the sort of problems you bring up are somehow /qualitatively/ different than other problems we expect writers to solve.

It's true that some of these issues arise from the medium, but they're still just that - issues. Writing is, and always has been, an exercise in overcoming various issues.

If you rephrase the original claim as

#+begin_quote
  Due to medium-related constraints, good films are harder to make than good books. Therefore, all else being equal, films are more likely to contain cheap tricks like idiot balls and unrealistic head injuries.
#+end_quote

then I'll gladly accept it, for some definitions of "good". It's the talk of (if you don't mind me paraphrasing)

#+begin_quote
  So-called "cheap tricks" are in fact just the most easily available solution to the inextricable constraints placed upon movies
#+end_quote

which I don't like, because it implies the underlying equation is fundamentally changed.

Even if movies or series are quantitatively harder than (say) books, and even if this hardness is asymmetric - such that rational tropes become disproportionally harder, compared to say action tropes or visual tropes - the overall shape of the system (and I admit I'm repeating myself here) is still that better writers make better movies using fewer "stupid" tropes, and worse writers make worse moving using more "stupid" tropes.

While of course you should be aware of these issues, it's still just, best as I can tell, a relative rescaling of how hard things are, or which tropes are harder to do correctly than others, or many idiot balls you need.

--------------

You're probably correct in tabooing "fundamental" at this point. If I may, the expansion on the word you do defend - roughly, "issues derived directly from the medium" - fails to defend a cornerstone of the thesis, which is that the proposed "solutions" - idiot balls, characters to fail to learn anything, characters who are /way/ unprofessional - are directly the result of the issues. I'll grant they're the most /obvious/ solutions, but they're not /necessary/, in the sense that we see better shows having much fewer of them, or shows that avoid them at the expense of screen time, or some other resource. They're just another couple of line items in the internal economy of a work, alongside {screen time | writer hours | viewer attention-seconds | etc} spent on {original world-building | relatable characters | good pacing | sensible plot logic | etc}, even if they're disproportionately expensive items. (Which are tempting to do away with in the quickest, dirtiest way possible)
