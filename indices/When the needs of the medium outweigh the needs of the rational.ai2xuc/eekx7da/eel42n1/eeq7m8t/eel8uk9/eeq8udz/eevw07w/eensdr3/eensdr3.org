  I think there are three types of effects here: medium constraints, genre constraints, and plain bad writing. The interaction of all three things produces most fiction.
#+end_quote

More importantly, they are relative, and I don't think you can consider them as separate categories. A skilled writer or director can work around greater constraints of either kind. Furthermore, I would argue it is /expected/ they do so to some extent.

Writing /is/ difficult. Writing relatable characters is hard. Writing good prose is hard. Pacing is hard, and making events fit together logically is hard. The overall shape of the system is that writing good stuff requires you to overcome a bunch of difficulties. You rightly point out that some of these difficulties are tied to the medium or the genre, but I'm not sure that makes them special compared to the other things we normally expect writers to deal with.

  Well, I think it should change your opinion of some works.
#+end_quote

Insofar as we hadn't considered the difficulties before, yes. Insofar as we /are/ aware of these factors - and frankly, I think most of us are - they're not in themselves different from other things that make fiction-writing hard. Make no mistake, the concept of enjoying a work in spite of its flaws (of any kind) is important, (and absolutely vital for fan fiction readers) I just don't think of this category of flaws as privileged.

I suppose I should clarify, I am open to privileging what I would consider accommodations of genuine medium constraints, per the heuristics I've given - confined changes that arise in direct ways. In this post, the idea is expanded /way/ past that, which is why I'm hesitant to take it seriously. The limits you discuss don't seem that fundamental to me, and while you argue that

#+begin_quote
  After factoring in budget, time limits, premise, story arcs, actor contracts, etc., some of them pretty much are.
#+end_quote

there's honestly a limit to how many layers of second-degree effects you're allowed to pile on before going from "fundamental limits on the genre/medium" to "qualities the industry is currently bad at" or, again, "stuff that simply not easy, much like any aspect of writing stuff".

  Suppose, for a moment, that there really is no one besides your main characters to go on dangerous missions. Eventually your main characters will go on dozens of missions in which they barely make it out alive (premise and story arc constraints - the story needs excitement or it is boring). Probabilistically, they should be dead after twenty iterations of this,

A point of order - this example was not in the original post, and none of what I've said thus far applies to it specifically.

As it happens, I agree that this kind of long-term probability accumulation is a hard problem, even without any production considerations, and I am inclined to give significant slack for it. (Though, strictly speaking, not under a medium or genre constraint clause) That doesn't mean it can't be mitigated. Individual events can be written as natural-seeming progressions of competent actors, which means the coin-tosses only exist in the abstract. Not every subplot has to end as everyone is about to die - it's alright to reserve the really big stakes for special occasions. (As it happens, better writing allows for stories to be engaging without threatening death to all the characters all the time.) Or, you can do as Stargate did, and outright acknowledge that the universe the series takes place in is one of a handful where everything ended up mostly all right - the vast majority of the neighboring Earths at the other side of the quantum mirror were conquered by the Goa'uld, you'll recall.
