  I hadn't thought of cross-talk, though I'm not sure any particular "rational" plot hinges on it.

If we're assuming that the alternative to cross-talk is having characters who always "take turns talking" and let each other finish their sentences when they're saying something that's plot-important (or immediately stop talking any time another person interrupts them based on the presumption that whatever the interrupter is saying must be much more relevant to the audience), you could certainly make the case that there are situations where this would be at odds with rational behavior.

If you're trying to get a point across, and then someone with a dissenting point of view interrupts to contradict the point you are trying to make, does it make sense to let your own sentence end abruptly so that the person who opposes your viewpoint can have the stage? Especially in an adversarial context, it could be more "rational" to simply continue talking and elevate your volume: perhaps you'll overpower the interrupter (making them realize their interruption isn't working and forcing them to be the one who cedes the stage), and at a minimum, your loud mouth noises will hinder the interrupter from effectively communicating whatever they were trying to say.

There are a lot of real-world "arguments" that are won not on the strength of reasoning or rhetoric, but based on who is better able to "dominate" the social interaction and overpower other people who are trying to speak, especially when the premise of the argument is "we are two adversaries trying to figure out who is more socially dominant and figure out which party should cede to whom" (for example, a verbal fight at a bar where both parties think they would be the one at an advantage if the situation were to escalate). You might argue that the /real/ rational move in this situation would be for the weaker party to de-escalate the situation (thus removing the battle for the stage and the potential for cross-talk), but there are plenty of situations where an asymmetry in information could lead both parties to think, "/I/ am clearly the one who has more power in this situation, and screaming into your face is actually a pretty effective way for me to demonstrate that, while also preventing you from using your voice to persuade the people in this room away from the status quo where I have the advantage."
