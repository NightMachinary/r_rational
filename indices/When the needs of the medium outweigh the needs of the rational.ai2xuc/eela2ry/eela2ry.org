Uh, like... When the - When people talk they just open their mouths and out - words come out just kind of automatically so sometimes the order wasn't right or the tense isn't match with the rest of the sentence or a similar word substitution, and people interrupt people all the time because when they when people get started going with talking they often continue without pausing for input like good characters in fiction will say their full sentence and then stop and wait for another character to react to them so people will interrupt people all the time especially when they start to repeat themselves which is also a thing people do when they talk to.

Speech is disgusting and messy.

Right at the juncture between your frontal lobe and your parietal lobe are the structures that give you motor control. This is really oversimplifying things, but you can think of it as being on the border of what you consciously control and what your brain controls unconsciously. Ie, you decide to reach up and scratch your nose and it just happens. You don't decide to contract your bicep and abduct/adduct your forearm and contract all the dozens of individual muscles in your hand and fingers and wrist, you decide to scratch your nose and it just happens.

Same thing with speech. The Broca's and Wernicke's areas are both near the back of the frontal lobe. You feel an impulse to speak and it just happens.

Writing dialogue is like doing motion capture of a choreographed pattern of movement and then going into the animation software to smooth it out. It begins as an unnatural replication of something natural, and after that it gets edited to be even further from reality than it was to begin with. That's a major constraint of the written word. Sure, actors read from a script and the majority of their dialogue is just as unnatural, but they /can/ replicate it. You can't even come close to replicating it in writing. Look at that mess I made at the opening of this comment. It gets the point across, but it still isn't accurate.
