1. If you do the exact same thing with somone skilled you will make your skilled character look like a goofy doofus who doesn't know how to infiltrate. If you have them take off the helmet but act competent then the audience knows who they are and picks up form their behavior that they know what they're doing. Additionally a lot of helmet removal scenes are probably motivated by how much the studio spent on the attractive actor/actress which is also a constraint of the medium.
2. B5 is all rubber forehead aliens who speak english except Kosh who just sits in a corner being "mysterious" and also speaks english, and the Gaim ambassador who is the only one shown with a translator device but is a minor character at best (and several episodes state that they don't ave ubiquitous translator devices and that the ambassadors all learned english. No explanation of the random civilian aliens are fluent in english or why the aline's own secret government meetings are also in english is given). If they tried to do Spielberg/Henosn puppets and subtitles for even just Molari, G'Kar, and Delen they'd have massively inflated their effects budget and probably lost a lot of the relatability of the characters. (Or they have been written out early on like that preying mantis dude from the pilot).
3. Luke had piloting skills yes. However he does not have combat training or experience, he does not know rebel formations or radio jargon, has not qualified in an X-wing (or even any non atmospheric ship as far as we know), and has not trained with the squadron he joins. Additionally the rebels decide to trust him in a combat mission without verifying his skills, or even actually waiting for Biggs to vouch for him (that happens after he's been assigned a ship).
4. Vader is addressed as "Lord" implying a social rank in the nobility and Anakin held the rank of General during the clone wars it's unlikely Vader holds anything less. Vader is also later revealed to report directly to the Emperor. Even if we assume he's the equivalent of a CIA agent on a military base and not part of the military chain of command he would still be expected to act professionally at a staff meeting. Especially as the representative of the Emperor, and even more so if he doesn't actually have authority over Tarkin's staff.
5. The Falcon does the straight in attack just fine when Han comes back to save Luke.
6. Stun settings invoke the trope they don't avert it. Wether it's a stun setting, a Vulcan nerve pinch, a 'ninja-chop' a vase to the head, or a hypodermic needle to the arm it's still all just "we need them to be disabled here". Sci-fi gets away with it more because they make up so much stuff one more thing isn't noticeable and you can't really falsify fake technology, but it's the exact same concession to plot over realism.
7. This is the one where I do mostly agree with you, and don't have any nit-picks worth defending.
