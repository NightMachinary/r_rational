*Dealing With Cheap World-Killers?*

Given:

- An interstellar society that beats reedspacer's lower bound, and has done so for a very long time;

- An upgrade to physics, "Horizon Mechanics", which allows for the violation of conservation of energy in certain circumstances;

- That it costs under $1billion to install a drive onto a 100,000-ton asteroid, which can accelerate it at half a gravity indefinitely;

- That accelerating a 100,000-ton rock to 0.9c and steering it into Earth would cause an impact about 25 times the strength of the dinosaur-killer asteroid...

Then what non-dystopian methods are most likely in play to prevent disgruntled space-truck drivers from destroying whatever nearby planet they like the least? (Among other disaffected individuals and groups organizations that can spare a billion on some asymmetric STL interstellar warfare.)

Some possibilities:

- Nobody bothers with planets anymore;

- World-Killer detectors are cheap enough, and anti-WK interceptors are clustered thickly enough around any inhabited planet, to have a reasonably high chance of blowing up a WK before it gets too close;

- Upgrading everyone to better-than-first-world luxury, curing disease and aging, allowing people uploading-based immortality, and giving them a galaxy to spread out in to avoid overcrowding, remove nearly everybody's potential urges to cause gigadeaths;

- The drive's blueprints are the exclusive province of an extremely well-trusted group, such as copies of an em that has undergone extreme situations in virtual realities it didn't know were virtual at the time;

- Something stranger, such as traffic space-cops armed with nukes and willing to use them for the most minor of offenses, or nigh-superhumanly-good patent lawyers, or etc...

- All of the above at the same time, in a great big ball that's even more complicated than today's internet...

... What explanations can you think of that meet the general criteria, and let the setting stay generally hopeful overall? Which explanations cause the least amount of strain to your willing suspension of disbelief?
