If you have the ability to cause constant acceleration regardless of an object's mass or velocity, all the way up to 0.9c, you've violated both relativity and thermodynamics so thoroughly that your story is firmly in the fantasy, non-science-fiction realm. Oh, and you also made it cheap. At this point you're treating technology as magic, so you don't need to have a good reason why, you can hand wave it without breaking suspension of disbelief.

Or say that these drives come with navigation systems that intentionally avoid high speed collisions with other bodies (too many customer service complaints where the customer wanted to send a gift but accidentally killed their second-cousin-twice-removed), and the random truck driver doesn't have the engineering knowledge to interface two incompatible pieces of tech (the drive and a third party navigation/targeting system).
