Sorry, I missed the last part of your post!

  Finally, I want to suggest that you rethink the 95% statistic. It's hard to explain too easily since it's a vague concept, but the infections that kill the most people aren't the ones that are perfectly lethal, it's the ones that leave a lot of survivors. If an infection kills it's host every time and too quickly, then it can't spread very far beyond the first town it appears in. The Black Death was so dangerous, because it left a large fraction of survivors to spread to even more people to infect and kill off. Maybe set the death total to be roughly 50%?

It's not a literal plague; think of it as a Y2K bug in the vampire's software, and only 5% of them had the patch. I didn't really want to go into too much detail as none of this ends up reader-facing (except the strange age demographics of the vampires).
