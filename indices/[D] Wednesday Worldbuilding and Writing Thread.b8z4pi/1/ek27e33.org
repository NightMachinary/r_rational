A question about society:

What do people call disasters / great events that lived through / suffered through them versus people who read about them in history books?

My grandfather always called WW2 "The War", because as far as he was concerned, there was only one War, and it was the war he was personally involved in. But I call it WW2 because it's one of dozens of "historical" wars and has no special meaning to me (beyond the fact my grandfathers were involved in it).

But I think of 9/11, and I think the kids these days who were born after it and are currently yeeting about the place still call it 9/11, which is what it was called within a week or two of the event happening. I think September 11 was the "first" name, but then it got shortened. But I don't live anywhere near New York, and am definitely not a survivor / family of victim / first responder, so I'm not someone who "lived through" the event in the most meaningful sense. Do people in those groups call it something different? In her day-to-day, does the sister of a victim call it 911 or does she call it "the day Alex died"?

What about other places with omnipresent "disasters"? What do people in Rwanda call "The Rwandan Genocide"? What do the people of Cambodia call Pol Pot's atrocities, and how does that differ between the "young" and the "old"?

The reason I ask is because c. 1700 my vampires went through a huge demographic disaster: about 90-95% of all vampires were killed in what was effectively a plague, so most vampires alive today naturally don't remember it, but the ones who lived through it were kind of traumatised by it and not quite the same afterwards. I gave the disaster a couple of "cool" names that I was toying between: "the catastrophe" (pronounced cat-ass-troff, like in the French, because IDK that sounds badass to me), "the hecatomb", "the great death", but I can't picture a vampire who lost all her closest friends and allies using a name like that by default. At the moment I have a vampire character call it "that time", or "then", but I think that's really gimmicky too.

So, any thoughts? Any of the diverse denizens of this subreddit have local wars / genocides / earthquakes that are/were called different things by survivors and born-afters that I can use as inspiration?
