I think people who actually lived through things often refer to them with names, dates, or places. 9/11 is still recent enough we use the date, but I wouldn't be surprised if in 50 years kids learning about it in history books call it the World Trade Center attack.

With hurricanes, people are often like "I got out before Katrina", or things like that. (It helps that hurricanes have human names.)

Specific places or features of an experience also make their way into survivor languages. We had a Holocaust survivor speak at my school when I was younger, and she always referred to things as "Auschwitz" or "the camps" rather than Holocaust.

I think another heuristic is "what would someone have called this while it was happening?". While you're in a war, it's just "the war".

My instinct would be to either pick a name/date for ground zero ("I haven't felt like this since Venice", "I haven't felt like this since 1302"), or pick a generic term like "war" for what was happening ("I haven't file like this since the epidemic", "I haven't felt like this since the plague").
