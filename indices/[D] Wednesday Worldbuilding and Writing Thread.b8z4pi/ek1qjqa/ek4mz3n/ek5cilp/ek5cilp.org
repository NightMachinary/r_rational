I really like the idea of Path knowledge being controlled by entities like governments. Keeping information on charted Paths secure could provide a significant strategic advantage. Depending on how adversarial international politics are and how hierarchical society is, nations might have developed entirely distinct Paths, and social elites might have access to more options or better information that would help them preserve superiority. If the setting is modern enough and capitalist in nature, I could imagine large corporations investing to research proprietary Paths, and Path espionage/leaks being a big issue.

With Paths being as important as they are, it seems likely that entire cultures and ethnic identities might form around them. It's worth asking if Soul is perceived similarly to the soul in real-life Western culture. Are there religions in this setting, and how do they view Soul? Do people believe in an afterlife?
