What in particular do you want people to riff off of?

A nice final object to put on a Great Path would be something that is traditionally associated with domestic work, since it would complement the other options. A loom, or knitting needles, first came to mind. The low levels would let you do your domestic duties quicker and the higher levels would let you make supernatural fabric (say, invisibility cloaks) or perhaps you could knit your enemies legs together?

My question is, does talent come into it? Like, regardless of practise, some people are just more talented at some things than others to start with. Do talented people lose less soul on their first attempts?
