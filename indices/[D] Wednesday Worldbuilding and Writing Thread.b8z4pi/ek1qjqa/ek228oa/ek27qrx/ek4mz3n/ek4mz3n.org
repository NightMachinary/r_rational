This is a neat idea. I would predict that eventually all paths of importance will be greater and that specialization will be really major.

​

Imagine a country that invents the Great Path of the Anvil, the Great Path of the Birthing Bed, and the Great Path of the Training stick. Or something similar. Such a country could pump out a very well equipted and well trained army in a short timespan and therefore easily outcompete other countries.

​

Unless research are done to pool soul mojo then the major bottlenecks for a country are research of new Great Paths and the amount of the soul to invest. The latter could be fixed by some path related to increasing birthrate and the former might be solved by some variation of Great Path of the Tome.
