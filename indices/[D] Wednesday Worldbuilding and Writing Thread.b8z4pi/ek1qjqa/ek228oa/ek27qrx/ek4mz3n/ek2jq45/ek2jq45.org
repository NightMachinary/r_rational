I assume people are born with Soul, in which case it is technically regenerative. Perhaps set it up so the only way to get new Soul is to invest enough of it in a child, which means people who have abused their Soul are less able to have children?

I initially missed the "you can't Reclaim other people's souls", so I had lots of thoughts about Soul factories, Soul tax, or exponential growth.

What path people go for depends on how fast you can imbue your soul. If you can imbue your whole soul by the time you're twenty, the Great path is probably worth it. If it takes until you're 60, then it might be better to have multiple Lesser Path objects, getting each one faster as you get better at the ritual. A bag of tricks is better in more situations than a single powerful one.
