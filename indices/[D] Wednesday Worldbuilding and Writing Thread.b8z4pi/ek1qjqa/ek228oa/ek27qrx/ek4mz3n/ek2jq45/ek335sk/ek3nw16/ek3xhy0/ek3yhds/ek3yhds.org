You can destroy another's object but not steal the soul from it.

  the objects of others (in which case the object is still destroyed but the soul is lost).

You can only reclaim your own soul.

The reason the "only one person" rule exists is to stop the case where poor person A spends years investing soul into an object and then sells it to rich person B. Rich person B then puts a day's worth of soul in and suddenly has access to a high powered object.

I guess an alternate rule would be that you only have access to an object's power in line with the amount of your own soul in it but that seems messy.
