Sorry, didn't re-read the OP when I replied to the child comment.

You can still do a variation of what I proposed above: have children, force them to put their soul into something like e.g. a broom, and force them to use the special broom powers to sweep the floors of your evil lair.

Kidnap people with good Third Oaths that you can nevertheless subdue and force them to do your work, if you want to get benefits quicker.
