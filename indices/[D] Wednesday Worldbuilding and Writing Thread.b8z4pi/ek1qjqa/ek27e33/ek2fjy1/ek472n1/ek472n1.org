Just a few comments from an intruder.

Historically vampires were remote and incomprehensible and purely an otherness that threatened the living. Today's sympathetic model of vampires/werewolves/undead seems to have arisen with Anne Rice's "Interview with the Vampire." That novel and its sequel, "The Vampire Lestat," are about two men who in life were born and lived in late-Romantic France, the first being a kind of middle-class-mentality guy (Louis) and the second an insouciant aristocrat (Lestat). The first novel is full of pseudo-Romantic-French flourishes and cemented the general approach to being sympathetic to vampires in subsequent writing. From Rice's work proliferated a large variety of sympathetic interpretation of previously pure-otherness monsters, with werewolves referring to themselves as "Kindred" and such.

tl;dr Your choice of a French-language pronunciation isn't only subjectively "badass" but in an odd way canonical. And following up on the late-Romantic-French-revivalism roots of the current approach to vampires may be helpful to you.
