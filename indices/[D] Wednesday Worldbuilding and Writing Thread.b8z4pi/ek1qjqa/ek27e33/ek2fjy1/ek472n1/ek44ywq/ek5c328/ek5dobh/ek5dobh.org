Yeah, with a thing as "generic" as a War, that makes sense, but I wonder for "less generic" names - like the best one I have at the moment is Venice, would young vampires still call it "Venice" (assuming no other vampire disasters happened in Venice before), or would they give it a more descriptive name?

(FWIW I don't think a 'nam vet would confuse my if-he-was-still-alive-late-80s grandfather was a fellow 'nam vet, I'm sure they'd assume he was from WW2 until indicated otherwise)
