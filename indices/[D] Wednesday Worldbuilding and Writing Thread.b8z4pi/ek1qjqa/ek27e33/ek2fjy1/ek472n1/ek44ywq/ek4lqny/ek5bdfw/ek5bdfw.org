  I wouldn't be surprised if in 50 years kids learning about it in history books call it the World Trade Center attack

That's a good point. What did people call Pearl Harbour?

Google n-grams to the rescue:

[[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=December+7%2CPearl+Harbor&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CDecember%207%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CPearl%20Harbor%3B%2Cc0]]

It looks like people DID call it December 7 (probably, possibly, people might just be talking about Pearl Habour and mentioning the date it happened), which is good.

Hurricanes may be harder, as they don't tend to be discussed generations later like wars.

  Specific places or features of an experience also make their way into survivor languages. We had a Holocaust survivor speak at my school when I was younger, and she always referred to things as "Auschwitz" or "the camps" rather than Holocaust.

Thank you for this.

I think you're right on the money! I like Venice, though I wonder if vampires would still call it "Venice" once the Venetian Republic fell: probably, I guess? I mean why not? It was Venice at the time, after all, and I have my vampires use archaic names for places (often because they want to distinguish them from the human regions: Western Australia is a human designation with a specific meaning, while New Holland is a vampire territory with a specific, different, but mostly overlapping meaning).
