I don't have any real-life experience or know anyone who would be able to answer, but when I read about disasters or wars in the past, they are almost universally named after the location that it occurred in.

So I would suggest having the ones born afterwards just call the plague after where it appeared from. Kinda like how the bombing of Hiroshima is referenced by directly mentioning where it was bombed, Hiroshima.

However, thinking about it, it's not a war or battle like you were asking in your descriptions. It's a plague, and the next best example is the Black Death which killed off 30 to 50% of all humans in Europe.

People tend to name disasters either by the location where it occurred or by the most obvious feature of the individuals it impacted. I mean the Black Death was called that because people were literally turning black. So I suggest naming the plague after the most obvious feature of the infected or the place where it started from/killed the most individuals. Write down what an infected near death would look like, imagine the shock of seeing the infected for the first time, note the very first feature that you would pay attention too, and name the disease after it.

Finally, I want to suggest that you rethink the 95% statistic. It's hard to explain too easily since it's a vague concept, but the infections that kill the most people aren't the ones that are perfectly lethal, it's the ones that leave a lot of survivors. If an infection kills it's host every time and too quickly, then it can't spread very far beyond the first town it appears in. The Black Death was so dangerous, because it left a large fraction of survivors to spread to even more people to infect and kill off. Maybe set the death total to be roughly 50%?
