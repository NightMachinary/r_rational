I like the place name idea!

The plague was pretty well simultaneous, and it's what I use to explain the "sudden" onset of vampire mythology - a lot of the symptoms were things that people associate with vampirism (excessive drinking of blood over what vampires normally require, redness in orifices, growing pale, bleeding). I also imagine that following the plague, the vampires would have had some sort of "council" meet to try to salvage their fragile political structure and put down some ground rules.

I imagine both the "worst of the plague" (perhaps the place where there was the least Masquerade maintenance for whatever reason?) and the "summit" afterwards happening in Eastern Europe / Romania / Transilvania / etc. It looks like the first vampire (5 minute google) was reported in the Istrian peninsula: the actual person was from Kringa near the town of Tinjan. Both are extremely small towns, though. Larger towns nearby are Pula and Pazin. At the time this was all The Republic Of Venice (aka "The Most Serene Republic") - so maybe Venice might work as a name.

It also has the advantage of maintaining this exchange:

H: When was the last time something like this happened?

V: Not since before Venice.

H: Before Venice?

V: About three hundred years ago.

H: OK. (Assumes V was probably living in/visited Venice at the time; does not press matter further)

As the more "normal" choices (The Plague, The Disaster) would understandably make H curious.

I wonder if younger vampires would give it a different name? I like the idea of the youngest ones calling it something borderline disrespectful (The Winnowing, The Cull?) when the older ones aren't around.
