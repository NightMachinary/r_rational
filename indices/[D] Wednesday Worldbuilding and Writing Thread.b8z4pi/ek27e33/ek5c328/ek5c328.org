The names changed because the old one was not that descriptive any more. WWI isn't the great war that ended all wars any more because WWII happened and was even bigger. "the war" was WWII to your grandpa, but someone who served in 'nam or one of the Iraqs will probably think of their war when they hear your grandpa talk about the war.
