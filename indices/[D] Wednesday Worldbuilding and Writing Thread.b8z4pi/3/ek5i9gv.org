Any German speakers want to weigh in on if "Zwieleiche" is cringy or stupid sounding? Its for a fantasy species invisible to anyone who hasnt witnessed a death a la thestrals from Harry Potter.

While I'm asking, an intelligent species with this trait forms a close knit secret society in my story. They live in a world with normal people in it, and they have strong instincts to eat but typically resist because its too dangerous to poke the bear. Any ideas about their culture or does that make you think of anything?
