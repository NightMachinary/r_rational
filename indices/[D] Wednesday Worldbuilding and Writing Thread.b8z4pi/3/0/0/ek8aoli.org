It's intended as a mashup of "zwielicht" and "leiche"

Does "zwie" mean anything? I know 'zwitterion' as something thats both positively and negatively charged at either end, so I'm inferring it means something like "both this and not this" if its the same root as zwielicht.

I guess I'm imagining them living deep in the woods and hunting deer/moose/wolves as primary sources of food with the occasional unlucky hiker.
