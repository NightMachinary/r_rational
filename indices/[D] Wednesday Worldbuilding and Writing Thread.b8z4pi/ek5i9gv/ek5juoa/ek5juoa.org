Double corpses? If so it's zwei, not zwie.

Culture wise, it sounds like they have to keep themselves separated from the other species. If so, what conditions do they live in? Maybe they congregate in underground passages and secret rooms a la speakeasies.

Maybe the other species have rumors and superstitions that started with someone failing to keep their desires in check. The invisible people would probably need some kind of central authority to keep their members motivated to not feed, because in any intelligent species there will be strong willed individuals who have a different opinion from what the majority takes for granted.
