  Are the empowerment stages empirically determined by characters in the setting or are they integral to the system?

I would sat the stages are in universe soft classifications. That means they probably have names too. I'll have to think of some. Good question.

I also don't think they are hard boundaries either. Rather they are slices on an analogue continuum that stretches from mundane to supernatural. Splitting it into thirds is by conversion, since it matches with the preternatural -> supernatural -> metaphoric journey an item goes through. But you could cut the cake in a different way. Given that the rituals are studied by Academics, there probably are competing systems.

  Where did the Rituals come from and why are they limited in how often they can be cast? This does seem like a much simpler question to answer, of course.

I think the limits on the use of the rituals are practical rather than metaphysical. Trying to use the Endowment Ritual more than once a day will damage you/the object. You are forcing in new power before the old power has properly settled.

As to where they came from - I think pre-history. Hunter-gather's likely learned how to put a bit of their soul into their spears or clubs or fish-bone needles. As civilisation advanced, so to did understanding of the processed. This was formalised (likely by great men standing on the shoulders of giants) into the current Endowment Ritual.

Today, the current study is academic. Their are people in institutes of learning working to advance this area.

This is an interesting question. Given the importance of the Endowment Ritual, charting its development would likely be interlinked with civilisations development. What was the equivalent of the Ancient Greek philosophers? Who was the Newton? Something for me (and anyone else interested) to think about.
