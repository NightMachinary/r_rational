So I've been thinking of a magic system. It works like this:

All magic is powered by soul. Soul is a finite, non-regenerating resources. As far as anyone can tell, everyone has the same amount of soul. As a result, rather than spend soul directly, people invest their soul into objects which gain permanent magical powers from this act. Only the investor of a magical object can use it and only a single person can invest a given object.

The ritual used to put some of your soul into an object is called the Endowment Ritual. It can be performed once per day and takes a small piece of your soul and puts it into an object. The better that you are with the ritual, the the larger the piece of soul you invest but this isn't massively meaningful because you can invest the same object multiple times. The more soul an object contains, the more powerful it is.

There is also a Reclaim Ritual. This ritual breaks down (destroys utterly) an object and reclaims part of the soul invested in it. Doing this is never perfect and you will always loose some of the invested soul. Again, the better you are at it, the less you loose but since the only way to get better is to practice that is not a very useful fact. This ritual can be used both on your own objects (in which case the object is destroyed and the soul reclaimed) and the objects of others (in which case the object is still destroyed but the soul is lost).

The Endowment Ritual isn't static. It needs to be subtly changed depending on the object you are investing and how much soul is already in it. The changes needed aren't obvious or instinctive and can only be found by extensive academic study. As a result there are only five Great Paths.

A Great Path is a fully charted out path for the Endowment Ritual. By following it, you can fully invest your entire soul into an object. This provides the most powerful magical object possible (because everyone has the same amount of soul). Those who split their soul between multiple objects or follow a Lesser Path will end up with objects less powerful than those on the Great Path.

Great Paths exist for: The Sword, The Lamp, The Tome, The Rope and the <I haven't decided yet>

Lesser Paths exists (for example The Shield, The Watch, etc). Some provide useful powers but haven't been developed to their completion.

The powers granted by an object depend on the amount soul invested in it. This can be devised into thirds.

During the first third, the object will only provide ambiguously supernatural powers. Your sword will be very sharp, cut easily and almost impossible to break. By listening to the song of the blade, some of that preternatural power can flow into you. This will let you wield the sword with great skill, blocking blows /almost/ impossible for you to see, moving with strength and grace that seem /almost/ more than your body could produce.

During the second third, an object starts to produce overt supernatural effects. With a slash of your sword you can project a invisible cutting edge. By drawing deep on the blade song you could leap across a room to reach an enemy. When you fight, you are a blur, far faster than any mundane man.

During the third stage, the objects starts to produce overt supernatural effects metaphorically connected to its nature. Your sword can /cut/ things that are no longer physical or /kill/ that which was never alive.

Even on a Great Path, not all objects are identical. An investigator on the Lamp path might even a Truth revealing light at phase two. A lighthouse keeper might get a light that burns through any fog and is seen by all those in danger. Your items powers will depend on the use you put it too and develop towards that goal.
