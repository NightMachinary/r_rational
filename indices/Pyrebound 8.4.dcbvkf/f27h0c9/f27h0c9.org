I'm at work so I can't give as much thought to puzzling out the ending as I should. Anyone from the Reddit hive mind want to help out? At first glance, it sounds like maybe the Ensi made another Ram and sent it off? I'm not sure how that impacts Ram though. Like I said, I don't have the bandwidth to puzzle this out on my own for a few days :(
