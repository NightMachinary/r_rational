There is, to my knowledge, no PB fanfic yet, only an aborted Wiki. If there must be erotic PB fanfic, I insist it honor the spirit of the original by overthinking every detail. For example, if Ram did something unnatural with a murrush, he would absorb a fair amount of heat in the process, which would increase his aggressive impulses accordingly and thus possibly drive him to greater exertion. With the current state of lore it is difficult to say how much heat he could absorb without sustaining burns, assuming there is such a limit, but ...

[several paragraphs of speculation excised]

... so the only solution would be for Ram himself to stand in a large body of water (for a heatsink) while the murrush remained outside on the bank. Which brings us to tinap voyeurism--but that is a matter for the sequel.
