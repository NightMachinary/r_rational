Not sure how to reply to this, TBH. It would have a very different vibe with the genders reversed because, if push came to shove, Ram could pick Darun up and throw her bodily out of the room (as she more or less notes herself). The other way around, there would be a constant threat of coercion or physical violence hanging over them, and it would be a very different kind of scene. I think a double standard makes sense here.

I would say Darun's approach is not respectful, nor likely to lead to a healthy relationship in the long haul. It's not moral--but then, very little she does is moral. A large part of what goes on in this story is morally far from optimal. By inappropriate, do you mean it shouldn't have been included? Because the story also has much worse things shown in detail, like child soldiers, muggings, death threats as jokes, human trafficking, involuntary human experimentation, and organized crime. What's the difference here?
