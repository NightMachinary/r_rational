My experience thus far is that I'm really very bad at predicting what my readers will or will not deduce from clues. I've tried to drop clues as a general rule, and it seems to me that a sufficiently determined close-reader would be able to at least guess what's happened here, but I don't necessarily expect someone to go back and skim the text and get a one-week jump on the author.
