... yeah, not gonna lie, that scene felt extremely rapey and inappropriate to me. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't fly /at all/ with the genders reversed.

Actually, it reminds me of a certain scene from WtC, except the equivalent character in WtC gets (rightfully) treated as a piece of shit for doing what Darun does here.
