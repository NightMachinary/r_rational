Eh, I'm not certain that that is a valid comparison. (WtC spoilers from here on out)

In WtC, there was a significant amount of narrative time spent showing the equivalent character as incredibly powerful and also with a blue/orange moral code. Joon himself also had a number of outstanding, serious hangups regarding sexuality and interpersonal relationships in general. There is a huge power differential there, plus the house could not understand Joon's objections.

Conversely, there is no equivalent power differential between Ram and Darun. Ram has expressed (internal) interest in Darun, and his objections to actually sleeping with her were broadly a combination of "my mom warned me that would be a bad idea", "I'm very cautious in general and Darun in general is not, so this is probably a bad idea", and "Darun made it clear she was not interested". Reading through it, I don't think that I saw any indication that Ram didn't want anything to happen or anything that reads as rape.

A comment from the author indicates it's supposed to be more seduction-focused, and from that sense it's... not great, I'll agree there. I would not have thought seduction reading it. She's very much just throwing herself at Ram rather than seducing him, but given the comment I would chalk that up to authorial inexperience rather than anything else. I wouldn't have even noticed if it weren't for the comment; Darun has always been written as pretty straightforward with her sexuality so throwing herself at Ram could absolutely be in character now that he is a ticket to the kind of wealth she wants. Which is an entirely separate issue, but I digress.
