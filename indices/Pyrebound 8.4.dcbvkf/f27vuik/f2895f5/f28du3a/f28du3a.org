For reference, my wife is the first woman I ever seriously dated, is temperamentally extremely far from Darun, and is not at all seductive; I have no experience with the hookup scene (assuming The Kids are still calling it that these days) and don't know anything about how it works firsthand. I didn't really distinguish between "seduction" and "throwing yourself," though now that I think about it seduction would be more subtle, yes.
