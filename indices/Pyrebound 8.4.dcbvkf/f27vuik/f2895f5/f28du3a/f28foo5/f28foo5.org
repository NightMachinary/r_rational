I believe the preferred nomenclature is "whippersnappers". And just to be clear, I don't have a problem with Darun as written. The seduction was heavy-handed but not necessarily out of character, and you'll get better at writing it as you practice more. I'm very much enjoying the story so far and all criticism is for the purpose of discussion and growth rather than any of actual complaint.
