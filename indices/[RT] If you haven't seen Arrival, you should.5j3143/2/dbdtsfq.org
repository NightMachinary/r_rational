I've seen it. I like the alien parts, the language, the antigrav, etc. I didn't like the B-plot with the future child or the idea that speaking a different language allows you to break physics. Wasn't a fan of the unsubtle pro-US-military-above-all approach, either.

I'll admit I haven't read the book - that might bring it together more smoothly.
