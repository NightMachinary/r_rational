That's very sweet, and honestly, that's probably what he'd do too.

I'm glad to have someone so incorrigibly rational in my life, but at the same time, it's infuriating at times. I was hoping that by getting him to watch /House/ I could explain how even though you're doing the rational thing, people might still think you're a jerk. Didn't work. He just thought House was the best and everyone else was stupid. /sigh/
