Try phrasing it to him cleverly: First agree with him part of the way. He rightly points out that House gets better results than a normal doctor would. This makes his approach better than the standard one.

Fair enough. But just because he has a /better/ approach doesn't mean he has the /optimal/ approach. He could achieve all the same results by behaving more sociably, while also getting reduced social friction, not alienating his minions, and building up social capital that he could use to do more without repercussions. :P

Then point out to him that this is an instance of a general problem: People defend a particular action as having advantages over the null action, but don't spend the time to think of /even better/ approaches -- usually as part of some motivated reasoning so they don't have to stop doing the original action.

Also, I suspect most of House's abrasiveness comes from his constant pain (hence his Vicodin habit) and he copes with it by screwing with people.
