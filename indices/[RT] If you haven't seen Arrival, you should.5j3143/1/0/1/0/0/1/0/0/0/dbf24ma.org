I'm probably worse. Assuming we had a kid together, I'd make notes for my alternate timeline selves and then go back and randomize the circumstances of our kid's existence over and over until I could reliably generate a child whose existence brought you the most joy and happiness.

(Edited: OK, I'd try and find the maximum total happiness for both yourself and the child.)

(Double edit: while adhering at least moderately closely to societal norms/expectations, for anyone thinking "Well then just lobotomize them and stick wires in their brain's pleasure centers.")
