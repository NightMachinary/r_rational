If it helps, I've learned that if you want people to be happy, sometimes it's rational to do the irrational things that make them happy.

Even if it's a case of wanting to put purely rational goals first, there's no reason not to also attempt secondary goals of happiness. And from there, it's a short step to leavening pure-rationalism goals with emotional ones.

Or, from a long-term rational perspective, people are more likely to help you achieve rational goals if you've made them happy, even if that means perhaps not meeting each and every short-term rationalist goal.
