Sorry, I should have known that I'm on [[/r/rational]] and maybe an emotional argument is not as evocative as I'd have hoped...

Hopefully you're not as bad as my boyfriend who would say "well I'd stop my daughter ever existing and I'd love my new daughter the same, and she wouldn't die, so it's strictly an improvement" and then when I explain that people generally care about their kids enough not to want to replace them, even if their future self wouldn't know the difference, he just scoffs and goes "what? no. that's stupid. who would do that?! They'er wrong!"
