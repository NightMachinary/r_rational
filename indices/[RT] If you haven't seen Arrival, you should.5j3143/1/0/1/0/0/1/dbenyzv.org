That's true, but you don't have the knee-jerk "oh my god she could have saved her so easily!" sort of reaction like you do with the accident. It happens on a smaller scale in the story, too - she remembers a salad bowl falling on her kid's head and making her cry, and then that same day she's in a supermarket and she sees the salad bowl. She decides to buy it, even though all she knows about that bowl is that it hits her kid in the head and makes her cry.

Plus, the point was that she /loved/ her vision-of-the-future child. If your Favourite Person (partner, kid, parent, Eliezer Yudkowsky, whatever) were to suddenly get hit by a bus and die horribly, and I said, "hey, I'm Omega, I can make it so that person never lived. You will forget about them, but they wouldn't have died young in that bus accident" - you'd be like, "no, I love them, I remember them, and although our time was cut tragically short I would rather have a little than none of it". Louise /remembers her future/, so she loves that little girl just as much as you'd love your own kid.

Can you imagine going back in time and deliberately stopping yourself from conceiving a child you /already have raised for 10+ years/, by, say, making yourself have sex 10 seconds later so a different sperm meets the egg? Sure, you'd probably love that new kid just as much as the original one, but you would lose /that/ kid.
