  My personal obsession was with social networks. I wanted to know how they evolve and at what point they are greater than the sum of their parts. I wanted to know what sorts of things social networks could accomplish that would be impossible for individual human beings. Specifically, I wanted to know whether a social network was capable of art, science, and contemplation. It is my firm belief that some complicated systems have emergent properties that might as well be called ‘life.' These systems can be aggressive. They can be passionate. They have goals. They have a personality.”
