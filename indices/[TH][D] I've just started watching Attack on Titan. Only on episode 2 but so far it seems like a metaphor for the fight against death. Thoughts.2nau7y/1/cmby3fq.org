A metaphor in what way?

I haven't gotten all the way through Attack on Titan, mostly because I prefer dubs to subs (so I can split focus), but I found it to feel very much like a jingoistic military propaganda piece, in the best possible way. The titans are just the "Other" that can be safely killed by the valiant heroes without any moral question. Though it's possible that this changes later on.
