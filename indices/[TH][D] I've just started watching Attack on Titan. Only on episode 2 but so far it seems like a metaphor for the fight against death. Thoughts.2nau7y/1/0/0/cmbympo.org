Okay, I guess I can see that. I certainly don't think it's the writer's intent though.

The most compelling interpretation I've heard is that the titans are an occupying force and the main characters are the insurgents. It's not terribly hard to see the titans as the American military (vastly more powerful, able to be defeated only with hit and run tactics and then not even all that effectively, utterly foreign). But I guess I can see death working as a metaphor too.
