The titans are an "unstoppable" force that kill everyone they can get their hands on, and most people just accept their existence as a fact of life.

At the start of the first episode everyone feels safe because it has been such a long time since anyone they knew was eaten, and after the attack most people grieve for a while then start forgetting again. Only Eren thinks to try to stop them permanently, instead of just trying to minimize casualties or not think about it like everyone else does.
