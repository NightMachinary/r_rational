I think it's just a general commentary on human nature and how people have difficulty seeing the bigger picture and cooperating even when there is an immediate threat. The general asked Eren at one point what he thought about people in the past's belief that an external threat would force them to work together, and Eren said that was naive. As the plot goes on the protagonists worry more about their enemies within the walls than outside it.

In terms of real life, if there is a connection then I'd say that the author of AoT is probably more likely to be commenting on Japan's relations with China, which the right wing in Japan perceives as a threat in terms of their economy and their numbers. The walls are supposed to represent [[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2013-07-23/interview-george-wada-producer-of-attack-on-titan#][Japanese isolationism]] and there is some weak evidence that the author is right wing [[http://seldomusings.wordpress.com/2013/10/19/migiteorerno/][see here]]. Apparently the author has admitted that the general, Pixis, who is portrayed as a good man, is based on the Imperial war criminal Yoshifuru Akiyama.
