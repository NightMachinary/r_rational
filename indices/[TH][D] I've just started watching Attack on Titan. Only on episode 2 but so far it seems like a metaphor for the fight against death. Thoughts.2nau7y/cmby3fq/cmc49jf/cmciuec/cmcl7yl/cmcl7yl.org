Um there's a lot of info on the latest issues of the manga on the wiki page. Read this for lots of SPOILERS [[http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Eren_Yeager]]

The story section is fairly up to date and has lots of info.

Obviously we probably won't get the stuff like "where titans come from" until very close to the end. But we do know why they eat people, why Eren has his powers, why other shifters are after him, etc
