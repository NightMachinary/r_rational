I can kinda see the parallel in the early episodes, perhaps, but the plot developments (particularly with regards to Eren) strain the metaphor past the breaking point not far past where you're at.

It's still a great show though. In case you were unaware, there are three side-story episodes (OVAs) bundled with the DVDs and manga that you can find relatively easily on the internet. And the first episode of the prequel (covering Levi's early days) airs in two weeks.
