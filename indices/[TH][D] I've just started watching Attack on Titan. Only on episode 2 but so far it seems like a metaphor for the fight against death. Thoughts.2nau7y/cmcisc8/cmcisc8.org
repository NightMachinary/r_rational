It's not a metaphor. It's a long, dreadful slog through the efforts of the mangaka to avoid giving us actual information or plot progress, while simultaneously failing to examine the primary failure mode of the main-character, while also giving the main character plot-relevant superpowers for no good fucking reason.

Sweet Cthulhu Who Only Swims Left, this could have been a /really good/ anime/manga if they'd fixed the pacing and given the [[#s][AoT ep7]] to Mikasa instead of Eren.
