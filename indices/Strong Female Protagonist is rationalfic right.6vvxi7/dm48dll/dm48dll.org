DAMMIT, WHY DO YOU NEED TO OBSESSIVELY PUT LABELS ON EVERYTHING?

Seriously, this isn't against anyone in particular, but we have two of those "Is XXX rational fic?" questions every week. Why do people care so much about a label?

I mean, I like SFP and I'm all for discussing it, but "Does it match a vaguely-defined concept that people interpret very differently?" really isn't the best open minded discussion subject.

Grmbl grmbl stop talking about concepts I don't like grmbl grmbl.
