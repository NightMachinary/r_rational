It's pretty concrete on the sidebar. And I dunno about everyone else in [[/r/rational]] fiction but /I'm/ interested in rational fiction and think it's nice to discover a new story that turns out to be rational once someone posts it. According to the top comment this isn't one but another time it might turn out to be rational and therefore (to me) worth more of a try than others.
