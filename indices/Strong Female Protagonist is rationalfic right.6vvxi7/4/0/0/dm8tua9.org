thanks, it was a really fun read! I'm glad this post brought it to my attention.

Per max -- I agree that the act is reprehensible; I also agree it was correct from a utilitarian standpoint. Obviously, if there were a route to a non-violent solution, she should have taken that - finding a better way to convince him, incentivizing it in some way, etc.

however, for the purposes of the story, this was set up to be impossible. I was disappointed in the trajectory of Max's character arc in general. He was really turned into a strawman very quickly.

To be clear, I'm not much for libertarianism as a practical set of policies, but the ideals can certainly be made out as self consistent and commendable. For some reason the author felt the need to make him almost villainous and hateful. The sudden anger at being told what to do, the careless disregard for people, it was all just an unlikeable caricature and complete strawman.

I would have much preferred a slightly more generous execution of the same story, where Max argues for the values of personal freedom persuasively, instead of just acting like a dick for no reason. Genuine moral conflicts like this around personal terminal values or "axioms" are interesting.

Were I to write the story, I would have it such that his power to amplify others comes with a cost to himself, and show that he is unwilling to pay that cost at Al's behest. They could even still have some existing friction between them, though maybe less trivial and morally one-sided, where they had heatedly argued about personal responsibility and social good vs individual freedom, both coherently.

I think THAT would be a much more interesting conundrum. Max would have a point - he isn't obligated to help Feral, especially at cost to himself. But Al's decision would still be the best Utilitarian solution. Using force could even be said to be justified, given that it didn't just end Feral's self inflicted torture, but increased the total capacity to save many lives.

(though, I'm not sure the logistics work out on that, either. moving all those organs around the world coming out of a single facility operating just 40 hours a month would be a nighmare.)

Given that he had no reason not to comply, though, and it was costless to him, using force may be justified. She didn't need to physically HURT him, though. Kidnapping and just waiting in the sky till he gave in and agreed would probably have been enough.

I suspect the author doesn't have any sympathy or understanding for Max's position, though, which is why he wasn't written to be more compelling.
