I think the reason Max was written to be such an unbelievable jerk is because the scenario was supposed to be extreme--the question being, basically, "at what point does it become okay to twist this dude's arm? If he can save this many lives at essentially zero personal cost, and he won't do it, and the reason he won't do it is that he's a spiteful prick with a bootstrap where his empathy should be, /then/ can you twist his arm? Why or why not?" They wanted to give Alison every possible reason to feel justified in her actions, and then show her conflicted and wracked with guilt /anyway./

Basically, I think he was a dick with poorly conceived ideas because that arc was about utilitarianism vs deontology /more/ than it was about autonomy vs. cooperation. But I agree that it was a missed opportunity. If they'd made him an unlikeable piece of human garbage without the emphasis on personal autonomy, they'd have left those libertarian ideals open for a more nuanced exploration later. I'd like to see the autonomy vs cooperation debate fleshed out in its own right, not just as a facet of the utilitarianism/deontology debate.
