I think so, yeah. Granted, it's not a munchkinry fic, lots of things could have been done better, but I think it's very realistic, because you don't just go straight from superhero into a perfect social munchkin. She /tries/ solving problems through intelligent application of their knowledge and resources, and that's what counts, even when she makes mistakes or outright fails.
