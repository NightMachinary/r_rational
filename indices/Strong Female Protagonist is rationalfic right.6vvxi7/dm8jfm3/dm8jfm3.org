So, I just binge-read this comic over the weekend since seeing the post.

I think you could call it rational fic, yes, though the titular protagonist is not herself rational. In fact, she is surrounded by people who approach problems rationally, and she might be the only main character who /doesn't./

My main criticism of her is that she doesn't leverage her comparative advantage. Rational problem solving is about identifying strengths and exploiting them to achieve your aim.

Her strengths are obvious, yet she pointedly avoids using them to directly solve problems. The only thing she does that benefits from her abilities is firefighting. Honestly, she should just be doing more of this. Rather than trying to think about the whole world's problems and solve them all at once somehow, she should focus on problems she can solve that others can't.

Disaster relief is something she is trained for and has abilities that would make a huge difference. Simply cooperating with firefighters and the national guard to help with catastrophes could save thousands of lives without the need for violence that she seems worried about. And that's just thinking locally. If she actually got her head out of just helping the western world, she could work with relief groups in at-risk areas and make a HUGE difference. Just transportation of food and medical supplies to hard to reach areas could make a world of difference.

These are obvious things she could do that would be personally rewarding and help others, without all the philosophical hand-wringing over how to fix the whole world with "one punch."

She's really a poster child for hipster college students who want to THINK about saving the world but not actually DO anything directly useful.
