Sorry, I don't think I explained myself very well. I didn't mean to connect the jerk aspect with utilitarianism, but I see how it came off that way. I definitely don't think harming him for being a jerk is justifiable from a utilitarian perspective. What I meant to express is that by making him completely unsympathetic but /not/ allowing that to close the debate, they highlight the philosophical dilemma in play. Like, if he'd been a really nice person it would b be more "obvious" for Alison to feel guilty, just because it feels bad to hurt nice people, but he's a complete asshole and she still feels guilty because she's questioning her principles.

I could be reading too much into it. I guess it's also possible that they just really don't like libertarians.
