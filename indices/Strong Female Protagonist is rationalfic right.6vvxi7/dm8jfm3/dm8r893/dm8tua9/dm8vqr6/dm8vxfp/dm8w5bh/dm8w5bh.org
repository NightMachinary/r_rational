Well--that depends on the reader's perspective, right? /I/ don't believe jerkiness has bearing on whether force is justified, and /you/ don't, but there are perspectives from which his jerkiness would be relevant to that question. I think the idea was to cover all the possible avenues by which someone could justify harming him, and then say, "OK, in spite of all that, there's still a debate here".

Their antagonists are usually a lot more nuanced. I'm no libertarian, but there /are/ important conversations to be had about the value of personal autonomy and how it should be prioritized.
