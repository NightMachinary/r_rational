Yeah, I'd say so. Given that the central question driving the protagonist's actions is "How can my superpowers be applied for maximum utility?", it's definitely the kind of thing that appeals to this sub. There's also a lot of philosophical tension between deontological and utilitarian perspectives. Keeping it vague to avoid spoilers, but I think people here would particularly enjoy everything having to do with the character Feral.

One thing that distinguishes it from a lot of power munchkinry content is that the main character isn't especially idealized; she is /trying/ to do the best she can for the world, but she is very much human, and her powers don't include either superhuman intelligence or superhuman emotional regulation. So there's a lot of struggle between her lofty ideals and her flawed, human impulses, and and a lot of introspection in the vein of "I need to stay cognizant of this personality flaw I know I have" or "Okay, I see now that this is how I fucked up." I don't /dislike/ brilliant, hyper-rational protagonists, but I've really enjoyed this character's more relatable struggle to do good.

Note that the story spends a lot of time exploring social justice concepts, as part of the broader theme of "how can we actually make the world a better place for everyone?". For me that's very appealing, but I know some people find that kind of thing offputting, so fair warning.
