At least from how it's described in the comments above, it'd be more like a black superhero running around torturing and murdering people suspected of being in the KKK. I feel like I'd be a lot less conflicted about his if the comment said 'rapist' instead of 'accused of rape'. Is it more clear in the original work if these people are almost definitely guilty?
