I think their point isn't necessarily that vigilantism is ever justified, but that killing rapists is sort of a steelman for vigilantism. Like, if it's not justifiable to be a vigilante who kills rapists, how is it justifiable to be a vigilante who kills [insert socially acceptable target for vigilantism here]?

The idea that only some applications of violence--specifically, those that defend against threats to the status quo--are seen as acceptable/admirable is a major theme of that arc. The vigilante says it herself: "You killed so many innocent bystanders [as a superhero], and it was all okay...You ever see a soldier get called a serial killer? ....They're trying to tell people that I'm fighting the wrong war."

Basically, she's arguing that society has shown it has no objection to her /methods,/ so the problem must be with her /targets./ Hence the deconstruction of superheroes as a concept: The reader, faced with this apparent hypocrisy, has to decide whether the answer is "it should also be okay to murder rapists" or "it shouldn't be okay to murder anyone."

Actually, an anti-financial-criminal vigilante could probably fill a similar philosophical niche. It just wouldn't be as compelling of a story, because most readers wouldn't have the same visceral reaction to a financial criminal as to a rapist.

Re: evidence, the vigilante in this case does go to great lengths to confirm to her satisfaction that the rapists are guilty. Most of that happens offscreen, of course, so it's hard to say exactly what her standards for evidence were. But it's made clear that this is /extremely/ important to her--her own rationalizations for the murders absolutely depend on her believing she's done her due diligence.
