  Therefore, if vigilantism is ever justified, it would be against rapists

I don't see how your arguments justify vigilantism in this case. From what I understand there is still little or no evidence that the vigilante bases their decision on. Your latter example of financial crimes seems like a much better candidate to me because there's WAY more likely to be a concrete trail of evidence that the justice system missed and/or covered up.
