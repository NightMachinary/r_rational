Actually, that is a deconstruction of the entire justification of /having/ vigilantes. Rape has two characteristics which makes it unusual as crimes go.

1: The recidivism rate is very, very high. Rapists are rare, but rape is common, because rapists re-offend over, and over and over. Rapists stop when they are stopped, and not before.

2: The conviction and apprehension rate is abysmal. The formal legal system does a really shitty job of fighting rape, and will often put the victim through hell in the process.

Therefore, if vigilantism is ever justified, it would be against rapists, and it is perfectly logical that in a world with capes, one of them would embark on that crusade. It is really hard to argue against it without completely de-legitimizing caping full-stop. Which is the authors point. Beating up drug-dealers and muggers does not address any social problem which the formal justice system fails at. The cops are, in fact, pretty good at that job.

Uhm. Now I kind of want to write a story about an oracle-expy that goes after financial sector criminals... Who also reoffend a lot and dont serve time very often.
