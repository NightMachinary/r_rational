Offscreen, I don't know--she had apparently been killing for a while before she "stopped making them look like accidents". I'm not aware that she was intentionally /excluding/ women as possible targets; she might have been, but I don't think she ever says so explicitly. We don't actually see her kill any women, probably because rapists are mostly men. (She does try to kill the female main character at one point, not for raping anyone but just to get her off her back.)

She does say that the victims of the rapists she killed were "women, mostly women, but men as well, and kids." I found one example of her referring to her targets as "guys," so it's probable that they have been overwhelmingly or exclusively male.
