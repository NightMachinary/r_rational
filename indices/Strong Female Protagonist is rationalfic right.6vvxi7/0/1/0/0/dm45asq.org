I didn't really get the impression that the comic was fetishizing the violence. The character made spectacular displays of violence and torture because she wanted to make her motives obvious and inspire fear among her target demographic--not because the readers were supposed to be like "nice". Speaking only for myself, even though I despised her victims for their crimes and believed they deserved punishment, the brutal nature of their deaths made me feel uncomfortable pangs of sympathy for them--not triumph or gleeful satisfaction.

I know fiction has a fine line to walk between simply showing extreme violence and gratuitously reveling in it, but I don't feel that this story crossed that line. That might just be my own opinion though.

As for the trope that rapists could be anywhere among us...well, they could be and they are. They're rare, but they don't wear an identifying facial brand or anything.
