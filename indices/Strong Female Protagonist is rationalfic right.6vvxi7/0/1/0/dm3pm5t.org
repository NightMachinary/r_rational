Ok, that all sounds fair enough, but that's not really what's bothering me. There are plenty of stories where heroes do violent or evil things, but it's not an issue because the reader is expected to understand that you can't solve the world's problems that way.

It's the fetishization of violence against the dirty mongrel enemy that disturbs me. Especially when combined with the trope that these evil mysterious creatures are widespread on e.g. college campuses, and could be anywhere amongst us.

Or to interpret it more charitably: That particular character is presented as a pitfall that the social justice activist is not to fall into - but the line is drawn precisely at deliberate torture and murder of an otherwise deserving enemy, /not/ at the idea of treating fellow college students as being potential monsters deserving of death in the first place.
