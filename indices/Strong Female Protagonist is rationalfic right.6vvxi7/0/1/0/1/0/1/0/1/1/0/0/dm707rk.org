Now that is just pedantry. I'm sorry that the broadly used term for white people is not "pink", but language develops organically and here we are.

There are many situations in which it is relevant to distinguish between white and non-white people, especially in countries like the U.S. where white people are the majority and there is a history of systemic discrimination in their favor. Or in this case, where the commenter who used the term was specifically addressing that all of the victims of a particular serial killer were white and not anything-other-than-white. Again, sorry if making that distinction triggers you, but I really don't think you should be censoring our free speech like this.
