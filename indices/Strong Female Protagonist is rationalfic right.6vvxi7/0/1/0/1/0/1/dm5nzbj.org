  Imagine, instead, if a white character were shown killing POCs and another white character had that as a reaction.

Rapist POCs? Because in that case I see no difference. Hell, I didn't even remember that all of that character's victims were white. In fact I'm just taking your word for it.

Then again, I'm not from America, so maybe this just shows a cultural difference between us.
