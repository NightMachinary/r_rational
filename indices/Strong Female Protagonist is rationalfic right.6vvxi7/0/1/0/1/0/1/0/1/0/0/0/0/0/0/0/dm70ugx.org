You're trying to separate people, broadly, into "white" and "not white", an absurd tribal division that ignores almost everything about what defines a person.

Yes, you bloody should describe people by who they are and what they think, not what melanin score they rolled at chargen. Just because it's hard for you to prop up strawmen and socjus talking points without having a big bad whitey to differentiate from the noble colored person (and I'm sure every single non-white person loves being lumped together like that, under a single ideological rally g cry of "at least I'm not white!").
