This entire conversation is giving me a serious eye twitch.

This is [[/r/rational]], right? Can we not say PoC? It's factually incorrect, it's tribalistic, and frankly it's just a rebranding of old racist terminology (colored person has somehow become okay by being person of color, even though nothing has changed).

Just say black person, or something. Please. I come here to get away from ill-considered nonsense like the PoC divide.
