For what it's worth--I think you /did/ say what you mean, and this criticism you're getting is entirely unwarranted. You weren't talking about one specific race, you were talking about non-white people broadly, and you used a suitable term to cover that entire group. This person's insistence that you use physical descriptors makes no sense when you were not even talking about individuals.
