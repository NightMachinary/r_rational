rofl. Favorite part of this is that white isnt a color technically, and neither is pink. (and neither is black, and I mean black as in darkness. I dont know if the various shades of brown count or not). And you should use the terminology of the person bringing up the concern, regardless of your opinion of the concern. if someone says "im concerned that this murderer targeted/didn't target blacks" then that is the topic, you shouldn't complain about the word choice unless it is offending you. someone was concerned about the representation of "people of color" so trying to get them to stop using the term is effectively just saying "stop talking about this"

Wow this is much longer than I meant for it. No, white is not a color, technically
