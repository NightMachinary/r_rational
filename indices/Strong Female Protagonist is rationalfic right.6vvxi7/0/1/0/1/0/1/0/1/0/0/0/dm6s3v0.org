Oh yeah, sure, it's definitely an americanism. And I totally grog your point about how annoying it is that americans think their pet hobby horses ought to apply to everyone else as well. But I'm just trying to be polite to the people I'm speaking to by using a term I expect them to be more comfortable with, and it's slightly ironic if you complain about my use of a political term while using "socks" as a derogatory term yourself.

In private conversations, however, I do the same thing as you - avoid political terms and just say what I mean. It's almost always better that way.
