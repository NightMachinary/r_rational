Don't know if this makes a difference to you, but--dropping spoiler tags since we're this far down the thread--Valkyrie isn't a women's shelter. It's an organization where biodynamics get matched up with women who've recently left abusive relationships, and protect them during the period where they're most likely to be murdered. So it fulfills a similar need to a women's shelter, but it is something that specifically calls for superpowered individuals, not something just any group of baseline humans could do.

It also arose organically out of the events of the story. Al decided to organize Valkyrie because she was inspired by her conversation with Dr. Rosenblum about the serial killer. If you recall, Rosenblum's side of that conversation was basically "I don't see why I should care about this one serial killer murdering a handful of people, when many more women are being killed by their partners every day and that doesn't get nearly as much attention." Which is a pretty [[/r/rational][r/rational]]-style line of thinking, really--being objective in how you allocate your time and resources so you don't focus on dramatic problems at the expense of more serious but "boring" ones.

So I think that got Al thinking about these forms of suffering that are more systemic, less spectacular, don't make the news the way Moonshadow's murders did. Then combine that with Moonshadow calling her out--paraphrased, "you could be doing literally anything else, but you're here, trying to apprehend me." (Of course she was there because she wanted to help her friend, but I do think that hit a nerve.) And those conversations, I think, inspired Al to focus less on the adversarial "find a villain and punch them" approach she's used to, and instead try to address a systemic problem that causes a lot of harm in ways that are easily ignored. It's not the /most/ effective thing she could do, but it's /more/ effective than what she'd been doing.

Regarding the comments section--I mentioned this before, but it was in an edit and you may not have seen it--I really don't think the readers who applauded Moonshadow's killings and the readers who condemned twisting Max's arm are the same people. I wasn't reading the comments during Moonshadow's arc, but I've definitely seen the people who most loudly condemned Al's actions refer to Moonshadow with a similar degree of contempt. That set of commenters aren't motivated by social justice stuff; they're mostly just deontologists who are deeply opposed to the "ends justify the means" approach. I've even seen a couple of them insisting that the utilitarian crowd would hate Alison as much as they do if she'd hurt someone other than a rich white cishet man. (And I'd also bet good money that Rosenblum would have approved of Al twisting Max's arm if she knew about it.)
