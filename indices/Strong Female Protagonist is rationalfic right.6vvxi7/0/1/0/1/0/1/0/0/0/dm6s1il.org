  It's an organization where biodynamics get matched up with women who've recently left abusive relationships

Cheers, I forgot that bit. That makes slightly more sense, but still not really - funding women's shelters with your millions of dollars and government support would still be more effective, and the thought of "we have a giant squid person here who can shoot explosive water bolts from her hands - let's use her to support women in abusive relationships" doesn't /quite/ seem intuitive to me.

By the way, do you have any idea if the comic's numbers on murder rates for abused women is accurate?

  It's not the most effective thing she could do, but it's more effective than what she'd been doing.

More effective than eliminating invisible supernatural serial killers? I dunno, I think it actually does an amazing amount of good to have a photogenic hero like her fighting villains, letting everyone know that an invincible superhero is looking out for them. Look at how much damage the mere fear of terror has done to America - reversing just a bit of that fear could be worth as much as a thousand shelters.

It reads to me like she is more interested in making a great display of being humble and sacrificing, by getting her hands dirty and lamenting over how privileged she is, than in actually using that privilege to its maximum potential. But to be fair, she does worry and wonder about these things a lot, and she really is trying to be a good person despite it all.

  I really don't think the readers who applauded Moonshadow's killings and the readers who condemned twisting Max's arm are the same people.

Sure, fair enough. But if you look at how the comic treats the two acts, there's still incredible moral dissonance for me.
