I really don't understand how that was what you took away from SFP. The whole "are regular people good or evil" question is as old as dirt and it's not entirely obvious to everyone what the actual answer is because there is evidence for both sides. Also, serial killers ARE people too, and not all of them are psychopaths. In the story the reason the main character even felt an impulse to kill all those bystanders at all was because she felt like they were threatening the life of one of her best friends by inciting violence against her.

SFP is NOT a fic for social justice warrior ideology, it's a fic for social justice. If you cannot see the difference between these two things then you've been fooled by SJW ideology just as much as any true believer.
