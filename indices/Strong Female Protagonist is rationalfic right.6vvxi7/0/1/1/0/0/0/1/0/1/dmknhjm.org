  thousands of rape kits go untested
#+end_quote

Only because /they don't need to be/.

Why don't they need to be? Because the rapist confessed, or the accuser refused to help prosecute and the charges were dropped, or it came out that the accuser was making a false accusation, or both parties agreed that sex occurred but disagree about whether there was consent. There are a million scenarios like these, and the ONLY time rape kits need to be tested is when there's a dispute of fact over whether sex occurred between two specific people. Testing ALL rape kits is a total waste of tax dollars, and we should be applauding the fact that the government is practicing discretion in at least this one area.
