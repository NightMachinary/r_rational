That's not how that statistic works. Assuming it's true, based on what you said, 20% is a lifetime statistic - it doesn't mean that she has a 20% chance of being attacked in any given situation. That would give you a much higher chance in a lifetime, like closer to 100%.

I need to brush up on my probability to calculate the actual chance of an attack on a per day or per year basis though.

Anyway. I'm not saying that being suspicious isn't justified. If anything, I encourage it - it's important to be safe. I was just pointing out that the immediate conclusion some people might leap to was wrong.
