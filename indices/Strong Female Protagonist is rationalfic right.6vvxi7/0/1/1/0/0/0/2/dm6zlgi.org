Spot on. And the idea that droves of women are filing rape charges over "post-hookup regret" is especially laughable. Like, "Oh, I don't want anyone to think I'm a slut, so I'll arrange to have a defense attorney try really hard to prove I'm a slut in front of courtroom full of people I know." Sounds believable /s
