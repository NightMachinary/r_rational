I have to say, knowing how to defend yourself only goes so far. Most men are so much stronger than most women that often the safest, smartest option is /not/ to fight back. It's common for women to "cooperate" with their rapists as a survival mechanism, because fighting could get them killed. And of course many victims are already incapacitated at the time of the rape (also an issue for male victims).

I think the most useful strategies for women are proactive ones. Watch while the drinks are made, meet new guys in public places first, trust our intuition when we get the "creep vibe," watch out for each other when we're out as a group, etc. Not that it's our responsibility to stop men from raping us, but I'll take whatever reasonable precautions I can to minimize my risk. Or I would if I either drank or dated, I guess.
