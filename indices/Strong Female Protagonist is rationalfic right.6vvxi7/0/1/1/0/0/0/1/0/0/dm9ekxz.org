I have to look for the source again, but wasn't the 'one in five' study referring to sexual assault, not rape? Although that's still awful, don't get me wrong.

Also, remember, you can't really use the rape statistic for women to determine anything about men. Since rapists tend to be repeat offenders, it doesn't mean that a lot of men are likely to be rapists.
