Three things of import here:

1) You're forgetting that about 40 percent of rape victims are male, and assuming your hypothetical alleges victim is a poor innocent woman being slighted by the big bad justice system, when in practice it's male victims who are told that they were "lucky" or they should have enjoyed it, and female victims that are rushed for rape kit testing and supported by every swinging dick (outside of situations of judicial incompetence, which is an admittedly common problem in certain jurisdictions).

2) You're assuming a much higher degree of mental competence and sanity then what they actually possess from people who file false rape allegations.

3) Are we celebrating perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes now? A random woman on the street should no more assume that every man around her is a potential rapist then a random man should assume a woman in a short skirt is a slut.
