It's hard to get accurate numbers in this, considering rape is viewed as such a "special evil" in society (even though it is at worst a violent assault, but that's another conversation). Being accused of rape will turn the angry mob loose almost instantly, and they'll be out for blood, truth be damned.

I mean, you yourself said in another comment in this thread that "victims" (not alleged, but "victims") go "through hell" when they are part of an investigation of an alleged rape, a statement you're very unlikely to make for any other crime investigation where the victim must testify. If we're already ascribing some sort of special consideration for alleged victims, the reporting skews. Add in the absolute madness of post-hookup regret being spun into rape allegations, and the numbers skew even more, especially with the modern SocJus "listen and believe" ideology.

We'd likely have much better numbers for rape if people didn't think of rape as the "worst thing ever" (which is patently absurd, since murder is the worst thing ever. You can recover from rape, but murder is forever.), and just lumped it in with severe assault/battery of a non-sexual nature.
