Kind of. It definitely has rational elements, and it certainly tries to be one. But a lot of it is lost in the moral morass of Social Justice. I'll spoiler it just to be sure, but the MC sits down and tries to figure out how to most effectively use her power for good, and ends up [[#s][tag]] What's rational about that? She doesn't munchkin her unique advantage of superpowers at all, instead it's only relevant to the extent that it allows people to complain about how privileged she is. If she were rational, she would get involved in politics or something instead.

Also, again as a result of the SJ overtones: There's a very creepy bit where one of the female 'heroes' [[#s][tag]] Seriously, that sort of thing creeps me out, and it's totally anethema to what rationality is about.

Edit: Please note that the above criticism does not take away from the fact that the comic is very well made and engaging - I still read it in its entirety, after all!
