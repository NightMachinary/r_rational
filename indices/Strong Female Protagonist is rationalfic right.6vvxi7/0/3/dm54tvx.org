I love the comic and also actually totally agree with you about Valkyrie.

...EXCEPT: why is /getting involved in politics/ your alternative? Assuming you mean liberal politics, that doesn't leverage her superpowers except insofar as they make her a celebrity (granted, the BIGGEST superpower in American politics apparently), which is an advantage they also bring to Valkyrie. But the political system in America is DESIGNED, admirably, to make "politician" not much of a munchkin job (if it were, Indian Quirrell's assessment of munchkinry as a "tyrant"'s mindset gets really literal). Most politicians, even popular ones (a useful quality for winning elections and jack shit else), do not accomplish anywhere near as much as Valkyrie could if well-organized and successful. And there's no indication that her powers OR personality are optimized for politics at ALL - if anything, the opposite - whereas Valkyrie at least does draw on skills (organizing a cape team) she already has.
