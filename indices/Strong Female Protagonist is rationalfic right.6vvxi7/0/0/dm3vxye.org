I agree that the organization she ends up building is not the highest-utility application of superpowers, but I also don't think it was supposed to be. I think it's meant to be a critical stage in her development, but not her "final form." The "rational" aspect of it is her realization that she can accomplish her goals more effectively by networking with other capes, rather than by trying to independently punch the world's problems to death with a powerset that's not really equipped for effecting large-scale change. She has a long way to go, but she's making progress by correcting that flaw in her approach.

The actions of the character you refer to in the second paragraph are certainly disturbing, but they are not portrayed as heroic in the narrative. They're a reaction to a systemic injustice, sure, but a misguided and self-defeating one. That character is the /antagonist/ of her chapter; she's not portrayed as a wholly unsympathetic sadistic cartoon of a villain, but SFP's antagonists rarely are. She comes across as a foil to the protagonist, an example of what she might become if she gives in to her impulse to solve problems with violence.
