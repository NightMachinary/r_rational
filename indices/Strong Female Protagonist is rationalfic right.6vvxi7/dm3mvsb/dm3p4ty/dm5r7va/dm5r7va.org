Rape has a third characteristic: It has a high false accusation rate, and the fact that it may not leave evidence (especially when there is dispute over whether someone consented) makes it convenient to use for false accusations. And that characteristic makes vigilante justice against accused rapists particularly bad compared to vigilante justice against other crimes.
