Do you have a source on that? Everything I've read says that the false accusation rate for rape is roughly the same as the false accusation rate for other crimes. I'm pretty sure the false accusation for rape only appears to be higher if you assume that all acquittals and dismissed cases were false accusations--which of course is an unjustifiable assumption, since there frequently isn't enough evidence to convict in cases of actual rape.
