  ... This looks a lot like a sealion. (if you do not know what that is, it is a deliberate attempt to waste peoples time by asking excessively basic or "what-about" questions. )

And this looks like a passive aggressive insult. /quirks a brow/ Let's lay off the assumptions.

I questioned you because you presented bad, irrational arguments. It doesn't matter if I agree with your position; your arguments undermined the point you were trying to make. It doesn't make your point wrong, but don't expect people to be convinced by those arguments.

Also, like I said: not American. I come from a vastly different culture and have very high expectations of safety and police standards. It's very difficult for me to believe that people can act so callous because it's in direct contrast with how things are here.

So let's get to your example. And let me get this out of the way first; what you describe is /awful/.

What should we do instead?

I don't have a stance in this debate because I don't know what we're debating. I address arguments that I think are bad and I addressed yours in particular because the other response to you was... I mean, they weren't even bad arguments, they were just factually incorrect.

So yeah. False rape allegations exist. We don't have the exact numbers, but let's presume it's small. Are you saying the procedure should then take the word of the victim and adopt a guilty until proven innocent mindset? Or is there a better solution?
