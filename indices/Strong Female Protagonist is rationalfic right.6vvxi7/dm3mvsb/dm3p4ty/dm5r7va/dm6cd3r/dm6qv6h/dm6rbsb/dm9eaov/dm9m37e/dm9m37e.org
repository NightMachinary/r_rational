... This looks a lot like a sealion. (if you do not know what that is, it is a deliberate attempt to waste peoples time by asking excessively basic or "what-about" questions. )

But yes, people are routinely total scumbags to women who report rapes. Not just individually, systemically too.

Let me use the example that boils it down to its essence. In order to get a conviction of rape, you really need a rape kit. Do you know what a rape kit involves? It is a checklist and a set of containers for samples.

In order to do a proper rapekit, the person who just got violently assaulted needs to get up, and go /directly/ to a medical facility. Do not take a shower, do not change your clothes. Then you have to tell a complete stranger- a medical professional, but still a stranger. That you were just raped, and you still have your attackers DNA all over you. Then that professional will /take your clothes/ - because those are now evidence. Count your bruises and the location of them. Including the ones you almost certainly have in intimate areas (.. vaginas dont bruise during consensual sex.) And oh yes, take scrapings from everywhere there might be secretions left. It is, even with the nicest doctors possible, not a good time.

And you know what then happens in a lot of US states? Those kits just sit around and never get tested. Because there has not been allocated enough money to run dna scans on them. This, while politicians proclaim their devotion to law and order.
