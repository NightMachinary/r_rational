it's not a statement about the typical man we are considering -- it's the perception of the average woman.

it doesn't matter to the woman if the man who attacks her is a repeat offender or not. the rate of risk remains the same. she has a 20% chance of being attacked. this is certainly high enough to warrant some trepidation and caution. The odds of dying from an injury -- any injury -- is 1 in 20. 4 times less than being sexually assaulted. So, viewing any strange man in a situation that has ANY potential for leading to an attack with suspicioun is more than justified.
