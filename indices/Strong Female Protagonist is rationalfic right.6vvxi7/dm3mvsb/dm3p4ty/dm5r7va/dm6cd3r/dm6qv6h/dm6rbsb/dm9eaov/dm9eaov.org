My objective here is to maintain a rational perspective, for the record. I'm not taking a stance on this issue yet.

  And, frankly, go watch court tv.

I'm not American and I couldn't find much information on court TV - just something about how truTV used to be called Court TV.

But is television really a good source? There's an inherent bias here - any material that's worth being televised must have a story. It's hardly going to show you the boring court cases, or the court cases where nothing really happens, or the court cases where it turns out someone was lying all along.

  Most rapes dont go to court because women damn well know the defense council will try to make them out to be a lying slut.
#+end_quote

Is this what happens? I'm honestly asking. The defense council's job is to present a defense. Whatever defense they present must be supported with evidence.

Or rather, what I'm asking is, what exactly does the defense council do? If they're presenting the possibility that the woman may have lied, that's what they're supposed to do. If they deliberately belittle and try an emotional argument to make the woman seem like a lying slut, then that's awful. But the two are very different things and deserve a distinction.

  The police very frequently do the same thing before things go to court. And every woman on earth knows this is what happens.
#+end_quote

Do they? Again, it's important to draw a line between trying to establish the facts of the case and actually shaming the victim. Why and how is this established as a fact? I'm sure there are policemen that are awful about it, but I'm equally sure that there are policemen that are sensitive about the subject. It's a traumatic thing.

#+begin_quote
  Nobody sane files those charges without cause. Apply some theory of mind. Would it be worth it to you? No? I did not think so.
#+end_quote

I don't think this is a rational argument. Someone who makes a false accusation is a criminal to begin with - they've clearly already thought it through and decided it's worth it. Applying the average person's mindset to it is like asking the average person if stealing or murder would be worth it - most people would say no, because most sane people aren't criminals.

There are examples of women who falsely accuse others, including one who falsely accused fifteen men. I don't have the source with me at the moment since I'm stuck on mobile, but I'd be happy to get some sources if you'd like to continue this discussion.

Somewhat more horrifyingly, there's also precedent of false memories being created by unethical therapists or psychologists. This is perhaps the worse case of all - the trauma is real, and the victim certainly believes it's real, but the perpetrator is still innocent. I believe the study done for false memories was a female scientist. Again, I'll grab the sources if you'd like to make this a discussion.

#+begin_quote
  The only reason women elect to go through with pressing charges is a desire for justice and the fact that - as I said, rapists reoffend.
#+end_quote

Well, yes, and it's very brave for the victims to do so. That's why false accusers are so bad - they undermine the real victims.

There's one thing I'm genuinely curious about, and it's the clear difference in cultural perspective between me and a lot of others. I live in a very safe country; we have one of the lowest crime rates in the world. I can't conceive of policemen or courts deliberately making fun of and/or putting down victims.

But my question is - how much of that is an exaggeration? Because remember, there's a cognitive bias in place here. Negative memories are a lot more prominent than positive ones, and negative news tends to be a lot more lucrative. If a victim is treated correctly through the court procedures, there's nothing to write about. So you only really hear about it when things go wrong.

Which is to say, how much is the media a reflection of your society, really?
