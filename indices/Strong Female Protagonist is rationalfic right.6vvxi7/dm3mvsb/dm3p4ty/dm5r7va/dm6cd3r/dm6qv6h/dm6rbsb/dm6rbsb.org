You are talking to two people here. And, frankly, go watch court tv. Most rapes dont go to court because women damn well know the defense council will try to make them out to be a lying slut. In front of a room full of people.

That is an extremely unpleasant experience. The police very frequently do the same thing before things go to court. And every woman on earth knows this is what happens. Nobody sane files those charges without cause.

Apply some theory of mind. Would it be worth it to you? No? I did not think so. There is no emotional payoff to sending an innocent to jail, and there certainly is no hope of reputational or financial gain either. The entire reason this is a common perception is due to adversarial courts. The only defense against a testimony of rape is to undermine the credibility of the witness, and therefore approximately all* rape cases end up including a false accusation of perjury.

*Not saying it never happens. Some people are, after all, insane to very high degrees. But to suppose it is common is laughable.

The only reason women elect to go through with pressing charges is a desire for justice and the fact that - as I said, rapists reoffend. A lot. So getting the guy who assaulted you off the street is vital for the safety of all your friends.

Are you unhappy women tend to view you as a potential predator? That is fair. The large dollop of fear which taints a lot of heterosexual dating is not pleasant. Lending camouflage to the actual predators out there is, however, not helpful.
