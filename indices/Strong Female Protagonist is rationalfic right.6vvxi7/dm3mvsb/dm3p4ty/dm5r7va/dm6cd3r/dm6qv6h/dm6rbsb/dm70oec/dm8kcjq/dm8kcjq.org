1) thousands of rape kits go untested. Women are not supported the way you claim. not even sure what "swinging dick" means in this context, but you've clearly got some weird prejudices here. also your numbers are wrong - 40% is for domestic violence victims. One in five women and one in 71 men will be raped at some point in their lives. Not even close to 40%

2) you never provided a source for your "high false accusation" assertion.

3) there's a difference between being afraid of a legitimate threat against your person with a relatively high probability - again one in five women will be raped at some point in their lives - and denigrating/sexualizing women. What even is this argument? It seems to fall back on its own premise.
