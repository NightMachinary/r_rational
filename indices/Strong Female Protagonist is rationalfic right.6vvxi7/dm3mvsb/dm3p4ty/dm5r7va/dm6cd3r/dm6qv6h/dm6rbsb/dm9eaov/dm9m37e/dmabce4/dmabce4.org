  In order to get a conviction of rape, you really need a rape kit.

Lawyer here, you /absolutely do not/.

It is helpful, but almost never mandatory.

You are being misled by popular culture, movies, and hearsay on the internet. A majority of sexual assault cases are won without direct physical evidence of rape, because a vast majority of sexual assault cases are not about violent assault (what is legally termed rape in many jurisdictions, although the term has caught on socially to mean everything related to sexual assault) but sexual assault in either an existing relationship, related to intoxication or drug use, or by someone either related to or well known by the victim.

The big public cases are stranger rape, but that is not what the reality is for the majority of victims.
