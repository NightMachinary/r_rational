I think it depends on the precaution--there are people who will basically expect women to hide in a locked basement every night. At some point you have to draw a line in the sand and say "I'm willing to accept this much risk in order to have a life." But /reasonable/ precautions shouldn't be discouraged, yeah. Certainly nobody should be like "why didn't you..." after someone is raped, but it would be foolish to discourage precautions in advance.
