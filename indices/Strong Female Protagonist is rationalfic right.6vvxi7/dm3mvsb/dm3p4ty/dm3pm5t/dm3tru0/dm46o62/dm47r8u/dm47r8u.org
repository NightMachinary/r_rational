  By contrast, look at how the MCs most controversial action is treated. She... bent a libertarian's arm once. That's all she did, and everyone lost their shit. She couldn't sleep, and literally threw up in disgust of herself. People in the audience reviled her for it. Seriously, I mean, what?

FUCK that was so frustrating. [[#s][spoilers and ranting]]

Of course there were plenty of people taking the opposite side too. But I guess the lesson here is to keep the comments section well divorced in our minds from the actual story, because there's always going to be some real infuriating shit in there.

I will say I don't really see much celebration of that other character's actions these days. The readership seems to largely agree that she was wrong. I think the composition of the audience might just have been different at the time those pages were posted.

I suspect that there's not much crossover between "people who think the other character's actions were good" and "people who think Alison's actions were evil." A lot of the "Alison is evil" rhetoric I've seen has gone so far as to accuse those who /don't/ condemn her of being social justice warriors, for defending the "torture" of a cishet white man.
