I'm not denying that I have my biases, but I think I'm more aware of them than that, Vulcan. I very much appreciate the difference between social justice and SJWs (note I never used the term SJW in my comments) and am grateful for anyone who is still capable in this day and age of making their arguments in a reasonable and rational manner, which clearly includes the authors of this very well-made comic! Nevertheless I still take issue with some of their object-level beliefs (which I'll agree I could have steel-manned better).

Regarding those object level beliefs: You seem to be referring to the case where the MC got angry at the mob that threatened Feral. I haven't discussed this issue (I was talking about Moonshadow) but I found that to be totally reasonable and understandable, and don't blame the MC for killing that one person in the slightest. The thing that made me uncomfortable was the disturbing torture-fantasy played out against suspected rapists, which I don't think is unreasonable.

Anyway, I remember you liking my story, Scar's Samsara, which also touches upon some issues of social justice. Surely I wouldn't be able to write about that in a favourable light if I were "fooled as much as any true believer"?

Edit: I have added a disclaimer to my OP to make it clear that I'm not just bashing the comic.
