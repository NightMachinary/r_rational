Honestly I think you are probably noticing your own confusion somewhere in your mind and then ignoring it. You think reading the comments MIGHT have biased you? I think if you're even worrying about that at all then you should steelman the hell out of that. Honestly, wanting and threatening to kill the angry mob that is trying to incite violence against one of your best friends is wrong, but it's not unprovoked like twisting a random guy's arm AND kidnapping him in order to save one of your best friends from endless torment. While the latter is more defensible from a utilitarian stand point, it isn't as relatable to the emotions of humans who don't intuitively understand scope. I will repeat myself: By treating social justice and social justice warrior ideology as equivalent, you are letting yourself be fooled by social justice warrior ideology just as much as any true believer, and in the process seriously misrepresenting a great work of literature. REVERSED STUPIDITY IS NOT INTELLIGENCE.

Also I would like to add that i myself am an aspiring rationalist and I am also a big fan of SFP and do not think any more highly of the SJW movement then you do
