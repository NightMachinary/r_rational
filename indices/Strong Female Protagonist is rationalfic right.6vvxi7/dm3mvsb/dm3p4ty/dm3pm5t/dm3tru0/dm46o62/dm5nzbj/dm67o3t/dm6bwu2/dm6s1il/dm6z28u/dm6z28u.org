I take the comic's numbers as accurate in-universe, but I don't know how accurate they are in real life. I do know that it's true that women are disproportionately likely (compared to men) to be killed by intimate partners and ex-partners.

Re: "More effective than eliminating invisible supernatural serial killers?"--Well, yes, that's what I'm saying. Moonshadow's scary, but she was ultimately killing only a handful of people. Alison has realized that there are more serious, systemic issues that are more broadly harmful even if they aren't as spectacular. As for the deterrence effect--she's tried being a photogenic hero fighting villains for years, and by the start of the comic she'd come to the conclusion that it didn't fix anything. I agree that fear causes a lot of harm and expense, but either Mega Girl wasn't enough to alleviate it, or Alison hasn't made that connection yet. (I do agree that making a lot of money to fund women's shelters would be more effective, but it's probably valuable for Alison to learn all the skills that go into building an organization like this from the ground up--especially anything in the area of negotiation and diplomacy.)

I don't think the comic really treats Moonshadow's and Alison's actions one way or another--I don't think it passes a value judgment. I think /Alison/ treats the acts differently, for understandable reasons. On the one hand she's reacting to the actions of an old friend she knows she's treated badly, whose descent into villainy she feels responsible for. Whereas on the other hand she's reacting to /her own/ actions--actions that created cognitive dissonance because they violated what she thought was one of her core principles. If Alison had slashed a rapist's throat open, she surely would have thrown up, etc the way she did after hurting Max.
