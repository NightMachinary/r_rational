PoC is very much an American SocJus term, and the socks would very much like it if everyone just assumed their point of view was accepted as the default by everyone else. That little bit of ironic imperialism.

The rest of the world, most of whom are just a little less obsessed with skin color and a little more obsessed with cultural identity and who stole whose goat fifteen generations back, just use a simple descriptor of someone's skin (if it ever comes up at all). You don't have black Russians, brown Germans, or purple French. You just have a Russian man (who happens to be black), a German woman (who happens to be brown), and a French Canadian (who happens to be purple).

Only in America is so much importance ascribed to one's melanin count, and only the socks want people to make up special words reserved for people of a certain phenotype.

Just say (whatever) person. I've never seen someone get offended at being referred to by their factual phenotypical descriptor (unless you use it as part of an insult, I. E. "Hey, big nose!" or something).
