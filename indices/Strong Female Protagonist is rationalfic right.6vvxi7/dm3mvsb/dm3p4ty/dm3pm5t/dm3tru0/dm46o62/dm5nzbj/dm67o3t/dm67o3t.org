To be clear: I'm not that sure either. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if there was a POC among her victims.

And the comic does show Moonshadow to be in the wrong, so maybe I'm overstating my case a bit here. I don't think the comic is anti-white or hateful of men or anything like that. But I do find something to be incredibly /off/ about a worldview in which building woman's shelters is a logical thing to do for someone with superpowers, hunting and torturing rapists is considered merely controversial, and taking someone's bodily autonomy (bending their arm) is considered to be the worst thing in the world (TM).
