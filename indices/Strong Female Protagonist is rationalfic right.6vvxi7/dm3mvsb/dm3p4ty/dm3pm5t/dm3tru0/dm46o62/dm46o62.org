Hey Vulcan. My impression might be partly coloured by reading the comments to those sections and being particularly dismayed by them. I'll agree with you that SFP is much more even-handed than most SJ stories, and the protagonist does try to be a reasonable and decent human being, which is great. And I do think the story is good and well written.

However, the underlying assumptions of SJ ideology still shines through. What we have here is a character [[#s][tag]], and the protagonist going "You know I can totally see where you're coming from but violence is not the solution." Imagine, instead, if a white character were shown killing POCs and another white character had that as a reaction. Would that seem reasonable to you?

As @CeruleanTresses put it, this antagonist is put up as a foil to the protagonist - someone who the protagonist could potentially become. It's something meant to inspire the audience to think and go "Huh, do I agree or disagree with this?" However in doing so it places the Overton window to the extreme left, and anchors you to consider anything less extreme than that as normal.

By contrast, look at how the MCs most controversial action is treated. She... bent a libertarian's arm once. That's all she did, and everyone lost their shit. She couldn't sleep, and literally threw up in disgust of herself. People in the audience reviled her for it. Seriously, I mean, what?

Does it not cause any moral dissonance in you, to see these two completely different actions treated in such a completely perverse way?
