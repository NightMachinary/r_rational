It's just one thing that kind of bothers me with SFP. I'm not exactly opposed to the SJ themes, but if we're looking at creating awareness, a lot of domestic abuse victims are men. Like, 40%. And a vast, vast majority of abuse /shelters/ are for women - way out of proportion with the abuse statistics. SFP organizes a women's abuse program, I think, when a program to support and protect /everyone/ would do more to break down the perceived line between men and women.

It's a theme that SFP doesn't seem to touch on very much. In its effort to focus on the strong female, it forgets about the weak male. Or that's what I think, anyway - I could be wrong?
