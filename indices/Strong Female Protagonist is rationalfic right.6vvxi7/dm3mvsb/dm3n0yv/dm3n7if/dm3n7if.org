Not useful? Pah, they make her famous! They give her instant respectability, government support, and social credit. She can go on shows like Oprah and make millions, then donate that money to charitable causes. She specifically notes that, and /whines/ about, the fact that she can get away with murder because the government doesn't want to make her an enemy. And she completely fails to use any of this for good, instead choosing to spend all her time moping about how much she sucks.

On the second point, yes, sure - the author doesn't explicitly paint it as good. But implicitly it's clearly giving voice to a disturbing fantasy. Imagine if it had been a white character hunting and killing black characters instead - methinks this would have been presented in a less sympathetic light.
