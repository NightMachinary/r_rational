On the first point, I think the idea in the story for the reason she doesn't munchkin her powers is that they really aren't useful for anything. Low-grade Superman powers are pretty meh. She'll probably go into politics eventually, but she is pretty young.

On the second, I think that isn't supposed to be a good thing. The author is exploring the idea that giving out superpowers to people from underprivileged groups will obviously upset power structures.
