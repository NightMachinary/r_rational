As a counter to your points, I would like to remind you of what happened to Feral. She may not munchkin her own powers, but she's well aware of the power of munchkinery. It's even better since she's well aware of the moral issues with how she did it - and I'm pretty sure that she's going to be seeing fallout further down the road.
