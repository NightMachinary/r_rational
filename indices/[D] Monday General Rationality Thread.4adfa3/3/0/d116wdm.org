  Am I missing the whole point of fiction by wanting to know what happens "after?"

Well the thing is, that once everything is perfect the interesting-ness of the story kinda... dies. Writers are aware of this and tend to avoid the whole shebang, because obviously they want to write compelling stories and perfect worlds are pretty boring. I'm sure there are quite a few stories set in perfect worlds that exist, but most of them are terrible for the aforementioned reasons. If you want to make a story like that work you generally have either be a really, really good writer, (like mister banks) or tell a story at the edges where the utopian society interacts with a non-utopian society. A couple stories you might enjoy:

I really love this story by the way, just because it gets so many details /right/.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/to-the-stars-puella-magi-madoka-magica.3927/][To the Stars:]] by all accounts humanity would have things pretty good in this one as well what with all their massively upgraded bodies and well managed system of AI, if it weren't for the invading space cephalopods. Luckily, they have puella magi on their side.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cruel-to-be-kind-si-multicross-thread-iv.310606/][Cruel to be Kind:]] self insert uses dimension hopping power to create multidimensional space empire. Gives populace replicators, universal basic income and 400 year lifespans. Fights wars with various other polities for convincing reasons. Avoids mass uploads and nanobots, but otherwise makes things very nice for the populace.
