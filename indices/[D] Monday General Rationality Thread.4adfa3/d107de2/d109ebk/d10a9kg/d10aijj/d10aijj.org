  And using taint interpretation, you just need to cast some good spells to offset casting evil ones.

I'm not entirely certain this would be true. If you take a piece of metal and bend it back and forth many times, you aren't simply changing the state of the metal in a binary sense. All the bending heats the metal and eventually, the metal breaks.

One could probably make a similar argument about alignment. If you flip-flop alignment too often due to actions you perform, you might go insane.

That's definitely how I'd run it as a DM.
