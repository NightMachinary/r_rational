Well, there are ways around it but Animate Dead usually costs money. Is your other spell homebrew? It's been a while, so I don't remember how easy it is to get around, but for most characters it's 25gp per hit die, I think. Which makes it not worth it when it's just an added precaution and you don't expect anyone to try to raise the corpse, and for important NPCs the higher level resurrection spells don't care whether the body has been animated/is present/still exists.

As for Alignments, since the written rules dictate that alignment spells do eventually change your alignment, I headcanon it as a kind of Wheel-of-Timeish 'taint' that seeps into you a little bet every time you use Evil spells. Altough I suppose there are also Good, Lawful and Chaotic 'taints', but... Those alignments don't get very many great spells.
