Is animate dead really that great of a spell in terms of cost-effectiveness? 250 silver pieces is enough to hire an untrained hireling for 250 12-hour days of labor. Granted, a Skeleton or something could work all night as well, so after 4 months it would have been cheaper to use Animate Dead than to hire a laborer.

There are times when something like a Skeleton could be useful-- for example, working underwater-- but just hiring people do to stuff works well, doesn't require magic, won't piss off any local governments, and isn't Evil (assuming you work with alignment stuff).

If your goal is, for example, to build a castle, this kind of task takes 5-10 years. It's hard to make it go much faster due to logistical limitations dealing with medieval-era construction tools. Assuming it takes 500 workers 5 years (let's say 2,000 work days) to make a castle, we're talking 1,000,000 sp, or 20,000 gp-- the cost of a +3 sword. This isn't counting the cost of having some builders and master builder + carpenter like people in there, but it should be a reasonable estimate.

If you're a level 9 wizard casting animate dead, you can control up to 36 HD of skeletons, or 36 workers. It would take a /long/ time for 36 workers to put in 1,000,000 worker-days of effort.

Of course the real moral of the story here is that wizards have a [[http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/stoneShape.html][lot]] of [[http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/wallOfStone.html][spells]] that are the same level as Animate Dead that let you do great things. You can always [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/geas-quest#lesser][convince]] someone powerful to help you out and lend you labor.
