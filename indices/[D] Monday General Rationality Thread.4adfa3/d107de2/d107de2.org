Some time ago (during preparation to our slowly-ongoing DnD campaign) we had a discussion about Animate Dead. I pointed out that this spell offers cheap manual labor (almost free, if I will be able to cast it with no material component by applying different spell). GM said that this spell is Evil, and my Chaotic Good character shouldn't aim to use it. We discussed what exactly makes the spell evil, and it turned out that it directly affects souls. This is experimentally testable - if you Animate Dead someone's corpse, you can't raise him from death.

This prevents truly Good charracter from using Animate Dead for manual labor (or tactical advantage), but makes it most convenient resurrect-denier. And that's kinda important. In fact, any self-respecting wizard should have all his slain enemies Animated, and their skeletons lying in Bag of Holding. There could even be organizations offering Animating and keeping watch over resulting undead.
