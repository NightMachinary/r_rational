That rules abuse is useful for an order like "act like a piece of machinery" which will let you turn skeletons into mechanical computer components or land-based waterwheel drivers. This is definitely a use for skeletons that you couldn't use hirelings for.

A lot of this depends, by the way, on what will cause everyone involved in this campaign to have fun. In the campaign I'm running, the party is basically bringing 20 level 1-3 NPCs with them everywhere they go. The campaign is mostly focused on organization-building, gathering influence, making allies, and dealing with internal intrigue with these NPCs. This is what people find fun, so it's good. There's nothing rules-wise preventing a player from introducing a bunch of skeletons or abandoning an NPC or something, but as a PC before you take an action you want to make sure it won't ruin other people's fun. A PC having a spat with an NPC apprentice could actually be great RP, done right.
