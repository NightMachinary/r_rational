The big advantage of using skeletons for labor is that they don't require logistical support. Additionally, depending on the reading of the Rules as Written, "they follow the last order given" may mean that they follow it forever, in which case you can basically ignore the control limitations by issuing an order and then detaching from the skeleton. I've seen this done to build computers - rat skeletons do nothing for boolean zero and raise their tail for boolean one, then each rat skeleton's orders are a boolean function of the other rat tails they can see.
