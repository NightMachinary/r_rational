We're actually playing Pathfinder, and my other spell is in the rules. It's called [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blood-money][Blood Money]], and it's ridiculously broken. Anyway, Animate Dead on humans or other PC races produces 1 HD undead, which means by 7th level it's cheap even with proper cost. Storage is probably more expensive, unless you already have proper dungeon.

Anyway, the thing is that even higher level spells care about your body being animated. At least in [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resurrection][Pathfinder]], and it seems even in the usual [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/trueResurrection.htm][3.5 Edition]]. And, considering that 5000 gp is a pittance on higher levels, this really makes Animate Dead very handy if you really want that warlord/tyrant/dark mage or any other villain to stay dead.

And using taint interpretation, you just need to cast some good spells to offset casting evil ones.
