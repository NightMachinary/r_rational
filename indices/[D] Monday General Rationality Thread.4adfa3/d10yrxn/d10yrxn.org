I've read just about all the rational fiction I can get my hands on. Light spoilers since my thoughts here deal with "the end" of these works in general.

I've read Nearly everything on this list: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3f9gly/list_of_stories_similar_to_hpmor/]] I noticed a trend, they end right at the part I most want to see. The characters meet, decide to optimize the world, struggle to overcome all sorts of cool obstacles, figure out a way to defeat the bad guy, or develop a friendly AI, or cure death aaaaaaannnnnnd done. No exploration of what comes next!

Don't get me wrong, I love all the stories that detail the lead up to humanity taking that leap into the unknown and presumably utopian future but it would be cool to have a story that takes place */in that world/*. Reading the culture series is the closest I've seen to this kind of setting. Are there others? A bluer shade of white is a great example of coming really close, giving a tease of things to come that sound like a fantastic untold story.

Are there just no compelling stories to be told in a utopia? Am I missing the whole point of fiction by wanting to know what happens "after?"
