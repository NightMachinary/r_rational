Well, there are no denying in LoL, but yes, well-optimized bots that can dodge every dodgeable projectile and chain disables perfectly could be very dangerous if they had bare minimum of strategic ability. There are tools that assist human players in such ways (they are called scripts), and they are strongly prohibited in part due to efficiency.
