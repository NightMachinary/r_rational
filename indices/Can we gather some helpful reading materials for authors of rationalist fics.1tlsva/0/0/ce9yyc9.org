[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/][The Fun Theory Sequence]] might be particularly useful for a writer interested in science fiction or fantasy writing. It's a guide on how to build Utopia where people would actually want to live for a long time. Friendship is Optimal was partially guided by these rules. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/][Building Weirdtopia]] is especially interesting.

Of course, before you can write *good* rationalist fiction you have to first know how to write so maybe [[http://www.amazon.com/Self-Editing-Fiction-Writers-Second-Yourself/dp/0060545690/ref=tmm_pap_title_0][general "how to write" self help books]] might be more useful. That said, there's nothing stopping you from learning how to write by writing rationalist fiction.
