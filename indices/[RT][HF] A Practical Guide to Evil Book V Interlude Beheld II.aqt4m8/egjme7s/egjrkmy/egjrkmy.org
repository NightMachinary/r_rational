To be fair, Cat has been out of the field. Over a year's time, iirc - that can be a lot in a war. Considering where she was last spotted (near Keter), I wouldn't be too surprised if people started assuming her to be dead after a couple months. Besides Masego (also missing from the front) most of her remaining subordinates are not exactly spectacular in the way she is on the field of battle. I don't think the Callowans under Cat have clashed directly with Levantine forces before either (edit: The main army at least. Not counting Peregrine & co. considering they tend to act alone and have inscrutable motivations).

Under these conditions, I don't think it would be unreasonable for a commander to assume that Cat's exploits have been overblown or exaggerated. If they had any idea that she was coming for them beforehand, I think this would have been a definite plothole. But as it stands they have no reason to spend resources finding info on an enemy they have no idea is alive, let alone present on the battlefield.
