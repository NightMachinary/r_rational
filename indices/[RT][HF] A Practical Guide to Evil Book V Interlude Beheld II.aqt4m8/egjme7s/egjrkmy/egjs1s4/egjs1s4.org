Yeah, this is the age before internet and these people hear rumors of crazy shit all the time, even if some of it is true why would he believe that she "tamed" the mythical-themselves fae that almost no one ever interacted with, let alone cooperated with, and that they support her by riding flying horses into battle.

I mean, from an outside perspective Cat is kind of BS. Black Knight's secret daughter, never defeated in battle, binds fae, fights demons hand-to-hand, /bullied a fucking angel into resurrecting her/. There is a limit to how much impossible shit you can accept even about a Named, and Levant is about as far away from Callow as you can get, in an age before phones.
