I am getting a little tired of the "those stories must be exaggerated so I'm going to ignore them" trope, in this and other fictions. The other side is supposed to have competent leaders, and Named apparently have all sorts of powers. Why doesn't even a single enemy commander have a hero at their disposal whose power is to accurately witness / record / retell events? Or, more mundanely, some commanders they trust enough to take at their word? Given either of those, how is there not a direct line of information down from the top to various levels of command ranks below them? Sure, you don't want to give the rank and file nightmares, but that doesn't mean the generals shouldn't know exactly what they are up against, down to lieutenants and captains having at least /some/ accurate intel. Surely the scarier parts could be spun to be less intimidating. It seems stupid to send your forces into battle not knowing that the enemy commander is capable of dropping a lake on them, so they should avoid engagement on bowl-shaped terrain if that commander is known to be present.
