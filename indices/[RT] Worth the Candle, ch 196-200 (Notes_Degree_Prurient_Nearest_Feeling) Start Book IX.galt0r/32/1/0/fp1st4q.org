It does some things well and other things pretty poorly (a not-insignificant amount of the humor is derived from 'OMG d&d so nerdy' and d&d-based double entendres mixed with a healthy dose of bad communication). If you like the D&D-as-therapy aspect of WTC, you'll find things to love in here. A lot of the moments between the sisters are genuinely touching, and occasionally fucked up (in a good way imo but ymmv).

On the whole, I'd say I prefer WTC by all but two metrics and one of those metrics is just 'time required to enjoy'.
