  That's honestly impressive. People still reading Pact during stressful times. I love the book, but my god is it so fucking depressing. No piece of media has given me so much anxiety.

Yeah, I had started reading Pact, but couldn't take the constant escalation of tension and quit. Hardly a moment to rest or regroup, just diving head-first into crisis after crisis. I feel stressed just thinking about it.
