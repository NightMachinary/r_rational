Chapter 2:

  (I won't belabor my physical description. My friend Greg had once said that I looked like someone had chosen ‘default' for every option in the character creator, which I'd tried to laugh at but cut kind of deep. I wasn't handsome, I wasn't ugly, none of my features were very prominent, my eyes were blue, my hair was brown, average build, average height ... After Greg had made his comment at one of our D&D games, my nickname had been ‘default' for a while, at least until I stopped pretending to find it funny, and even after that my friends would use similar lines to trash talk me, saying that I was “the most generic man alive”, “a white bread with skim milk $@#$!$#!”, or “the human equivalent of vanilla ice cream”. Not that I was any less of an asshole to them.)
