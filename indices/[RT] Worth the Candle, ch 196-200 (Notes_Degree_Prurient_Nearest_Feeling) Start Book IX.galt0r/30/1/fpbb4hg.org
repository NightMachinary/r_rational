Further, how did they fix Joon? Did they fix him? It says in this batch that he decided to stay "as he was", which I interpreted as meaning that he stayed an amputee, but it doesn't make much sense. Can they use the backups to fix missing limbs? I would assume that required both a high enough level in Soul Magic and the creation of Magic material, which we are told cannot happen. So I'm confused on several fronts.
