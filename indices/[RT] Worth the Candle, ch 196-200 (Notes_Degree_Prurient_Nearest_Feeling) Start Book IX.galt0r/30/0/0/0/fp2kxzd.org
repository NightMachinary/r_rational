  Magic generally didn't produce more magic, with a few exceptions. If you cut off a finger, it was really hard to find a magic that would regrow those bones (though it was relatively easy to heal a broken bone back together). If you lost blood, you needed a donor, or you needed to replenish it naturally on your own. Skin was a little more permissive than bone or blood, but it was apparently hard to find a magic that would help you recover from flaying. This was because bone, blood, and skin weren't just physical things, they had latent magic.

This is from chapter 101, though the skin thing obviously isn't true now. Grak went without a hand for his initial months in the time chamber because to actually grow missing bones back, even if the soul is fine, takes something beyond what Joon has available to him through bone, blood, and fairy healing. Maybe replacing a lost eye would have just taken a little bit of extra time that they didn't feel like spending, but the lost limbs needed something special.
