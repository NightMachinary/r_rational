BitB is alive through magic, because he would have died a while ago if not for that. Grak has warder's sight, and warder's sight is both common enough to be widely known, and would in most cases notice a living human suffused with necromantic magic immediately. It's a good thought but I don't think it works out practically even disregarding what BitB would hope to gain from a Gambit like that.
