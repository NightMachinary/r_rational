Something needs to be said about what a brilliant idea it was to have chapter 198 revolve around prepping for the marriage inspector. That did so much to enable such a deeply rich scene.

It meant you could seamlessly integrate:

- A mini-recap of their early relationship,

- The topic of Fenn (and the little bow that could be tied on that hampering Joonaryllis),

- A look at a “what-could-have-been” timeline,

- The issue of Maddie and adding both additional insight into that situation as well as exploring how it's currently affecting Joon's perception of his relationship with Amaryllis,

- The roleplaying conceit and the obfuscation it allows which makes the exploration of all these issues much more natural and much less awkward

Imagine trying to cover that much ground that efficiently and that elegantly and with that much feeling when it's a scene with the characters sitting down and just deciding to have a deep conversation. The marriage inspector angle enriched it all so much.

And outside of that there's all the other humour and callbacks and just all-round fantastic character writing that had the chapter feeling so tense, heartfelt, titillating and bittersweet.

Loved it.
