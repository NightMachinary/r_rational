My pet theory for a long time has been that Fenn will come back in a way tied to Bluebottle. When this quest was brought up by Perisev she speculated about Joon developing "new magic" which would be the last thing to confirm (to her) that he's the new Uther. Bluebottle has his own specific and excluded brand of necromancy which I feel is going to tie in somehow, maybe it counts as bringing someone halfway back from the dead or something, and then another form of magic finishes the process.

And now we're finally at the bottle episode, so I get to find out how on/off the mark I was.
