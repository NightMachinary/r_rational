  “The least rigidly defined are the most susceptible,” said Grak. “Reimer said that defining the letter A as B took five degrees of reasonableness.” I tried to think about what six or seven degrees would look like, and instantly understood: defining A as 1 would be six, and defining A as banana would be seven.

Putting on my contrarian hat, I think defining A as 1 is far more reasonable than defining A as B.

Consider the case of three boxes, labelled A, B and C. In this case its very easy to argue that these letters are a number system - first, second, third - 1, 2, 3. A = 1, B=2, C=3.

On the other hand, I'm finding it had to think of any case where A=B.
