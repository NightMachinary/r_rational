I felt the same way about A as 1 at first, but I think it was meant to be a metaphor, and that Degrees of Reasonableness are all about *â‰ˆ* rather than =.

- "A" and "B" are on the same scale, and very close together. An Entad working only on A wouldn't need too much adjustment to work on B.\\
- "A" and "1" only have a symbolic relationship, but are more separate as concepts.

Like a "chair" and a "table", versus a "chair" and "the act of sitting".
