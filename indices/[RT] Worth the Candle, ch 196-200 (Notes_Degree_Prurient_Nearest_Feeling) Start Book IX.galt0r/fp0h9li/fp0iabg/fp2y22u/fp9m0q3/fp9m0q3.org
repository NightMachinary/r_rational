In terms of actual quests, we still have a fair number, plus magic like star magic. DnD level-wise, you're effectively a god at level 20, and Juniper is nearly at that point, but it's a long way to go before his power are 'natural' rather than dependent on souls (and side note, I'm glad that the unicorn bones were addressed in text- for a limited resource, they're sure getting used very liberally). Last time that everything was explicitly listed out was Chapter 138 Stats for Nerds II. It's not guaranteed that all of these will be addressed by the end, or that Fel Seed will be the final arc. I don't know what else will be done with Fenn, the elves, and her canceled quest. Let me know if I missed any quests below- The quest list hasn't changed all that much.

God Botherer

The Lost King, Found? - only thing of note is that the five other dream skewered who arrived around the same time as Arthur were mentioned as being relevant to this quest.

Through the Lashing Glass- a separate exclusion zone for some reason, which made me think they might tackle it earlier. Even the Risen Lands was an exclusion zone, although it was low level/the dangers came from other people more than the undead.

All 13 Exclusion Zones under Slayer of Horrors. This includes Fel Seed, Captain Blue, and Doris Finch. It includes areas that have had tangential topics brought up in passing, like the elves' Celestar research and the immortal farming guy brought up in this batch. It includes areas that haven't been brought up at all since first being introduced like the Goblin King. I'm particularly interested in A Door Into the Soul, Better with Loops, Guardian of the Underworld, and Finger of the Sun.

Tragedy of the Commons - cross-planar, definitely feels like an endgame quest. Maybe Captain Blue will detonate a void bomb while he's at it, forcing the issue.

Birth of a Nation - can progress over time.

Taking Root - still not complete, even if the locus finally saw some progress. Could still need some time, some additional tasks, or still end in failure.

The Sound of Silence and The Infinite Library quest also never had an explicit "Quest Complete" notification in the text. But the same is true for "They Say You Can't Go Home Again," so I can't tell if these are complete and we just didn't get the message due to inconsistency/the general abstraction of the game layer, or if all of these are /technically/ incomplete plotlines that will come back later. I'm kinda curious about this, because the Anglecynn arc seems "over," Lisi and the clones aside. He's sent out letters to his friends, talked to his mom, and has what he can get of the game notes. There's really nothing left for him if he tries to visit Aerb-Juniper's hometown, so I think the key is the "you had a life, before this." It might not be completed until he really finds out what the world is, if he's actually dead on earth, if he's a simulation, etc. Infinite Library and Sound of Silence definitely have dangling plotlines as well, but again, not sure how relevant they'll actually be.
