This is the first half of a two-part batch, split up because otherwise it would be almost 72K words, which is too much all at once in terms of both reading and editing. The next "half" will be posted Saturday at 8PM Central (or 48 hours earlier if you're an early bird on [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon]]). If you'd prefer, you can think of it as two large chunks of writing in close succession, rather than being 'split': I don't plan to do it again, but it worked out a lot better for me.

AO3 version [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/57405361][is here,]] if you prefer that. Or, if you want, the story [[http://alexanderwales.com/][is now on my website]], with [[http://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-196/][the first chapter of the batch here.]]
