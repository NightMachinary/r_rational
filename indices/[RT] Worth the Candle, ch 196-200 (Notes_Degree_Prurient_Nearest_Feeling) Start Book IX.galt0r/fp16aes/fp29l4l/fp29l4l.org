Other replies already mentioned that Grak would probably have noticed that, but maybe there's some Entad/bullshit interference against Grak's sheer Overpoweredness.

There still might be some other twist, especially if they're going over to /another/ of the 13 Horrors due to this. Maybe they'll reach Doris, find out that she can't locate him, and learn they need to go kill Manifest to understand some other Soul / Necromancy shenanigans...

Then at Manifest's EZ, they'll realize his one true weakness is Farming 100.

Perisev bamboozled them into finishing the side-quests, it's all a DM plot!
