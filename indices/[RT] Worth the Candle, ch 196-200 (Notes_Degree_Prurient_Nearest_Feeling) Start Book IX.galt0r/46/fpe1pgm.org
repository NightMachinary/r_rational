From Chapter 198:

> “I went back on my promise,” I said. “With the Bethel thing. It was spirit, not soul, but ---”

I don't seem to remember this. Has anyone got a reference?

​

Chapter 200:

> And that, really, was what I wanted. I wanted to be done with things.

I was a little bit surprised by this -- Juniper's not enjoying being an adventurer, he wants to end it and go back to being a teenager on Earth?

But later I think he commented that he was planning to end it by becoming a god and doing world optimization. So I guess that seems like a good reason to want to end being an adventurer.
