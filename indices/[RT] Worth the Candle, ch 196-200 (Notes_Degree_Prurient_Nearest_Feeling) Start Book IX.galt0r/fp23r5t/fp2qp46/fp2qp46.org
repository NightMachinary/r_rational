  I hope one of Mary's clones gets to be a druid

Huh. I thought this was ridiculous at first, but this is exactly the kind of fuck-you logic the Locus would employ on a Clone that physically *can't* use magic, desperately wanted to be a Druid but life said she never will be, loves the Locus and their Druid daughter a lot, and wants to do all she can to nurture them and help them grow.

It was even technically foreshadowed on their first meeting with Solace!
