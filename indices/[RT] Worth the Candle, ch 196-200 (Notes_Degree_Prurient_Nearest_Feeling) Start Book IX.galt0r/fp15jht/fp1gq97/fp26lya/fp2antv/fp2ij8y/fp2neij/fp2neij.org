*EDIT:* I'm very wrong. Read [[/u/sicutumbo][u/sicutumbo]]'s reply

+Manifest was a Soul mage that excluded the Capital city of the Second Empire, effectively ending it due to the nature of the exclusion - every living mortal within the exclusion's range became Manifest.+

+IIRC we don't know in what way they became manifest (likely a hivemind, rather than exact clones like Doris?) and how instantaneous it was, but there's some connections to draw here - especially if the 'puppet' we just witnessed actually was directly controlled by Blue.+
