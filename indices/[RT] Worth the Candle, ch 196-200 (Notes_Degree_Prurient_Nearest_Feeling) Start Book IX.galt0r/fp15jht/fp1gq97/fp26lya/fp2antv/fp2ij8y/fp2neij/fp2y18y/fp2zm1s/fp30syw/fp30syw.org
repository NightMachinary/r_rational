Grand names seem pretty common on Aerb, and I wouldn't personally assign too much accuracy to them. IIRC AW had a post a long time ago about what munchkinry you could do with the ability to puppet half of the population in a fairly large area at any one time, which I think was him thinking about Manifest, but other than that we don't have much confirmed information about what Manifest actually does.

Manifest effectively destroyed the Guild of the Essential Soul when he manifested, since he controlled the people there, and him being a soul mage makes the most sense of the magics we've seen, but yeah that's only speculation.
