Making new bones is excluded, which was mentioned when he first sacrificed points to get to Soul Magic 100. Separately, most healing magics, including all the ones they have directly available, can't make bones or even make bone matter where it's missing (Grak had a hole in his head from a void rifle, and the best they could do with bone magic is cover it with skin and restore the brain). If they tried what you're suggesting, I think at best the healing magic would move the flesh around so that there's a cavity where the bone would go.

Druid magic is an exception to the above, because it's an exception to basically every rule, but it's inconsistent if it will do what you want.
