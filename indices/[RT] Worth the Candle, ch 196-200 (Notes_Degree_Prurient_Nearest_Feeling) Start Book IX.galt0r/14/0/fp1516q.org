The thing is, it's all worded in such a way that there are no certainties and there's little guidance towards how to actually use it or abuse it. "You can sweet talk the Layman" sounds good, but what exactly it means isn't entirely clear. The wording makes me think it'll never be a sure bet, though. Likewise, "the map *might* become confused with the territory," with no indication of how you'd make that more likely to happen or what it'd actually look like in practice.

You're not wrong that it's powerful, but it's not the kind of powerful that you can really abuse because it's all so fuzzy and vague and open to interpretation, which is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from the locus. I suspect if you tried to actively explore its limits and find a way to munchkin it, you'd just get a flat "no" in a response.
