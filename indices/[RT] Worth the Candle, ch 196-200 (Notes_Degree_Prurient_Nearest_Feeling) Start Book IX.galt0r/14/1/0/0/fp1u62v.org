Sweet talk the Layman -> "the Layman" is a construction used to decide on interactions between magics. He gets asked simple questions like, "is that a chair?" to decide whether a magic item that makes chairs bigger will work on something.

Otherwise, Reimer would ask, "what's a chair, anyway?", Joon might answer "it has 4 legs and you sit on it" then Reimer would sit on a deer and call it a chair. If you can sweet talk the Layman, you can make an argument why your thing should work, even if it really shouldn't

Map and territory is a LessWrong meme, and I think it's been mentioned before in-story too [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mistaking_the_map_for_the_territory]]

Tldr maps oversimplify and necessarily skip information that might be important. If you can confuse them, then you can take any of the simplifications in the game layer and treat them as though they're the final word. My mind goes to HP and magical healing -- bone magic makes HP go up, but it's been established that it doesn't help with brain damage. If you forget "territory" details like that and use the simple map of HP, maybe now it will fix your brain
