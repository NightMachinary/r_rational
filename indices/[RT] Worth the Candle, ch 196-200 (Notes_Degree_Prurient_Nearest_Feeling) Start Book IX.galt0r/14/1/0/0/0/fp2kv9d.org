The map-territory relation thing pre-dates LessWrong by about eighty years. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation]]

The single best example of the map not being the territory is Ren√© Magritte's painting "The Treachery of Images", which is a painting of a pipe with "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" (This is not a pipe) written below it. The map, after all, is not the territory.
