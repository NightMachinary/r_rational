The discussion of the psychology and ecology of the Hells was fascinating--although one line did stick out to me. If there are the infernal 1%ers out there who have millions of souls that go largely unused...does that mean that there are a lot of souls not actively being tortured? Just...sort of held in limbo waiting until their billionaire demon overlord decides that he wants to torture them in particular?
