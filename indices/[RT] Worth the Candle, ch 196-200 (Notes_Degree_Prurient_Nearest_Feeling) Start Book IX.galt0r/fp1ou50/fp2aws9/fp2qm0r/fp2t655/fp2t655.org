Oh I said that as a joke, but the gist of it is pretty much my main theory for what Aerb is.

Juniper died on Earth, likely through suicide, feeling only despair and hatred for whatever supposed God his universe has. Aerb is his afterlife - or perhaps the journey to it - based on his ideals, his sensibilities and his past.

And if that is correct, the Dungeon Master isn't even necessarily God himself. He's an extension of what Aerb is, materialized from Juniper's feelings about what his callous God is like and his experiences in life as a DM (that eventually became callous to his players with Fel Seed).

Whether there's an actual religious spin on it or if it's all due to Juniper's own beliefs on religion is up for debate.
