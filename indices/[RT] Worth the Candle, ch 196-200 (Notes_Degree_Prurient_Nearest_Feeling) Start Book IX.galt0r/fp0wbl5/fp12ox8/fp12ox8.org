I'm kinda sad that it's looking like we'll never actually meet Aerb Tiffany, given what June said in his letter, but it makes narrative sense. Any interaction with her loses a lot of bite when 1) he's already dealt heavily with Bethel while she was wearing Tiff's face and 2) he's married to Amaryllis. If she was going to become a character in the story, it would have happened before he already worked through a lot of the issues she presents.
