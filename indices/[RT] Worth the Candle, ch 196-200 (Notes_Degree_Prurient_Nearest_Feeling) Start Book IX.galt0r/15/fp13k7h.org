Does Grak have a beard? Because I've always pictured him as being pretty stereotypically dwarfy, which means having a big, bushy, braided beard. If that's accurate, then it definitely impacts the conversations he sometimes has about gender, considering how much of a masculine image that presents.

Actually, that raises another point. How much of the traditions and aesthetics of Aerb's dwarves come from their decision to use masculine pronouns in Anglish? If they'd decided to use female or gender-neutral pronouns instead, would beards be less prevalent among dwarves?
