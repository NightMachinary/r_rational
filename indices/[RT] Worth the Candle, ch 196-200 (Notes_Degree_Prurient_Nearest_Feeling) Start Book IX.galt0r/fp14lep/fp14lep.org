After the seemingly unending spectacle we had in the last couple of chapters this was some very welcome change of pace.

However I'm anxious that we'll get another gut punch soon since things are just going too well - new powers for the group left and right, near unlimited resources, no main character deaths aside from Pallida-ish.

As much as I'd like to get all the answers regarding Fel Seed, Uther etc. I also don't want this story to end anytime soon, I really hope that there still is a lot to come, even though a lot of threads are coming together atm. So many interesting exclusions which we'll likely never see (especially the boy in the time loop and the uber-farmer sound fascinating to me), a shame really.

Also getting those time lines was great, I'm on another reread right now it's not that easy to keep the timeline straight in your head.

Reimer and Lisi were hilarious, as was Amarylis response letter.

The marriage inspection prep. while well written and impactful didn't really land with me - sure keep the relationship drama going but we've been through how they felt for each other a few times now and I couldn't really take it too seriously esp. with all the Anime references.

Moving on, I'm just impressed how good of a character Grak is and how warped my view was due to the format of this being Junipers story. While not caring for him much in the beginning (as our Protagonist) in my reread I notice how much interesting stuff there was way from the beginning.

The Captain was another Highlight and I wonder what tricks he has up his sleeves given that he doesn't seem that powerful right now - for a moment I was even wondering if they'd mirror one of Joons earlier campaigns and just join sides with him (if only for a short time).

But the best part imo were Vals notes on the hells. I mean, they had been introduced as well, hell - but the more we learn the worse it gets. I mean...what the fuck, how many layers of shit do they have? While reading those I had miniature of Tony Benn in the back of my head with this speech [[https://youtu.be/ETqOvBKnKdk?t=146]] those poor poor infernals, also the notes tie in nicely with the Captain arc, economic systems based on suffering, creating a paradise for the very few while even a lot of the exploiters are just reinforcing their own misery. Quite poetic.\\
Still, kill them all.

Ah and one last thing. I really want to always read the chapters as soon as they come out, time zones be damned (they're released at 3am were I live), but yesterday I waited in vein.\\
Yeah, stupidity on my part for not just sleeping the night and reading them when they're released and I have time on hand, but it would still be great if the spreadsheets announcements were with the date.
