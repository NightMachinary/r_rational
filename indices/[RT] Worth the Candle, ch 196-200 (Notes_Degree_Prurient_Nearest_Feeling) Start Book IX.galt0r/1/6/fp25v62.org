Really happy that there's a split.

It's something I've been thinking about even before this absolutely massive batch - splitting it into smaller chunks makes it easier to catch up quickly, easier to discuss / theorize with the community without only focusing on the ending / important bits, and easier to process in general.

I don't know how much it helps / interferes with your particular style of writing, but I'd definitely support future batches being split up around the 15-30k word mark as well!
