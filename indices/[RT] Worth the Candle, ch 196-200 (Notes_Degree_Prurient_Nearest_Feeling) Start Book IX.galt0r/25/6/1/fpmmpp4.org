Bone magic is special, and doesn't get virtues, instead unfolding with more things to tap. If I had to do it over, I probably wouldn't do it that way, but that's how it is. lvl 10 was PHY and sub-attributes, lvl 20 was MEN, lvl 30 was magical powers (mome and unicorn both used in text), and lvl 40 is (currently) undefined.
