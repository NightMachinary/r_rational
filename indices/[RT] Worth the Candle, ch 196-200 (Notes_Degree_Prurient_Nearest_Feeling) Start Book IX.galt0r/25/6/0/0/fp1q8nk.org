Level 30 seems to allow tapping of special abilities from bones, in general (I don't know if that references specic magics or pseudomagic or what)

The relevant text is this:

#+begin_quote
  */Skill increased: Bone Magic lvl 30!/*

  I ignored the message. New levels, new powers, more game bullshit that did nothing good for me. Amaryllis had already made her predictions about what all my skills would give me at their higher levels, cross-referenced with historical notes. Level 30 was either social attributes, luck, or special powers like the one I could already sense was lodged in the unicorn bones.
