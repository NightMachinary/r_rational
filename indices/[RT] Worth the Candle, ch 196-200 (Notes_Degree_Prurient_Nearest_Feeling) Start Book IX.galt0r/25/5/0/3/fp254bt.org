I noticed it prominently while reading, googled it to confirm this was a real thing, but still found it jarring to read after knowing it wasn't a typo; I think the fact that my brain happily parses the word as a normal English word with an unrelated meaning makes it hard to scan. I like Raven having more archaic speech in the abstract, but this particular method breaks the story immersion for me a bit.
