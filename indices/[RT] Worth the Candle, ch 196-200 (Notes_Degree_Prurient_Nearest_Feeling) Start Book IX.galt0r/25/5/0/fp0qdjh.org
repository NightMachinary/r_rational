One of the archaic meanings of "wise" is just "way", which used to get used in a lot of expressions, like "in every wise" or "in any wise". The phrase "in no wise" is now a fixed idiom, somewhat divorced from how the word "wise" has largely lost that meaning. It's most commonly found in older Bible translations, and still archaic, but used here for effect.

... but from the number of corrections I've gotten for that line, maybe it's more archaic than I thought, and just confusing if you don't know the fixed idiom.
