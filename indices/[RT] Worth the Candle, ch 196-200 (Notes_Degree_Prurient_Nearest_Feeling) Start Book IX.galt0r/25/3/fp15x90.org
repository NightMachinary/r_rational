I have a kind of nitpicky typo from chapter 191 since I was rereading it earlier today:

#+begin_quote
  I had the advantage though, because he was fighting with his off-hand and I had more than just a fist, I had my entire body, feet, elbows, and knees as well.
#+end_quote

Technically at this point in the fight, he only has the one elbow, not plural.
