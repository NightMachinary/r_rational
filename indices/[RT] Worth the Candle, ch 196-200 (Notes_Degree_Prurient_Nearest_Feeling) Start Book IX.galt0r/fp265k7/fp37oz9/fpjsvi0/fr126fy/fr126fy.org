If anything, wouldn't that be an argument for soul magic exclusion or against zombie exclusion?

It seems like you could get functionally equivalent loyal zombie armies out of either school of magic. The only meaningful difference between the two is that Captain's zombies are in pain while soul zombies are altered to love what they do. But it doesn't seem like pain is at all related to exclusion (I mean, the Hells exist, after all).

The only meaningful difference I see is that soul magic doesn't let you project your actual self into other bodies, and Captain's magic apparently does. Two of the recurrent causes of exclusion we see are immortality (Fel Seed, Skin Magic, Captain) and uncontrollable feed-forward loops (Glass, computer, Doris Finch).

Soulfucking is actually closer to an uncontrollable growth loop than zombie magic, given that other soul mages can be recruited to the cause. So it must be the immortality aspect of the magic which would cause the exclusion.
