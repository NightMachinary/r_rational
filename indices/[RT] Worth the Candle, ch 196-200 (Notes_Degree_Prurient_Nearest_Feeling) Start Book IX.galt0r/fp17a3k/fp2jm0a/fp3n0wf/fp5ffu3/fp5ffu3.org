my theory is old mate BitB has advanced necromantic magics enough that he can freely swap between zombie bodies without needing a phylactery. You kill 'him' and as long as there is a prepared zombie body nearby, he inhabits the new body. in the end you would need to kill some (all?) of the zombies hes has access too in order to kill him permantly.
