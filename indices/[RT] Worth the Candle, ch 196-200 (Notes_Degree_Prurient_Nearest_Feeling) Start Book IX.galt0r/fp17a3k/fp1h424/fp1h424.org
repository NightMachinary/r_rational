It'd be pretty careless of him, but I guess we don't know that he is cautious.

I was wondering if we'd see another complete upset that compounds on the original "there are actually still people trapped in the bodies" thing. e.g., "the stilted movement of the zombies pretending to work is another layer of pretense and they're capable of all simultaneously and expertly fighting and Captain Blue isn't dead while a zombie remains". Or "he has far more zombies than anyone thought and they've been using void tools to mine further and further, and the exclusion zone continues arbitrarily deep". Or "Captain Blue transferred his consciousness into the dead body of a dragon".
