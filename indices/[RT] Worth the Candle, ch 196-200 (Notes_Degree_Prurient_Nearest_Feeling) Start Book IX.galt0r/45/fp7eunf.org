In this batch we learned a bit about the Mary clones. A few of the details are a bit of a major dealbreaker, or really should be.

- They follow a law of least utility or benefit when deciding between being a human or animated statue for the purpose of interaction with abilities

- they have no souls.

- their combat stats are so low they can be expected to fail most encounters.

- They know everything 0!Mary knows and vice versa, at a temporal resolution of 1 day.

So they're effectively ex anima for the purpose of resisting demonic/devilish posession, and have information that would cause the hells to starting invading (the existence and location of Valencia, as well as the details of her power). The moment a devil rolls a Mary clone for a posession attempt, the hells will attck any wek points they know about.
