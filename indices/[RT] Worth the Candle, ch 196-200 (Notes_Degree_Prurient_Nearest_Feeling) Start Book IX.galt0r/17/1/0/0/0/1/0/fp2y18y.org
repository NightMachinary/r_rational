This isn't really right.

#+begin_quote
  Manifest Destiny - The fall of the Second Empire was, by some accountings, inevitable, but by others, it was the work of a single incident. The exact nature of the magic that allows the immortal man named Manifest to puppet his subjects from a distance is unknown, as is his exact location, but it is clear that with the magic excluded, his range is limited to only Lankwon, once the Imperial City, now the City Made Manifest. Defeating him will be an impossible task, but one that you have taken upon yourself.

The magic Manifest uses is unknown, he puppets other people rather than actually turning them into himself, and he seems to be a single person rather than a hivemind. If he was turning other people into himself, his location would be obvious if somewhat inconsequential.
