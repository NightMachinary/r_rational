Huh, lot's of great stuff here. Good opener to the book and then straight into the action with Blue. Juniper's musing on him make me think that whatever lichdom Blue is exploiting for eternal life damaged his mind. I wonder if he doesn't even have an original body anymore and is just a sort of spread consciousness that can fully puppet any zombie he likes.
