Defining A as B is a single increment in a base-26 system.

Defining A as 1 is the using the first symbol of each, but changing from base-26 to base-10.

The metaphor does start to break down a bit since you could argue that mathematicians switch between base systems all the time, but the gist is valid. 2 degrees of reasonableness means switching between similar but noncompatible systems. Literally apples to oranges.
