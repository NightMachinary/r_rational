I disagree. I won't go into the verbal and nonverbal communication going on between them, but I'll say that, as I read it (and text before and after that scene seems to support this) Juniper had problems with having sex with Mary where sex means *coitus*.

Due to his upbringing, that holds special weight and feels wrong to do if both people aren't super into it. He doesn't seem to feel the same way about kisses (see previous batch) or, apparently, other sexual things that don't involve the coitus.

Edit: (I don't think you should be downvoted into the negatives. I think you're missing on some of the subtext but so could I)
