I didn't suspect these comments to cause me quite so much time spent remembering blowjobs I've given.

At the end of the day, you're describing your enthusiastic consent, which Amaryllis did not have. She had, at best, scientific enquiry in mind and at worst, emotional manipulation for nefarious purpose, none of which Juniper had previously given his explicit consent for. It is a situation unrelated to Amaryllis' sexuality except in so far as it relates to Juniper's requirements for consent.

He said it wasn't fine, he explicitly did not give consent, and every comment so far has told me how this rape is okay because of nebulous things like "it wasn't piv" or "asexual people have sex all the time".

He said explicitly that he was not okay with sex if she didn't get joy from it. No technicality makes it not rape. No other argument matters.
