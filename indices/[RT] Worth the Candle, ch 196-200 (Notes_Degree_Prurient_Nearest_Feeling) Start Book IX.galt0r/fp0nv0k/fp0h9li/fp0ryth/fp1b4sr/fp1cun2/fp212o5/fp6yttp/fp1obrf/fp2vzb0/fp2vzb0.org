Mary literally says the phrase "I'm not going to take an erection as consent", which is pretty explicitly what Bethel did. Joon gave Bethel multiple hard "No"s, and she forged ahead with the sex anyway.

I'm not seeing where she lied, either, unless you want to count the flirty tsundere stuff ("It's not like I like you or anything")
