Ch 199:

#+begin_quote
  she just started out at the bright, shining land
#+end_quote

(Should be 'stared'.)

Ch 200:

#+begin_quote
  one that focused not just on necromancy, but a few other, death-related fields.
#+end_quote

(I could be wrong, but isn't the comma after 'other' extraneous? As it is it's halfway to 'a few other, death-related, fields', which surely isn't what's intended.)
