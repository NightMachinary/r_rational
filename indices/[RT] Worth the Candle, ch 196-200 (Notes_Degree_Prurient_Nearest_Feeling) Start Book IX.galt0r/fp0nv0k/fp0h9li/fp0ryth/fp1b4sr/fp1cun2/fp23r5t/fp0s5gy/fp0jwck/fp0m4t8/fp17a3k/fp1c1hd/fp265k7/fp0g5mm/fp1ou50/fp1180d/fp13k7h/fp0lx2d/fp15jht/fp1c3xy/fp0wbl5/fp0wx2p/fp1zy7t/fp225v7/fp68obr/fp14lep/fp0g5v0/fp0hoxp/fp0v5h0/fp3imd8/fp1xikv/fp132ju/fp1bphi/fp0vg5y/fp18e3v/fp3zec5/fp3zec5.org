Halfway through getting the locus out of the bottle (!!) I was expecting the solution to be Kleining the bottle somehow--redefining its topology so that, at least from the locus's perspective, the inside was also the outside (why don't you put the whole world into a bottle, Superman?). Although that has terrifying implications, including "what if Bethel ate a Klein bottle?"

â€‹

It feels like that 20th point of loyalty was made contingent on the locus being tethered to the land, since there's some difficult-to-patch exploitability otherwise--for example, take the bottle to somewhere that's already an exclusion zone, and further munchkin the already-excluded magic. Find the bloodline magic exclusion zone, put Juniper and Amaryllis in the bottle, and come out with Arthur somehow.
