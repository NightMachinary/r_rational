You know what I just realized? Despite this being my absolute favorite fictional series ever, I don't know what the protagonist looks like.

Somehow, I read through 200 chapters without forming a mental image of Joon.

Is there any part in the story where his appearance is actually described? Cause if so, I sure forgot about it.
