Two quotes from story:

  According to the notes that Reimer had given, the Layman was more of a concept than a person, one which could be ‘instantiated' in different ways, either through DM fiat, through agreement by the players, or by asking a third party who had no or little stake in the outcome. What that would mean on a system implemented in full with more rules, on what was probably a simulation was anyone's guess.

In a D&D context, sweet talking the Layman is convincing everyone at the table (the DM especially) that things should work the way you want.

  “Oh,” I replied. “You mean, why not make it more sensible and change it so that it would mirror reality?” She nodded. “It's a map and territory thing,” I said. “You've got the map, which is a description of reality with baked-in assumptions about that reality, simplifications and shorthands and whatever, and then you have the territory, which is the actual reality itself. So in tabletop games, you have the rules, which are a playable map, and it's totally disconnected from reality, so you start to get it into your head that those numbers are the thing you're talking about, not a representation of them. And from there, you get into the business of number manipulation, rather than trying to simulate reality, in part because fuck reality, reality is boring and lame.”

Joon explains it in terms of tabletop rules, but in the bigger picture, the map is the game (representation of reality); the territory is "reality".
