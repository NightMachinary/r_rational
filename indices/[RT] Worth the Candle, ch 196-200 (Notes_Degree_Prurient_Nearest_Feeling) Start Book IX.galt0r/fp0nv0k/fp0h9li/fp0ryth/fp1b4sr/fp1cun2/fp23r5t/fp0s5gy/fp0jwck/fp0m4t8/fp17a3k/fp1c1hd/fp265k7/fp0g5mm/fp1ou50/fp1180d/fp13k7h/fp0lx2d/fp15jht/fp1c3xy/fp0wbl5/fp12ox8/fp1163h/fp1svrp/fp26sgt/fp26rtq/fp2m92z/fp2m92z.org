It's especially insidious because collecting entad rings is just sensible. For most other entads, like gloves, armor, helmets, even swords and guns to an extent, you can only use one at a time. With the weapons you might be able to switch them out mid combat, but you're not actually going to use two at once. With rings, you can easily use 8 at once at a minimum provided they aren't excessively bulky. We see here that Joon has 4 rings on.
