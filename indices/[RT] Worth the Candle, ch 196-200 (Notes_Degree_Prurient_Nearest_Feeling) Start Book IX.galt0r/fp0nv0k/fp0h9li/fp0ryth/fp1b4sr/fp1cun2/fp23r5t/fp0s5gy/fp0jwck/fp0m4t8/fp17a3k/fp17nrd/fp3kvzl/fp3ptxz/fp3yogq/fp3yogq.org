It makes sense as to the reason he was excluded. We have seen a number of exclusions based around the idea of a single person gaining an ability that would allow them to control or possess the whole Hex. Doris Finch and Manifold (manifest? Can't remember) being the main examples.

So the idea that he has managed to horcrux himself to every single zombie makes sense as to why their creation demanded an exclusion.
