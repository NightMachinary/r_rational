To everyone confused by Pact's rating: it's likely due to the podcast "Deep in Pact", a read along review/discussion podcast for Pact. They joined the Doof! Media group which is relatively well known to Wildbow fans for its We've got Worm/Ward podcasts, so there is a significant group going back and giving it a reread or first read with them.
