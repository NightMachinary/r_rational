Anyone has a collection of all the times Juniper changed how he refers to the Locus? I feel like his complete uncertainty on this matter is pretty much how the Locus would like to be treated lol.

I noticed that in that chapter he uses both it and she, but I'm not sure if that's intentional or not.
