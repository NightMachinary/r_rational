Anyone who reads a lot of classic science fiction gets exposed to map-vs-territory by Heinlein & van Vogt's raging boners for Korzybski. This is how I was first exposed, [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q79vYjHAE9KHcAjSs/rationalist-fiction][as was EY]]. So you're saying there is no more than a 1% chance that AW read much science fiction before encounting the LessWrong community?
