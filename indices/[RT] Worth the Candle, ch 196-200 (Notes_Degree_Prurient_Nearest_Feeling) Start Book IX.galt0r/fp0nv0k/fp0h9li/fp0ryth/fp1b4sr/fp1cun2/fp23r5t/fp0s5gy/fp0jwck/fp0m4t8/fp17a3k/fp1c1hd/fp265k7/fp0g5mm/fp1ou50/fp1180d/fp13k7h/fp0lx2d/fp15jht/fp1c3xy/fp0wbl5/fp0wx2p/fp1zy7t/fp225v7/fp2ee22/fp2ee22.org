Mary's cynicism already screwed them over pretty hard in the last arc, I wouldn't be surprised if Joon is right on this and that "slightly cheaper slave labor" isn't worth the potential association with Blue if discovered - even when ignoring the moral qualms.

People like Harold's Cult, the Doris Finches maybe, and others that stay in the background anyway but could use manufacturing power. Hooks for future adventures, basically.

Perisev as a disgruntled old business partner still sounds possible, though.
