My takes on this half-batch:

- I loved the romance stuff. As Joon says, it's awkward but awkward good instead of bad. I find it cute but also quite realistic (except for the contrived situation, of course).
- Liked the honest conversation with Grak.
- I wonder what's the next in the solution to the Locus' situation, and if any exists.
- What's Capn' BitB about? Does he have an actual body? Can he jump from zombie to zombie?\\
  Someone guessed on discord that the exclusion was probably due to whichever method he uses for immortality, rather than the zombies, and I agree.
- Doris Finch! I hope Joon learns tree magic.
