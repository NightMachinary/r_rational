Wow, that makes a lot of sense! And it's a great hook for the Hells arc to happen before Fel Seed.

After a quote as metal as "The fact remains that they are what they are. And someday, they'll all be gone." - Valencia seems about ready to rip and tear.

*EDIT:* Two facts we learned in the Notes chapter that support this theory:

- Fresh souls in the Hells are very rare at this point (aside from sudden accidents), so 100k-500k new souls are a worthy prize for Infernals to go after, even during a pandemic.
- Infernals have their own form of grotesque *literature*, which can't be found anywhere else but in Hell - a clear motive for Perisev.
