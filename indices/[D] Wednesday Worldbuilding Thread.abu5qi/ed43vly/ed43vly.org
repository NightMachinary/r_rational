So I'm currently thinking about a setting where a GAI has reached effective omnipotence. Of course, this GAI has a few built-in failsafes. One of them is that while the AI can help provide the technology needed to create entertainment, it cannot itself create entertainment. And when it comes to wireheading, it only operates at a two-level remove: it'll give you the tools you nees to build a distillery, but will not actually build you a distillery.

There are a few different ways to turn this into a plot, especially since I've thought of another failsafe that makes things interesting, but my current thinking is to have a sort of "superhero" scene around this. The "heroes" are the anti-wireheaders who want to tear down distilleries and labs, and the "villains" fight to protect the drug dealers. Of course, the AI supplies both sides with equipment and "superpowers", and resurrects anyone who dies.

So, the challenge here is determining how this culture develops. Are there only a few, likely relgious fundamentalist "heroes" making guerrilla strikes on targets of opportunity? Are there far more "heroes" than "villains", because, it's easier to destroy than create, and besides the heroes can loot anything they find? What do you guys think?
