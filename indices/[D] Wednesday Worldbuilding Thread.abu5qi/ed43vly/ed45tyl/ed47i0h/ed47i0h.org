Its goal is to fulfil human values +through friendship and ponies.+ However, it has a few restrictions put on it by the team that was developing it, just in case it ended up poorly aligned. For the record, I'm writing it as a succefully friendly AI, with a few quirks.

As for ethics, I had initially conceptualized the world as more of a way to explore the implications of a GAI on society, but then I realized that the amount of people who want to read navel-gazing is, while not insignificant, much smaller than the people who wany to read about superheroes. So I decided to use superheroes as a medium to do navel-gazing in. (After rejecting a few other possible conflicts; there's a post by my a few months back on the same world.)
