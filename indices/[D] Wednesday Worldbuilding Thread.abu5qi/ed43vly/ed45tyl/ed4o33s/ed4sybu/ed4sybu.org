  How does the AI work? It exists to fulfil human values - does it carry out its own assessment of human values, or only take explicit instructions?
#+end_quote

A combination of both. Within the context of the work, it'll take action based on the set of constraints imposed by its creators and what it's learned about humans. Within the context of me trying to write a story, it'll take action based on what I suspect most people will recognize as a "good" AI, (that is, being strictly better than the current world) that doesn't have any way to be visibly be more "good," with a few clear exceptions obviously imposed on it as constraints. Which isn't a particularly rational way for a GAI to work, I suppose, but it's the one "gimme" the setting gets.

  How does it balance “I want to blow up that stuff with my superpowers” with “I want to not be smeared across the dirt and have my stuff blown up by some superpowered asshole”?
#+end_quote

That's the tricky bit. I considered having the whole "superpowers scene" be sort of consensual, in that only people who implicitly agree to be targeted can have their stuff destroyed, but that makes the character trait pool heroes can draw on a lot shallower.

On the other hand, I'm not sure why defense by obscurity wouldn't be stronger than offense in a world where boths sides can get superpowers anyways, so even an AI allowing unprovoked destruction on the logic that it'll rebuild everything anyways (except for stuff that directly enables wireheading, which the AI technically doesn't allow anyways) wouldn't necessarily enable a superpowered dynamic.

(Though for the record, the AI autonomously disables pain and rapidly revives you, so "dying" is less than a big deal.)

  Maybe it's anything in between!
#+end_quote

Yeah, half my problem is that my canvas is so dauntingly large I get decision paralysis.
