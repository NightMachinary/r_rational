I think there's justifiable leeway for whatever ratio of heroes or villains you want. Maybe we continue on our current sort of society but with super-cops and super-drug dealers. (actually, 99% of people will have superpowers). Maybe there's a progressive revolution of pro-happiness sentiment resulting in the small number of fundamentalist heroes you suggest. Maybe it's anything in between!

How does the AI work? It exists to fulfil human values - does it carry out its own assessment of human values, or only take explicit instructions?

How does it balance “I want to blow up that stuff with my superpowers” with “I want to not be smeared across the dirt and have my stuff blown up by some superpowered asshole”?
