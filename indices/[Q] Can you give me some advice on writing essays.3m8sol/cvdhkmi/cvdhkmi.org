One trick I tend to use for essays when I'm not sure of the /exact/ direction I want to take them, but know the basic topic I want to cover, is to take a few paragraphs someone else has written on the subject and then paraphrase them into my own style. Or I take the same amount from several sources covering the same point and synthesise them into a single piece. Once I'm done with that, my brain tends to have gotten into a "flow" where I can just continue the train of thought into new areas. Then at the end I go back and either delete the paraphrased material or, if the alterations were enough to make it novel, tidy it up to fall more in line with the new direction I've taken.
