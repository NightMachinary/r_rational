Think about what you want to say during idle time, e.g. when in the bathroom, in transit, waiting, etc. Keep a notepad, voice recorder, or word processor handy. When you start talking to yourself, mentally or otherwise, about the sort of topics on which you'd like to write essays, record your thoughts.
