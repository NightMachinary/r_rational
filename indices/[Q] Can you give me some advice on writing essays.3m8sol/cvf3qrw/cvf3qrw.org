Some people write better when a little buzzed.

Aside from that, we're not that smart here. I mean, yes some people are just like whoa but most of us are a long way from having memorised or integrated the majority of rationalism and a fair number are just here for the fanfiction. Discuss ideas more, it's good for you. And if you end up in an discussion and think you have a good point, use it as the core to build an article around.
