OK, you want to write about Rationalist .... stuff. I assume you know in more detail what you want to write about.

Write about that.

Suppose you want to write about "What I learned about Rationalist Fiction by setting up my website" or "Why I set up my website." Start with that.

You might try to find a hook. What other hobbies do you have? How do they relate? Can you explain it.

Can you relate the ideas in your everyday life?

Try freewriting. Start with the obvious stuff, like "A common saying in Rationalist Fiction is 'foo'" and just keep writing. Don't stop typing for 20 minutes. Don't fix typos, don't edit it. See what comes out.

Don't imagine that the favorite thing you've read was plotted to the teeth. EY may have known how HPMOR was going to end, but I assure you he didn't have 600k+ words in his head when he started. I certainly didn't have 120k+ words in my head when I started, I just wanted there to be more stories like HPMOR, didn't see any I loved, and started writing.

And don't worry about comparing yourself to some imagined reader or writer. Some people will hate your stuff, some will like it. Everyone who knows about all this stuff already had to read it somewhere first. Why not your site? And, sadly, the vast majority will ignore it

The main benefit you are going to get from writing is that /you/ enjoy it. So, write what you enjoy.
