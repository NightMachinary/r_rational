  I have nothing to say, or rather I feel like there's nothing worth writing about.

I feel like this is your main problem. Whenever I have sat down to write something, I constantly end up throwing out at least a good third of the words I have written. However, the main trick is knowing which parts to get rid of and which part is worth keeping and it's nearly impossible to figure out the quality of a particular piece of your writing before you actually write it.

You say that you don't have anything new or interesting to write about, but you did say you know the "obvious" things. I recommend starting with what seems like the basics, because they can help you build up to newer and more interesting topics in the very process of writing out the foundations. Don't worry about quality, originality, or how wise you sound. All of that can only come after you put something down from your pen. No matter how stupid, silly, or inane the first words might be, you need to have some words to actually start.

A good starter phrase for me is: "I don't know what I want to write. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know...."

Get something out!

Good luck.
