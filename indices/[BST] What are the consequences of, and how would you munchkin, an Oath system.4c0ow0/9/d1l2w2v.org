Capture a guy.

You then have him swear, on penalty of death, to never eat chicken.

You then have him swear to make a sincere effort to capture anyone he believes he can capture without getting caught that he has not previously caught, and have them swear all the oaths he swears today, on penalty of death.

You then have him swear, on penalty of death, to never disclose any of this happened, or why he is attempting to capture people if he is caught in the act.

Release your prisoner.

1. 2. 4. 8. 16... You have released a self replicating oath into the world. In all likelihood, people will be eternally plagued by random kidnappings, and chickens will inherit the earth because damn near nobody eats them.

Of course, that is if you are lucky, and it is merely a ban on chicken that your evil oathificer devises. Probably a loophole in my example here somewhere but you get the gist.
