There are two exploitable features here, aside from the obvious. The first is magical knowledge, and the second is magical enforcement.

You have a sealed box and a friend in front of you. You make an oath: "I swear to give my friend a sealed box containing an apple within 10 seconds, or else I will give him a dollar." You give him the sealed box, wait 10 seconds, then check if you have lost a dollar. You now know if the box contained an apple.

Depending on how smart the Oath magic is, you can solve everything by binary search.

Also, depending on the specifics, it could be used for free, instantaneous transportation. "I promise to not touch this table, or else I will give [far off merchant] 100 bales of cotton." Touch the table to teleport the cotton from your warehouse to theirs.
