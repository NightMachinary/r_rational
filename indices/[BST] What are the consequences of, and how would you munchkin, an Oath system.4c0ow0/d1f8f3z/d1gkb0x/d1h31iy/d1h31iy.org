No you missed the point, the /punishment is what i'm talking about/ based on the other comments you can actually set quite a few things as punishment it doesn't just have to kill them. That's why I was clear that the second step is actually to get them to break the contract (by setting it as impossible to uphold) so that you can then exploit the punishment mechanic.
