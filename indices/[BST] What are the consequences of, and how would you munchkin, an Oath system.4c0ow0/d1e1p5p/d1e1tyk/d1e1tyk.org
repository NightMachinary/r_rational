With the consequences, it's more as if you're giving up something than gaining something. The key is that you must own something to offer it as consequence, whether it be to the law or to some other person. You cannot offer a lack of something, and since it has to be something 'owned', it has to be something that exists. Since a lack of something is by definition that something's non-existence, you can't Oath it away.

I suppose there's an exploit in that you can own skills, and then you can Oath off those skills to the highest bidder. You'd end up with whole farm schools filled with people continuously gaining certain skills over and over again, so they can auction them off to someone who needs them.
