There are souls in this setting, yes. As for the memory and talent transference, it works, but mainly for the small/medium sized families. You see, the more powerful in magic you are, the longer your life is. For the small/medium families, this won't matter as much since the parent's lives aren't likely to be too long, maybe a century or five. But, for the larger clans, since memories aren't able to be copied, just transferred, they won't give up the power of their high-level members in any situation other than death/crippling. Keep in mind that the high-level members of a family are the pillars of the family; they fall and the family falls. In this setting, souls are used to exercise control over their magic, it would take some time for the new heir to be competent enough to become the pillar of the family again.

Since things to be offered as consequence can't be given to multiple people (i.e. if you have an apple, you can't Oath it as consequence to two people. Similarly, you only have one set of memories), this would lead to avid competition among the younger generation to decide who would get the legacy from their strongest elder.

On reflection, it's likely that the more ruthless of families may set up a sort of slavery system, in which they raise a bunch of brainwashed slaves to become powerful warriors for their family. Instil devotion in all the slaves, and it will be magnified when you make them Oath away their skill, memories and the like to the strongest of the group. Repeat with a new generation, and give the older generation's memories to the most outstanding member of the younger. And, from that setup, you end up with a system of increasingly powerful, increasingly devoted slaves who will defend the family to the last. This would make it so that the main family would only have to focus on administration tasks and the like, no need to focus on magic for anything more than the increased lifespan.

This could also lead to perfect scouting: Have a scout swear and Oath that, if they don't come back from this mission alive, their memories of that mission would be transferred to a spymaster.
