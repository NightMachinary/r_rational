Oaths as a method of communication.

"I shall not die. If I do, may this flower which I invested care into raising burst into flames". Now you know if he's dead or not.

You really gotta firm up "consequences" if you don't want to inadvertently create an entire magic system based on "consequences". It's very hard to give people free reign over what the "consequence" is without finding an exploit. (Even with the example I gave, you can tie the flower-oath to something more trivial and weaponize the flower by tying it to dynamite.)

The easy way is to have rigidly fixed consequences.
