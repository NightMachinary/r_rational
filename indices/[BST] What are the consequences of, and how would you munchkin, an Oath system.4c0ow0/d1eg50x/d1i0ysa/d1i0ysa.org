Most magic systems treat categories that people find useful as primitive categories. Thus you can have magic that can't create food, even though food is pretty similar to non-food, or magic that can turn you into an animal but can't make arbitrary physiological changes.

In line with this, you can't invent your own language and switch the words around, since the average guy in the street will say "that's not a real language", in the same way that you can't say "I will define 'animal X' as 'human being with the genes of the current king'" and use the animal transform spell to turn into the king.
