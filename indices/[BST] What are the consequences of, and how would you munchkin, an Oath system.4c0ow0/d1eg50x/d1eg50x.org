Will Oath-System accept a language of your own invention that uses same words that common language, but have different meanings? Then, when you're giving Oath with witnesses present, you're mentally notifying Oath-System that you're giving it in your own language, in which it means something harmless. If this works, potential implications are endless.

Can consequence include giving up any object to another person? Can this be used to teleport objects? Can you consequence away your dumbness? What about hunger, or thirst? What about waste - unlike previous examples, this is actually your own physical thing, but losing it may be highly advantageous.

Can you consequence away knowledge? Can this be used to induce highly selective amnesia?

Can you use Oath to derive knowledge? For example "I'll now tell the city where my nemesis currently resides, or my left pinky experiences mild pain for 3 seconds. It's City ABC". What is the result of such Oath, assuming you don't know your nemesis whereabouts.

Can Oath be conditional? "If you do anything my son, I'll do my utmost to make you suffer for eternity, or I die." Will you feel this Oath activation when condition is triggered, or when you learn that condition is triggered?

Btw, If Oath can be conditional, it may be possible (I'm not exact expert) to craft "Computational Oath" - sequence of logic that brings some output (in Morse code of weak pains to your pinky, for example) depending on some input. I assume calculator can be done easily enough (at least for some near-immortal superbeing).
