  They're not going to want to swear Oaths giving away their ability to deceive, to struggle for power.

I don't think it would work out that way, here's why:

Imagine two societies, A and B. Society A has the people in positions of power swear oaths, Society B doesn't. People in Society B won't trust their leaders to speak truth or to fulfill their promises.

As a result, a capable knight will prefer to pledge his loyalty to a king from Society A instead of a king from Society B, knowing that the king from Society B might screw him over at any time even if he had been entirely loyal. Society A thus winds up with more knights, more power, more ability to militarily crush Society B.

Likewise, capitalists open up their companies in Society A knowing they have laws that they can depend on - that means lower risk, after all. And the knowledge that the rulers in the society won't just nationalize their companies, which can't be said for Society B's leaders. So capitalists primarily invest in Society A turning Society A into an advanced economy, while Society B is still stuck in medieval stasis. Soon Society A will turn out military technologies, and have such an advantage in productivity, that they would overwhelm Society B.

Likewise, people in general will emigrate from Society B, where they fear for their lives (because the rulers are free to kill anyone at will), to Society A, where the rulers have sworn oaths to abide by rule of law and not kill people wantonly. This results in Society A having a far greater population than Society B, which means a much larger economy and a much larger pool of potential conscripts.

So by the law of evolution of societies, Society A will eventually crush Society B and dominate. Just like in the real world, where nations that have a strong rule of law dominate over ones that don't.

And the power elite, knowing that their nations will become advantaged by using oaths, will take action to not only take oaths themselves, but also ensure that the rest of the people in positions of power do likewise. They don't want to be part of the soon-to-fail Society B, after all.

What this means of course, is that a few centuries after the discovery of Oaths, all major countries will have oath-abiding governments.

This is practically a guarantee. If you create a world with oaths where the leaders /don't/ use oaths, it will be entirely /unbelievable/ in my opinion.
