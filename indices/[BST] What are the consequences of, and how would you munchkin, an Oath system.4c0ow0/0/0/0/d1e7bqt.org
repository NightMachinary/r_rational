It's not so much for the purposes of a trial.

how to put this.. Okay, modern analogy; Law enforcement relies on people trusting the cops. The more trustworthy law enforcement is, the more effective it ultimately is, because people volunteer information to trusted agents of law and order in a way they do not to such agents that are viewed with suspicion.

Thus, the black witch king in the mountain may be a corrupt and ancient being with a drinking problem, but if said witchking is wise, then the Sheriff? The sheriff is sworn to the law. If the witchking is foolish, sworn to the witch-king.
