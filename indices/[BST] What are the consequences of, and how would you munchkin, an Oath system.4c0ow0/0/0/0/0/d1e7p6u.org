I do see where you're coming from there, but for this setting I have, it's not as relevant. The rule of the witchking may be fair under the lawsworn sherrif, but that doesn't matter when a group of unsworn people roll up with more resources and stronger individuals and decide that they want that mountain. Cunning is the most reliable way to gain resources to grow stronger, and Oathing away your ability to exploit your position for more resources is a surefire way to hinder your future growth. In this sense, the witchking has to choose between fair underlings, and competent underlings. When he needs strength to defend his territory, you can be sure he'd pick competent any day.
