You would be correct.. if corruption didn't affect the wealth of nations. But it does. An individual corrupt sheriff will have more money, than a comparable honest one in an otherwise identical nation. A nation which has /only/ honest sheriffs - because they use magic to enforce that - will be quite a lot wealthier, overall, than it's neighbours. That means higher tax income. Thus, more strength. Uhm. That does the depend on the ruler having enough sense to spend at least most of those increased earnings extravagantly on their minions as opposed to just hogging it all and building more palaces..
