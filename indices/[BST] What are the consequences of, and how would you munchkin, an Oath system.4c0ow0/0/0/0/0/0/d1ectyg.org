Resources = Money. A well governed nation will be richer, and tax collecting yields more wealth over time if that's done fairly too.

So unless the magic rewards corruption /directly/ - Meaning that there are spells that run on the heart of a forsaken child and so on, then no, the witchking isn't weakening his power by forcing his underlings to be paragons. After all, if one underling backstabs another for personal advantage, all the resources invested in the stabbed person go poof, and that's a net loss to the witchking, even if it isnt to the stabber.

There are perverse incentives in this system. For example, I think that in a system where you can just pour battle experience and wealth into minions to strengthen them with no real upper bounds on return to investment, the optimum strategy is to have as few sworn minons as at all practical, so that you can concentrate gold ect into them.

So the sheriff is incorruptible. And tearing across the country side desperately trying to cover an absurdly oversized circuit, dealing out very rapid justice so she can sprint to the next village and investigate a robbery there. Sprint because it's faster than riding after the 5th level of investiture. Horses, after all, die if you push them too hard.

Probably not how everyplace would do things, but at least some places will do this. The starting requirement is a ruler with a secure enough position to kick things off, and enough wisdom to see that it is a good idea.
