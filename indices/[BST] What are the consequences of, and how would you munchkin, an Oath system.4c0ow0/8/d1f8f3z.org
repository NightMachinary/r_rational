If the first person to get access to the oath system is extremely ambitious and somewhat clever I can see this playing out as invasion of the body snatchers. First the "Master" oaths himself to psychologically give up his ability to be deterred from his goals by laziness. Next being super motivated he kidnaps a few powerful people. He forces them to agree at swordpoint to something they can't possibly do, then when they fail they forfeit their ability to desire things other than what aligns with master's will, or through another method they effectively become a thrall of his. Now that Master has forced many powerful people into thralldom they will then go on to kidnap /more/ people to thrall... You get the point, and that's without even getting into the spell's abilities to potentially transfer skills and information, even over great distance.

Basically depending on how things go when oaths are first discovered this could play out like invasion of the body snatchers on roids.
