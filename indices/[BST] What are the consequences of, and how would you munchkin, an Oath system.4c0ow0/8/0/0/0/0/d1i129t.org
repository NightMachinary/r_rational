You missed the point, the oath can be anything, he can have an oath to not stand on one foot.

The point is that since you can give up lots of things as collateral to the oath it could do more than just kill you if you break it.

If you look at some of the other comment threads it is clear you can give up memories and other aspects of your mind as collateral. So I find that part of the oath system as interesting as the oath itself.
