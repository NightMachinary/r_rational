"I agree to aid any person or people who have also taken this Oath when doing so is substantially more beneficial to them then it is costly to me, and not to harm any person or people who have also taken this oath unless doing so is substantially more beneficial to me then it is harmful to them."

Phrasing could use some work, but hopefully it's good enough to make the point.

Taking this Oath will, on average, be beneficial - the only actions it requires are positive-sum, and the only ones it prohibits are negative sum. (It wouldn't be in your interest to take it if you knew that you would have many easy opportunities to help others but almost never be in a position to receive help, but that's not a usual situation.) If you have taken this Oath, it's in your interest to persuade more people to take it as well.
