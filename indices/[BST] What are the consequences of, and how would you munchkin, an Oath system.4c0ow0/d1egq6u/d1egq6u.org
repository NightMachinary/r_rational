I think Yudkowsky had the right idea on how to balance such a system - namely, it doesn't do anything physically impossible nor does it cause any consequence if it is broken - it simply compels the oath-maker to complete the terms of the oath to the best of their ability.

Still totally munchkinable via tricking rubes into making poorly-considered oaths that effectively make them your perfect slaves.
