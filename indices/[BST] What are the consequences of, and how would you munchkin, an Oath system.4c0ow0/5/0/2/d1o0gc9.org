  As for the Oath factories, what incentive could such a place have to entice people to want to work there? Near any worker would prefer to go with a competitor who doesn't institute such practices over the factory.

First, this assumes there are enough jobs at the competitors for everyone who wants one.

Second, the obvious benefits are higher pay and (possibly) the owner's/manager's Oath to treat his workers fairly. Those workers who would work honestly anyway don't have a lot to lose by taking the Oath (assuming it has exceptions for personal emergencies, sickness leave, etc.). The competitors only get those who /aren't/ willing to work honestly and are substantially less effective. They get driven out of business. Now everyone has to work at the oath-factory or nowhere. The Oath might lose those exceptions (perhaps the owner didn't swear an Oath, or was willing to suffer the consequences, or lost/sold the factory to someone else).
