  any Oath with it's harm as the consequence would require it's permission.

That still allows a loophole. The age at which someone understands X and is free of outside influence isn't a yes/no thing; people gradually get more and more independent as they age. What's the highest level of dependency that's still independent enough that someone can take an oath? Can a 5 year old or 10 year old take one? Clearly they can never completely understand things like an adult can, but they surely have some understanding. And it obviously wouldn't make sense to say that you can't take an oath unless you have 100% understanding and are under 0 pressure.
