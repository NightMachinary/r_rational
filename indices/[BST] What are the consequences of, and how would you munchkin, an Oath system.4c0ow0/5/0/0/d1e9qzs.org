/(Opinion:)/

It's perfectly fine for you-the-writer to use WordOfGod for establishing and defining laws of the setting, because that's what sci-fi and fantasy are largely about --- changing basic aspects of /our/ reality to investigate how such changes would affect the human society and using the narrative of adventure to deliver investigation results.

However, the same doesn't hold true for using WoG to define certain /social/ behaviours (unless [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invention_of_Lying][psychological]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy][characteristics]] themselves are what you're changing as a basic aspect). Not only does that defeat the whole purpose of social inquiry, but you also have to consider that your audience will be reading the story while holding certain expectations. They'd expect, for instance, for people in your world to have psychological characteristics similar to people from ours. And if people in your world act differently without any explanation for that difference, at best it would be making your audience frustrated by their illogical actions.

This is the point where you should start to change\broaden your opinion on the matter instead of continuing to bend the world's laws to conform to your opinion.

Especially if the Oath system is not a new phenomenon, there would have been at least some countries in its history which decided to use the Oaths for one reason or another. And at least some of them would've survived to this day because a country without corruption would be much more efficient in going through the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels][technology levels.]] Some of them would've self-eliminated for various reasons (e.g. getting hijacked, having crazy dictators, etc), yes, but as with any kind of evolutionary system, the ones that survived would be the more durable and balanced ones. So: your world would have had at least some powerful countries that have Oath-powered political hierarchies.

  As for the Oath factories, what incentive could such a place have to entice people to want to work there?

Well, this one you /can/ tweak out to a certain degree depending on how your story's background canvas is painted. For instance: [in your world there is no philosophical analogue to [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-intro.en.html][Free Software Movement]]] → [there are at least some poor strata and countries (safe Oaths for self-improvement are expensive and scarce)] → [they get economically abused by their more developed counterparts]. And akin to how sweatshops are a thing in our worlds, employee-abusive Oath-factories would be a thing in yours.

On the other hand, I'd think that even if /everybody/ had their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs][basic needs]] covered, at least some people would find working through an Oath factory more effective. In this case, of course, the factories would be more interested in caring for not only the well-being of their employees but also for their rights.
