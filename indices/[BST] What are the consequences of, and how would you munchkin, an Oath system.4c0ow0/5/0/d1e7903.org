In regards to the Judgement of Solomon, I'd say the baby is not explicitly 'owned' by either woman, it is it's own soul. As such, any Oath with it's harm as the consequence would require it's permission. Since accepting the terms requires understanding of the Oath, it would be too young to be given as consequence.

I've explained in a few other comments on this thread why a country in my setting is unlikely to have enforced Oath taking for it's officials. The only way I can see it happening is if some incredibly powerful expert, of whom the country has no information on, comes up and makes them institute such a system. Since they wouldn't know who the expert is, or what they care about, they'd have no choice but to swear if they don't want to die right then.

As for the Oath factories, what incentive could such a place have to entice people to want to work there? Near any worker would prefer to go with a competitor who doesn't institute such practices over the factory. They'd have to have one hell of an incentive towards such a job. The only thing I can think of in-setting would be magical resources, which could be obtained elsewhere, albeit at a slower rate. Only if the factory has an exclusive technique, spell, or whatever could they be attractive enough for workers. And, if the spell is valuable enough to attract workers, it's valuable enough to attract thieves. The spell won't stay exclusive for long.

I do completely agree with the personal improvement one, though.
