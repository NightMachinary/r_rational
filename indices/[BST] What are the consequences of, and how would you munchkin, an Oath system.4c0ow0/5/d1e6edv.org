Firstly, it would likely impose a sense of objective morality upon the world. No matter if the oath works through “divine intervention” or something like a technologically advanced alien civilisation, it would still mean that the population /has/ to adhere to certain standards and word-definitions and is unable to ignore them. Maybe some countries would choose to ignore the Oath in their legal system or outright outlaw invoking it, but it would still be there, like a weird psychological phenomenon --- if not outright a law of nature.

If the women from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Solomon][Judgment of Solomon]] made an oath setting the penalty as something happening to their supposed son, would that Oath take? If yes, then people are a type of potential property in a moral system that can not be ignored, disputed, or changed. Similar consequences should be expected regarding owning animals of various degrees of intelligence.

Another ultimate litmus test for countries would be whether they require from their politicians, governmental workers, and citizens to take certain kinds of Oaths or not. A standard argument against mandatory Oaths could be made through concept of “free will”. This argument could also be abused to a degree to allow political corruption, nepotism, crime cover-up, etc.

In countries, where citizens are required to take certain Oaths, there would always be the looming risk that an agent from within or without would be able to [[https://torrentfreak.com/eztv-shuts-down-after-hostile-takeover-150518/][hijack]] their entire government by finding a loophole in the currently used version of the mandatory Oath set.

If the Oaths can be used to make someone do something, people would be perceived as functionaries, to a certain degree. An Oath could be arranged this way to make a person be literally unable to stop working on a certain task until they are finished. If a company specialises on this kind of Oaths (let's call it an Oath-factory), it's reasonable to assume that it would care about the health condition of its functionaries because they are a valuable asset to it. The penalty section of a typical Oath used by an Oath-factory would resemble a programming code.

On a personal level, Oaths could be used to improve skills and character, to get rid of bad habits (“I swear to stop wanting to smoke if I break this Oath”), to forget things and maybe to share memories and knowledge with others. Oaths made by amateurs would also be more likely to backfire and cause harm to involved parties.
