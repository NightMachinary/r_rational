Is oath magic new, or old? Because this makes an enormous difference.

If oath magic has been a part of the setting for a long time, it will have been woven into the fabric of society on a bone deep level, and have utterly transformed it, because this is the kind of thing that allows you to eliminate the agent problem.

Agents of the law will be utterly incorruptible - and perfectly trusted.

Merchants will be non-deceptive, and known to be so, and so on and so forth, because everyone will be using standardized oaths that have been long codified and shown to be abuse and loophole free over the course of centuries.

This also limits munchkinism rather severely, because people will be very, very skeptical of any new oath that isn't in the Codex of Duly Tested, Examined, and Approved Oaths. No oathing to tell the truth and then being technically truthy to get away with shit - if you want to establish trustworthyness magically, you take either the Witness, Judge, Trader, or Enforcers oaths of Not Deceiving People, and those are all darn bulletproof.

If it's new, people will be making up their own oaths and everything will be a clusterfuck because they get it wrong.
