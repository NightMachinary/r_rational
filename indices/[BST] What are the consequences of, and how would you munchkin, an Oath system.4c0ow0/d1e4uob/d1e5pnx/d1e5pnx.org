It's quite old, but in the setting it doesn't make much difference. An Oath is a great tool for building trust, and it's useful for merchants, but it loses it's effectiveness when it comes to the ruling class.

The magic system in this setting allows for people to train to a ridiculous height. People can become so strong such that an entire army of people at a lower level can't hope to scratch them. Now, consider that the Oath magic had to be new at some point. The people running the country are going to be the strongest individuals (power gives resources, everyone wants resources for further advancing their magic, large amounts of treachery pre-Oath, ergo the people at the top got there by the sword and stay there with their newly acquired resources) and the people a little lower the totem pole are still going to be strong. They're not going to want to swear Oaths giving away their ability to deceive, to struggle for power. After all, if you reach a high enough level, you can live forever. The people who swear they will never do no wrong are cutting off massive amounts of their own potential for growth. And it's likely they would all band together to avoid making any Oath of the sort, maybe even swearing another Oath to rebel or kill the king's loved ones if they're ever forced to swear an Oath against deceit and the like. So no precedent is set for Oath swearing as a requirement to enter into a position of power, it would never become the tradition and wouldn't be as suspicious if someone didn't swear an Oath upon entering the position.

As for law enforcement, what could swearing an Oath help with there? Criminals can also swear Oaths, making it easy to pass Oaths of truthfulness, by simply Oathing away the memories of the crime. There would be a few more steps once the enforcers get savvy to this, but then there's just a few more steps easily accomplished by Oath. As such, Oaths of truthfulness are nearly worthless after the fact. It's better in-setting to rely on the other branches of magic - scrying, divination, that sort of thing - for anything regarding crimes, because then anyone with knowledge of such things can easily repeat the tests to see if the law enforcement is being truthful or not.
