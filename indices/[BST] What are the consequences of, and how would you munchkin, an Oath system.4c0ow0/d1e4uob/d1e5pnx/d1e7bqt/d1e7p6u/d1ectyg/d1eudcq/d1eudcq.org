It's not that the magic rewards corruption, or punishes incorruptibility. It's that being incorruptible holds no advantage in terms of raising your strength. Consider two different sherrifs; one who is perfectly fair and just in his upholding of the law, and another that uses his position for his own ends. If they both start at the same level of strength, the one who exploited his position will be stronger than the one who didn't.

Since this is an older magic in the setting, it has been experimented in towards such a direction. But, the other countries, rulers, sects and the like who didn't instigate an Oath block against their members being would expand if they had the chance. One ridiculously strong character can swing an entire war in their side's favour. You're far more likely to get such a character emerging from a side that doesn't forbid exploitation.
