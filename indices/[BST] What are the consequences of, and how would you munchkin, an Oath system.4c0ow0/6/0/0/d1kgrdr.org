Well, would making a kingdom somewhere far from civilization that talks in your "fake" language (and learns all words meaning "nothing", or all words of Common language, as a part of their religion) help with this? Because that's not an impossible feat for immortal being of a godlike power.

And those two examples are somewhat different - usually magic system defines what counts as "animal", but Oaths use natural language defined by humans (unless it works other way in that setting). Will Oath system work for obscure language of a backwater tribe? If it would, how is it different from my example?
