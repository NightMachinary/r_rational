You can't Oath away your potential for sickness, but you can Oath away your potential for things you have to work for, either by offering your motivation to do such a thing, or by making an Oath that you'll never become such a thing, with dire consequences.

For neuroses, you'd have to separate them into deficiencies and otherwise. If it's a deficiency (i.e. a lack of motivation, a lack of restraint, the like) then no, you can't Oath that away. If it's something separate (PTSD being a learned reaction from traumatic memories) then you can.
