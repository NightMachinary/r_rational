Consider: I don't just own my skills, but my experiences and memories. These could easily be passed down the line to descendants if I was for example on my deathbed. Depending on whether the "self" is contained in a soul in your setting, you could easily craft an Oath to trade bodies with another.

Continuously retraining in a skill could highlight better teaching practices such that the teaching is quickly optimized. Also, people develop and retain skills and knowledge differently, so one package of skills cycling through a series of novice learners to build on the product could output a broader and therefore more useful package.

Large groups of literate individuals could read through pages and transfer all the memories/knowledge contained within to one person so that the information is absorbed at incredible rates.

I wonder if it's possible to duplicate memories through oaths rather than transfer.

Edit: You could through social pressure and time form a society in which the eldest son is duty bound to host their father's soul/memories/skills when they are close to passing, continuing the lineage.
