You have a really good point there. I think it depends more on whether the king's subordinates are sensible or not. If they are, then they can use their new-found knowledge of Oaths to completely negate the king's attempts.

The key is that the king has to move stealthily in that scenario for him to succeed, whereas the subordinates can be as brazen as they want. If the subordinated realise there is a decent chance of their king making them swear Oaths, they can all decide to set up an Oath as a warning system before getting everyone else to do the whole counter-Oath shebang. If they do realise this, and I think they will given the level of cunning I'd attribute to someone who got to their sort of level, then the king will be unable to stealthily Oath enough subordinates to matter. And I think that the king would realise that this would only lead to bad times for him, and refuse to try to Oath all his subordinates. The risks outweigh the rewards.
