Consider that people had to discover the Oaths at some point in time. Upon any king trying to introduce such a system when it isn't the norm, none his subordinates would be too pleased. Since they would have reached their positions through strength and cunning, they would be put off by any king trying to make all of them swear Oaths of fealty to him. They would likely realise that they, themselves, cannot do anything against this king of theirs, but they as a group can. If they all swear Oaths that, if the king tries to make one of them swear an Oath of fealty, they would all kill his loved ones, betray all his secret information to the enemy, etc. Then they just have to tell him about it, and then they're safe to connive their way to the top.

The marriage point probably wouldn't see much use, I think. Look at how people treat getting a prenup in modern society. If you tell your partner that you want to get a prenup before marriage, it's often viewed as a betrayal of trust, "How could you want to make a prenup? Don't you trust me?!" This is likely to be the same in this setting. Sure, some will do it, but a good quantity won't.
