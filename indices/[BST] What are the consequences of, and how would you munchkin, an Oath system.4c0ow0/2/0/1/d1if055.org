This seems overly cynical in that you assume that this would be the case in every kingdom. There are many monarchs whose underlings were, at least on balance, faithful to them. This becomes more common as you get into smaller polities (i.e. tribes, clans, and bands) since the ruler was closer and closer to the whole group. Depending on when Oath magic got started, you're probably going to see a whole lot of large nations that are ruled in a weirdly tribal/band-like fashion despite their size, because Oaths allow them to maintain that structure.
