The person who discovers oaths first becomes the oath-king, unless he's a coward or helpless or stupid or something. This is how it'd play out:

- Person A (discoverer of oath magic) abducts some person (B) weaker than him, and forces B to swear oaths of fealty to him on pain of torture. The oath of fealty also includes a provision that prevents them from revealing the fact that they've been subverted.
- Rinse and repeat. Person A can abduct a bunch of people weaker than him, or even have his vassals abduct people, all of whom are weaker than his vassals.
- Once he has enough people, he can have his vassals team up against stronger individuals, forcing them to swear oaths of fealty too. Even if he's only able to abduct the weakest people in the village, once he gets a bunch of them together they'll be able to overcome any ordinary person. And once he's claimed a bunch of ordinary people, he'd be able to overcome a soldier (bows are really useful). And once he's claimed a bunch of soldiers, he'd be able to overcome even a competent soldier / knight, etc.
- Eventually he will be able to subvert his entire village, and then other villages, towns, cities, kingdoms, empires.
