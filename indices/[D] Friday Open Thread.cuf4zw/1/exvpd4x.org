Anyone ever tried Princess Tutu? Despite it's girly name, it's a really cool anime about a character from a fairy tale fighting against fate. And the idea of an evil narrator that plays god with the lives of the characters is really neat.

The character development is on point, the music is all classical ballet pieces and the story has some twists that make it clever.

Also it has a cool fanfic called [[https://sites.google.com/site/thispendentheart/][This Pendent Heart]].
