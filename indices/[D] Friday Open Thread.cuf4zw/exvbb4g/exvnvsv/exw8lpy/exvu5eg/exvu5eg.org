He's /always/ been at the very least wellish-loved, and definitely respected as an exemplary specimen of humanity by most people, even people who don't think highly of his acting ability.

It's been relatively wellish-known since the early '00s that his sister had leukemia and that he's donated millions upon millions of dollars to leukemia and cancer research. The way [[/u/SvalbardCaretaker][u/SvalbardCaretaker]] worded it in present tense could be interpreted as a recent thing, and it most certainly isn't. Back when the Matrix sequels came out it was in the popular consciousness that he willingly took a smaller cut than his contract had agreed to (I just looked it up and it amounts to about $38 million) so the Wachowskis would have a higher budget for special effects, which happened at the same time the actor who played Tank in the first movie was demanding a higher salary than Keanu because he thought he was irreplaceable (which is why Tank was replaced by Link in the sequels).

In addition to the fact that he freely gives of himself, he also has never lived lavishly and thrown money around like other celebrities. He's incredibly down-to-earth and humble despite his fame.

I think what really kicked off this current resurgence in popularity was his appearance on the Colbert Rep- Uh, whatever show Colbert hosts. The Late Show or whatever. John Wick 3 was coming out soon and so he went on the Late Show and they were talking and joking and people think of Keanu as somewhat philosophical so Colbert was like "What does Keanu Reeves think happens when we die?" and Keanu breathed out hard and got kinda real and said "I know that the ones who love us will miss us" and it almost sounded like he choked up a little bit when he said it and BOOM the internet collectively remembered what a legitimately wonderful and genuine person he is, and the world really /sucks shit/ right now so it's been kinda nice to have a shining beacon of humanity's potential walking around reminding us that our species is capable of enough good as to be worth saving, because it often seems like we aren't.

Here's the clip.
