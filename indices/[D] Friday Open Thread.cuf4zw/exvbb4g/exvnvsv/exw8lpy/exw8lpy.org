He was in a few big movies that weren't that well-received - /47 Ronin/ and /Man of Tai Chi/ comes to mind. As he's the lead actor, he got called a terrible actor (most visible = easiest target).

Then John Wick came out that audiences loved, and it also came out that the guy donates a ton to charity, stories about how [[https://kluv.radio.com/blogs/miles-morning/did-you-know-octavia-spencer-was-famous-keanu-reeves-came-her-rescue-when-she][nice he is]] became more well-known, he was cast as a character in the /very/ highly anticipated /Cyberpunk 2077/ game (which is where the "You're breathless" comes from).

He also had a very, /very/ [[https://people.com/archive/too-much-sorrow-vol-55-no-16/][hard life]] - his bio dad left his family when he was 4, and mom had a strong of divorces, hi sister was diagnosed with leukemia, his best friend OD'ed, daughter was stillborn, his (then ex-) GF was in a fatal car accident. So there's a ton of sympathy for him from that.

So basically a guy with a very hard personal life became super popular around the same time that it was revealed he's just really very nice to everyone around him, and everything kind of just took off from there.

Fun fact: In 47 Ronin, people complained that have a white guy playing the main character, who was half white/Japanese, was whitewashing. Keanu Reeves himself is half-white/Asian.
