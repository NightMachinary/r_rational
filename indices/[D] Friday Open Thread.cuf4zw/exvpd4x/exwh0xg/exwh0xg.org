That anime is excellent. It has a bit of a rough start, but just keeps getting better and better. I particularly like how it explores the importance of emotions and how too much or (plot critically) too little of an emotion causes problems. Also at least one plot point reminds me of Permutation City, which is strange for a fantasy anime featuring ballet.
