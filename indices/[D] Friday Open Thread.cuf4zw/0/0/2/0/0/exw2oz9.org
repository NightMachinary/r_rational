Yeah, people sometimes forget (or never knew in the first place) that just a year before he started filming the Matrix sequels, he almost had a daughter, but she was stillborn at 8 months, which pushed the relationship between him and his girlfriend to the point that they broke up out of grief, and then a few months later she died in a car accident due to alcohol that she'd probably been drinking due to grief. And of course his sister's leukemia was diagnosed around the same time period, within a year or two.

It's like, tuberculosis killed Edgar Allan Poe's mother and his cousin/wife, and he reacted by becoming the prototypical whiny little emo bitch-baby. Keanu Reeves has had tragedies of a similar scale in his life and he's reacted by becoming the human embodiment of compassion and love. He's literally one of the best humans there's ever been.
