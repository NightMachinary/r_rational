Thanks for the detailed response! I don't really follow pop culture much; I was just surprised to see how much goodwill he was garnering considering how much it was /in vogue/ to make fun of him, last I heard the guy mentioned. But, like your timeline might indicate, this was probably in the early 2000's.
