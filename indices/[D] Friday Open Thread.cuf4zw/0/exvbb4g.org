So. The rumors about a Matrix reboot finally got killed off the other day by official news that they're making a Matrix 4 - with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss confirmed to be reprising their roles as Neo and Trinity, and with Lana Wachowski (but /not/ Lilly, apparently) confirmed to be returning to write and direct, and it's going to begin production early next year.

Is it going to ruin the series' legacy (inb4 "Reloaded and Revolutions already ruined it" (which for the record is false)) or is it going to be a glorious masterpiece?
