I'm a big fan of casting a wide net and not drilling down too hard unless you're going to do it in the text. Here's my checklist of things to think about, if not things to have long, complex answers for:

*Geography checklist*

- Land masses
- Rock/metal distribution
- Watersheds
- Seasons
- Prevailing winds
- Biomes
- Arability

*Cultural Predicates Checklist*

- Non-renewable resources
- Renewable resources
- Crops and domesticated animals
- Natural disasters
- Diseases
- Technology

*Cultural Checklist*

- Food
- Dress
- Recreation
- Architecture
- Religion
- Race
- Gender Roles
- Traditions/Holidays
- Trade
- Beliefs

*National Checklist*

- Cities
- Heirarchy
- Role of law
- How law is made
- How law is enforced
- How power is obtained
- How power is transferred
- Division of power
- Military
- Economy

The things that make a culture "middle-east" are probably some combination of the local foods, local clothes, local customs, beliefs about the world, how the locals look, and a bunch of other things. At least some of those are going to be predicated on the climate and the available materials. Of note, you're going to get a lot of different answers depending on what tech level you pick and what's available to your culture.

  In Northern Areas alongside the Caspian Sea (Northern Iran), abundance of water and fertile soil for farming has caused villages to have a scattered pattern. Moreover, area of residential plots is relatively high and residential environments are surrounded with citrus fruits. Native people of these areas used to make a living by farming, gardening, working on rice fields, and fishing. Not long ago, houses were made of wood and then thatched with clay and straw. Ceilings were covered with Sufal (made of baked clay), canes or stems of rice plant. Dense forests on the margins of the Caspian Sea and mountains provide the wood needed for making houses. Ceilings, pillars and in some cases, walls and the foundations of houses were made out of wood. Where the land moisture is high, the house floor is built above the ground level.

  Central Iran is an arid salt desert with a harsh nature and an average annual precipitation of less than 200 mm. Living in these areas is only possible around or near Qanats (aqueducts) and springs. Aqueducts are sustainable subterranean systems for drawing the underground water resources to the surface which is the result of a genuine Iranian irrigation innovation that slowly draws the underground water to the surface and has supplied water for thousands of years. Shortage of water in this region has made aqueducts an invaluable element such that not a drop of water is wasted. Whenever the amount of water is not adequate, it is first directed into a pool and then drawn into the farms. The size of the villages and their population in this region are determined by the amount of water available.

  Clay and sun-dried clay are the basic materials for housing in desert areas in Iran. Houses were built very close to each other in a dense context. Applying clay which is resistant to heat made living through hot summers possible. Houses are introvert and with the courtyard placed in the center (central courtyard pattern) to protect the house from the harsh nature and hot winds as well as provide the dwellers with an appropriate open space. Rooms are separate units and open to the courtyard. In complete harmony with seasonal changes and in order to provide dwellers with comfort inside the house, some movements are necessary for the family members from the sunny parts of the house (suitable for the winter) to the parts back to the sun and shaded parts (suitable for the summer). The family members move upstairs, downstairs, and to the north or to the south Eyvans (porches) of the house.

I'm not suggesting that you go into this much detail, but these are two very different pictures of what (for example) architecture might be like in different regions of what is now Iran, which comes from different weather, occupations, and available materials.
