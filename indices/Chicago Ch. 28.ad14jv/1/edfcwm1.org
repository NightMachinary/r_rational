This chapter was fucking wild. Clownmuffle is some incredible horseshit. Hard to call her power a singular power, really, which is about as much as I can say and avoid spoilers. Interesting that she's doing her level best to ignore her Canadian adventure...

This entire fight scene seemed almost impressionistic, which suited the content just fine.
