The best answer I can give you is... not yet. I once expressed doubt about applying the [RT] tag - this kind of thing, munchkinry and so on, will eventually grow into the story. However, it is not the immediate focus. I was told that the tag probably fit fine enough, so I went with that.

A lot of rational stories tend to start out with a magically rational protagonist, who has tons of knowledge about decision theory and biases and all sorts of other things, who then proceeds to try and munchkin the universe. I'm not doing that - I'm going the long way around. It could be interesting to do, but we've already got /Lighting up the Dark/ kind of going that route, and I've got different plans.

First of all, I'm trying to portray a universe where nobody holds the Idiot Ball. If I succeed, we're going to have clever characters doing clever things, often foreshadowed as well as I can manage it. I suppose, so far it is "rationality" from a more normal, regular perspective, rather than the superhero version often portrayed around here.

I would not call Sakura a typical rational protagonist. A clever one, yes, perhaps - like Taylor in Worm - but not a HP:MoR style protagonist, or a more regular rationality junkie like Bella in Luminosity. Still, there's plenty of time for portraying character development in a realistic fashion!

I don't think anybody would be able to complain about the various munchkinry/rational themed things that will take place much later in the story, and I think my explanation for chakra and how it works and why, and so on, is moderately clever and at least fairly interesting. However, for now, the [RT] tag is tentative - though the story hopefully fits square into the main criteria given in the right sidebar:

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
- Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
- The characters solve problems through intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
- The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
