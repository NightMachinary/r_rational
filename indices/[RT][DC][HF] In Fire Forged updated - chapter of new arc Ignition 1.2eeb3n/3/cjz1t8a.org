I am having trouble keeping track of all the storylines of fics i am reading, and i can tell there is something major going on in this fic specifically, and some of it going over my head.

Besides the actual work and effort Sakura and co. are puting in their training, is there anything distinctly rational or munchkinry going on?

specific examples would be best.
