Yeah. The details that could make me conclude that Kakashi must have seen the mess weren't in my mind when I read the new chapter (or even the existance of the mess, to be honest. After all, I just thought while reading the old chapter that Kakashi made and I forgot about it).

I'm still a bit confused to be honest. Especially because it's repeatedly stated that Kakashi knew something without stating /what/ he knew.

It probably doesn't read that well if you spell out everything all the time, but, when Ino says "You're sure Kakashi knew?" does she mean "You're sure Kakashi knew someone else went through your notes?"

Because while reading, I kept wondering if it was meant that Kakashi knew about the missing hours. Which might be a very plausible guess, but not a sure deduction.
