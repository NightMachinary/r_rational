I like it when the author assumes that I'm smart. But sometimes that means that I don't quite follow. What does Sakura think that Kakashi knows (that someone searched her notes?) and why does she think he knows it (he admit he didn't make the mess?)? Somehow she seems to believe that Kakashi knows something about her missing hours?
