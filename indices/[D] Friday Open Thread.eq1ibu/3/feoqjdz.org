So, Weasel World Tour continues!

I'm going to be in LA, SF, and Vegas during the first two weeks of February. I'm following my husband who is following a band.

Anyone want to grab coffee / meal / touristy activity as I'm passing through?

Also, we need to travel from LA-->SF in one day. I want to drive - it's much cheaper and less stressful than flying IMO, and an eight hour drive split between three people (husband's best friend) is completely within the realms of what we as Australians think is culturally normal (I know I've driven 10 hours in one day split with one other person for work last year, with me doing about 60% of it). Is this a terrible idea, doomed to failure? Already planning on hiring the car for 3 days so we aren't stressing about returning it on time.

Any tourism recommendations for LA, SF, or Vegas? I'm literally going to Vegas to see Penn & Teller before Teller inevitably retires (he's just taken like two months off for back surgery!). I'm not staying at the strip (my hotel is near the airport), but the money I'm saving not staying at the strip will pay for Lyfts. I'm not a gambling person.

Also... how worried should I be about crime? I apparently lived in a dodgy area of Paris (I never once felt unsafe, but maybe I should have, IDK), but the thought of ending up in dodgy places where /the criminals routinely have guns/ terrifies me, and our SF hotel is like 10 minutes from Tenderloin. My parents said I should have a money clip with a $100 note on the outside and a bunch of other notes on the inside and if someone tries to mug me, I should throw it and then run in the opposite direction. Is this... actually a good idea?
