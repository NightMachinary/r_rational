  Flights from LA to SF are surprisingly cheap, but driving between them isn't a problem. Depending on the day of week and time of day, and where in LA you're leaving from/where in SF you're going to, traffic can add up to like 2 hours to the otherwise 6 hour drive. If the time isn't a big issue, drive up the coast even though it's a bit longer, the views are worth it. No idea what the cost would be to rent a car in LA and return it in SF, there's often an upcharge for that, but it's likely fairly common so it wouldn't be too bad.

It's going to be a Saturday, and the schedules I was looking at had us leaving between 7am or 9am (in order to arrive at lunch places around noon or one). I am very much open to learning what times in LA (we are leaving from Hollywood and going to Central SF) will be most conducive to avoiding traffic.

Cost: there's three of us with checked luggage, so the total cost for flights for us is about $450 AUD + lyfts each way. The total cost for the car for three days, drop off and pick up in central LA/SF respectively is $150 AUD + any garaging/valet fees.

Flights: also concerned about the time we'd need to leave the hotel to get to the airport in time to check in (apparently at LAX you need to check in 2 hours early for domestic?), traffic to and from the airport, and the risk of delays. Seems like the time saving is maybe not THAT much, though it is of course much, much safer.

Time: It looked like 6 hours for boring route, 8 hours for middle route, 11 hours for the really nice route. The 11 hour route won't be possible in one day, at least not if we want to be happy at the end of it.

  If you do drive up the coast, it's worth it to stop at one of the nicer seafood restaurants around half moon bay.

Vegan reporting in, but I've identified several vegan restaurants on the route so should be okay.

That's a relief, thank you! I think Australians feel about America and crime/guns as Americans feel about Australia and spiders/snakes.
