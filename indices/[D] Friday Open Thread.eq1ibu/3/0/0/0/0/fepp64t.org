  I'm not super sold on the Impossible Burger. I'd rather go with class raw food.

I'd love to have the impossible burger so that way I know enough to not be sold on it :). Thanks for the raw food recommendations - will definitely check them out especially if they're the local specialty, vegan-wise :D

300 USD pp is.... something I'd really love to do one day. I'm not sure if today is going to be that day, though.

Street tacos sounds awesome. I've heard the mexican food in the states is something else. We both love the chain mexican stuff available here and are ready to be blown away :)
