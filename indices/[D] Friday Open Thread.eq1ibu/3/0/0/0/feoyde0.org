I'm not super sold on the Impossible Burger. I'd rather go with class raw food.

Cafe Gratitude is the classic and there's a few around LA; and Abbot Kinney has The Butcher's Daughter.

Sugarfish is really good sushi, [[http://destroyer.la/]] is an amazing lunch spot in Culver City and it's food is nothing like you expect from the name. I've never been to Vespertine, but it's like $300/person and is supposed to be riduculous. You eat each course on a different floor of this building or something? The Tasting Kitchen is more "normal" fine dining ($150/person with wine pairing?), and the LA Dining Car is a 24 hour gourmet steak and lobster place.

At some point, get street tacos. I'm talking the full kitchen on a street type places, not the one person with a skillet ones. They're the staple late night food, too, since a lot of restaurants aren't actually open that late.

Food trucks are also a huge thing, and there's various evening meetups (like a farmer's market, only at night, with food trucks instead?) all over the place at different times in the week.
