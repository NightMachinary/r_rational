ah I didn't intend for my comment to constitute an argument for recycling that it may persuade you or others of the practice. Most of it really is motivated by the desire to see a new name associated with my comments, in the same way I might prefer variety in the clothes I wear. I tire of this name (though I was quite happy to have imagined it) and wish to try another. That's easily worth the triviality of a dozen clicks and several characters!

Your account only has a few dozen comments made in the same time I've vomitted up several hundreds. I can see the relative burden switching would incur were you to create new ones with comparable frequency.

Plus, the possibility of doxxing is non-trivial -- I've written some... controversial things, one might say, that doubtless many of my peer group could find quite revolting, if the sort of sputtering I receive online in response is any indication. Better to isolate any accounts so afflicted and move on! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
