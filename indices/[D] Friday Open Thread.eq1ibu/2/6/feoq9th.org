I change online names about once every 6 years so far.

I picked my first pseudonym when I was ~8. It was pretty embarrassing, to say the least. I switched to "couteaubleu" ("blue knife") when I was in high school. From what I remember, I was playing a lot of Minecraft and Call of Duty at the time, and the name came from there.

A lot of people in my internet peer group of the time poked fun at me for the name, and I eventually switched to "PoignardAzur" ("azure dagger"), which is essentially synonymous but sounds a lot less awkward. I sometimes use NarrateurDuChaos ("Chaos Narrator"), probably inspired by Pen of chaos and/or Reflets d'Acide.

Anyway, I never really recycled the accounts, I just created new ones as I moved to different social media platforms, which is why my cameo in r!Animorphs is called "Sergeant Knife" (I guess "couteaubleu" sounds kind of cool if you don't speak French).
