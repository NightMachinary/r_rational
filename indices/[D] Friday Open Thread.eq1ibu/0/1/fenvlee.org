In communities with sufficiently poor epistemological norms, catchy-but-obviously-invalid arguments take off because arguments are viewed as soldiers. It doesn't matter that everyone smart enough can see exactly why the argument is bullshit - you can't /say/ that, because that will be taken as a signal of disloyalty to the cause.

Over Christmas, I was with older relatives, and someone showed me "a real video of Iron Dome", which was obviously a computer animation, but was passed off as live-action footage. When I pointed this out, they became /absolutely enraged with me/ and repeatedly demanded that I /google Iron Dome/, because /they thought I was claiming Iron Dome didn't exist, presumably out of an antisemitic desire to pretend Hamas doesn't launch missiles at Israel/. When I made very clear that I was aware of the situation in Israel and was not /denying the existence of Iron Dome/, just disputing the physical reality of the video they showed me, which /appeared to have recorded in something like GoldSrc/, they fumed and literally stated that they didn't comprehend my motives in pointing this out.

I think a similar dynamic is responsible for the popularity of memes like "if Christ never existed, then why is there Christmas?". It's a faux argument. The purpose of the argument is not actually to convince anyone. It's a test to sort your enemies by submissiveness and your allies by adherence to arguments-as-soldiers - and if you view arguments as soldiers, then supposed allies who don't adhere to arguments-as-soldiers are traitors and should be treated the same way as defiant enemies. It's a tool for the construction of an echo chamber, composed of people who are either very stupid or want to be.
