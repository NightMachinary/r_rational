That just seems too... Organized? Premeditated? Manipulative? Idk. It feels like you're modeling Level One thinkers with Level Three thoughts.

Like, this is on a sign out on the side of the road. In trying to find the term for "the sign in front of churches" I read some things written by pastors for what sorts of things churches should put on their signs, and it seems like most churches use those signs to display messages that they think will draw people in to come to the church. I don't feel like it's likely that they put that message there for the purpose of scaring away people who have common sense.
