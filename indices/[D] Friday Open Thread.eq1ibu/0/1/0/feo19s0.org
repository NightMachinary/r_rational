I think you're neglecting the other side of possible responses to such arguments. It feels reassuring, freeing, and empowering to choose to believe gotchas. In so doing, you solidify your belonging to some community. Arguing with a gotcha is like trying to argue with a motivational quote poster. You're missing the point. It's not an argument at all, it's a cute observation that is fun to entertain and irritating to be forced to critically evaluate.
