Not being American, did you know that most Christians here believe that they have ownership over the entire holiday season, to the extent that they believe that any attempt to be inclusive of non-Christians with their "non-mainstream" holidays (like Jews with Hanukkah) by saying something like "happy holidays" instead of "merry Christmas" constitutes /a literal war against Christianity/?
