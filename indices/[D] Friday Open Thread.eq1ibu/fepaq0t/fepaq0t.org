A game I made during my winter vacation came out so good that I'm taking a month off of working on my startup to polish it up and sell it.

Does anyone here have any favorite irrational science fiction tropes? It's a game about building an interstellar rail network, so I'm trying to go way off the camp end to match the core concept. So there's lots of things like single-biome swamp planets. You can definitely find a planet-sized psychic crystal floating through space. More weird planet types would be a big help.
