  Does anyone here have any favorite irrational science fiction tropes?
#+end_quote

- Everyone speaks English

- FTL travel

- Sound in space

- Everything is lasers

- All alliens are humanoids; maybe with some lizard or insect mixed in

- All aliens are roughly the same technology level as us, or maybe slightly behind us

- Hybrid babies

- Human males are what all the alien women want to sleep with

- Time dilation

- Body snatchers (yeerks/goa'uld/etc)

- Planet busting guns

- Asteroid impact

- Hive mind species

- Aliens whose space ships/society looks like an apple store

- Planets of hats: "this is the accounting planet, where all the accountants live"

- Time travel

- Shrink rays

- Robots with the three laws

- Robot uprisings

- Cold war era themes that were prominent in Golden Age sci-fi stuff

- The russians are evil

- Racism and sexism ("favourite" is maybe the wrong word, but the old timey racism/sexism is hilarious in Golden Age stuff)

- What if phones, but too much?

- Twist endings (The Main CHaracter Was An Alien All Along)

- Body horror

- Shapeshifters

... that's just a few off the top of my head.
