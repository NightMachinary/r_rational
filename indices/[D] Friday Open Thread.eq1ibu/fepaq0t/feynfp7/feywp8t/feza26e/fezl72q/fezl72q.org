Already had it!

#+begin_quote
  Fusion candle gas giant planet
#+end_quote

These are cool. First I heard about them was when they were one of the higher ranking options on [[https://qntm.org/destroy][qntm's How To Destroy The Earth]]. I'm not sure if I'm brave enough to tackle the code for letting players move a planet in this thing though.

#+begin_quote
  Eder bubble worlds, smoke ring world
#+end_quote

First I've heard of these, will have to think a bit. Not sure how an Eder bubble is different from a ringworld, in terms of effects.

#+begin_quote
  Venus style balloon planet, Jupiter sunline
#+end_quote

What are these?

#+begin_quote
  Jupiter class ignition
#+end_quote

I'm not sure if I'm doing this, but [[https://krajzeg.itch.io/slipways][Slipways]], the game that inspired this, has it.
