Welp. Here we are, half way through January, and the church I have to pass every time I have to go to Walmart still has a Christmas-themed message on its marquee board. They've had it up for like 6 weeks. I've thought about mentioning it here a couple of times but not remembered until like Sunday or Monday when there's not much point making a new top level comment.

It's pretty ridiculous, something like "if Christ never existed, then why is there Christmas?"

Do you think the person who wrote that was being sincere? Like, that seems like parody, like somebody making fun of the arguments religious people present in support of the truth of their religion. Maybe a non-believer trapped in the church due to family and local culture somehow got put in charge of the marquee board?

Granted, this /is/ a redneck town in the U.S. South, so if there's a real person who actually thinks that's a compelling sort of "GOTCHA!" argument then this is where that real person would live. It just blows my mind that that's on a real marquee board in front of a real church.
