It baffles me that Americans associate Christmas with christianity so much.

For comparison, in France, we call the holiday "NoÃ«l", and there's a general understanding that it's a pagan tradition that was reappropriated by the Church, with added symbolism that has been warped and codified by 20th century commercialism.

Like, I remember watching that episode of The Simpsons as a kid where Lisa goes "I can't celebrate Christmas anymore, I'm a Buddhist!!", and being completely baffled by it. Why the hell would you need to be christian to open a bunch of presents and eat cake with your family?
