You know the local culture better than internet randos, but to me that could easily read like a joke. An interesting one. The joke being that it isn't literally true, even to the writer, but that it is true on a deeper, thematical level to them. A flavour of post-irony. I know /I/ routinely make ridiculous arguments in favour of things I genuinely believe.
