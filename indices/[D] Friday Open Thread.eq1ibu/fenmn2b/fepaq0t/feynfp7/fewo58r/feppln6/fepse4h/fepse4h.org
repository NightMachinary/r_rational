  So many humanoid alien tropes
#+end_quote

I should spend some time trying to come up with ways to have aliens. Weirdly enough this is the only sci-fi game design I've done where invoking Apes Or Angels is good for gameplay. Like... I was thinking you'd mostly find long-gone precursors, or make friends with a Matrioshka Brain.

  Time travel, shrink rays, shapeshifters

Do you know how much of a headache some of these are going to be to program? I'll probably make you get one from precursor aliens whose ship looks like an apple store.

  Body snatchers, robot uprisings

It's a peaceful game!

  Planet busting guns

I already planned on this one. Peacefully.

  Planets of hats: "this is the accounting planet, where all the accountants live"

It's a game where you decide what kind of hat the people on a single-biome planet are going to wear. Then the planets are connected via trains. I'll make sure to add a twist ending.
