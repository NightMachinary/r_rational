My first account was my first name and initials (I register it for most everything), but I got kind of weirded out by people going "oh hi, $name, how are you going?" and was posting a lot of personal and sexy stuff and was like, I do not want this associated with my IRL identity. So I made this account. I've had it for years.

And IDK, I feel like small subreddits have communities. Not to the same extent as the web forums of old, but they exist. I feel like my identity here has value, even if it's as "that person who always posts vampire questions on worldbuilding".
