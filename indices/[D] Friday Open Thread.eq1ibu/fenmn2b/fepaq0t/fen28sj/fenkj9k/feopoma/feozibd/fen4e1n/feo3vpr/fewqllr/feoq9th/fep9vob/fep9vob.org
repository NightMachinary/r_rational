I have a pattern of deciding I want a new username to represent a new focus in what I want to post about, picking a name that's appropriate to that topic or posting style, then almost immediately changing posting styles to something that doesn't work with the new name. Maybe every six years or so.

I had a perfectly reasonable name that was a bit linked to my professional identity, wanted something better for shitposting, and immediately spent most of the time on that doing serious posts on feminist boards. Later I decided I wanted a name better for representing my professional projects, and mostly ended up using it to complain about capitalism.
