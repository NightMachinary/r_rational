This is my second account. I lost the first after my account got flagged for suspicious activity, and I discovered I'd made a typo when entering my email address, so I couldn't accept the recovery email. This account was supposed to be temporary while I got that sorted (hence the name), but by the time I did get it back, I realised I'd said a lot of cringeworthy things I'd rather keep in the past, and the new name had grown on me. I'm also less worried about IRL people finding this name, which is a plus

I'd had the first one for about three years
