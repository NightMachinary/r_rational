Used to be at least once a year, when I was still more active in politically charged conversations. Back then, someone starting to stalk me and send nasty PMs was a more regular phenomenon.

Now that I actually have two communities where I regularily discuss stuff and spend time actually engaging with people instead of just the content someone posts, I've been more reluctant to abandon this account.
