To answer your question, I've never done purposeful recycling. I keep my identities fairly isolated and focused and that has been enough so far.

I don't quite understand why you do the recycling. Is it just the "new start"? How is that enough value for the trouble of, at least a dozen clicks, and even writing several characters on the keyboard? I mean, if the site is large enough that your identity has no value, how can abandoning it have some?

You add a few reasons at the end, but with a "Plus", as if you have laid out the main argument already.
