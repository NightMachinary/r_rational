I try to keep the same identity over time and also across websites. The last time I recycled an identity ([[/u/callmebrotherg]]), I announced it in this thread (I think of [[/r/rational]] as the center of my reddit experience) and maintained the "callmeX" formula so that people who didn't catch it would still be able to figure things out. If I ever dropped my current account, then I would still maintain that formula unless I was abandoning /everything/.

Part of this has to do with marketing (if I mention my worldbuilding books and somebody's interested in those, it's easier for them to find the books if my identity is coherent), part of it has to do with enforcing kindness on my part (if my reputation is tainted then I can't just drop that identity and start afresh), and part of it has to do with "I just like it this way."
