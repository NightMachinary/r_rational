We've got really nice beaches here, me and my husband both grew up like 10 minutes from the beach, and we've holidayed all over south east asia, so, uh, we've seen our fair share of nice beaches; is half moon bay just a really nice beach? If so, it's probably not going to be worth it for us. (We freaked out in New Zealand when we saw a pebble beach...)
