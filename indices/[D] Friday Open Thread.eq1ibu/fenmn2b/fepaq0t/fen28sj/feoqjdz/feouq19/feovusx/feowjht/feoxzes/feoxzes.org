Weekend is fine for driving. The important thing is to avoid weekday rush hour traffic at each end.

If you have the time and don't go that way on the drive up, a day trip down to half moon bay is usually worth it. Though maybe a bit less so in February.

I'm sure the vegan restaurants would have better stuff, but nearly all decent restaurants in both LA and SF will have good vegan options. There's a lot of vegans in the area.
