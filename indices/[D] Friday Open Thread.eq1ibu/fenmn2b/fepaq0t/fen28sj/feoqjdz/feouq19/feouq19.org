LA has a few nice weird things. The "Museum of Jurassic Technology" is a good afternoon thing. The museums at USC usually have a cool rotating exhibit (I dunno what's there now?), and there's a few more excellent art museums around. If you can do an evening, I recommend "Clifton's" downtown for drinks.

If you're a foodie and have a serious budget, there's a few places I can point to. If you want to stay on the cheaper side, there's others. If LA has a "specialty", it's actually raw food. No one does the hippie thing better than Westside.

For SF, I recommend doing the "Exploratorium" and then eating at The Slanted Door in the ferry building (they're blocks away from each other).

Drive time is ~6 hours, but you want to pay attention to miss traffic on both ends, or you'll get fucked.

I would not generally worry about crime. You will not want to walk through LA's Skid Row, but there's no reason you would. I'm less informed about SF, except that cars get broken into (while you're gone) all the time. I would, in general, not worry about crime; I walk around all over the place all the time and never had an issue. Then again, I'm a moderately sized man. If you're worried, just lyft/uber instead of walking if you're at all worried about the area. Note that in both LA and SF you can go from ritz to oh fuck in like two blocks, so don't worry about being that close to the Tenderloin. Also, weed shop nieghborhoods usually look sketch but they're actually pretty secure while the shops are open.
