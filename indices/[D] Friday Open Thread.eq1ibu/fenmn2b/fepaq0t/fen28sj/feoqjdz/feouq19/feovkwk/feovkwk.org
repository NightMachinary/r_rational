  If you're a foodie and have a serious budget, there's a few places I can point to. If you want to stay on the cheaper side, there's others. If LA has a "specialty", it's actually raw food.

I love food, and enjoy expensive meals on occaision, so it's definitely possible. Vegan, though, which means I was more or less planning on going to the most highly rated vegan restaurants in those areas (me and my husband are so excited to try the Impossible burger). Not a huge fan of raw food, but hey, if it's good it's good.
