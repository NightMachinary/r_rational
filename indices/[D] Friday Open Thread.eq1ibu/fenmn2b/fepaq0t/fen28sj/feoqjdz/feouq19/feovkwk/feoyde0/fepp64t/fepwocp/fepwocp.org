You can just get them in stores :)

Oh! Go to Santa Monica beach on a Sunday and watch (or join in) with the acrobats, and then go eat at Cha Cha Chicken's. It's amazing. A couple blocks away there's also a Mexican place with something like six different kinds of mole sauce.

By and large I would not otherwise eat in most LA mexican /restaurants/ - they're, I don't know, watered down? But the street food is amazing, and there are a few real gems.

Tocaya Organica is a good vegan mexican / moden america fusion place with a couple of different locations.

And yeah, Vespertine is legendary. It's supposed to be one of the major locations for molecular gastronomy, and I think the build it's in is from an architecture school in the area? It's weird.
