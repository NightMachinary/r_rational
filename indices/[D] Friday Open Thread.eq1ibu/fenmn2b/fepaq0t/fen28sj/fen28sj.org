How often do you recycle internet accounts, if at all? On reddit, for example, I'll usually start fresh every two years or so (going back ~10y), around the point when I reach ~10,000 comment karma, which I've incidentally just attained (also, this is my 1,000th comment according to [[https://redditmetis.com/user/phylogenik][here]], which does provide a nice poetry). So I'm now once again thinking of what new name to choose for myself.

It's nice to get a "new start", so to speak, and I feel like I'm not losing terribly much on larger sites like this when shuffling identities. In my earlier experiences on the web (c. the mid-2000s) I feel like I found myself in much smaller communities of a few dozen members, where everyone knew everyone else and deeper, persistent relationships could form. But in larger spaces I'm unlikely to really encounter the same person enough to be able to recognize them and they me, so the benefits of having a new name outweigh the costs of severing a few very meager, superficial ties.

Plus, it makes future biographers or would-be doxxers earn their keep ;] lazy bums
