Flights from LA to SF are surprisingly cheap, but driving between them isn't a problem. Depending on the day of week and time of day, and where in LA you're leaving from/where in SF you're going to, traffic can add up to like 2 hours to the otherwise 6 hour drive. If the time isn't a big issue, drive up the coast even though it's a bit longer, the views are worth it. No idea what the cost would be to rent a car in LA and return it in SF, there's often an upcharge for that, but it's likely fairly common so it wouldn't be too bad.

If you do drive up the coast, it's worth it to stop at one of the nicer seafood restaurants around half moon bay. Make a reservation ahead of time if you're doing it on the weekend or after 6 on a weekday, they get pretty busy.

I don't have a lot of experience with tourist stuff in SF, but the one recommendation I have is the alcatraz island tour. You take a boat out to the island and there's an audio tour around the prison. It takes a few hours, but I had a lot of fun. You do need to make a reservation in advance for that too. The other tourist stuff is fine, Pier 39, Ghirardelli Square, the Ferry Building, etc. Mostly crowded and overpriced, but that's normal for tourist stuff and it's usually worth doing it anyway.

SF during February is colder than you would think, especially if you go out in the bay for the alcatraz tour. There's lots of parking, but you have to look for it and probably walk a bit. It's totally worth it to get one of the parking apps, I use spothero, that lets you find the cheapest parking and pay ahead of time. It's the difference between paying $8 and $30 for a days parking. Or just leave your car at the hotel and take an uber.

Crime isn't a big problem. The most likely thing to happen is to have your car broken into if you use street parking, but that's still fairly rare. You would have to be really unlucky to actually get mugged, much less with a gun.
