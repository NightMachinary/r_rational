I went to San Francisco on vacation this past August. If you felt the dodgy area of Paris was not noticeably dodgy, you probably will be fine with San Francisco. I have never been to Paris but San Francisco did not seem worse to me than the big cities in the northeastern USA I visit more often. If you're aware of your surroundings and acting appropriately, you should be fine*.

*I am male and not small, and had this pointed out to me when I commented on SF homeless vs other cities homeless. But I also assume if you have experience in large cities and feel able to cope, you shouldn't have a problem in SF.

I did not do Alcatraz because it requires advance reservations and is so popular it was too late for me when I selected SF as my vacation destination, but I was there in the summer so the waitlist may be shorter for you if you choose to try for tickets now. Lots of places have good views of it, in any case.

My first day involved hiking through Chinatown to Coit Tower, a truly awesome place of awesomeness. Coit Tower has Great Depression era murals on the ground level, good views of the sort of stuff you're likely to want good views of at the top. In Chinatown, I visited a few temples which mostly don't permit photography, sadly. The area near the gate is a tourist trap, so unless you like tourist trap stores I would focus on restaurants or the temples if you choose to go to Chinatown.

If you like hiking, the Presidio is great. Also for biking, no idea if the weather will be good for biking, thank you global warming for letting me ride my bike in January in New York where I thought we were supposed to have snow. If you like art, there is a nice museum called the American Legion in the Presidio, focusing on European art, and one called the De Young Museum in the Golden Gate Park focusing on American art. I rode a bike from one to the other, hugging the coast when not in one or the other park. The Palace of Fine Arts is not a museum but is pretty cool and I suggest it. There is also a science museum right next to the De Young if you prefer science museums. I am reminded of a roommate from my hostel who was a very new transplant from Adelaide and found the science museum delightful.

My dad charged me with going to Mark Twain sites. (He lived everywhere.) They no longer exist as such, so far as I can tell, but the Transamerican Pyramid is located at the spot where he lived.

I hung around the fisherman's wharf area a bit but it was, in my opinion, a bit underwhelming apart from the sailboats and the view. I liked the park/bicyicling compatible bits but not the tourist trinket bits. If you like tourist trinkets, this is the prime area for it.

The Muir Woods are very close, maybe a half hour drive at most, over the Golden Gate Bridge. Redwoods, giant trees, very cool to me, tour guides were like 'can you believe they wanted to log this', my family background includes logging adjacent activities and I can totally believe they wanted to log it.

If we were together in person, I could scroll you through the photos on my phone and give a really boring account of exactly what you should do in San Francisco which would consist of 'do everything I did but better.'
