  "Let's say I collect thirty hearts a day, every day, for the past eighteen years. I assume you're still fantastic at math?”

  “98,550 hearts,” replied Sander, nearly automatically.

For the reader's sake, translations have been made whenever the subject of weeks and years are brought up. At the time /The Glimwarden Chronicles/ takes place, the calendar system in use was a remnant of Tor Ellsum. The clergy there used a base nine numbering system, which was largely vestigial in Light's Hollow. This calendar had nine-day week-equivalents, nine-week month-equivalents, and a nine-month cycle. This resulted in a calendar with 729 days, with a single extra day tacked on at the end to make up the difference (Tripartite Day). As the Jorón lived on a planet with years equal in length to our own, each calendar cycle covered two orbital periods. While the clergy might have found the symmetry of nines pleasant, there were some obvious problems with regards to this calendar, namely that some conversion was necessary if (for example) you wanted to plant your crops at the same time each orbital period. Nevertheless, no later attempts at reform met with success, even after society had largely switched away from the nonary system.

Whenever a year is expressed, it refers to an Earth calendar year rather than the Jorón calendar year, which is twice as long. This is primarily to avoid confusion with regards to ages, all of which the reader would have to mentally double if translation was more literal, e.g. the text would describe Sander as being eight years old. Depending on context, I have sometimes translated the Jorónese word for a nine-day calendar period into a literal "nine days", but in many places I have simply left it as "a week" since it seldom matters to the narrative whether a week consists of nine days or seven (and a declaration of nine days might feel oddly specific if the reader does not know or remember the cultural context).

Sander's math is therefore somewhat more simple than the translation would suggest, because he is only multiplying basic numbers together and doing a standard conversion from nonary afterward.
