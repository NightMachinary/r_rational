Sander is a good character. I'm liking his personality and his self-awareness. But remember most people aren't that self-aware, so having both a self-aware quasi sociopath and self-aware Sander is quite a bit.

Hmm, I'm guessing there's a degree of diminishing returns with eating hearts, or else glimwardens would be more politically powerful than they appear to be in this setting.
