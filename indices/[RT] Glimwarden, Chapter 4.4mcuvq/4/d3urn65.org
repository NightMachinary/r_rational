Something I was confused about before that hasn't clarified on reread: the first chapter says

#+begin_quote
  Killing a darkling wasn't supposed to be about making a killing blow, or even removing its body parts one by one, it was about inflicting enough cumulative damage that it was left with no reserves.
#+end_quote

This gave the impression that taking down Darklings is a battle of endurance in most circumstances, a diminishing of HP bars that theoretically can make a group of them dangerous even for experienced Glimwardens (since they can't just one-shot them with superior power).

But that seems to be exactly what Merry is saying her guns are capable of. Except when she shot it:

#+begin_quote
  The darkling didn't seem to be effected by the hit; it began sprinting toward them, occasionally pushing off the trees with its claws as it went by for more speed. Sander had thought that it would die from the pistol shot; he stepped back with his borrowed pistol drawn. For her part, Merry had drawn a dagger and seemed unconcerned by what was happening.
#+end_quote

Not even a visible loss of substance, until

#+begin_quote
  She had stabbed it through straight to the very core and killed it in the instant that it jumped at her.
#+end_quote

So apparently a one-shot is possible if you can pierce the heart, but that's difficult normally because of all the substance being in the way. My hypothesis is that the bullet bored a line through its substance near enough to the core that she could just pierce it with a dagger and go for an insta-kill. If that's the case, why didn't it close its wound the way it did against Sander? Not enough time? I get that Merry's not the best verbal instructor, by her own admission, but I think it can still stand to be better explained.

Looking forward to seeing the new type of monster in action next chapter!
