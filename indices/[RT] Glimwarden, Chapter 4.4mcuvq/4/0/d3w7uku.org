If I had to guess, I'd say that a darkling is basically a construct like the Lanterns that utilises the energy of the hearts in a different way. Damaging it saps energy from the system (potentially causing it to lose coherence), but destroying the heart shuts it down outright.

I'm not terribly confident in that model, but it makes a nice literary parallel with the Lanterns. "HP and heart=crit" makes about as much sense, but doesn't quite fit with the technical portrayal of the Lantern technology.

In this case, Merry was either trying to illustrate the issue of effective range with her pistols or trying to goad the darkling into attacking.
