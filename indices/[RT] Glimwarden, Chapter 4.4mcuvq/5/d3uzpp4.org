Mhhh... As other people said, the fact that the town in completely glimlit instead of bordered by a glimlight fence probably means that the centre of the ring wouldn't be safe from darklings, either because they can spawn in or because they can bypass the fence.

Could you make a hunting reserve that way? If the darkling spawn inside, it would probably be a much safer hunting ground than the forest, with bunkers, easier scouting, etc. The amount of darkings there might not be enough to sustain the lanterns, but it would still be a nice bonus.

Otherwise, I like Sander's arrogance here. He says: "Half die in the first year, but it's not so grim after that. If you could figure out why that first year was so bad then you'd be able to mitigate whatever factors are at play."

Okay, so let's say those factors are, 1: they suck at fighting, and 2: their bones are too easy to break because they haven't eaten enough hava yet. What do you do about that? Make double sure the darklings don't eat you?
