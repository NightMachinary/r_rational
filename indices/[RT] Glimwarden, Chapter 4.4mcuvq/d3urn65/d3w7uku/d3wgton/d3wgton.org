The idea that destroying the heart shuts it down makes sense to me too, but that would presumably make you harvest less of it, if it's harvestable at all. Apparently it just splits when you try to crush or bite down on it, so I'm not sure yet why stabbing it would "destroy" it unless the act of splitting it is what makes the darkling lose coherence.
