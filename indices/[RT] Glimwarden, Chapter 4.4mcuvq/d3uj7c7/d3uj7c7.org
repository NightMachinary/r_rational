So I wonder about limits and hacks to the system. Lanterns 2-7 are usually built in the natural hexagonal circle packaging. What happens if you then turn of the middle one, taking care to have a high flux in the interlapping zones?

Do darklings just SPAWN inside the light hollow? If not you can get away with much fewer lanterns overall. Either no one ever tried - or they did with catastrophic results.
