Interestingly, if the lanterns work by some sort of dipole or 4D effect, but the evaporation of their central hava sphere is dependent on it's 3-space area, it would be entirely reasonable for their field strength to be dependent on the diameter^{3,} while the rate of hava consumption went as diameter^{2.}

That would mean that, fences aside, protected land area would be a constant function of the rate at which hava was used up. This would help account for the uniform design of the lanterns: there's little cause to want to make different sizes.

Risk aversion (in a simple single-wide fence, one lantern failure lets darklings into the core, which is large compared to the ring in which the residents could seek refuge), the loss of useful barely-lit hinterlands, and the sheer manpower required to maintain so many more lanterns would be sufficient to explain why fences aren't a thing - at least for mid-sized places like Light's Hollow.

Big places could have a double-thick fence, which would require TWO lanterns to fail before the core was compromised; and if the second, inner, fence was composed of lanterns mounted on rails...
