Glimlight clearly works on some sort of principal beyond our physics. The most clear example is that intensity falls off by 1/r^{3,} which seems to suggest either that it's some sort of dipole effect, or that it's propagating in a 4-dimension space. In either case, it's unlikely that mirrors or fiber optics will work the way you would want them to.
