Really, you can extend the idea: say a lantern "protects" any volume which receives sufficient flux. So, if you can turn off the middle Lantern, it makes sense to instead have lots of smaller Lanterns in a fence, so that you're not wasting as much Light.

While you're at it, since you just need to achieve some minimum flux, why not make the Lights smaller and denser? Maybe more efficient. If the tech is there, you could instead use fiber optics (or mirror system, or similar), to direct light from a central lantern (or perhaps 2-3 for redundancy) out to the exterior.

An enterprising individual with good control of lantern output and direction could aim a beam of Light from the lantern, creating some targeting system. That could be the ultimate form of a Lantern.

A Lantern is the most wasteful use of Light, because the other forms (human consumption, runes) are permanent gains, whereas the Lanterns only temporarily illuminate the city.
