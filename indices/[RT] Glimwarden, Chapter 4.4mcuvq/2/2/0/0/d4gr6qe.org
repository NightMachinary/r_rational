Well I think we know set ups aren't a thing but I have a hard time believing that the Glimwardens wouldn't just dig a pit and shoot darklings in a barrel in order to farm if it was possible. Or build a tower.

Though to be fair they could build a trench then bring a travelling lantern over and all the darklings in there get evaporated.
