Ugh. It's a good thing to have critics, but I really wish the criticism was /better/. Most of the issues the author seems to have with rational fiction really only hold for bad fiction. Having competent antagonists and secondary characters is a founding principle of rational fiction. It is definitely possible to evoke the feeling of a genre without jumping directly into its traps and inconsistencies. Rule based magic systems allow themselves to be used as major solutions without feeling anticlimactic. Trope longevity doesn't necessarily indicate the quality of a trope.

The observation that characters seem to become less human in rational fiction is true somewhat more often than the others. It's not true most of the time however and isn't a necessary part of rational fiction. Characters failing due to biases and errors in judgement is a hallmark of rational fiction, and I think rational fiction does a better job of handling this than a lot of other genres. It is a much more enjoyable thing to see a character make a mistake and then have that mistake dissected and analyzed than to have a character fail and never learn from it.

This view of rational fiction seems to take the worst pieces of fiction that claim the label and then say that the problems with them are inherent parts of rational fiction as a genre. This is problematic.
