Also, quick question. Does Practical Guide To Evil count as rational fiction? Everything there happens because the plot requires it, but in that world Plot is, pretty much, a force of nature. It also violates second rule (factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil") in a pretty obvious way.
