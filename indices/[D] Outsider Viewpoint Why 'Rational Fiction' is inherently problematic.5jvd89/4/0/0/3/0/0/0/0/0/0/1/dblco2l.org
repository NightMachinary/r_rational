  How do you define what a setting's rules are?
#+end_quote

Whatever laws of physics/Not!physics are in play. E.g. Name magic in PGtE, Rule Of Three stuff, interraction between magical weapons and Named, all that stuff. Characters may or may not be correct in their assumptions about the /actual/ rules.

  I'll cede the discussion if, from an explanation of where we currently are in the plot, you can offer a general prognosis of how the story will develop in the short term.

O come on, that's not fair. We are literally one interlude away from the epilogue of this book. That's pretty much the most unpredictable place in the whole story-this revolution of Hero's Journey just ended, new one will begin in the next book, we already received our Boon and other stuff.

I /think/ that Heiress never actually wanted to rule Liese, and in the interlude we might see what her actual plan was. Given some previous foreshadowing about her father -"if he'd genuinely found a way to make flying fortresses less costly it could be very useful"-her wanting Liese just to use the population as sacrifices is a real possibility. That would also pay off all the mentions of flying fortresses in a satisfying way. Another possible plot development is re-appearance of Lone Swordsman as an undead abomination under control of the Heiress, since his body is in an extradimensional bubble controlled by her, though I don't think he will play a major role.

Hmm. Now that I think about him, we never saw the end of that supposed "redemption story" with him. Catherine is so in tune with her villainy that she isn't getting redeemed any time soon, but Swordsman was certainly doubting his heroism by the end of it. Problem was, he couldn't be redeemed as long as he was allied with the Choir of Contrition. If, however, he is raised as an undead abomination, and sees that Callow being governed by Catherine /works/... That has possibilities. I'll add it to the Possibility Hat.

In general, I think next book (I suppose it's possible that this won't happen until book 4, but I don't think that is likely) will focus on Catherine accquiring a new name, like The Dark Queen of Callow. To do that, she would have to overcome three challenges somehow related to Callow. I think that Heiress would be defeated by the end of the book, after 3 encounters with her (either the same ones, or a different parallel set), which would signify the triumph of New Age villainy over the old age crazyness. Procer is likely to make some sort of move soon too, since they had that Stairway thing and were clearly just using the rebellion to buy time. Catherine is likely to end up needing to protect Callow from a crusade at one point or another. Also, there were two elves who were heading for Liese to do something important there.

TL;DR predictions for the interlude/epilogue, from most to least likely:

- Heiress unveils her evil plan related to Liese
- Procer starts to make their move related to crusades
- Elves do something in Liese, very likely relating to Heiress
- Catherine finally tells the Empress what she wants (to rule Callow)
- Swordsman's body is mentioned and/or he is raised as an undead
- Black gets an explanation from the Empress
- Robber's Name is confirmed
