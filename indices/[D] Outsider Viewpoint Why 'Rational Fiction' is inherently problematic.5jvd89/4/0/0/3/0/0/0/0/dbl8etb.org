  I'd define author fiat as a deliberate subversion of probability in favor of the plot. That way you can still check for it backwards:if the resulting action was highly improbable even despite the explanation, then it's bad and not rational fiction.
#+end_quote

But the problem with "checking it backwards," is that the author gets to decide the probabilities /after/ the fact. That lets them skew the probabilities to whatever would work, again making the lack of a fair play whodunit effectively author fiat.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, just re-read that part of the book knowing what the character knew at that point? If some action seems out of place, author fiat happened. If everything is fine, it's still rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Knowledge is power. Central to the idea of rationalfic is that characters don't get new powers as the plot demands. Even if the character could have reasonably expected to have that knowledge, not revealing the knowledge to the reader beforehand makes it a result of plot fiat, because the author could have made up any other piece of knowledge and used it instead. [[#s][Spoilers]]

I even run into this problem myself-- in my own fic, even though I (try to) foreshadow discoveries about the magic system in advance, I could easily have interpreted the magic system in some other way, and the readers wouldn't have known. As such, I don't consider my fic as meeting requirement #4, and only consider it as fulfilling #1 and #3 because the main conflict is political, rather than being about the magic system itself.

  What character knows isn't rules, I don't think.
#+end_quote

This might be a definition issue, as mine is pretty wide. I define a setting's rules to be any in-text thing that restricts how the reader can expect the plot to progress. For example, prophecies, limits on superpowers, clearly-deliniated moral boundraries, etcetera. Out-of-text narrative causality is not part of those rules.

Thus, I consider in-character knowledge as part of a setting's rules because, at least in a rational fic, a character's actions are constrained by what they know (as opposed to fortuitous hunches).

How do you define what a setting's rules are?

#+begin_quote
  See my post here. It's actually pretty causal, with strict Plot structure.
#+end_quote

I admit-- this /could/ negate my previous arguments. I don't have any direct arguments against your conclusions, but I'm not convinced that they have /predictive/ power.

I'll cede the discussion if, from an explanation of where we currently are in the plot, you can offer a general prognosis of how the story will develop in the short term. I'm not asking for specific events (that would be unfair) but more a prediction of which part of the hero's journey will be hit in the near-future of the story. I don't tend to read particularly in depth (I love PGtE, but I'm not really the kind of person that does a ton of analysis), so, unfortunately, you're going to have to PM me, but I do promise to accept any reasonable interpretation of how an event matches up with your prediction.

"Reasonable" is of course a bit of a weasel word, so to more rigorously define it in this context, I mean that an interpretation must concern a plot-advancing event, rather than one intended primarily for characterization or world-building. I also ask that, under your own subjective judgement, no superior candidate for some other, disjunct part of the cycle happened prior or after. (For example, you predict that we're at "call to adventure" and that we'll see "refusal of the call," but a candidate for "meeting with the mentor" happens before to the refusal.

I'm dropping burden of proof pretty hard on you, and I'm sorry for that, but you seem like you'd be doing this kind of analysis anyways :P
