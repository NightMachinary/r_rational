Well, you define rational fiction not how I define it-e.g. I don't consider it "Central to the idea of rationalfic is that characters don't get new powers [knowledge, in this context] as the plot demands". Characters can get things as plot demands it, as long as there is a plausible reason for it(as there was one, in the case of Catherine) I am not sure what else is there to discuss. I agree that a lot of appeal in rational fiction is being able to guess where the plot is going to go, but I don't think it's strictly /necessary./ Often happens due to how the four rules interract, but not absolutely required.

EDIT: lemme still give you some analysis of PGtE though, one minute.
