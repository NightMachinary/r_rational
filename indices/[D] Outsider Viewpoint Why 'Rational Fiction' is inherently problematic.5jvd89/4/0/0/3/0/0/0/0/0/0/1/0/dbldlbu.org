Thank you for the analysis. I don't think all of your prediction follow from internal logic, but there are a fair number I'd not only concede the argument for, but be actually convinced that PGtE is a rational fic, and not just ceding the argument on its technical merits.

#+begin_quote
  ...she would have to overcome three challenges somehow related to Callow.
#+end_quote

While a little vague on the timeline, you're making this prediction directly because of the setting's internal logic, so if Catherine needs exactly three callow-related challenges to get her name, this will definitely convince me that PGtE is a rationalfic.

#+begin_quote
  I think that Heiress would be defeated by the end of the book, after 3 encounters with her (either the same ones, or a different parallel set), which would signify the triumph of New Age villainy over the old age crazyness.
#+end_quote

If this happens, I'll cede the argument. Conditional to the "triumph of new age villany" being directly acknowledged in story, I'd also be convinced. The disparity is due to the fact that, as the viewpoint character, I'd expect Catherine to win anyways, so just her beating Hieress alone wouldn't quite convince me.

#+begin_quote
  Heiress unveils her evil plan related to Liese
#+end_quote

As your top prediction, if this happens in the epilogue, I'll cede the argument and be convinced of PGtE's status as a rationalfic, on the logic that if you can make a prediction that precise, then clearly the internal logic of PGtE is well define enough to be rational.

#+begin_quote
  Robber's Name is confirmed
#+end_quote

I myself can see where this follows from PGtE's internal logic, so if this happens in the epilogue, I'll both cede and be convinced.

#+begin_quote
  Procer starts to make their move related to crusades\\
  Elves do something in Liese, very likely relating to Heiress\\
  Catherine finally tells the Empress what she wants (to rule Callow)\\
  Swordsman's body is mentioned and/or he is raised as an undead\\
  Black gets an explanation from the Empress
#+end_quote

I'm rather iffier on these, as these predictions don't rely on the setting's internal logic with regards to narrative causality. If any of them happen in the epilogue, I'll concede, but probably won't be internally convinced.

So now we just need to wait for the next chapter. Which is hard enough /without/ the resolution of an argument hanging over my head :( How could you do this to me, man?
