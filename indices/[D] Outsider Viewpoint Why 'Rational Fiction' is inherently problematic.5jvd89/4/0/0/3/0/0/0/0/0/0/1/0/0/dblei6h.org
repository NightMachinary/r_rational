  While a little vague on the timeline, you're making this prediction directly because of the setting's internal logic, so if Catherine needs exactly three callow-related challenges to get her name, this will definitely convince me that PGtE is a rationalfic.

It will probably be more like 3 to get the name-3 to do something else, since both books so far seem to split into two roughly equal parts.

  I myself can see where this follows from PGtE's internal logic, so if this happens in the epilogue, I'll both cede and be convinced.

I don't think Robber having a Name is extremely likely, but it seems to be so sensible. He is known as "the craziest goblin", casually does unique memorable things (e.g. that thing with the demons, or him riding a bomb towards the gates of Liese and then surviving the blast), is quite often involved in situations where only Named should really participate (e.g. he was the /only/ non-Named in the room when Catherine was respawned). All of that points to him having a Name, in my opinion.

  I'm rather iffier on these, as these predictions don't rely on the setting's internal logic with regards to narrative causality.

Yeah, they aren't terribly convincing, but to be fair, my original post was 50% bullshit on the spot anyways)

  How could you do this to me, man?

That was my evil plan all along. MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA
