These days I see the word used as a broader (thus also harder-to-criticize) alternative to racist / sexist / etc. That's how [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=problematic][Urban Dictionary]] lists it. It's sometimes a useful tool, sometimes a bothersome rhetorical tactic.

But in this instance it is indeed used as a synonym of "sucks".
