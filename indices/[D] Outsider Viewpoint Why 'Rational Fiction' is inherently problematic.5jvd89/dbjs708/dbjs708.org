I can't help but think that these critics are, like, being so incredibly and unnecessarily mean, for whatever reason. It's like a palpable sense of disgust radiating from their every post, especially the thread OP's. Which is somewhat ironic, given that trying to stay as unbiased as you can is a major tenet of rationalist fiction, and these critics are so inherently biased against rational and rationalist fiction that they actually ended up rationalizing their reasons for hating it.

Amazing.
