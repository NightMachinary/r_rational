I guess I meant more the sub-community I'm part of; it was not at all my intent to exclude you or any other [[/r/rational]] members from SV. SV is a pretty broad church, and includes a number of different tribes, often with relatively limited contact with one another. It's fantastic that you're a part of our community.
