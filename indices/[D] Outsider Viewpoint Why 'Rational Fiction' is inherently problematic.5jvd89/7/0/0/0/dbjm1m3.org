For the record, I think that Harry was frequently a smug, obnoxious jerk. I also think he had the best intentions, cared a lot about people and the world in general, and was really clever.

The people in the thread keep saying that he "doesn't act human". He doesn't act like an 11-year-old, true. That's a little jarring, although there's an in-universe reason. I think what they really mean is that "he behaves like a utilitarian and I believe that no one behaves like a utilitarian and/or utilitarians are horrible people because they do things that I see as bad on a local scale just because it's good on a global scale."

HPMOR definitely had flaws, but I enjoyed it tremendously, despite thinking that Harry was often smug and obnoxious.
