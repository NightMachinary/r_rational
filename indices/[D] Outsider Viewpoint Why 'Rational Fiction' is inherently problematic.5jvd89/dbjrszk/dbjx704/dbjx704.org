I don't think this SV thread is a good environment for constructive debate. Whatever the reason, most of the discussion I've seen is mostly of the "You're wrong! Here's an extensive list of reasons why!" "No, YOU'RE wrong. Here's an extensive list of every single factual inaccuracy you said!" kind.

(plus debates about LoTR, but they're still better than all the toxicity)
