Guy from the thread you're talking about here! I'm a member and moderator on Sufficient Velocity.

If you guys think there are specific clarifications you can raise constructively (and it seems like you have a number of them), then I'd encourage you to come along and do so. We can appear like a somewhat acerbic community at first, and we have a few boylishly mischievous members like Jemite, but honestly we're a pretty friendly bunch when you get to know us. ^{_^}

More viewpoints raised in the friendly and good-natured way that rationalists tend to when approaching others could only enrich the discourse, I'd hope. Even if you just repeated some of the statements you'd made here addressed to the posts or comments you felt relevant, I'm sure it would make a positive impact.

Hope to see some of you! : )
