  Guy from the thread you're talking about here! I'm a member and moderator on Sufficient Velocity.

  If you guys think there are specific clarifications you can raise constructively (and it seems like you have a number of them), then I'd encourage you to come along and do so.

Hi, [[/u/Admiral_Skippeh]].

So, as far as raising objections constructively, do these posts count?

Those are the ones I found in two minutes of searching and copy/pasting links from a search of the first three pro-RF people I happened to remember offhand. There's plenty more in there, and by other people. Yes, we've engaged and almost without exception we've been polite and constructive. (I freely admit that my last post in the thread was /not/ polite.)

I read through the first 6 or 8 pages and tried to engage productively three separate times, all to no avail. In all that time I did not see a single anti-RF person make what I would consider an honest argument. No one offered benefit of the doubt, no one really engaged with our points, there were numerous ad hominem attacks...shoot, their definition of rational fiction was tautological to start with and they refused to update when more constructive definitions were offered.

  We can appear like a somewhat acerbic community at first, and we have a few boylishly mischievous members like Jemite, but honestly we're a pretty friendly bunch when you get to know us. _^

No. This is not "boyishly mischievous", this is rudeness and contempt. Here are some quotes to demonstrate what I'm talking about:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7515607/][Jemnite, post #1]] Okay, first before I start, I should probably define what 'rational fiction' is. It's that sort of odd fanfic trend where you see people go, "You know what this setting could do? SCIENCE. MOTHERFUCKING SCIENCE ALL OVER THE PLACE," except oftentimes it just means they cram if full of psuedoscience and strange philosophical arguments which have nothing to do with the scientific method at all?

[...]

"Rational fiction [...] hollows out the story and creates glaring faults and defects within it. It's popcorn fiction in the truest sense, it strokes the reader and author's ego for being so 'rational' and 'smart', so that they're too busy with gratification to see the major problems."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7515977/][Jemnite, post #11]] "And if you can say a story that says that is still 'rational fiction', I think you are blinded by your own self-conceits and cannot see past them in order to acknowledge that something you like might be bad."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516046/][Random832, post #13]] "Another thing that rational fics suffer from is that the protagonist [...] is always a Mary Sue."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516533/][Reveen, post #18]] "And frankly if you ask me, the better in terms of writing quality the work of fiction is, the less it will distinctly seem like rational fiction."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516775/][firefossil, post #24]] "Rational fiction is inherently disrespectful of the original work." [...] "In short, rational fics are generally bad at fiction and bad at rationality."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516967/][firefossil, post #32]] (In response to Kiba saying: " So I don't know why would anybody, rationalist or not, think like Vulcans.")

"Start with all rationalist fiction and all people who write it."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7518032/][Guessmyname, post #52]] "Being told I was in the same lofty halls as the aforementioned MoR author wasn't exactly the most en-heartening thing in the world, either. It just comes across as one of those bizarre internet personality cults that lives five miles up its own arse, desperately attaching itself to other things like a fungus to feel bigger and more important than it actually is."

--------------

This is just from the first couple of page, and there was a lot more that I could have included. This is not boyish mischief, this is something that we would be entirely within our rights to call a [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/help/rules/][Rule 3]] violation on.
