Bit of a late reply here because I've been busy, apologies.

People in my community can be robust in debate, and like all communities there are a few who can occasionally tend to make it a bit too personal, but fundamentally I think our users turn out to be pretty friendly if you get them on a human level. There's also a phenomenon in these quotes of imagining what rationalists must be like without thinking they've ever spoken to one- I think this diminishes a tad later on. Don't feel critique of what are words at the end of the day is necessarily personal, and remember that our community has quite a diversity of opinion as well.

Thank you all for attempting to engage in the thread. Even when there was not as much mutual understanding as might be hoped, I think you broadened the discourse.
