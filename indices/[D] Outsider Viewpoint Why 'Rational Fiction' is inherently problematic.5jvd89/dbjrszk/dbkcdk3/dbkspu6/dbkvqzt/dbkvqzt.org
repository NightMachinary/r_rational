Just for the record, who are you talking about when you say "my community" -- do you mean all of SV, or just some small subgroup that hangs out on one particular subsection? It sounds like you don't consider the people from this subreddit to be in that group, yet we are very much part of SV. [[/u/Velorien]] and I write one of the most popular quests on the site and there are plenty of people from [[/r/rational]] participating in every part of SV. We were part of that discussion, we were part of the debate, yet we managed not to be "robust" (which appears to be another euphemism for "rude", much like "boyishly mischievous").

Seriously, you need to stop making excuses for these guys. Rude is rude, and what was on that thread was not okay.

EDIT: And the fact that, as I just noticed, one of the other mods locked the thread proves my point. Seriously, not okay. Stop making excuses.
