He's absolutely correct about pretty much everything he's saying, except for the fact that it only applies to bad rationalist fiction.

His first point about the main character being smart giving everyone else an intelligence downgrade is pretty funny, since most (well done) rational fanfiction actually gives the background and main characters more intelligence than canon, not less. I do agree that there's plenty of "HEY IM HARRY LOOK I SMART, DUMBLEDORE WHY ARE YOU SO INCOMPETENT AND SENILE," but you honestly can't say that those shit fics represent the whole genre.
