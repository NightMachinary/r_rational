I think the complaint about character writing is very valid. The most charming characters in all rational fiction are in HPMOR, and they borrow a large part of their charm from canon. Can someone give examples of charming original characters in rational fiction?

The complaint about deconstructing settings instead of playing with them seems valid too. Even when describing very fantastic toys, rational fiction is usually goal-oriented rather than playful. Can you name a piece of rational fiction that's as playful with its toybox as the original Harry Potter?
