  Can someone give examples of charming original characters in rational fiction?

I liked the crew in babyeating aliens. It's a short piece so obviously the presentation isn't very in-depth, but they're not vulcans.

  Can you name a piece of rational fiction that's as playful with its toybox as the original Harry Potter?

/Explicitly/ rational fiction (i.e. self-identified rationalist)? I think the closest is Mother of Learning. +Non-self-identified... Omelas?+ (see below)
