Omelas? You're calling /Omelas/ playful? What do you mean by "playful," then?

/Those Who Walk Away From Omelas/ grabs one image, shoves it in our face, and wiggles it about a little to make sure we notice. To me, "playful" connotes whimsical use of many, or at least multiple, images and connotations. I don't know of any rationalfic that can come close to canon /Harry Potter/ on that, but... for something in that direction, maybe Scott's [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes]["And I Show You How Deep the Rabbit Hole Goes"]]?
