That is a much better term. "Rationality", "rationalist", and "rational fiction" are all valid terms and I see why they were adopted, but they are terrible from a marketing standpoint. They are inherently divisive -- "if you don't agree that this is awesome then you are irrational!" Not the best rallying cry.

"Hardened fiction". Great choice.
