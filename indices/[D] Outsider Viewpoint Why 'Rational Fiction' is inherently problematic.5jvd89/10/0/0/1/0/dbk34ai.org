There's still a pretty big leap between a story being a Romance, and a story having romantic elements (such as Star Wars). I wouldn't call Star Wars a Romance, there's a very particular focus that romantic stories have that Star Wars delegates to the backburner.

Which makes the comparison to Rational pretty apt, I suppose. We have a conflation of vocabulary between Rational the genre that presupposes munchinry, transhumanism, AI, competency porn, and setting fixing, and the rational elements that we have on the sidebar. We've noticed this problem and have bandied about "rationalist" to attempt to address it, but I think that's fixing a different problem.

So as usual, I guess we have vocabulary to blame at the heart of it all. Rational the genre, vs rational elements, and one side is talking about one while the other is objecting about the perceived sleight on the other.
