The one dude who called the term "rational fiction" a "marketing term", while being derisive, wasn't /so/ far off the mark. I'm not so sure that rational fiction is a genre so much as a collection of secondary attributes that can apply to any genre. It would be like calling "stream-of-consciousness" a genre, when it's really more of a tactic or style used.

I think this is supported by the fact that "rational" is a bit of a sliding scale; no one gets into arguments over whether or not a story is fantasy, or more fantasy than another fantasy (barring perhaps Star Wars), but whether a story is rational is very much greyscale. Some stories are more rational than others.

In addition, would it be possible to have a rational story that did /not/ overlap on any other genre circle in a venn diagram? A rational story that was not also a mystery, or a superhero story, or a sci-fi, or what have you? If it can't stand alone, I'm not sure it deserves to be called a genre.
