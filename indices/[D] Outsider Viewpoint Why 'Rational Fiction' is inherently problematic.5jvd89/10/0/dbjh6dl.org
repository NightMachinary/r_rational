  That might be the case for rationalist fiction, but rational fiction really just stands for writing that people around here like.

I kind of disagree with this. I mean, yeah, we had to find a label for it and that's the one that stuck, but "rational fiction" pretty well describes the core tenets of the genre, as defined in the sidebar and on the tvtropes page and elsewhere.

I don't see why we should back down from the label and say "Rational means good for us." No, rational fiction means rationally written and explored fiction. Not all rational fiction is "good" and not all non-rational fiction is "bad."

And that doesn't mean my taste in stories isn't affected, to some degree, by how rational it is. I liked The Dark Knight even though it's got plotholes big enough to drive a batmobile through, but I didn't like The Dark Knight Rises because those plot holes were big enough to sink a football stadium into. (Was it a football stadium? I forget. You get the point.) If TDK was more irrational I would have liked it less, and vice-versa. But I can explain why, objectively. That I care about those things is part of my personal taste, but those things themselves are not.
