I feel like a large part of the disagreement is the expectation that =rational= fiction should be a well defined genre, with sharp lines deciding whether a particular fic is or isn't rational. That might be the case for rational/ist/ fiction, but rational fiction really just stands for writing that people around here like.

And hey, it might be that the things that make some book good to us (consistent characters, a sensible setting that follows its own rules, etc) are also the things that make some book good to other fanfic communities. There's definitely a self-selection process going on here. Thus the occasional statement of 'rational just means /good/'.

It doesn't. Rational means good for us. "50 shades of grey" and "Twilight" are /good/ fiction. Look at the sales! People *LIKE* them. Maybe not the people around here, maybe not the kind of people that go into detailed analysis of particular fiction genres on online forums. But others do.

So we need a word for a particular class of writing that appeals to us, that is consistent and well characterised and avoids plot holes etc. etc. Because we used to call that 'good', but that is empirically incorrect. And 'rational' is a word, it fits the spirit of the concept, and so it took off.
