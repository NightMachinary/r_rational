Haven't started volume 12 yet :)

My meaning was that I doubt it's suddenly going to veer into grimdark territory. Harry Potter had characters die by the end too, but I never really doubted that the good guys would pull through. I get the same feeling from /TGAB/; it's not a criticism, just an echoing that the "tension" isn't at the same level as, say, /Worm/ (which frankly I didn't like as much as I like /TGAB/).
