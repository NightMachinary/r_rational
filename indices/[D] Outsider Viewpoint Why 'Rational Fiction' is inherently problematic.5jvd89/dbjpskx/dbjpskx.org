The part of this that resonated with me was the section about lack of tension. Good rational/ist fiction /does/ have tension, but I can't deny that I've stumbled into more than a few "fix fic"-type stories where the hero just smugly solves every problem without setbacks, and it becomes less of a /story/ and more of a dressed-up list of complaints about the original work or genre--or, in some cases, a love letter to the perfect brilliant rational hero. Of all the traps this type of fiction can fall into, that's always the one that disappoints me the most.
