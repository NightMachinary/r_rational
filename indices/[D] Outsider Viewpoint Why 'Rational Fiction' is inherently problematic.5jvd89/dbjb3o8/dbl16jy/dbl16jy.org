Maybe that was high-handed of you... but literally the OP starts by defining rational fiction in the most insulting way possible (and such that only a caricature of HPMOR fits his definition), and then various posters continue with either claiming that rational fictional=good fiction (despite numerous counter examples of good fiction that is not 'rational') or lumping all rationalist fiction in with the worst traits of HPMOR or any number of misunderstandings that show they have only read 1 or 2 rationalist stories and not bothered reading the subreddit of tvTropes page at all.

So the thread was probably going to be shitshow regardless.

Edit* expanding on my post because I thought of more points to rage about... Earthscorpion shows up to tone police, not the numerous other insults such as calling rational fanfic fans EY cultists, but rather Daystarelds' post calling them out. People trying to get the thread "back on topic" by returning to the OP even though OP was poorly thought out and/or outright trolling, also ignoring what little advancement the discussion has had from OP. The LotR being brought up 3 separate times, with the discussion repeating itself down the same way. People asking why JJBA isn't rational in order to call [[/r/rational]] too general... like wtf, in JJBA new applications of powers and powers themselves are randomly invented every couple of fights, the fights often consist of absurd guesses and predictions of opponents actions... trying to call it rational to prove that rational fix definition is too general seems especially disingenuous to me (for the record, I found the dozen or so episodes I watched to be fun, but too repetitive for me to watch the whole series).

So I think your mistake was trying to fairly engage with them at all.
