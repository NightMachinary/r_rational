Just made it to the end of the thread... ironically it was locked a few pages after the discussion had turned mostly civil.

  I disagree with this. There are people who legitimately don't know what the community is or have never heard of places like LessWrong.

From my lurking on space battles and other forums, I have seen people that know that lesswrong is just a collaborative blog yet still choose to use the "cult" label. At this point, "sneer troll" is probably the correct label for them. As to informing third parties, a link to lesswrong itself along with a few of its better posts should be enough to let someone figure out the cult claim is bullshit.
