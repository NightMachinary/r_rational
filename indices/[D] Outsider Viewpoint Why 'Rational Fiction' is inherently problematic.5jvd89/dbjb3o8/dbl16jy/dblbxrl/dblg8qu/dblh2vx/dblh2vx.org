Yeah, in future situations, upon returning to a thread after being away a bit, I'm definitely going to read through to the present part of a thread before I start responding to the people who responded to me, so as not to shift the tone back if it's moved on.

I disagree with this. There are people who legitimately don't know what the community is or have never heard of places like LessWrong. I think it's worth pushing back against accusations of being a cult. I could be wrong though.
