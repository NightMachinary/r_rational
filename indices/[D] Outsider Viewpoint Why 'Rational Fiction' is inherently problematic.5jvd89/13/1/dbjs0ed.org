  The part of this that resonated with me was the section about lack of tension.

Do you have some particular works in mind? The only recommendation from this site I've read recently that felt like this was /The Gods Are Bastards,/ but really it's just because after 11 volumes without a main character dying or suffering a disastrous failure, I tend to expect them to make it through somehow.

I'd still recommend the series, though; great world and character building.
