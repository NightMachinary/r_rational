This definitely happens in some rational fiction but I don't see it as endemic to the genre, and certainly not a defining characteristic of it.

A lot of stories, regardless of genre, are poorly plotted. Rational fiction is neither exempt nor exemplar.

It's a tricky thing to balance, sometimes, maintaining tension without resorting to deus ex machina or contrived solutions ("But wait, what if I try something I've never done before nor will ever do again?" // "That's so crazy it just might work!"). If it were easy to do then there wouldn't be so many examples (across all media and genres) which get it wrong.
