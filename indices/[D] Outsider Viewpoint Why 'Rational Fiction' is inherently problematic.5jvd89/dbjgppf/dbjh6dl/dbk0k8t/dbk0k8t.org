On the rational writing podcast, when discussing the definition of rational fiction, the idea that it was 'thinky' fiction came up, that a common feature in rational stories is that they made you think about what was going on.

I think it's slightly more general than that, and I'll say that I think the (or, at least, /a/) core of rational fiction is that intelligence is a core virtue of the story. Battles will be won and lost primarily based on who had the better plan, who prepared more, who improvised the quickest, and so on. This would be in contrast to the 'generic action show' where Determination and Fighting For What You Believe In are core virtues that decide the outcome. In generic action show, whether the battle is won or lost depends almost entirely on whether the hero can get his second wind when things look down (often triggering some superpower to justify the success of said second wind, but it's the same thing).

This explains quite a few things, such as why rational fics tend to have anticlimaxes more than usual. You specifically /need/ a long, drawn-out fight to show off the raw willpower and determination of the protagonist at the climax, but in rational fiction you don't specifically need that, since you can show off the cunning of the protagonist and the extent they planned and prepared or the quality of their improvisation in a single scene where the enemy was outsmarted and simply had no hope of victory. Of course, you can do drawn out fights this way too, but the key is that it's not /required/. The focus on intelligence also helps explain the attention to detail and consistent rules, since your protagonist is supposed to live and die based on whether they can plan things out and grasp for advantages, and an inscrutable 'as the plot demands' ruleset is incompatible with that, whereas you don't /need/ the rules to behave the same way to force your protagonist to the brink of defeat before their show of determination and second wind.
