  The one dude who called the term "rational fiction" a "marketing term", while being derisive, wasn't so far off the mark. I'm not so sure that rational fiction is a genre so much as a collection of secondary attributes that can apply to any genre.

This. I had to stop reading the thread because People Being Wrong In Obvious And Simple Ways is very frustrating, but I was hoping that we might be able to come up with a better definition of rational fiction.

I like how you describe it as an approach rather than a genre. Maybe it's comparable in that sense to e.g. "grimdark." I don't think that you can quite have a "grimdark genre" but there's definitely a cluster of shared qualities, and you could easily have an [[/r/grimdark]] that talked about grimdark fiction. Hell, insofar as some people think that all good literature has to be depressing as fuck, you could easily see a "Why 'Grimdark' is Problematic" thread where some of the posters are arguing that "grimdark" is just being used to describe good fiction and is a useless term.
