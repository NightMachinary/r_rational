Oh absolutely, there's rational sci-fi and rational fantasy and so on. But I don't think there's any reason it needs fo stand alone to be a genre.

I actually think of it like "romance." Lots of settings and stories can be considered romance stories in addition to their other descriptions, but if you just call something a romance story, or a rational story, the implication is that at the very leasr you know something about it, even if it's a modern, realistic story.
