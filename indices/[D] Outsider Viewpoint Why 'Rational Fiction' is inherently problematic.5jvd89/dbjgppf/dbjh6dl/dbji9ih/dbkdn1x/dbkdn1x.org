Right, but I think that again conflates the two meanings of good? Apologies if the below doesn't make sense; I haven't tried to express this before and am not willing to spend a long time getting it intelligible. (do let me know if this at least aims in the right direction, or if it's completely useless)

You can write a 'good', well-written, consistently characterised, internally-making-sense story, and it still not actually being liked by anyone, and not /good/.

You can also (though it seems very hard, and I don't know whether it was ever achieved) write a story with completely non-conventional/'bad' writing, that makes no sense, but still is so emotionally evocative that it is well liked and /good/.

Most people don't really care about the 'good'/'bad' distinction; it's somewhat correlated with the story being /good///bad/, because in the extremes 'bad' is incomprehensible to everyone. But if you naturally take stories apart, try to figure out how they work, guess at the rules governing the imagined word... If that is essential for you to enjoy a story, then /good/ can de facto become a subset of 'good'.

The way these concepts map for me, 'good' is rational. No one's interested in /bad/ 'good' stories (uninteresting, boring rational stories), so it doesn't get talked about. /good/ 'bad' (compelling but non-rational) stories are rare for me, because of how I enjoy fiction, but common in popular culture.
