Ah. Makes sense. Thanks!

For the record: I got a 25-point infraction for a snotty departure post. I didn't try to convince the mod to reverse the infraction, but I did ask why there were no infractions for the OP and 15 pages of the anti-rational-fiction crowd being anywhere between condescending and flat-out insulting...especially since some of the people doing that were themselves mods. (I'm looking at you, foamy.) The answer was that mods are just people and are free to be as rude as they want as long as they don't mod a thread they're in. There was no clear answer on why the OP and/or the anti-RF crowd weren't being infracted.
