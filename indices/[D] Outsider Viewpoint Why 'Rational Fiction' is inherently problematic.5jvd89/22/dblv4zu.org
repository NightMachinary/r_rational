I just checked out the thread again. There have been some pretty interesting points made.

I don't know when I'll be able to do it, but I'm pretty sure that I'm going to go through the thread, collect the good stuff that's been said, add it to some thoughts that people have expressed here and elsewhere in the past, and put it together for a sort of update on the rat!fic discourse as it currently stands.

Is there anyone else who would be interested in this?
