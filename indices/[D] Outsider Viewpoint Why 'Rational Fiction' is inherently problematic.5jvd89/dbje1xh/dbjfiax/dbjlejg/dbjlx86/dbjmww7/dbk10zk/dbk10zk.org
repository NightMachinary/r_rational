In the immortal words of one crazy pyromaniac:

#+begin_quote
  “Are you going to do that thing where you give me cryptic advice that later comes in useful at a critical moment?” I asked, trying to convey how irritating that particular habit was through my tone.

  Black took a sip from his cup, though not quickly enough to hide that he'd actually been a little offended by that. I tried not to be openly amused, though not very hard.

  “Well not now, I'm not,”

Thanks for the link.
