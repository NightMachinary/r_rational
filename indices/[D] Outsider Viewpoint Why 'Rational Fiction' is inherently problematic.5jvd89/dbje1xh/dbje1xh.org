Does anybody actually care what that jerk on sufficient velocity thinks of rational fiction? Are the things they're saying common misconceptions, are they things that will harm the reputation of this genre and of people who read it? Or is it just some random person who doesn't matter who learned to speak trollish as a second language so that they could post on the internet about how angry they are that other people like something they don't like? And if that's the case wouldn't it be better to just ignore people like them because anything we say to them would only fuel their trollrage?
