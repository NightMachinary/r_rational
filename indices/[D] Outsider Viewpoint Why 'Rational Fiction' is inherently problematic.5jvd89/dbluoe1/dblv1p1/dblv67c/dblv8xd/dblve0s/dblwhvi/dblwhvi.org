So, I read 1.5 chapters. Findings:

1. Fic is fun. I will probs reads the rest.

2. lots of weird plotholes about how the flying monkey who talks to people who see him crashland his aircraft, blows up bars, punches people through windows, drinks soy sauce, flies visibly and lands in public places, etc, is never considered to be an alien or z-fighter or whatever. He does insane terrifying things and people just completely fail to react.

The specific events where people fail to react are basically:

1. When he lands on the car park, the people see he is an alien. He flies off supernaturally (seemingly). There is no response to this.

2. He flies in public, right up to the restaurant, and walks in with his tail visible, then drinks a bottle of soy sauce. The response of the owner is "ah, he must be american" (hilarious, yes, but also the dude's an alien)

3. he blows up a couple of bars with his powers. It doesn't sound like he systematically eliminated nearby witnesses. In bar #3, he punches a dude through a window and out into the street, then gets another drink. no reaction from bar people, not even mentioned.

The next day, there seems to be no major changes to anything, nor any reactions from anyone, not even in real time, etc. This is still a great fic but requires significant suspension of disbelief during the first 2 chapters that the world is populated by actual thinking humans.
