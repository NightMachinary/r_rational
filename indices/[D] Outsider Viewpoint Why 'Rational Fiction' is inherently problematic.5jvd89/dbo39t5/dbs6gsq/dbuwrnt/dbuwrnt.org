Right? Hell, "Rationalism" isn't even why I read the stories. Just that they try to be more grounded and play everything straight. So Hardened Fiction is a closer term to what I enjoy anyways.

And yeah, that's a good point. "Yeah, I like rational fiction." "Oh, I see, so I just like irrational fiction?"

Instead it's like "I prefer hardened fantasy." "Oh, I like the more traditional fantasy myself."
