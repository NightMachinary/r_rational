Having just spent a few hours reading through the entire thread, I actually got something out of it.

After much concideration and analyzing what I like about "rational fiction," or rather what I most enjoy when I find it in a story and the rational fiction community tends to have a solid cross section of, is Hardened Fiction.

Thus, I shall be using Hardened Fiction to define my tastes in the future.
