I would not count Worm as rational fiction. it does have cases of characters thinking things through, but it also has as a more or less explicit conceit that shards mess up people's ability to be clearheaded and get along, as well as having cosmic entities that think in arbitrary ways and several plot devices. And not every character uses their abilities in the most efficient way (I have a hard time seeing why Contessa doesn't get up each week and go "path to having a list of the 20 most interesting things that will happen this week, by my current standards and assuming no further uses of this power".)

Some of these things are arguably rational, but I'd say they are only rational in a trivial way. "People fight because shards make them want to" is, literally, people doing things for a reason, so the definition is literally satisfied, but I think that goes against its spirit.
