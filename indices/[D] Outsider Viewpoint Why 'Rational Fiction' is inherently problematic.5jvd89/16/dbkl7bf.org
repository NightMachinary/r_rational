So, points that I found somewhat reasonable from that.

- Our definition of "rational fiction" is too broad.

I think this is largely related to "The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent". Some of the posters there couldn't tell whether or not a world was sane and consistent, saying that "star wars" and "lord of the rings" were.

- Our use of the world "rational" implies that we think we're better then them, and that rational fiction is strictly superior to all other fiction because it's rational.
