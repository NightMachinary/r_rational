The part that amazes me is that they felt so strongly about this issue that they actively went out and started a discussion about it, just for the purpose of saying how awful this thing that they don't like is. They have denied and ridiculed the genre as a whole, as well as the very polite and reasonable words of the rational-fiction fans who have tried to engage with them.

Seriously, did a rational fiction author kick their dog or something? I asked them, but no one will respond.
