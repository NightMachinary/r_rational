  The part that amazes me is that they felt so strongly about this issue that they actively went out and started a discussion about it, just for the purpose of saying how awful this thing that they don't like is.

Meh, this is very normal and fun. You just don't like being on the receiving side. Do you remember that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5as909/spoilers_doctor_strange_is_the_antirational_movie/][Doctor Strange is the anti-rational movie and I hate it]] post we had a while ago? Pretty sure the director didn't kick any puppies.

Sure generalization is unfair but nothing new. We've seen that before with fanfiction being ridiculed. Presumably a lot of bad rational fiction has been uploaded and they got sick of seeing it.
