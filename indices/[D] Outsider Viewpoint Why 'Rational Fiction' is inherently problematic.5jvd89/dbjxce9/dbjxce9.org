There are a wide range of genres and characters focused on hypercompetance. Pulling out applied science and problem solving as a bad place for it seems nitpicking. No one seems to have issues with Conan being good with a sword. Large sections of mystery as a genre are people who solve crimes that baffle professionals. No one has issues with mcgyver solving problems as long as he limits himself to solution sets that include duct tape.

I do think some people have issues with stories about people who are outliers in terms of temperament and approach. I've seen a number of people who are upset that the martian is not a meditation on human isolation because they can not imagine themselves or anyone they personally know be able to keep their calm in a crisis, but such people do exist.
