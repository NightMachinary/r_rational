I don't find myself on either extreme, but am definitely closer to "HP is a little shit" than "HP is so adorable I just want to hug him."

OTOH, I'm not in love with HPMOR either. I do like it a lot, but I think that it has a number of flaws and its chief value is not in itself, but in the genre that it inspired.
