Not necessarily. An AU fic might take a world build by someone else, and just /add/ new things to it, rather than changing//correcting/ things.

So a fic that takes a world, and says 'this thing doesn't make sense, i'll make it better'... That's pretty disrespectful, yeah. (Though I don't really much care about fanfics being 'respectful' to the source; parodies are fun, fix fics are fun).
