So I somehow stuck it out until page 14 before finally giving up, but here's a thing that puzzles me. Quite a few people in there were saying that they find rationalfic /disrespectful/ to the original work.

I have this ongoing thing where I try to explicitly notice and dissect perspectives that completely surprise the hell out of me -- as in, "Wow, that idea wouldn't have occurred to me at all, and I still can't quite make sense of how anyone would come up with it". (Came up with this practice because I occasionally get social advice from socially adept family and friends, generally in response to some perceived /faux pas/ on my part, and about 80% of the time I wind up with this flabbergasted feeling of "Why would someone even /think/ of that?!")

This is one of those WTF ideas. I've seen it before from a bunch of friends who enjoy writing fanfic as well. How does this work? Is this some generalized dislike of all AU fics? Because as far as I can tell, if you think AU fics are okay, then this 'respect' business is just nonsense.
