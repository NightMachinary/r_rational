I am totally onboard with your original post; I would +1 insightful if that were a thing Reddit did.

That said, I would like to offer warning to your edit:

First off, the categories you are dividing people into have an implicit value statement: the people who like cerebral things that are useful and require skill and/or diligence are being put in one group while the trivial hobbies are going in the other. That's okay until you class the groups as "us" and "them."

Second, my sense of society is that most people would reverse your definitions -- "geek chic" refers to programmers et al, while "nerds" refers to comic book readers and D&D players in mom's basement.
