A lot of the confusion regarding what rational fiction /is/ seems to come from the fact that literally nobody from SV in that entire thread managed to understand that the bullet point definition that's being given is an extensional definition, not an intensional one. It points in rational fiction's general definition, it's not a fully complete necessary and sufficient set of constraints by which rational fiction is defined. It's like pointing to a bunch of red things to define what red is, rather than defining a specific wavelength range of light. In addition, the bullet points in the sidebar don't really mean "it's definitely rational fiction if it has these qualities." Instead, they're more along the lines of things that something has to have or it definitely /isn't/ rational fiction. Actually narrowing things down from the stories the bullet points bring forward to just the stories that a reader of [[/r/rational]] would call rational fiction would take a bunch more bullet points.

On an unrelated point, they seem to viscerally hate us, and I /recognize/ that flavor of hate. It's the type of thing I see whenever someone else in the room fails to hide how nerdy they are. I mean, look at the language they're using. Robotic. Not human. That's pretty familiar to me.

I really didn't expect SV to get in on the whole "let's hate the nerds" thing, considering, y'know, they're nerds. But apparently to urge to hate nerds is so strong it can infect nerdy communities and make them hate /more/ nerdy communities.
