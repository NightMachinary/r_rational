All of these points are false and/or solve each other.

For points two and three, of course most fiction hase genre caveats and weird people who do things without using logic. The whole point is recognizing that fiction is riddled with these characters and putting a rational character into the middle of them. The main reason a lot of rational fiction is fanfiction is it's poking fun of and exploiting the fact that the cannon characters do irrational things and pointing out how they're being irrational.

Further, point two is definitely false. You can easily have a character who's rational and logical but isn't a cold emotionless robot. For example, basically any educated person in real life. Certainly some characters in some rational stories go too far, sometimes on purpose sometimes not. But since typical stories don't even attempt to use logic or rational behavior in the same way that humans do, it's not unreasonable to try to add some more logic. If you tried to write as realistic a character as possible into the Harry Potter universe, it would certainly end up looking a lot closer to HPMOR than it would to cannon.

As for point one, it's also blatantly false. You can write a story in which multiple or even all characters are rational. Or you could write one with rational characters and "normal" story characters. Maybe they'll look stupider in comparison, but it's only necessary to actually make them stupider if you're making a Mary Sue rational circlejerk fanservice sort of story. in HPMOR, he did sort of make Dumbledore... not stupid per se, but kind of weird in my opinion. But Quirrelmort was definitely rational. Hermione and Draco were rational at least in so far as they did things for well thought out, intelligent reasons. And most of the other characters were just sort of normal people.

Mostly this guy is just sort of taking the worst flaws that some rational fiction writers make and trying to argue that they're somehow inherent and unavoidable to the genre as opposed to over-exaggerations that some new writers occasionally make. An issue that occurs in all fanfiction, not just rational ones.
