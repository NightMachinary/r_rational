So I binged through the rest of the thread... it looks like eventually the discussion actually shifted in a somewhat more productive direction of discussion the definition of "rational" "rationalist" in a manner that at least got the two sides talking to each other. Ironically, you jumping back in with responses to older comments dragged the discussion back down some. Of course, given the overall crappiness of the original post, and the regular repetition of points already addressed, its not like anything of value was lost.

  Hopefully I learn from the experience and do better next time.

I think you've already done better than EY's worst case of every "critic is a sneer troll", so there's that. In the case of this thread, I think the best case would probably have just been to respond to the few legitimate points, explain why the "accidentally" insulting comments were insulting (example: many people empathize with characters like HJPEV and actually talked like him as a kid, so calling him an inhuman mindless robot is insulting to these people), and outright ignore the directly insulting comments (i.e. [[/r/rational]] is a cult, this comment is not even worth trying to address).
