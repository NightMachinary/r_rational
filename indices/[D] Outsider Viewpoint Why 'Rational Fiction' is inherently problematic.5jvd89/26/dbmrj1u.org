I don't know why I click these kinds of links any more; I really don't. I visited the linked thread and saw... pretty much exactly what I expected to see: vitriol, name-calling, strawmanning, one-sided discussion--in other words, stuff that's completely par for the course when dealing with anti-"X"ers. I mean, like, seriously: once you've seen one of these threads, you've seen them all.

There've been a lot of comments in this reddit post expressing confusion as to why the posters on SB/SV like doing this sort of thing so much, why their "criticism" is pretty much universally awful, etc. To me, the answer is quite simple: they don't like us. Some might call it tribal rivalry (though I think "rivalry" gives it a bit too much credit, as it implies that the dislike is mutual, which I don't find to be the case). EY calls it "sneer culture". You might call it something else--but we all know what it is I'm talking about: there's a group of people you don't like, so you insult them as much as you can, with each insult feeling deliciously cathartic, like getting to punch your sworn enemy, etc. etc. etc. ... and I really don't think there's anything more to it than that. You might protest at that, telling me to give other people the benefit of the doubt--and normally, I'd be all for that. But this, it seems to me, is a case that is ridiculously clear-cut: there are no doubts worth giving the benefit of.

So posting this sort of thing to [[/r/rational]], in my opinion, accomplishes little. It creates some needless drama, provides little actionable advice, and is thoroughly unpleasant to read through--to say nothing of actually /engaging/ with such "criticism". (Mad props to [[/u/DaystarEld]], [[/u/eaglejarl]], [[/u/blazinghand]] and [[/u/hackerkiba]] by the way; you are more patient people than I.) There might be thoughtful and useful criticism of the rational-sphere out there, but to find it, we need to look elsewhere--because this ain't it.

Aaand... I don't know what else to say. Mostly I'm just tired of having to go through this same damn song and dance every few months, or however long it actually takes before another SB/SV'er gets it into their head that creating another "I hate +Eliezer Yudkowsky+ rational fiction" would be a /hilarious and original idea/.

Seriously. Can we stop doing this? Thanks.
