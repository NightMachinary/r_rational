I find this exchange on page 15 funny:

    The definition of rational fiction has been debated at great length, so I'm not going to touch on how it applies to unaffilliated works, but stories written to fall into that category follow guidelines summarized on [[/r/rational]]'s sidebar:

    Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

    Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

    The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

    The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

  Which runs into the same issue that's been raised over and over - by this description, The Lord of the Rings is rational fiction. I Want My Hat Back is rational fiction. Frozen is rational fiction. Star Wars is rational fiction.

Really, as their examples of things that fit these criteria they picked /The Lord of the Rings/ and /Star Wars/? They would be hard-pressed to find worse examples.

/Star Wars/ literally has a dark side and a light side of the force, with the Empire committing genocide and the rebels saving planets of cute aliens.

/The Lord of the Rings/ was explicitly constructed to be an epic about the conflict between good and evil. That's the entire point of the series.

It is simply staggering to me that they could say something so fundamentally incorrect yet still believe that they are shedding light on someone else's unacknowledged biases.
