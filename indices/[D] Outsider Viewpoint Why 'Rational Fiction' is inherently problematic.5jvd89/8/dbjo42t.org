Such an odd rant. One of the reasons I really enjoy rational fiction is because this:

#+begin_quote
  One: To create a hypercompetent main narrator you must make everyone else incompetent.
#+end_quote

... is not supposed to happen. I can think of several rational or rationalist fanfictions I've read where the source material has much more incompetence; HPMOR, R!Animorphs, Pokemon: TOoS, Metropolitan Man, Luminosity.

I wonder what the ranter had been reading?

  Which leads into the second problem with rational fics: the characters are too focused on 'intelligence' or 'rationality' and somehow forget to be people.
#+end_quote

Sometimes I can see this as a valid point, but usually the longer a work goes on, the less I feel that way. I've been eating up /Heroes Save the World/ recently and originally felt the kids were just too emotionally detached to be believably dealing with the situation... and then I get to an entire chapter that focuses on the trauma it's been inflicting on one of them.

And in some other fics with rational themes (if not exactly rational entirely), it's a plot point. In /The Games We Play/ it is mentioned as a plot point several times that the kind of modifications and trials facing the main character should be cracking his mind like an egg, but his power helps protect him and make it no more traumatic than, well, a game.

  Plus what's the point of having real conflicts if your character will just go 'this is the optimal' solution, solve it, done done NO FUCKING TENSION AT ALL.
#+end_quote

Again, this seems to make no sense and makes me wonder what he's been reading. I can't think of any rational fiction I've read with a straight-up Mary Sue who instantly figures out the best method and never makes a mistake. A huge part of the drama is that the characters often know they /don't/ know enough and hope their plan works based on their limited information or options. Plenty of rational fiction is extremely dark for exactly this reason; /Worm/ comes to mind.

  Three: Do you realize what genre cavets and aesthetic trappings are?

I just think this is a matter of preference. Some people prefer not to look deeper at the concepts in a story - they are happy to go along for the ride and trust that things will work out. But it's a key part of rational fiction that there are rules (even if they may be almost entirely unknown). I much prefer creative solutions to macguffins or "it happened for the sake of the plot." Others, maybe, do not. But even then there are fictions where the twist is that the plot or macguffin are also guided by rules. /A Practical Guide to Evil/ has this as a running theme; the meta-conflict is whether the structure set up by Good and Evil can be overthrown, and if the characters are actually doing so or are just acting out their roles. /Unsong/ is entirely based on this; everything that happens is for the sake of the plot, because nothing is a coincidence.

As mentioned, I wish the ranter had given some concrete examples of what works he's thinking about. The only one I think I've read on Sufficient Velocity is /Dungeon Keeper Ami,/ and I think the only point of his that might apply is the idea of incompetent foes.

Edit: One last thing is that the ranter's definition of "rational" does not match what I think of (which is the sidebar here). His rant specifically seems to be against science porn that masquerades as rational/ist/ fiction. Not actually rational fiction in general.
