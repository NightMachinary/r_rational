PGtE isn't particularly rational, as it doesn't make a serious effort to have "fair play whodunnits." Given any particular decision, you can see that it was in-character with the information they had, but you likely couldn't have predicted the character would do them beforehand with the informationn /you'd/ been given. There's also a fair bit of "not explaining the plan." What got me to decide it wasn't rational specifically was the way [[#s][Spoilers]]. As a reader, I didn't know enough about how the in-universe narrative-causality worked to predict it beforehand in any real sense.

Of course, I might have missed some foreshadowing a few chapters earlier, in which case I'd be wrong.

It's still a great story, of course, and I'm happy to see it posted for discussion, but it's more rational-tangent than actually rational, like worm is.
