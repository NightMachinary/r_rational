The reason I consider the fair play whodunnit as crucial to rational fiction is because it's the means by which we determine whether the other tenets of rational fiction were upheld.

#+begin_quote
  1.) Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

Here, if you only find out the plausible reason after the fact, that's functionally identical to something happening because the plot required it; the author made something happen, and /then/ provided the justification. Of maybe they planed everything books in advance, but the point is that we wouldn't /know/.

  2.) Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

This one doesn't actually require a fair play whodunnit, I admit.

  3.) The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Here, again, the fair play whodunnit is necessary. Without holding the information in advance, it's again impossible to tell if the character was given their information previously, or if the author decidedto bestow that information to get out of a corner they'd written themselves into. Offscreen character knowledge a character couldn't be expected to know is functionally identical to powers as the plot demands.

#+begin_quote
  4.) The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

And this one pretty clearly requires the fair-play whodunnit as well. If we don't understand the rules of the fictional world, then we can't make a judgement on if they're sane and consistent.

Of course, not all of these things need to happen all of the time; an author can chose to break genre conciets to make better writing. But it's my personal judgement that PGtE doesn't follow these rules often enough (well, save 3, paradoxically) to qualify as rational. If there was some way to predict its internal narrative causality, it would count. But with the system as vague as it is, it's too hard to predict to be properly rational.
