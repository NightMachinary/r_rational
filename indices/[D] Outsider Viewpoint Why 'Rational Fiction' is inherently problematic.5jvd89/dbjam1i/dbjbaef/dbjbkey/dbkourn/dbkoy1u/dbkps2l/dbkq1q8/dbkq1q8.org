  Here, if you only find out the plausible reason after the fact, that's functionally identical to something happening because the plot required it

I'd define author fiat as a deliberate subversion of probability in favor of the plot. That way you can still check for it backwards:if the resulting action was highly improbable even despite the explanation, then it's bad and not rational fiction.

  Without holding the information in advance, it's again impossible to tell if the character was given their information previously
#+end_quote

I mean, just re-read that part of the book knowing what the character knew at that point? If some action seems out of place, author fiat happened. If everything is fine, it's still rational fiction.

  If we don't understand the rules of the fictional world

What character knows isn't rules, I don't think.

  If there was some way to predict its internal narrative causality, it would count.

See my post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ji8mw/rt_hf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_ch_49_victory/dbhycc3/][here.]] It's actually pretty causal, with strict Plot structure.
