People only join the /side/ of Good or Evil because their beliefs and values drive them to it, though, and "Good" and "Evil" are much more complex notions - to the point that we've got people on every point of the Good/Evil spectrum constantly scheming against eachother. If you think about who actually fights who in the story, only a small fraction of it is even Good vs. Evil at all.
