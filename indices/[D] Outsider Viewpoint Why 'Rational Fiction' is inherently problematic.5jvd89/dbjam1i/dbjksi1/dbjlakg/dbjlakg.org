Seems pretty correct to me. When used in this sense, someone saying "such and such concept/idea/belief is problematic" is usually just a way of saying "I don't like this" or "I disagree". It would have been more honest for him to name the title "This is why rational fiction sucks" or something, but he used the word "problematic" to seem more authoritative and objective. It is pretty pretentious and arrogant.
