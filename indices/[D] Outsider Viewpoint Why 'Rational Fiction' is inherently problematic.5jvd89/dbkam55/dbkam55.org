It's funny how one of the stories that I've seen positively received here as an example of a rational fanfic is currently running on SV - /With this Ring/, and is fairly popular there.

I wonder if any of the critics in that thread are following it, but don't consider it a rational fic such since it's never been advertised by the author as such?
