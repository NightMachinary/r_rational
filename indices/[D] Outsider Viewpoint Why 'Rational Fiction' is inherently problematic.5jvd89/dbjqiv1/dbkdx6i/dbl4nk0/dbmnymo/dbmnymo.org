You're right, Scott's writing is a perfect example of something that's both rational and playful. I wish he put more effort into characters though. Unsong is pretty much a bunch of Valley archetypes and cardboard cutouts, except Dylan Alvarez who feels alive because he is an unrestrained inner part of Scott, like Tyler Durden.
