I guess I was going for "picks an idea and runs with it". You're right, doesn't fit very well. I guess I don't usually read anything I'd describe as 'playful', and I never recognized such a quality in the original Harry Potter.

(and on second thought Omelas isn't even very rational itself, exactly because it picks an idea and runs with it without focusing much on the likely consequences, so it was a bad example on both counts)
