  The most charming characters in all rational fiction are in HPMOR, and they borrow a large part of their charm from canon. Can someone give examples of charming original characters in rational fiction?

Well, so much rational fiction is fanfic, there aren't very many original characters.

People seemed very fond of Pip from Significant Digits. And Garret from R!Animorphs. ETA: and a lot of people really, really liked Quirrelmort - who's basically an OC - to the point many outright refused to believe he could be a villain.
