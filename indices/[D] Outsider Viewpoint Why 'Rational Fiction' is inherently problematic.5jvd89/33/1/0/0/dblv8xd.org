Interesting ideas. Well, I'll take a look at it now and let you know what I think. While i'm taking a look, since you know the work better than me, could you play devil's advocate while I catch up and tell me what arguments a reasonable person might make /against/ it?

also any longer description someone else wrote or ideas about why it's rational would totally be useful.

bbl while I read.
