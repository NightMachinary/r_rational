The essential idea of EA / LW / CFAR is "figure out the best available methods to achieve your goals". Those methods tend to be strongly divergent from mainstream thought -- for example, some average Joe hears, without context, that the EA crowd said "giving to Toys For Tots is not an effective way to save and improve lives". Joe immediately says "you monsters! You're against kids getting toys?! That's mean!" Then the EA crowd says "giving $3,000 to TfT makes 100 kids happy for a day. Giving it to the AMF saves someone's life." Joe is now in the awkward position of either admitting he was wrong or doubling down on how horrible the EA person is.
