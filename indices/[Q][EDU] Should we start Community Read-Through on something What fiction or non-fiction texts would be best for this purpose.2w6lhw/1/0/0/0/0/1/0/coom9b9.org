There are a couple reasons.

First is convenience. I like writing a whole lot. Things I don't like include marketing, editing, and promoting. Traditional publishing doesn't eliminate the need to do those things, but it does reduce them, and that means that the ratio of writing to doing things that aren't writing goes up, which I think would make me happy.

Second is prestige. There are numerous gatekeepers involved in traditional publishing, and getting past those gatekeepers on the merits of my work would make me happy - and prove some of that merit to people upfront. Self-publishing doesn't have that. I could put the first draft of the novel up on Kindle in the next twenty-four hours, and that would prove approximately nothing (until and unless readers/customers start coming in, and I start getting mentioned places, which is really variable and comes down to that marketing/promotion stuff /on top of/ writing well).

Third are connections. An agent knows people, and can deal with all that social stuff that I'm decent enough at but really dislike. Getting into the inner circle would allow me better access to my favorite authors, who are all traditionally published. Traditional publishing gets you introductions and opportunities that selfpub doesn't.

Fourth is the physicality of actually getting a physical book in my hands (possible with print-on-demand for selfpub, I will grant that).

The big benefits of selfpub seem to be that you can instantly get your book to market and make a higher margin on sales, but the money aspect of it is mostly irrelevant to me (since no sane person decides that authorship is the path to riches) and I don't actually think that getting traditionally published is going to require all that much actual /work/ once I have a manuscript I'm happy with - just time spent on queries and probably lots of rejection.

And once my manuscript is done, I can always self-publish it later on.
