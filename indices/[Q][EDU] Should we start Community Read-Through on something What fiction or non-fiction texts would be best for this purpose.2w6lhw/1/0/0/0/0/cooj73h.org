I'm working on the second draft of a time travel novel, but I'm going to at least make an honest effort to get it traditionally published before going self-published, which means that it's literally years away from being seen by anyone other than friends and family (and agents/editors). Once the second draft is done, I'm going to send it out to some beta readers before draft number three, and then work on a different project in the meantime. I think that will probably be published weekly at AO3 or FictionPress (or both).

The elevator pitch for what I have in mind is that it's a version of the 1600s where people get superpowers from being famous. I reserve the right to change my mind though.
