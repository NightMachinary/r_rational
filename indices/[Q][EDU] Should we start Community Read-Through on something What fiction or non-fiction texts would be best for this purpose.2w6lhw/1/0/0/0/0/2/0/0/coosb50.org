Huh. This is, actually, a really good explanation for most of the stock superhero tropes.

- Spandex and capes
- Talk in purple prose / have catchphrases / have battle cry
- Have a theme -- riddles, bats, clown, weather, boomerangs....
- Elaborate villainous schemes in broad daylight instead of quiet robbery at night
- Deathtraps for the hero, not a bullet

This is a /much/ better explanation than Worm came up with.
