That premise sounds like it has a lot of potential. I'd like to see what you do with it; [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/2w2l46/what_sort_of_powers_would_you_expect_if_worm_were/][this thread]] from [[/r/Parahumans]] has got me interested in superhero stories set in the late middle ages/early renaissance. (Thanks for suggesting Marvel 1602.)
