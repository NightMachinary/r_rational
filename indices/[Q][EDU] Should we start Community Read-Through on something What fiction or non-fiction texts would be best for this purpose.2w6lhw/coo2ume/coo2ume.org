Okay, well, my thoughts.

- Well, it does seem like this sub is bound to get a bit quieter unless someone starts something. Both /The Waves Arisen/ and /The Two-Year Emperor/ -- the most frequently-updating fics over the last month -- finished just before /HPMOR/ started updating. And, of course, most of the /MoR/ discussion is gonna be at [[/r/HPMOR]]. So

- I expect we'll gain a lot more readers as [[/r/HPMOR]] ends. Someone should definitely make a thread over there maybe after the last chapter, or between the last two chapters, to basically remind everyone that [[/r/rational]] exists.

- On that note, there's already a SlateStar Codex readthrough going on over in [[/r/VoluntaristLWBookClub]]

- However, I do agree that a readthrough here would be interesting. It would be announced in the gap between the last two MoR chapters, and the first thread would be a week after that announcement. It would be good topic for that advertising thread for [[/r/HPMOR]]. We wouldn't want it to drown out the actual rational fiction discussion, ofc, but maybe 2-3 chapters a week?

- I think /GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach/ is sufficiently difficult-to-understand to justify a community readthrough/discussion. See my username.

Good idea [[/u/19283123]]! Thanks for bringing it up ðŸ˜ƒ
