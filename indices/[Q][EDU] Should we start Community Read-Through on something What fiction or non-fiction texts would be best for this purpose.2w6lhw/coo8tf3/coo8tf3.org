I'd love to start with GEB as the first book and then AIMA as the second book to go through.

I would recommend going at the pace of one chapter per week to best fit differing schedules and to allow people to read the chapter at a slow pace if they wish (about a few pages per day or so).

If people don't like one book, can we have two books be read at the same time? It wouldn't be too hard to read two chapters in a week and be part of both groups if some people like both of them.
