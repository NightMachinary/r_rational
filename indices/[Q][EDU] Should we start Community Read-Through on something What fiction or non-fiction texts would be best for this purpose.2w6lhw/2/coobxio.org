I would like to cast my vote for, in descending order of preference:

- AI: A modern approach

- Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases

- Probability Theory: The Logic of Science

- Thinking, Fast and Slow

- Thinking and Deciding

- Anything else on your list that is not GEB

- GEB (I've already read it, and +I suspect many have+ I didn't enjoy it much, and before I caught myself, I tried to provide a convincing rationalization to tip the scales in my favor, because in actuality I am selfish and would only begrudgingly support this option if it lead to reading other books)

I have the first 5 and have been meaning to read them, but haven't been able to make myself keep at it. A community read-through would give me that extra bit of motivation.
