[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder]], an AU to Hard Reset and to canon Equestria: Twilight, Celestia and the queen of the changelings are in a time loop, each with a different anchor point

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]] (possibly important to understanding the story), Twilight in a time loop has to stop the changeling invasion

Trigger warning: ponies, implied torture, repeated-death-induced insanity

Edit: [[/u/Jello_Raptor][u/Jello_Raptor]] beat me to it but I'll leave my comment up to signal how great the story is.
