  Its entirely possible the quantum mirror is useless. IIRC all it does is tell you about things, and its entirely possible that there is no way at all to escape the loop no matter what it says.

  After all, the answers of "Its an unchangeable natural phenomenon", "Aliens in the past did it (and we got the side effects, so only some humans loop), and will fix the tech when they spawn every loops so we can't change it" and "the AI that comes after us used supertech far beyond us to do it so that it can loop forever and escapes even the heat death of the universe" are all the same in that there is no way meaningful way to deal with them.

  Like great, now you know but... So?
