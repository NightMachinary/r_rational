Indeed, that's like not-dying itself, or anything else where one path has only darkness and the other path has only darkness with a /tiny/ sliver of subjective light which might just be a train.

To put it in Lord of the Ring terms: "It's entirely possible that Sauron has stationed 24-hour guards on and around Mount Doom. It would cost him little (remembering HPMOR-LotR). If that's the case, we'd all just be killed or die as slaves anyway. So, why not just hand over the Ring right now?"

Because even though it's entirely possible that there's no path of life, what if there */is?/* Then by giving up on it, you're digging (or sealing up) the grave yourself for everyone who could have taken it. The point of finding out is that we don't know which is the case before we get that new information, and that new information makes all the difference.

--Or to put it in a somewhat more morbid way, if lots of people die in finding out that no one's lives (/futures of being annihilated through total memory loss) can be saved, /that would have happened to them sooner or later anyway/. Though I prefer the defensibility(?) of the above phrasing.
