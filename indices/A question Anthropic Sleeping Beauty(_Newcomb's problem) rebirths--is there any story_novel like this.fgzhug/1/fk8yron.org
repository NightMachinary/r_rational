[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder]] is basically exactly like this. It's an MLP fic where the premise is that there are multiple loopers, and the only person who recalls a loop is the first looper who dies in that loop. This means that most loopers forget most of their loops.

Problems: It's a re-imagined version of another (decent) fic, it's dead, and it's incomplete.
