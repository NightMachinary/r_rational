There are older (and really good) authors (like alarajrogers) who update stories only once a year or so - but horizon still writes new chapters/stories, so this principle doesn't apply. My point is that as long as it's marked incomplete, he's leaving open the possibility of returning to it someday.

But I see your point, it's probably best not to hold our breath. :)
