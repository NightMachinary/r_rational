Ahh.

Reincarnation without time-reversal: familiar, like in Hand x Red where one person is briefly free to act in separated time periods while another waits for him each time, or Tsukihime where the reincarnated person makes a huge fuss each time just so that he can see the unaging person he's in love with who comes to kill him each time, or Please Save My Earth where the reincarnated don't necessarily remember their past lives at first, then have to come to terms with what horrible people they previously were.

HPMOR: thus the restriction which sets in. Still, it's a good point that this comes close to what I was imagining--a situation where there are changes from the future of the timeline, in reaction to(/taking into account) your own future actions which you don't remember (yet). Simplifying/Distilling further, the question 'How can you try to win against/fight/stop a Peggy-Sue instead of winning as a Peggy-Sue?'.

Dream: Intriguing. My second thought is "Could you set up a broadcast system, so that different instances could observe it (password-protected) through their smartphones without influencing each other, rather than having to all cram into the same physical area for the observation?". My first thought is "Who's left (and with what memories) after the loop collapses?". (Perhaps a loop collapsing would just leave all the instances in the world, unable to go back in time, no longer connected?)

Now I'm remembering the game Achron, where time-waves propagate changes, and if you can't set up a stable time loop (units which go back in time getting to their going-back-in-time locations by the same time with the same amount of health) you can flip back and forth between the two outcomes. Units hiding at Point A at time A without attacking the enemy, at time B going back in time to time A and attacking the enemy with the past versions for double the firepower, and if the time-travelled versions are destroyed then the enemy is defeated and the untravelled versions can go back in time as scheduled (following preserved orders), but if untravelled versions are destroyed then on the next timewave-pass the assault will be carried out without the future-versions of those units and the enemy might not be defeated... or the clearer example of something going back in time and destroying the building which created it before its creation, which-one-is-there-in-the-end flipping back and forth over and over...)
