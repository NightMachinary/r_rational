I don't know if you are comfortable reading comics but the recent /House of X/ and /Powers of X/ has something very close to what you are looking for.

Moira MacTaggert is a mutant, her mutant power is to be reborn at the original moment of her birth remembering everything that happened in the all the lives and timelines she experienced before, she is reborn ten times and begins to work to change the timeline building on her mistakes.
