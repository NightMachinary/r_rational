(I have read it, and am put in mind in turn of another story which I cannot remember the name of: a certain advanced civilisation has long-term goals in conflict with humanity, and typically makes plans through high-resolution simulations of the other civilisations it interacts with. Humanity secretly develops a way to detect whether members are in a simulation or not, and gets lots of people ready to start behaving unpredictably as soon as they find their reality has 'changed' to simulation-reality. The advanced civilisation is so alarmed by their inability to make reliable or even consistent simulations with humans in them that they all-but-wipe-out humanity in a single onslaught. The main content of the story is set a long time later, and was far less interesting to me than the food-for-thought premise.)
