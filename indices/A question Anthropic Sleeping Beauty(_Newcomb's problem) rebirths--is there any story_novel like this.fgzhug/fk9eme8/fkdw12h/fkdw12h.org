(Thank you very much for this. It sidesteps the 'what actions to choose to handle someone who already knows what actions you would choose' thing I was curious about, but this appealed to my tastes greatly.)

Separate thoughts about it:

I very much liked the 'era you live in as though a place that you live' symbolism/structure (though that may be my own viewing-frame), as though people in the same place and nearby eras were nearby neighbours. Similarly, I enjoyed the time-war approach.

Something which bothered me the most was 'How are new kalachakras born?'. Presumably there had been a Harry August who lived and died as a linear for many lifetimes of Virginia's, unless his birth itself was a result of a near-permanent change to the timeline. Because of forgetting, that would have to have been from an mnemonic underpinning the timeline by making the same change each time, because aside from the mnemonics everything 'relaxes' back into shape as information isn't consistently passed on forever... and if linears never became kalachakra, then (mnemonic underpinning aside) you'd expect kalachakra to eventually all be wiped out except for the first few, as the timeline wipes out the most-likely-to-be-born kalachakra as it thrashes around a bit. Then again, I may have misinterpreted something never directly talked about--maybe the never-conceived can either have their next life or else start a new one, and it's only the killed-after-conception-and-before-birth which can't (in which case what's the critical moment of development? But more to the point, people recovering from never being conceived wasn't dealt with--or rather, for the first (second?) cataclysm, it was suggested that the effects were permanent even for the never-conceived.

It's been fun for me to consider this from a an immortality-seeking perspective. A mnemonic alone has effective immortality (save when never born). For a mnemonic the question becomes 'Where next?', but it's arguably fine if they still have a lot to enjoy experiencing in their lifetimes for the moment. For humanity and the kalachakras as a whole, mnemonics aside, the situation is clearer: the kalachakras live, the kalachakras forget. The world ends, the linears die out. The question then for EVERYONE is 'Where next?'. Stagnation of a sort, staticness--death. For the linears, everyone dies and everyone forgets through dying. For the kalachakras, they just forget instead of dying. The impulse next is "Okay, how do we not die? How do we not forget? How do we push humanity's future further--spawning more kalachakras besides--or/and how do we get actual immortality, for us and the linears, and extend humanity's future and learning/existence that way? Do we have the option of developing technology that we can invisibly extend earlier and earlier through history, setting up an infrastructure which lets people live their lives as normal throughout history, still birthing the kalachakra origins, but whisks them away to the rest of the hidden technologically-advanced universe once they would have died? (Kalachakras accidentally dying in the future having the option of 'leaving early' at any time?)".

With this perspective, Harry's reversal is straightforwardly confusing. By the end he's destroying the quantum mirror for revenge, but then why did he do his reversal in the first place? 'This is rot, this is stagnant, the tree is dead, let's take an axe to it for the sake of the quantum mirror, which is the ONLY WAY OUT because even the kalachakras in the furthest future of humanity with all their technology have failed'--and for that matter, why hasn't humanity and/or its kalachakras at the furthest future made a quantum mirror?--and yet, after knowingly being responsible for the cataclysm-equivalent effects on the future kalachakras (all those deaths), the reversal in response to the deaths of present and past kalachakras seems perverse.

Hmm, a last thought for now: as it takes one 'life' to pass a message backwards one lifetime, and it's been noted how long it takes to wait (several lives) for replies from the future, how many lives has Vincent been making small changes for before meeting Harry and talking about the quantum mirror and Harry learning about the end of humanity getting sooner in Harry's eleventh life? Or, maybe worse, how few lifetimes are there between Harry's life and the end of humanity? --Ah, though amusingly silly if it turns out that 'the end of the world' is because humanity ends through a happy Singularity, and that the happy Singularity was just getting sooner and sooner. Implausible and presumably not what was intended, granted.
