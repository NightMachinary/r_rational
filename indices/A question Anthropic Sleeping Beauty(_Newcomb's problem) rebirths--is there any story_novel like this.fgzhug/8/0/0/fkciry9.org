I mean, I wasn't necessarily thinking of any one thing in particular. If we're talking reincarnation, perhaps into not information from the future. Maybe each successive life began when the previous one ended, so you have the same X number of reincarnating beings interacting with each other across multiple lifetimes. Time is still moving forward, but not all lives remember all past lives so you get the same kind of information imbalance as originally described.

Or maybe you have an HPMOR kind of situation where, if I remember correctly, all changes to the timeline are already accounted for so that you end up with a single stable timeline where the actions of all "future" selves are already accounted for but just not within your knowable frame of knowledge.

Or it could be like a dream that I had once, where you had to observe a specific event in order to maintain the loop, but you had to do so in such a way that you did not draw the attention of any previous instance of yourself or the loop would collapse, so there is a semi-hard limit based on observational ability, stealth, and creativity of how many times you can loop before it collapses.

Point is, there are plenty of interesting ways to explore this kind of concept. I'm not a good enough author to do it myself but I would love to read it if someone else is.
