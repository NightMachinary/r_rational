Who said there would be only two players? <innocent>

I'm imagining someone bending over backwards to avoid known previous rebirthers from being dragged in, and ending up destroying someone else's life instead... and trying to work out how from what-I-would-have-done and who's-trying-to-kill-me-this-time (and if/when unsuccessful, what-I-remember-doing and who-killed-me-that-time)...

Heh-heh, and there's always the uncertainty of 'Am I in an even life and at risk of screwing up my next odd life, am I in an odd life and just haven't been attacked yet, or am I in an odd life and I finally got my last even life 'acceptably victimless' this time?'.
