Just checked it out, seems to contain some good stuff.

Sidenote: I'm not too familiar with TVTropes, but should Rational Fic be linked to Porn Without a Plot? Also RageFic? I can see how you might end up taking endless jabs at canon characters for not being rational or making the story more rationality lecture than plot, but that really doesn't seem like you could even call it rationalfic anymore (Also assuming that PWP in this context doesn't imply actual explicit content but rather just in general making the story something other than a FanFic). I'm not sure how the site works, but maybe we should change that if possible.
