If you click on the 'turn the page you know you want to' to go to the next page, there will be a symbol in the top left corner. Clicking on it will open a sidebar for options to enable or disable "Sexy Font" or "Glowy Shit".

If you got to my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5esm2q/rthfnsfw_the_care_and_feeding_of_magical_creatures/daffecw/][comment]], I even explain how to change the page to a No Style format which makes a standard black words on white screen layout.

UPDATE EDIT: There's now a Print-Friendly Option for black words on white.
