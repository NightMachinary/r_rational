I spent some time exploring the site and once you get past the prologue or get to the page that says "1. Eat Cute", there's a symbol in the top left corner. Click on that and it will bring up a side bar with links to the chapters and other important links. At the very top of the sidebar are options to disable the glow and fonts to only get white (or a very light blue) Times New Roman words on a black screen.

For anyone who wants to know how to change the page style on Firefox to black words on a white screen, click your ALT key immediately to the left of the spacebar. At the very top of your screen, click on View, then Page Style, and then No Style.

It'll change your current page into black Times New Roman words on white as a standard html page. However, it gets fairly tricky to figure out which character is saying what words because the author relies on having different font colors to show which character is currently thinking or speaking.

PS [[/u/Soren_Tycho]] I strongly recommend that you inform people about your font options instead of assuming that people will find it. Otherwise you could lose readers who only see the text and give up after the first page without taking the time to look around. Put the warning right next to "Hey! C'mon, turn the page. You know you want to." Also is there a possibility to have an option of black (and gray) words on a white screen? It would be very helpful for some readers who prefer that.

PPS Only got as far as the first page after the prologue, but so far it's kinda hilarious and I plan on withholding my opinion until I've eaten something (why did I decide checking out [[/r/rational]] before lunch was a good idea?!?) and finished reading up to the current chapter.

PPPS I asked the author how much s/he had written so far [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4h6zmq/rthfnsfw_imprecisely_bound_demons_or_some/d2odm31/][here]] and considering that comment of 175,000 words of story + 30,000 sidestories was six months ago, I believe we can expect updates on Friday for a good long while. :)
