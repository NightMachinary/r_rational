Okay folks, chapter 9 in which we see what happens [[/s][spoiler]] is now up, because it's Friday-ish.

ALSO I've added a black-on-white option ('Printer Friendly', available by clicking the Eye-of-Sade in the upper left to get the menu), and fixed the font on the title pape.

ALSO ALSO if you export to PDF the CSS will detect a non-screen medium and give you a nice printer-friendly format regardless of settings.
