The writing is kiiiiind of bad. "Stereotypical Harry Potter fic" bad.

Also, the beginning is a bit boring. I'd expect the story to either start with some action (a sex scene, the succubus running for her life, whatever), or give me some idea of the context of the story, and what the stakes are. Is anyone in danger? What is even happening?
