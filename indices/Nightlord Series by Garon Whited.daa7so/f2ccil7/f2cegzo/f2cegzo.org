I completely agree with the criticisms you list. Many times while reading many of the protagonist's decisions just infuriated me. I still recommend it because, on balance, the good outweighs the bad for me. That said, the writing does get better as time goes on---in the last book, the author seems to catch himself making some of those mistakes as they're happening. If you feel like you should skip ahead, I say go for it.
