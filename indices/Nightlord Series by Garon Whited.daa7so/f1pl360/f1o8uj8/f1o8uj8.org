This series is more progression fantasy than rational, but it has its moments. The gist of it is that the main character becomes a vampire, except he's a special one with magic. The overpowered abilities the main character has are generally used to their logical extent, even if it takes five whole books for that to happen. There's a shift that happens, where the story goes from the personal level all the way up to civilization-building.

Includes:\\
---Portals across the multiverse\\
---Apocalypse worlds\\
---Mild civilization uplift\\
---Munchkinning, and simultaneously,\\
---A frustrating lack of munchkinning\\
---AI, eventually\\
---Long books, with nice, high word counts\\
---A good fun read

The sixth book recently came out and isn't on the linked list for some reason, and the author's website is even more out of date. If you want to try the series but aren't sure you want to commit money to it, PM me and I'll set you up.
