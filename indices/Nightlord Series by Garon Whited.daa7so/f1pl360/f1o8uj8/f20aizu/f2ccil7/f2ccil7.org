I read the first two. I quite enjoyed the first one. The second one was fun at first, but gradually got more and more infuriating. Amazon reviews indicate that the third book takes everything wrong with the second book up to eleven, but indicate the the fourth book is better, so maybe I'll skip ahead, or just drop it.

Some spoilery thoughts/ranting:

TLDR:

#+begin_quote
  The protagonist is a real moron in the second book. He spends a long time doing nothing for no clear reason, then does the stupidest thing despite plenty of warning and options, knowing perfectly well that it was a trap. Why not just portal in a JDAM or something? Or even at the very end: just fireball the guy (and for some reason his flaming sword suddenly can't cut like it used to, and he left his juggernaut horse behind because reasons).<

  The time skip and power boost for the second book was really large, and detracted from the story I think, since so few characters could be around in a meaningful way, and he was so powerful that personal threats were largely limited to surprises and stupidity. Still, it was a good civ builder story, the worldbuilding was interesting, and the power fantasy was fun. His romantic indecision was just kinda awkward and didn't seem to have a point really, but wasn't too terrible. The big problem is how incautious and unproactive the MC is. He just doesn't really... do anything about his problems. I was sympathizing with 'Parrin.' How many assassination attempts does it take to get him to catch a hint! Seriously the very first dream assassination attempt was interesting, likely ought to have killed him, and should have immediately escalated to an interesting conflict. Instead he completely ignores it. He doesn't even try to scry his attackers, learn anything about Byrne, its prince, the magicians, nothing. The incredibly contrived stupidity at the end of the story would have made sense if he had been furious and understandably worried about these powerful enemies with remote strike capability, and immediately retaliated and gotten tricked into directly facing Parrin. Basically the ending was bullshit, you could see it coming for a long time.<

  Why would he think handing executive power to a 19 year old he met a few hours ago is a good idea? That's not an 'incredibly liberal' policy. Merit based (eg Tort) would make way more sense, and be more 'liberal.'<

  There's a number of small continuity errors where something was introduced and the shortly after introduced again as if it was new. Admittedly some of these could be the MC having dementia (which would explain some things), but no one calls him on it so... In general he has / invents a lot of really useful magic with ease, uses it for something clever, then seems to forget it exists or refuses to use it for no good reason.<
