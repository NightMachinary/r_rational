  Sounds like he gets handed a lot more stuff, though, ha.

Eh...he gets incredible advantages, but there's a saying that Eliezer Yudkowsky posted somewhere which is very good summation for this series.

  If you give Frodo a lightsaber, then Sauron gets a Deathstar.

Whenever he gets anything that he didn't personally work long and hard for, then he's usually facing some crazily overpowered and deadly enemy as a result. He's generally going through a two steps forward, one step back process. Easy power-ups are always causing problems for him for a long time afterwards.

The bit about the inquisitor is true, but I felt like it was more due to him being overconfident in his new-found abilities as a vampire against mortals and the fact that he literally has no way to find them except for letting them attack him. And the fact that the manor was his best spot to prepare for them. But it /is/ a mistake and narratively he is punished for that by losing Sasha.
