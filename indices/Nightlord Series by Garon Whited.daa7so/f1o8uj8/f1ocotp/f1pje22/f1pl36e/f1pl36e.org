Sorry, didn't read the whole series. I was referring to the first book. Taking the inquisitor people seriously and regrouping until he has his new situation figured out would have been the sensible thing to do, instead he camps out in his manor house where they know he is.

Sounds like he gets handed a lot more stuff, though, ha.
