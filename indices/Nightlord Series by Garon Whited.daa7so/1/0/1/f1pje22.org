  relocating his base of operations and making more flexible use of his finances
#+end_quote

I'm confused by this complaint.

He literally places his base of operations in a post-apocalyptic world where he can salvage the resources of an advanced technological civilization and no one except one person (who he trusts with his life) even knows of the world's existence. How can he do any better at placing his base of operations/lair?

Furthermore, flexible use of finances? He scans worlds for anything he might need and gets materials and highly advanced technological resources from alternative worlds. What is he missing from that?
