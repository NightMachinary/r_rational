Sure. Warning that I like my progression fantasies to require more work, setback, etc. Though again, haven't read this whole series, so maybe later books look more like that.

If you want urban fantasy, Dresden Files is probably the only thing that fits the bill.

For universe-hopping supernatural nobles, I'd recommend Zelazny's Amber series, at least the first five books but possibly also the whole series.

Another really decent universe-hopping (eventually) and well written progression story is the World of Prime series, which just concluded this year.

Probably not my top recommendation here, but you might enjoy the Daniel Black series. Another wizard empire builder situation.

Two progression-oriented web fictions that are recently popular:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis][Chrysalis]] , MC is a giant ant, magic and colony building.
