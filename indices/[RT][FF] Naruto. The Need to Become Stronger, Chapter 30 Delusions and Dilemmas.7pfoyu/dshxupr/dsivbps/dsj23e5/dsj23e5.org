Ok, I think I can reveal this one, because it's not a very important plotpoint. I intended for it to happen at this moment:

  The world shimmered around him, and then he was watching himself vanish in the direction of the nearest watch post.
#+end_quote

In other words, at the same time as he cast the Shadow Clone technique, to cover up any incongruity that he might otherwise have noticed.

Originally I wrote this story under the rule that the narrator never lies, so you could tell if the viewpoint character was under genjutsu because it would say for example "he remembered seeing" instead of "he saw". I ended up dropping that rule in favour of getting into the character's heads more, but I still use this trick to drop hints here and there.
