So, Hayate was under a genjutsu to think he was a shadow clone instead of the original. Now the question we should be asking is, was the genjutsu just to switch the original and shadow clone, or was his first use of shadow clone part of the illusion and he never actually got to warn the guard post?

In one of the possibilities, Konoha will at least know that there was a suspect moving around, and it looked like they came from the area Sand is staying. In the other possibility, no one knows this.

Or the direction the figure was coming from was /also/ part of the genjutsu, and they were trying to pin this on Sand. (Once you know the perspective character has been in a genjutsu, you have to question /everything/ about that scene. Anything could have been part of the illusion. We don't know when it was first cast.)
