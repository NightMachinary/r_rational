  So, Hayate was under a genjutsu to think he was a shadow clone instead of the original.

Nice! I was wondering if I made that one too subtle. Then again, you're the first to point it out, so maybe I did?

Well, I shouldn't spoil too much by confirming or denying anything. Next chapter will provide more answers, maybe. Or raise more questions :)

Also, I demand credit for coming up with chapter titles that fit each of the scenes involved: Chiyo being delusional regarding Sasori, Hinata being put under a genjutsu and having to make her choice, and Hayate being fooled along with his 'dilemmas are for civilians' bit. It's something I do to try and tie the scenes together, but nobody ever notices my cleverness :P
