proper munchkinry requires outside the box thinking. you have to be able to look at a complex set of rules, and pay very close attention to the boundary conditions. but it also requires thinking ahead more than just one step. If you play a game, and use an obscure rule... well the GM just saw what you did, and now every NPC in the world has read that same obscure rule. did you plan what to do when someone uses the idea against you?

most games have flaws we can find and exploit, because the rules are finite, yet large enough for unintended complexity. the real world isnt like that, because a real-world exploit is better called a 'Trade Secret'. it is something worth money, and anyone who knows how is already using it. social hacks? those are in use by politicians and scammers. physics hacks? heck, NASA put men on the moon decades ago. and in many cases, there are laws that prevent the use of some exploits- they know you can, and dont want you to.

why wont superman turn a crank? because if your being serious, then sharing kryptonian technology would have a much larger impact on the world. superman as scientist has a lot of potential that focuses on his brain instead of his body. it could work... but it wouldnt be superman anymore. it would be something new.

most of the really interesting munchkinry happens on the world-building and setting level. this is where the author does an ass-pull to explain why all this really cool stuff is secret, or why it wont really change the world. or where the author changes the world and really runs with it, a new setting to play in. DC and Marvel are the former, Worm is the latter.

a story is only as complex as its author makes it. and many of us love to deconstruct the ideas behind the stories we read. but many authors fail to start with an idea of the setting as a whole, and only show us new things piece by piece. and this creates a flawed patchwork that would need a serious re-write to be properly rational. munchkinry lives in the stitches of that patchwork, thrives in it. because the stitches that loosly hold the setting together were never meant to be deconstructed, and they give us the most fantastic ways to twist the setting to our whims.
