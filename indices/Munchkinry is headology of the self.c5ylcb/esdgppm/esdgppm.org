  On that note, if you actually think God is a nice person, then expect him to live up to the most basic standards of decent behavior and enjoy your lightning bolt to the face.

Or do as CS Lewis did with Narnia and expect free-willed finite beings to always find a way to screw up the nice things God gave us, eventually resulting in the willing sacrifice of the Logos' incarnation for that universe, whether Jesus the human or Aslan The Lion.

Rational fiction is not by default atheist fiction. It's /taking what is/ and exploring the consequences. If “what is” includes “I Am,” explore it, like Heinlein in /Job/.
