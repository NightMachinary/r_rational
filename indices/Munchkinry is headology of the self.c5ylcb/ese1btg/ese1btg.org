I don't really see this logic. Real life tends to already be almost maximally “munchkined”. Technology /is/ munchkinry.

“Ok, DM... I exploit the rules of quantum mechanics for periodic systems and defects in a semiconductor to build a machine that allows me to compute things much faster than my own brain, gaining a +5 to INT. Can I do that?”\\
“...yes. But we're not friends anymore.”

Munchkinry simply applies to fictional worlds because they tend to be designed around a narrative or thematic need rather than being genuine, living worlds, and thus people in them stick to that. Munchkinry is a humorous way to lampshade that, showing the things that could be done - and that thus someone invariably /would/ do - if that world really existed as described.
