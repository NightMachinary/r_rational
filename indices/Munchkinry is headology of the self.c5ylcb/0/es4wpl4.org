Headology seems to be a requirement of munchkinry, but fundamentally a different concept. For instance, in the first example you gave: if psychiatry is convincing someone a monster isn't following them, and headology is believing that there is one and giving them the tools to combat that monster, then munchkinry is believing there is one then saying, "Does this monster ever tire? What if we tie them to a millstone and derive production from their work?"

Or, to put it another way, headology is "what you believe is true", while munchkinry is using that knowledge for maximum gain.
