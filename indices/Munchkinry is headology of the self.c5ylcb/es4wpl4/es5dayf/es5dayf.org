I'm not sure if you're definition of munchkinery is accurate. Taking poorly thought out ideas/rules seriously is definitely an important step for munchkining, but I don't think that's the core of what it is. I would say that munchkining is getting maximum value out of something regardless of whatever intent there might be. Munchkining definitely requires taking ideas seriously, but I don't think you need to believe something is real to be serious about it, I would say that being serious just involves putting maximum effort into something.
