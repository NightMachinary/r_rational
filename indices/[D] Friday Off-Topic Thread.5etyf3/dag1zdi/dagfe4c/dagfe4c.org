Your generally a pretty competent person. If you are based out of the US, you should be able to change that with only a small hit to your quality of life. It's never going to be that bad for your personally, I think.

We don't know how bad the problem is going to be, and I think your assigning a lot more probability to "literally nazis" then is warranted.

I'm trying to put this a nicer way, but I think part of the problem is that your pretty heavily invested in university/academic culture. Some of the most privileged people in the world, with a pretty warped view of reality.

I think you've got a pretty strong academic bias, and that's a problem. You should spend some time in some other cultures.

As far as your comments on here and [[/r/slatestarcodex]] indicate anything, I mean.
