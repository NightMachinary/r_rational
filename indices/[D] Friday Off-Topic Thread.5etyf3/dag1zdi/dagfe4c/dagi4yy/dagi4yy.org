Look, I /know/ that this is disorder-level anxiety flaring up: the physical nausea that I never get from ordinary life and worries tells me that much. I just can't actually /stop/ it. You can't argue a literal inflammation disorder of the body and brain into relaxing, even when you're at your parents' house, perfectly safe, enjoying the holiday with them, eating nice meals and going to a show and watching cheesy Marvel Cinematic Universe movies every night.

I'm probably going to be spending a little time on-break from activism, because I need to not be around such an ultra-grim worldview all the time. I need to spend time around people who, whatever their politics, don't consider a human life, /my/ human life, something to be /spent on the cause/.

I'm an Israeli citizen on top of it all, so I know damn well where I can go to be safe. My second PhD application (it's just too damn good a fit /not/ to apply!) is going to be outside the USA too, and that's even just because that one department is /the/ department for the subject right now.

  I think you've got a pretty strong academic bias, and that's a problem. You should spend some time in some other cultures.

It's a difficult bias /not/ to have in the Boston-Cambridge area, actually. Academia may be a warped view of the world, but it's also our major industry alongside hospitals and technology. It gets to be the water we swim in. But trust me, I rather miss living in an out-of-the-way small industrial city whose idea of things to worry about was rocket fire (so straightforward!) and whose idea of fun was closing off downtown streets for a music festival (seriously, why /can't/ we do that here?).
