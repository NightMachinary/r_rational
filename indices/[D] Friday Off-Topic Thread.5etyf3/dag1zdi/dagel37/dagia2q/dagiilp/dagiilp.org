Right, but the panic that starts the attacks comes from somewhere. You can't stop an attack in progress, but you can change your modes of thought to shut down the feedback loop before it shuts /you/ down.

I have had a lot of luck with CBT-style interventions for this. Every time you start thinking about politics, you just remind yourself that it isn't your responsibility. Sounds dumb, but works, at least for me.
