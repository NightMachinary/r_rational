You have identified a problem.

Can you fix the problem? No.

Is any action you can take going to ameliorate the problem? Not at this moment.

Do you even know how bad the problem is going to be? Not yet.

I had about a day of panic as well, but it ended when I realized that fixing the problem was totally out of my grasp and that therefore my personal misery served no purpose but to make me miserable. Since being miserable is not a satisfaction of my utility functions, I decided not to be. I have since avoided sources of political news, blocked a bunch of Subreddits on RIF, and generally improved my personal sanity.

You can't fix this. It is not your responsibility to fix this. Should actual nazi shit start to go down, then we all have a responsibility to deal with it, but right now that isn't happening. In the unlikely case that it does happen, the world will not be helped by you being unstable and paralyzed by terror. The world will be a much better place with you in reasonable condition, being a functional adult. Continuing to worry about it won't help anything.

So why do it?
