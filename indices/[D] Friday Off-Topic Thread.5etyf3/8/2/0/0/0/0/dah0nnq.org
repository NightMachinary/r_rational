I completely recognize that attitude. I've been there myself. The problem with it is that it more or less guarantees that you will lose your mind and be totally incapable of living up to the goals you set for yourself. I know this from experience.

No matter how much you might feel like the Chosen Hero, you /probably/ aren't. HJPEV can get away with claiming responsibility for literally everything and everyone because he lives in a universe where he actually /is/ the Chosen Hero, but in our universe that's probably Elon Musk.

/You do not have to shoulder the weight of the world!/ You are not Atlas! Since you aren't the Chosen Hero, attempting to shoulder that weight will just break you. I'm not saying you should back down before adversity, but choose your battles! When there is nothing you can conceivably hope to improve by worrying about something, your worry only serves to make you miserable without improving the world one iota. Calling everything your responsibility has net negative utility.

You worry about you and the things you can reasonably expect to make better. I know I can't topple a corrupt and injust political machine, but I've stopped letting that worry me. I focus on improving the lives of those I interact with. Doing the small, concrete things that I can do to make this world just a bit more bearable.

Your life need not be epic in scale. Make it yours all the same.
