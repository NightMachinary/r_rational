Less HPMoR and more /Shinji and Warhammer 40K/; there isn't some /coming/ disaster I have to prevent, I'm already /living/ in the Bad Times. I just don't feel that I can or should exempt myself from the obligations that fall on anyone in my kind of position: try and hold up my section of life, and help other people do the same.

  I know I can't topple a corrupt and injust political machine, but I've stopped letting that worry me. I focus on improving the lives of those I interact with. Doing the small, concrete things that I can do to make this world just a bit more bearable.

See, it's exactly stuff like this that depresses me and makes me feel anxious. "Oh, sure, everything's going to shit and we're all gonna die, but let's try to feel a little better about it while we've got privileged places in the leaking lifeboats!"

Now, that could be the anxiety talking, but I can't detect an attack happening right now. I could just misunderstand how class actually works in our society: maybe us high-tech people really aren't so vulnerable to being heavily proletarianized, and I can actually do like some of my coworkers, buy a house, keep my job, don't run anywhere, and watch large-scale "history" play out from a nice safe personal bubble.

I just tend to think that "if things can happen to other people, they'll eventually happen to me too", so stuff gets worrying when bad things start happening to a lot of other people.
