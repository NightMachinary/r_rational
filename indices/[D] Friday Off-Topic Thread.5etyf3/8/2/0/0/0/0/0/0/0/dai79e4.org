  Where did you get the impression that these were the bad times?
#+end_quote

From the number of stressed-out friends I have to host in my apartment because they would have gone homeless otherwise. (Thankfully, they finally found a goddamn lease and will be moving to their own place on December 1.) From how high rent is for me too.

From the old people scraping through the recycling bins for scrap.

From the homeless camps in public squares.

Like, I don't think that these are the /worst/ times humanity has ever lived in, but I feel like things have gone pretty definitively Bad at some point, some point well before this year. Even just at New Year's Eve this past year I thought, "Well, welcome to another year in the grim darkness of the immediate present."

  In my darker moods, I would spend days lying in bed, completely incapable if doing anything productive as I worried about the impending destruction of the United States in a class war I was certain would happen at some point in my lifetime. And, here's the thing: I still think that is likely. I still look at the conclusions I made then and consider them more or less sound, despite the derangement of the mind that made them. The difference is that I have since readjusted my priorities and don't consider those things worth destroying my sanity or future over. It's just not worth it.

Yeah, fair point. I guess my problem is that for me, "There will be a class war" translates into the thought, "I and my loved ones will be vulnerable and very likely harmed during the class war."
