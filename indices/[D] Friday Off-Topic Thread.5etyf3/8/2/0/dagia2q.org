I meant the part about panic /attacks/ literally. They're not something you can /stop/ volitionally; you just have to wait until they pass and rational thought comes back. Mine even have a strong /bodily/ sign, which is the nausea.

Seeing a psychiatrist might be a good idea, but I'm not sure. I haven't actually had an anxiety disorder previously in life, so I'm not sure you can medicate away something as situational as this.

I'm working on my stuff, because at least doing stuff about my own personal life makes me feel better about that.

Thanks for posting back, though.
