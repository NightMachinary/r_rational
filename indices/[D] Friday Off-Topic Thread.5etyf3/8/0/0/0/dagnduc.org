  such an ultra-grim worldview all the time
#+end_quote

I have to ask, do you think that kind of worldview is warranted? I mean, a world where 1 in 4 women is raped (or even sexually assaulted by any reasonable definition of the term) is pretty fucking grim, but there are various problems with that particular study, exaggerates things a whole lot. As one example of a warped worldview causing things to look at lot worse then they are.

Maybe you'd like to talk a bit about this "ultra-grim"-ness? Get some of it sanity checked? Although I imagine if you're hanging out in [[/r/slatestarcodex]] you're getting a lot of different perspectives on these things anyway. Still, I'd be interested to hear if you think the ultra-grim tag is warranted.
