  I have to ask, do you think that kind of worldview is warranted? I mean, a world where 1 in 4 women is raped (or even sexually assaulted by any reasonable definition of the term) is pretty fucking grim, but there are various problems with that particular study, exaggerates things a whole lot. As one example of a warped worldview causing things to look at lot worse then they are.

Sorry, I was using "grim" here in the 1d4chan sense: not that things are entirely bad, but that any given individual has very little influence or control over events. Hard leftism can actually be more of a "grimbright" worldview: there /will/ come a crisis of capitalism, which /will/ be followed by a revolution, which /will/ be followed by a better socialist society, /but/ individuals can do little more than endure the flow of history and await the appropriate turning-points. It leaves you sort of feeling just as trapped as if things were just really bad, because you don't feel like there's much you can /do/ about your situation.
