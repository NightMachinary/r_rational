I highly recommend [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters][r/AskTrumpSupporters]] since those people are at least willing to talk to people they disagree with and its a forum that could always use more intelligent political discussion. It's not that I'm not still horrified by some of the beliefs espoused, but at least there is an attempt to have civil conversations between people of opposing political views and that's more than I've seen on a lot of other subreddits.
