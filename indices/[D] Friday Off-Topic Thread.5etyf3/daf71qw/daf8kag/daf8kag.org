Most of the default subreddits are really, really bad as far as I can tell. Less populated subreddits are often valuable and interesting forums, but anything with ridiculously large userbases tends to drift towards stupid memes and jokes and pun threads unless vigilant moderators with strict rules actively delete pretty much anything of that nature that gets posted - it's possible to moderate a really huge reddit community to be still worthwhile, but it requires an amount of effort from moderators proportional to the community size. There are a lot of interesting comment threads on reddit, but mostly they don't come up on [[/r/all]].
