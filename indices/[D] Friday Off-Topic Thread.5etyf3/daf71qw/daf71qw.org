[[/r/the_donald][r/the_donald]] is a very, very interesting subreddit. I highly recommend checking it at least once a day. When they're not trying to get John Oliver deported, they're trying to make Google display Hillary's photo when searching the word pedophile.

In any case, has [[https://www.rt.com/usa/368025-reddit-ceo-posts-modified/][spez's]] reaction dissolved anyone's trust in Reddit? Do you see the death of Reddit like the members of t_d do?

I don't use Reddit much anymore because I feel the quality of discussion has reduced substantially. Other forums like Hacker News are more mature and not plagued with memes every few comments. For instance, here's [[http://imgur.com/qf7DP4Z][Reddit's]] reaction to the Trump win and here's [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12909752][HN's]] reaction. (Forgive my shitty screencap skills)

Also the bubble is real on Reddit. It's rare to come across dissenting opinions here, something that's now exacerbated by pizzagate and the controversy that ensued.
