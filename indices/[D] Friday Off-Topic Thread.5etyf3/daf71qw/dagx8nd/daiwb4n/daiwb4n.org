  What CTR didn't realize was that the simple act of attempting to delegitimize the [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]] subreddit legitimized the complaints from the Trump supporters about liberal bias in media, social and otherwise.

At a certain point there is literally nothing you can do. Partisans have decided that telling them what they don't want to hear is proof of a nefarious conspiracy and they've managed to push this as a way to browbeat the media and everyone else for being "divisive" or biased so...you might as well do it anyway.

The framing here as this being a "CTR" thing just highlights the point: I saw a lot of complaints from people who weren't shills, but it's all dismissed cause of this apparent "heads I win and tails you lose" scenario.
