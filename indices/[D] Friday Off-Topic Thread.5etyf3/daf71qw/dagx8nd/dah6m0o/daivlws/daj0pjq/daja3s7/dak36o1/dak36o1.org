No, I am not part of the hive mind. Except for [[/r/books][r/books]], I don't comment on subs larger than 50k subscribers. I never claimed that this makes me special, nor did I say that the hive mind is stupid.

  Reddit is a hive mind is one of the most frequently repeated things said on Reddit. So is the hive mind engaged in mostly telling itself how stupid it is?

Yes, it is.

Also would you say that I adequately answered the question of 'who's they' in the previous comment? If yes, why am I being downvoted? If no, please tell me what I could have said instead. Because it appears to me that merely mentioning that I would have voted for Trump is earning me downvotes.
