  From a rational perspective, they're built around "new powers as the plot demands" and therefore immune to the fair play whodunit, with regards to plot points.

So, is the solution to write a "the world is a video game" story /only/ after you've created a framework game into whose progression paths /everything/ portrayed in canon can be slotted rationally? (For example: The widely-varying attributes, equipment, and spells of /Dark Souls 2/ would make a fairly-rational framework for a fantasy combat adventure, if all the enemies were hostile NPCs [rather than most enemies' being fantasy monsters]. Both the player and every DS2 NPC are playing by almost /exactly/ the same rules. Even though the NPC was created whole-cloth by the developers, it's still operating with in-game statistics that the player /could achieve,/ given enough time and skill.)
