"Gamer" stories are terrible and I hope they die out.

From a rational perspective, they're built around "new powers as the plot demands" and therefore immune to the fair play whodunit, with regards to plot points.

From a storytelling perspective, they spend so much time on pointless grinding and stats I get bored.

It just goes to show that one, well used power is far superior to any number of new powers.

Though I will make an exception for [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shinobi-the-rpg-naruto-si.380860/page-364#post-28220288][Shinobi, the RPG]] because the author was smart enough to make the primary conflict interpersonal.
