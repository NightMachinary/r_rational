I read the whole thing based on your recommendation. I like that the mc makes no attempt to preserve the canon timeline and that the story goes other places than the typical chunin exam and invasion storyline.

I'm not really enjoying the social ineptitude thing. It's brought up in basically every scene. His excuses are pretty unsatisfactory to me.
