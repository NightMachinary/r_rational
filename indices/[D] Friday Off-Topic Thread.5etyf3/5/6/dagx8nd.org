My dislike for Hillary Clinton was so extreme that I found myself enjoying spending a little time in [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]]. I even tossed out a few posts over there myself.

Spez's redirection of complaints about his own action was amusing, but nowhere near as infuriating as Correct The Record's campaign to downvote anything in the subreddit that was potentially serious and interesting. Granted, the vast majority of [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]] posts was blather and crap, but a lot of posts were never allowed to trend properly because of CTR's efforts.

It was clear that CTR was attempting to delegitimize the [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]] subreddit by only allowing low information posts to trend.

What CTR didn't realize was that the simple act of attempting to delegitimize the [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]] subreddit legitimized the complaints from the Trump supporters about liberal bias in media, social and otherwise.

CTR's meddling in [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]], and Reddit's failure to do anything about it, infuriated Trump supporters, and might have even impacted some close races.

I find it to be delicious irony that such strident efforts to cheat the system using votebots might have impacted the election in some small, positive way for Trump.

Yes. I support Trump. Especially after seeing how he's handled himself the last couple weeks. I welcome the return of a healthy economy. Once the economy is fixed, then we can look at more social issues and getting humans into space, so we can develop industry there.
