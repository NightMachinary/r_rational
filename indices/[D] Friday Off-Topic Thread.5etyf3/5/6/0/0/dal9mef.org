It's more than an appearance, the media bias is fact.

The donation records of noteworthy persons in media outlets were scrutinized, and a vast majority of all non-Fox media names donated to the Democratic party. Somewhere around 94% if I remember right.

It was also stated quite matter-of-factly by several reporters who should have been reporting unbiased news, that there was no place for objectivity in covering Donald Trump, because he was such a terrible candidate. In fact a couple actual articles were written to that effect, not just social media comments.

The media needed and still needs a browbeating, but what they need more is a representative population of liberals and conservatives, not a nearly 20-to-1 ratio.

I heard a conservative pundit indicate that part of the reason for this journalistic bent towards the left is that the lions share of students acquiring journalism degrees are doing so from left-leaning colleges. How much research went into that claim, I do not know, but it sounds plausible.
