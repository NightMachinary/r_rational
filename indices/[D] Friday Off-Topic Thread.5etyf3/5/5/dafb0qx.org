I've never really /trusted/ any website to look out for me, so my opinion on reddit hasn't changed. And really, I think it's pretty much impossible to have a community without some sort of bubble. Any group that prides itself on not being in a bubble is a bubble in and of itself. People who share ideals, preferences, or opinions are bound to gravitate towards each other. It's human nature. And they're also bound to have some incorrect view points, because it's inconceivable to be right about literally everything. Even in a group where opinions vary in a spectrum, there has to be some common ground. Otherwise, why be a group at all?
