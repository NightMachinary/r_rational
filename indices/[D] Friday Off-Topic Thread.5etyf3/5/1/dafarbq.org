The thing with spez doesn't bother me for one reason: he fessed up and reversed it. Now, if there were evil nefarious admins actually regularly controlling the narrative, do you think they would draw attention to the fact they were doing it?

All this information we post here is hosted on machines we do not control. Therefore we cannot expect to ever truly be in control of it. This does not bother me.

As for the reddit quality, to control the quality you have to seek out specific communities. In seeking out specific communities you inevitably end up with people searching for the same things as you, which leads to the echo chamber. I'm torn on this concept, as I would prefer to choose the company I keep and the content I peruse, but on the other hand this sort of self-segregation is a factor in our division as a nation.
