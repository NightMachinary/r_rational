I have a startup idea. I want to use blockchains (well, ethereum smart contracts) to timestamp files. Proving that a file hasn't been edited after the date you submit it.

I think that this could be useful for chain-of-custody for evidence, as an alternative to mailing yourself documents in proving prior-art on patents, etc.

Right now it would need more/better javascript then I'm comfortable doing. I can hack away at things well enough, but I don't think I'm comfortable creating the build-environment of doing the system architecture.

The smart-contract part looks entirely doable though.

The nice thing about smart-contracts is that it has micro-payments built in, so it should be pretty easy to monetize, if I could convince any organizations to use it as part of their everyday workflow.

Thoughts?
