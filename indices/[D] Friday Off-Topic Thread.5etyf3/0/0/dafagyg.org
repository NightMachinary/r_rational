Growing a community like this one is hard, consolidating it is only slightly less hard. I wish I had the money or influence to do things like organize and attend meetups, maybe even set up an East Coast CFARS, but I don't see it happening in the foreseeable future.

As for important goals that require coordination, rather than individual things like being an Effective Altruist, there is one thing I've been thinking about: raising the sanity waterline by introducing more people to rationalist ideas and principles and content.

I've been working not just to produce content across different mediums (stories, podcasts, and now a board game) but also grow the community by recommending other rational fiction and podcasts to people I know in a variety of settings. But in that I'm only an individual of practically no influence, relatively speaking. There are a number of things people can do to that end, like maintaining TvTropes pages for rationalist stories, which helps add more potential inroads for people to find their way into the rationalist community through its media. But on an even bigger level, I've often thought of how useful it would be to encourage famous people who might be rationally inclined but not "uniform wearing" rationalists (thinking of people like CGP Grey or Derek from Veritasium) to make videos on some of the Sequences, or just generally become aware enough of the rational community and principles to mention them on occasion in podcasts or videos that they're relevant to.

Other fanbases that would mutually benefit from exposure might be linked to specific works. For example, if Pokemon youtubers with wide fanbases or well known artists like [[/u/arvalis]] are also interested in reading realistic pokemon stories, there can be a cross-promotion between my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Origin of Species]] and his [[http://arvalis.deviantart.com/gallery/39915677/Realistic-Pokemon][Deviant Art]] following.

I don't know how much of the above is possible by "coordination," but I think the chances of it happening improves dramatically the more people are aware of it as a goal and occasionally work on it. If there's someone in the rationalist community whose uncle's best friend is one of DC Comics producers, for example, they should totally try and make them aware of Metropolitan Man, just on the chance that they really enjoy it and contact [[/u/alexanderwales]] about adapting his story into its own issues.

Things like that would be huge for making the rationalist community more mainstream, slowly and subtly but surely. And the wider the community becomes, the more in-person meetups can occur, and the more influential in the public sphere, the higher our ability to raise the sanity waterline and coordinate on the /truly/ important things, like raising awareness of existential risks and dangerous societal issues.

Just a thought.
