I feel like ripping off wildbow and doing an endbringer fight as an interlude could work well, as a pure-text story hook.

I'm sure you'll get to it eventually though. Still, could work well as a vignette.

Still, you probably know how to appeal to that audience better then I do. But as it stands, I think I'd have a hard time doing any PR on that front.
