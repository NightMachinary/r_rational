Personally I try to recommend OoS in pokemon subreddits and forums if it's relevant, like if someone talks about how the science of the world is ridiculous or how they want more mature storylines, or even when they theorize about how something in the pokemon world works that I've already included in the story.

  How could we make it "catch" better? My first thought is a mini-comic. Maybe professor oak explaining what's going on?

  If you storyboarded a few pages, I know at least one guy I could pitch it to to try and get it arted in. There are probably better options then that even.

A lot of the interludes work as good "entry points" to get people interested in the story without spoiling anything: specifically the Mewtwo interlude, or the one with Janine in Fuschia.

And I'd totally be willing to storyboard some scenes. I'll see if I can get it done in the next couple weeks.
