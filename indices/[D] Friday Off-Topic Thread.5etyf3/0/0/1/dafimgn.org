Pokemon has a huge fan-base, but it's hard to get people interested. Including it as a recommendation next time he posts a realistic pokemon drawing to the pokemon sub is probably a good start.

But I'd be hard pressed to post OoS to a pokemon related subreddit and say "here, read this". Or rather, it wouldn't get a lot of votes.

How could we make it "catch" better? My first thought is a mini-comic. Maybe professor oak explaining what's going on?

If you storyboarded a few pages, I know at least one guy I could pitch it to to try and get it arted in. There are probably better options then that even.
