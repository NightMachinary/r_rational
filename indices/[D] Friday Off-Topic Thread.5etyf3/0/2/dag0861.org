A few simple things like a blog aggregator would be helpful. I've managed to get an rss reader to show all the different rationality blogs that I know of, but I'm missing some. And a lot of people haven't even gotten to the level that I'm at.

Really, the current issue is that there is no central force behind the community directing activity, so even if everyone agrees that something needs to be done, it isn't actually being done, because most things require coordination and precommitment from multiple people or they won't be able to happen.
