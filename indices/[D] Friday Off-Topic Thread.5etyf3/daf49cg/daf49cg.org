The rationalist community has been pretty spread out lately, as far as I can tell. The death of lesswrong, most of the core being physically close enough that a lot of stuff happens IRL. The simple fact that the better known people have enough money to fly across the country for meetups and the like...

How can we consolidate rationalists into a more useful block? We have a pretty clear agenda, "raise the sanity waterline", use evidence to decide what policies to implement, interact with other sane people more often, etc.

But, most of the really competent rationalists end up doing their own stuff, and not spending a lot of time community-building. With a few notable exceptions, right now [[/u/daystareld]] as an example.

What kind of institutions could we create to help budding rationalists? Are there any tools that you'd like it if they existed? Can we consolidate the communities strength into a sharp cutting point to accomplish some important goals?
