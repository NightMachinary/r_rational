Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

So a lot of my free time this week was absorbed by Thanksgiving and doing my best effort to insert “bah, humbug” into conversations whenever feasible.  This update is thus mostly concerned with not breaking the combo and keeping things rolling.

[[/u/Dwood15]] and Xavion have both been helping create the prototype monster generator.  It's not yet at a sharable point, but stay tuned!

I may come back and edit this post once I have caught up with the log archiving (I'm a week out of date).  Tho it seems like there's not a ton of things to show in these posts, we had a few tens of thousands of words to the log each week, and there's always a lot of good discussion, even if it's just coming to a consensus on how things should work.

Also feel free to join us [[https://discord.gg/sM99CF3][on the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server]] for brainstorming and discussion.  It's a great group, really, and I would highly recommend hanging out, even if you're not in it for this project itself.  There's tabletop groups, Dota 2 partying, and [[http://i.imgur.com/j3jRmMZ.png][puns]] like you wouldn't [[http://i.imgur.com/8cUkzoGl.jpg][believe]].  Come join us!
