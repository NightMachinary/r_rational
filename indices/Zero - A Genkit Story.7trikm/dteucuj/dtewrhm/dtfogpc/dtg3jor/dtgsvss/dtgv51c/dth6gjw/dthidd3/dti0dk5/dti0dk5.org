Human genetic experimentation on the scale of the genkits is also illegal as hell. But okay, the biogens grew up in labs, perhaps deterrence of the MAD kind is enough to stop the clearly completely unethical researchers from just running up a virus to "Solve" the problem.

But conventional violence is a big problem. Asymmetric war depends on the ability to hide. If the world wants to wage a genocidal war against people who /cannot/ just blend into the general population, that pogrom would be horrifically effective.

Insurgency war does not work. Certainly not without great power backing- Note that however romantic the tale of the american revolutionary war, it would not have worked without the French being onside, and the american colonies were in a far better strategic position against an enemy far less inclined towards just murdering them.
