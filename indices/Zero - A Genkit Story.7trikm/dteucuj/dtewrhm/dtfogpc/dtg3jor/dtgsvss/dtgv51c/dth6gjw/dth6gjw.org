Honestly, the main problem is the war. If the conflict over genmods goes that hot, they should all be dead or humanity should be.

Bio-war, vulnerabilities to dead-man switches built into their biology, just straight up conventional violence. They cant reproduce without a lab, and there just should not be enough of them to win.

... Not to mention that I am not sure things like the drug trade even make any sense in a high-biotech setting.

That tech base means addictions are either curable, down to the underlying pathologies, or the drugs are in any case produced locally in peoples greenhouses and kitchens, because cheap manufacture of biologically active substances is /the/ all dominating application of biotech.

So.. The gen mods are run up as workaround for rules against human testing of gene mods. This is obviously complete bullshit, but the corps responsible manage to bribe some nations/regulators into buying their specious argument. So far, that is credible enough.

Then they get more popular, as essentially, well, sex or personal companion slaves.

Early examples do what slaves have always done and run away a lot, which establishes them globally, while nations that did not buy the "They are totally animals, just like my dog" argument have legal fits.

Massive civil disobedience campaigns, international pressure and eventually the very pointed parking of armored divisions on borders result in them eventually being declared human globally... Except that the nations which built them by the millions have absolutely no intention of granting them citizenship, so they get a bunch of heavy duty construction equipment and a deep line of credit due to reparations and ownership of the patents developed during their testing.
