  The original experiments which spawned their creation were a test to see how far the human genome could be manipulated and edited while still producing a viable, living creature.

this isn't sufficient IMO. This is not the approach any serious scientist would take to determine those limits, and they certainly wouldn't create thousands of different but similar types.

The only reasonable explanation for their existence in my mind is cosmetic/entertainment/luxury. Why else would they be made to look like specific animals, except that people demand it be so for aesthetic reasons?

It would make sense if they were basically exotic pets that were made smarter and smarter over subsequent generations, until they were basically companion/pet/slaves with human level intelligence. I could see this happening in a consumer centered future society with low regulation, and there being reason for certain elements or organizations to resist granting them rights (profit, desire for control of their pets.)

one outcome of this line of thinking is that there are likely still societies where they are enslaved (say, if China is anything like it is today)
