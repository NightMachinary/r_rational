  This world is based on a setting built up in roleplay

red flags for me TBH, but I'll give it a read anyway. Writing about roleplays tends to be somewhat tropey and melodramatic, with an overinflated sense of importance of the "main"characters that had been the PCs or major NPCs. this bias can distort the narrative and leads to less realism. I'm already getting that feeling from the rundown of the "party" that takes up half the text here.

The writing is tight enough, though, and you got some decent worldbuilding into this small space, so it may develop well depending where you go with the plot. If you can avoid cyclic arcs that feel like quests with minibosses and focus on the sociological/political hard sci fi elements it could be interesting.

In terms of specifics of the writing here - I think there should be a connection or transition from the list of his group members to "I wasn't sure what to think." It's kind of a weak jump. Instead he should think something about them, wondering where they are or how they are integrating into this new world. Then he can speculate at how alien it is, etc.
