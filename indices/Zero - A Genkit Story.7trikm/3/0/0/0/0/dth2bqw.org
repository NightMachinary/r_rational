So, as soon as the war is over, they went and put themselves in the one place where they could no longer use this as a defense? After everything that's happened in the war, would you feel comfortable leaving any form of defense behind?

And if you have a whole globe to work with, it's not going to be hard to find people who don't much like /either/ the A.E. /or/ China - even if they're not strong enough militarily to do much more than send out strongly worded letters.
