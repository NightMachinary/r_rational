Partially because the Genkits wanted their own city-state, and partly because nobody was willing to put up with crap from at least two permanent members of the UN security council. The A.E. and China both view the Genkits as a threat to their reputation and to human purity, and things happened during the war to make Genkits just plain unpopular there.

Imagine it from the Genkits point of view. You're alone, you're being hunted simply for existing. You have no government backing. All of your weapons and resources are either stolen or bought off the black market through middlemen with things like drug money. Your people are scattered around the globe, so being able to move product to fund your little war is feasible, because you have allies in places such as Mexico and the cartels mostly don't care who's paying them as long as the money flows.

So you're involved in the black market, and in some rather nasty sorts of crime just so that you can scrape together the resources to survive and be able to fight back. You have no ethical qualms whatsoever about hitting military targets and you're spread out underneath and through human cities, using their populations as shields to prevent heavy military from grinding you into dust. Anybody fighting you had to do it Stalingrad-style or risk either alerting you due to evacuations, or massacring their own people to get to you as well. Then the armistice happens and suddenly you have a chance to get away from all that and found your own country somewhere. After everything that's happened and the bad reputation you've accumulated by doing these things just to survive, would you feel comfortable building your first major city in a country where the very species that just spent years trying to wipe you out controls everything? I wouldn't.

They pushed for their own place outside of any human country because paranoia became a way of life for them. They couldn't imagine doing anything else. It just doesn't compute. Just look at what happened to Israel during the 70s, that actually happened in this world and it was a lesson the Genkits took to heart when they had the opportunity to make a place for themselves. Sure, it's more resource intensive to build a settlement so far away from everything, but when you're done you have a highly defensible position on a continent that humans have no major settlements on, on a part of the planet that's so difficult to reach almost nobody goes there.
