Nope, the exposition was Sorin just reflecting on the people he knew back then.

The very next chapter is from Ashara's point of view, where she describes him a little to somebody. I hear you though, I just couldn't think of a way to describe him that didn't come across as me stopping to describe him for the sake of it.

The neutral countries were a little concerned about an all-Genkit settlement being attacked by somebody who said fuck it to the armistice. A state leader like Kim Jong Un, for instance. The simple fact of the matter is, the Genkits aren't liked by a few really powerful players, and it would've added political pressure on whatever country was hosting them by the countries that didn't like them, and a few of those were too powerful to be worth the hassle. Instead those countries pushed for them to be granted their own rights someplace, and while Antarctica might seem like a really shitty choice for a city, it actually worked out for them because it's a bitch to reach overland. Zero is shielded underneath Mt. Erebus itself, and uses geothermal power for the most part, but not even a direct nuclear strike could wipe out the entire thing in one go and the Genkits are quite fine with that kind of defensiveness.
