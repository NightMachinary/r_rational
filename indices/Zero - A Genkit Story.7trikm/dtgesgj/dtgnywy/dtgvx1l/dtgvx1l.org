"Tell me, nurse. Do I still have all my scars?"

"Yes, I could hardly tell you were a Platypus."

Something like that?

It might not even need fixing, if you describe him early in the next section; but 'how to describe the protagonist of a first-person novel' is a question that's been asked a lot of times.

  The simple fact of the matter is, the Genkits aren't liked by a few really powerful players, and it would've added political pressure on whatever country was hosting them by the countries that didn't like them, and a few of those were too powerful to be worth the hassle.

Hey, nobody much liked Apartheid either, and South Africa's response to pretty comprehensive international sanctions during those years was more or less 'meh, who needs international trade anyway?'

I mean, sure, I can see them being unable to set up in just about anyplace in North America or Europe. But (say) Australia is /almost/ as hard to reach overland from Europe/America, and it'd cost /substantially/ less to set up a city there. Especially if you have the budget to go carving up the insides of mountains.

I mean, there's nothing intrinsically /wrong/ with a city in Antarctica; but I just don't see why there wouldn't be a city in one of the southern-hemisphere countries.
