You've got mammal-human hybrids, and by and large they're well written - the doctor's bearishness is introduced at pretty much exactly the right moment.

However, I've read the whole thing and I /still/ don't know what Barrelema or Sorin were hybridised with. (For about half the chapter, I assumed Sorin was baseline human). Barrelema doesn't matter that much, but Sorin's been on-screen the whole time. Of course, the advise of 'show, don't tell' applies here - but at some point you /do/ need to show.

Aside from that, it's an intriguing introduction. Given how much space you've given to the descriptions of Sorin's old squadmates, I'm going to guess that the first part of the novel will involve him tracking them down and trying to figure out what happened in the past sixty years?

Also, I see from your notes further down that the some countries had been neutral in the war. Why not set up the first genkit-only city in such a neutral country? (The country with said city would get an immediate boost to potential tourism income - I'm sure that plenty of countries would love that).
