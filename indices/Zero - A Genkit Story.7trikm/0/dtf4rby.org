It's a good start, though it's a lot of exposition for an introduction. "Show; don't tell" is a common bit of writing advice, and I think it makes sense- you want to want to get the reader identifying with the protagonist and putting themselves in their world as soon as possible, and that's more likely to happen with visceral events than with distant explanations.

I'd recommend trying to convey as much of the background and setting as possible through the character's decisions, and secondarily through their perceptions. So, for example, instead of having a character just describe the size and features of the city, you could have the protagonist insist on visiting some specific location (a choice that could give some insight into their character), and then imply the size and nature of the city through the character's reaction to specific details.

You might also think about setting up some of the backstory as mysteries to keep the reader hooked. For example, instead of just describing a former squad-mate, you might give the character an extreme emotional reaction to something that reminds them of that person, imply that there's an intriguing story behind it, but save the details for later.

On the worldbuilding, I think that the sort of future that would plausibly produce these genkits is going to have to be something a bit out-of-the-box. I wouldn't quite buy a setting where animal-people were created as slaves or super-soldiers- even if genetic engineering did turn out to be a better solution for industry and warfare than more advanced automation and drones, I think the features you'd want would be things like bomb-proof carapaces and the ability to secrete valuable materials, not fur and fangs. I also think that a majority of people in any culture similar to our own would recognize these genkits as people worthy of rights.

If they were created purely as an experiment, I think they'd fit best into a world where extreme experimentation in genetic engineering was pretty common- the sort of world where transgenic animals have replaced a lot of modern technologies, and where there are already a large number of human variants.

Even then, for the genkit population to become large enough to spark a war, I think you'd need something else. Maybe a strange new animistic religion that would see animal people as closer to some spiritual ideal. Maybe a counter-culture of genetic body-modification attracting those suffering from species dysphoria. Or maybe some utopian project envisioning animal-people as better integrating with nature.
