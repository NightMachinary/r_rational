yeah, [[/u/xinago]], I share these concerns. any society that could create genkits, did so in large enough quantities to be a threat, and then fought a fairly conventional war against them would need a very strange set of parameters that need to be explained.

Why give animals intelligence if machines are more effective at most tasks?

Why pick specific and diverse mammalian breeds rather than engineer hybrids for specific tasks?

How did society come to have that much understanding of genetics, medicine, and the mind and not simply transcend into a higher state civilization? Why hasn't there been a singularity? (all good sci fi needs to answer this last question, IMO)

Why not grant them rights in the first place, once this odd state of affairs is reached?

If you are so callous and imperialistic as to deny rights, why then capitulate when faced with primitive terrorist tactics? if your genetics is so good why not engineer a disease that targets just these modified beings? they should have clear markers.

you can ignore all this in cartoons and video games but if you want a hard sci-fi rational fic you need to address the holes in the world pretty tightly.

edit:

my answers to these questions would likely be that they were created by private entities as exotic pets. The "war" fought was not against the American Empire but private security forces for the corporations that owned and were profiting off them. these organizations would have more limited arsenals and ability to operate freely within US soil. Political pressure both internal and external would be weighed against interests of lobbyists until eventually it was a geopolitical PR problem and the government intervened to grant rights and enforce regulations.
