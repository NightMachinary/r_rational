Ok, I can buy the private militant vegan motivation. I'm still skeptical of all these governments fighting them, and I feel like having it be private security/mercenary forces is much more believable. First it is very unlikely so many governments would even engage in such an operation, and secondly it's unlikely they'd lose. You can hand wave this if it's essential to the plot to have an Evil Empire, but a late stage capitalist future with corporations running rampant gives a lot of flavor as well while being more plausible as an amoral agent acting to destroy the Genkits for any number of reasons - religious, economic, avoiding a scandal, wanting to capture for their own research, etc. Some combination of a profit motivated corporation that is fanning the flames of religious conservative groups for their own ends seems to make the most sense - you'd have corporate mercs + weird fundie militias all hunting down the Gerkin until the scandal goes public enough to force the government to intervene. You could even have members of the government involved or complicit until it all goes more public; it just seem really unlikely to have a government military led extermination campaign against a few thousand illegal experiment subjects. it takes a really weird mindset to make this happen.
