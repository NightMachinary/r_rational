no i mean they should have extremely advanced technology, surveillance/intelligence, high quality weapons and military units, extremely organized, etc. There's no way a couple thousand otters would have a chance to deal any kind of damage and survive for long. this is why I think it should be paramilitary/corporate mercs/militia. These could have a range of varying capabilities giving gnkits a chance in early skirmishes and opportunities to steal gear etc, and would face a host of issues with operating openly on US soil. they are also more likely to be aggressive/use illegal force compared to government military.
