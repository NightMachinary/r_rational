Hmm, I can see your point. Though the idea of corporations being in control of government through +bribery+ lobbying does make a lot of sense. I don't really want to just hand-wave things away, that's why I posted about it in this sub. This is basically the first attempt I've made at committing myself to writing a long-term story, I want to get it right.

In my mind, it's mostly about religious nuts and people obsessed with human purity who wanted to wipe them out. There's also some motivation there due to them spreading out across several countries, both immigrating illegally and threatening the status-quo there. Imagine, for instance, if they'd spread to a place like Iran. What might the governments response be? The idea that they'd try to scourge the Genkits from their soil isn't all that wild to me, and if that was taking place in several areas at once I could easily see the Genkits themselves becoming biased against humans in general and developing an Us VS Them mentality. I don't want the Genkits to be the poor, abused victims in this. They're just as capable of being monstrous as human beings. They did fucked up things too, and not all of the hate for them is unfounded.
