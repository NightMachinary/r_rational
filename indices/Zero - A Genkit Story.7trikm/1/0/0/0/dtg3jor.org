  this isn't sufficient IMO. This is not the approach any serious scientist would take to determine those limits, and they certainly wouldn't create thousands of different but similar types.

Animal rights.

Whole thing started out with genetic research being done by private groups trying to perfect human genome editing. The work was stolen by a second group of animal rights extremists who wanted to demonstrate that animals and people aren't any different. Militant vegans, basically, backed by at least one very rich and eccentric 1%'er.

The issue was that they never actually got permission from any major government for that kind of human experimentation, but by that point there was a few thousand Genkits and they'd been smuggled out and spread around the planet to different places to prevent anybody from simply leveling the main research facility and wiping them all out at once. When the UN moved in to shut the whole thing down, the Genkits were deemed to be illegal experiments and the more conservative factions decided they were an affront to the natural order, or against God, or whatever excuse they wanted to come up with to hate on this new species of people. They were never meant to be fluff, or a slave race. They were meant to guilt people into cutting down on widespread animal farming.

By the time /that/ happened most of the first-generation Genkits were old enough to understand what was going on and be pretty pissed off about being denied human rights. They were being rounded up for destruction because they represented a potential threat to anybody who wanted to avoid human genome editing. If they let the whole thing go, it would send the message that any experiments that came out of that kind of illegal research would be allowed to exist even if you broke the law.

  if your genetics is so good why not engineer a disease that targets just these modified beings? they should have clear markers.

Geneva convention specifically prohibits that kind of biological weapons research IIRC

(I keep editing this comment to add on to things, heh. Sorry about that)

The population issue of Zero going from less than 5,000 Genkits to 5 million Genkits is actually a result of continued genetic research by the Genkits themselves after the war. It wasn't just the A.E. they were fighting, but pretty much the entire UAE, Russia, the American Empire, China and a few smaller African countries. All places where religious conservatism is high or where human experimentation is severely taboo. It got to the point where the neutral countries got sick of the whole goddamned mess and started political pressure to set up an armistice and simply grant them their own place, which turned out to be Antarctica mostly because no major country has a serious foothold there. The UN funded the first stages of construction of the city, and they were then able to fund the rest themselves through a combination of hiring themselves out (since Genkits learn very quickly), mining underneath Mt. Erebus and reparations from the war.
