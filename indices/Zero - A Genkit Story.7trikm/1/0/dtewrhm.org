Humanoid bodies with mostly animal traits. The setting rose out of a roleplay thing, and the entirety of the world was created to give my players a legitimate reason to play furries, basically. Only what started out as an excuse to allow players to RP quickly grew into its own, organically created world.

Some of them do have sensory changes from your standard human. Canids tend to have amazing senses of smell, felinids have good night vision, that kind of thing. Bats tend to have bad eyesight but great hearing and a few of them have echolocation. The ones who don't tend to end up needing corrective eye surgery later on as they grow up.

The really neat thing is that Genkits don't age. Or rather, they age, but they don't degrade from their aging. The original experiments which spawned their creation were a test to see how far the human genome could be manipulated and edited while still producing a viable, living creature.
