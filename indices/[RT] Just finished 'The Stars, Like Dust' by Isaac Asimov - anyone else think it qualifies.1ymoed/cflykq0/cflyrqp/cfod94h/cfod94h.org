The whole story is a build up for the "ultimate weapon", which didn't exist back in 1700's Earth, it only exists in modern times. The whole story is basically propaganda for how amazing and powerful the ultimate weapon really is. That being said, the protagonist does seem to embody rationalist ideals, with how he apparently sets things up to prove various scenarios down the road (although those aren't demonstrated until later, when the plans come to fruition). The only time he's tripped up is when there's some bit of information that he couldn't have known. That's the way most of Asimov's protagonists are -- a sort of modern-day Sherlock Holmes type of person. No, I don't mean that they can see the state of a person's suitcoat and infer the person's occupation, I mean that they pick up on the little hints and bits of plot and innuendo that Asimov only ever touches on tangentially (so as to mislead us, the reader) and from those bits spin out just what exactly was happening.
