What is the optimal way to use the time travel ability of the boardgame Jumanji? From the first film we know that time can be reversed at least 26 years, Sarah would have a second high-school graduation and college graduation, she would likely remember the exxon Valdez tanker spilling oil into the ocean and the union carbide gas leak in India. It is insane not to play Jumanji again and again to save lives (prevent 9/11?) but obviously it's dangerous because Jumanji. How long would Sarah have to train with Alan to start another Jumanji timeline to save lives?

Also is Jumanji actually dangerous? Is it possible to lose? Does the game ever permanently kill anyone (besides those alternate timeline children who possibly have their existence erraced)? Is it ethical to not play Jumanji? What actually happens if you lose?
