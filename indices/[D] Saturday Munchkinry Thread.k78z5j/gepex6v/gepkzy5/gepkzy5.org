Is the exact rule for the time travel even clear? Is the game cleaning itself up back to initial starting condition (so players "playing" for a super long time get to start back at the time the originally started when winning) or is it merely cleaning up negative consequences (being stuck in the game was a negative consequence that happened 26 years ago)?

If it is the first case, exploiting the time travel is relatively easy: First player takes their turn by themselves, set the game aside, and then wait years for other players to join in. Only the First player will be reset... although you could push this up to 2 or 3 players... 4 players is unreliable because the game might find a way to pressure them into continuing so they can't just delay their turns, it is safest to not even have everyone playing. Hmm... each additional turn is a risk, probably best to have the first player go, see if the card they drew is safely manageable, and then have the 2nd/3rd players go if the card effect is too dangerous and they need to delay on an easier card. Then wait for years, recording and memorizing major historical events you wish to alter/exploit, then finish the game.

For the second case, it is much trickier... you need a card with negative and long term consequences. Play the game until a long term negative comes up, then stop playing until enough years have passed. This is tough because it means the players might be stuck with extremely adverse conditions (being stuck in a Jungle) while they wait.

If it is the combination of these conditions (incomplete number of players and negative effects that need undoing), exploiting the time travel might be hard as you need to get a long term negative effect within the first 3 turns.

Also, if we are counting the Videogame Jumanji as canon, then that means that the children will regain their memories of the alt-timeline once it catches up to when they originally use it. So that means your players that joined later also get their alt-timeline memories which is good.

However the Videogame Jumanji and Zarathustra movies heavily imply the game is semi-sentient. Thus exploiting it for time travel might annoy it and cause it to give you worse cards... or it might demand harder win conditions in return for the time travel benefit you are getting... or the game might entirely rewrite itself to suit you, in the case of a group working to exploit its time travel properties, it might give you a time travel theme gamed, or a game about munchkining weird and complicated magical conditions, or something else entirely (SCP board game?). The game seems to be "fair" in some sense, so it will probably give you benefits/rewards in compensation for the danger and it will probably be winnable in some sense, but if it scales difficulty it might get really dangerous and hard (unprepared kids looking for fun get an easier difficulty than prepared young adults looking to bend a whimsical magical item to their benefit).
