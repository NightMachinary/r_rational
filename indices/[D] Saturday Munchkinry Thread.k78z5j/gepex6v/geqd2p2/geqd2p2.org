My understanding of Jumanji is that it isn't actually dangerous if you are well prepared and not a bunch of civilian kids. Jumanji simply releases a bunch of dangerous jungle threats, and humanity has conquered the jungle long long ago. Just prepare lots of modern military equipment and protective suits and fill the place with insecticide.

So insects will drop dead, poisons won't work, animals will be shot dead, and the hunter's antique gun will be outmatched by heavy firepower. Really the most dangerous part of the game is the dimensional travel, but you can probably smuggle guns and supplies across and survive for the at most a few hours that it takes the other players to release you.

In fact, the dimensional travel may even present an opportunity. That jungle probably isn't on Earth at all, which means, all the resources we extract out of the wilderness? Probably still in that jungle, untouched! Who knows what precious materials could be found and brought back? There could literally be gold veins in there!
