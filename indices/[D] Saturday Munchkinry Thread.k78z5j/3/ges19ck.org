So this one is more of a puzzle. Lets say there are two near omnipotent sides to a conflict that play to specific rules (practical guide to evil style). Except it's sci-fi and they are aliens and the world is a cross between cyberpunk and Overwatch.

The "Good" side likes to reward protecting people, healing people, restoring (or creating) environmental diversity and stability, as well as protecting, creating, and restoring population centers and cultures (especially both at once).

The "Evil" side likes to reward killing people (specifically, and especially, those who work for the "good" side), dominating populations, destroying (often more of a converting/corrupting) environments and infrastructure (specifically those supporting the "good" side), and corrupting/suppressing cultures.

People are uplifted by these sides when they act along these lines in notable ways.

So here is the question. How would one become uplifted by both sides at effectively the same moment? This requires one to be considered a possible candidate by both sides, and to then do a single action worthy of uplift by both sides.

As an example, destroying a significant amount of "good" infrastructure (evil side) to protect people (good side; people the destroyer cares about, but that the "good" person setting up the infrastructure didn't).

(An alternative question might be. How would one (slightly) modify the above systems to allow for this? Though this is more world building, I thought I would include it in case anyone has great ideas.)
