Ohhh thank you! I like this response better than what I was trying to do, it solves the problem on a more meta level too. Them having different philosophies on how judgment is done works nicely with what I was intending. They already had different philosophies, I just wasn't applying it to their judgement because I wrote the mechanics separately and because I want them to be balanced mirrors of each other. But for some specific things like this, well it really works! Thanks again.
