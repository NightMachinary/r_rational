A city of people who were loyal to the 'good' side have been enslaved and are about to launch a grueling offensive campaign that will slaughter countless lives.

While others are locked in a bureaucratic gridlock, our individual gives the authorization to nuke the city into oblivion, despite most of his own family being there.

The good side grant uplift for averting a war that would have devastated an entire region, for making the hard choice that ultimately protects the world the most. The evil side love that fact that he just killed a ridiculous number of people, more than any other individual in a single day prior to this moment.

What do you think?

edit: Essentially. Utilitarian Moralism allows one to commit atrocious acts of evil whilst still technically categorizing them under 'greatest good' results. If one side uplifts for the 'Means' and the other for the 'Ends' in "the ends justify the means", then there are numerous situations that can trigger a dual uplift.
