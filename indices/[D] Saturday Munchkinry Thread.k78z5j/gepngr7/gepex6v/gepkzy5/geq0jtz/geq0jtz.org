  So that means your players that joined later also get their alt-timeline memories which is good.

Though it also seems to work by overwriting the alternate versions, which is less good.

In the ideal case, they'd have memories of both lives, which is pretty much the only non horrific way to do it, but there's no indication that this happened. However, they interacted with the run down house so rarely in their original timelines, that it's possible his return didn't butterfly their lives out of control so they didn't realize they remembered both versions.
