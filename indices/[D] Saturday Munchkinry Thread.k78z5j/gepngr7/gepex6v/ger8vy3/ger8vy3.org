You have the ability to telepathically say something to every human being on the planet. Only you have the ability, nobody else does. You can only say things, you cannot pick up on other people's thoughts. What you say always comes out in a monotone, almost un-emotive voice (think dry news hosts), and will be translated for people who speak different languages. And finally, your message is heard by everyone, from every toddler to elders on deathbed. How do you abuse this power?
