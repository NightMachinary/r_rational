This might be too specific to the examples here rather than the overall goal, but creating life in otherwise barren areas/planets that is aligned with "evil" both creates diversity and increases the number of corrupted entities.

The specific measurements of harm and healing may be exploitable. If you stab someone with a incurable poison, is the harm a continually rising "value" or based on the initial action? Because you could continuously heal them afterwards and there may be some mismatch there you can benefit from.

Killing someone to protect another meets both criteria. If alignment of the individuals killed matters, there's enough ways to temporarily alter someone's mental state that they could act uncharacteristic enough to not be, in the moment, counted as their alignment (probably removing someone's good alignment more so than evil alignment, because inhibitions and stuff). It'd depend on methods of measurement.

Edit: Oh if intent is a factor, then responding with either or good or evil aligned action to any accidents would be a gain for that said, so if you partner up with someone of another alignment and have a third person cause accidents repeatedly through some method (does Russian Roulette's randomness qualify as an accident or do I have to get more creative?) then you could farm uplift.

Also do dead people contribute uplift? Because I'm sure a dead person could set up a continually active/worsening scenario that the opposite alignment could farm for uplift (or just a chaotic scenario that could create things classified as accidents instead).
