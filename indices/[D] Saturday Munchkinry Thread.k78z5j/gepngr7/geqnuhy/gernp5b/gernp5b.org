Each new person established as a teleportation delegate lets a floating teleporting tentacled extra dimensional monster (kind of like a giant squid) into reality. Each new teleportation traversal established causes an existing extra dimensional monster to grow to kaiju size. The non kaiju sized ones can be taken down with anti-armor weapons but the kaiju ones need heavy bombardment to kill. The monsters aren't especially hostile generally staying on Earth but away from human (the smaller ones eat fish and the kaiju ones hunt whales) but they are attracted to the usage of Earth Booster League powers, meaning that usage of your teleportation power creates a direct threat to the Earth Booster League.

These extra dimensional monsters can spawn more after eating enough, about as often as a giant squid, so it isn't simply a matter of hunting them down as they spawn if a few manage escape and reproduce. On the plus side, studying them and harvesting them, and then heavily processing them can make a serum that can grant people copies of your teleportation power. Of course, if teleportation powers aren't carefully regulated this could be a downside in the long run.

The Earth Booster League powers, on the other hand, causes amorphous rock creatures to spawn and develop. Creating and refining material causes their initial spawning deep in Earth's crust. Refining material and creating impossible material lets them develop enhanced durability and increased movement speed. Using the social coordination powers grants them the ability to organize and congregate across vast distances. These rocks creatures are repelled by Earth based life, but seem to need gravity and open space to at least some extent, and they can float, leading to them tending to travel to the Moon and other astronomical bodies after spawning. They are initially only as durable as the rock they are made out of, but they have no clear central organs and most be broken into small pieces until no piece is bigger that 1/10 the original to properly kill them. They can slowly reproduce by continually occupying an open area with no carbon based life and rock beneath them and seeding fragments of themselves into the rock, converting it after several years into new rock monsters.

The rock creatures instinctively dislike carbon based life, which will lead to them attacking larger colonies established on other astronomical bodies. If the Booster League has used their powers continuously and heavily, and the rock creatures aren't exterminated as they spawn, it could in the long run cause every rocky body in the solar system to be uninhabitable to carbon based life.

So both the teleporters and the Booster league will need to come up with some regulations and restrictions on power usage and enforce them or else monsters will run rampant.

As a plus, the rock creatures and extra dimensional monsters are naturally hostile to each other, with the extra dimensional monsters drawn to the rock creatures like they are with the Earth league powers, so if there is unrestricted and unregulated power usage maybe they will fight each other?
