"Ah, well you've come to the right guy. The only thing preventing my life from being near-maximally entertaining and narratively engaging is a bunch of irrelevant bullshit, and with the addition of knowing you exist, I already have all the superpowers I need.

I propose the following deal: You restore my physical health to that of the average fictional protagonist, and fix the /boring/ parts of my mental illness that keep me from doing the crazy heroics and stunts of willpower I am already inclined towards and gets me back to where I were before all this bullshit that last decade or so has consisted of happened. You tweak the rules of probability in my narrative to work according to the rules of good writing, where the protagonist can't be randomly killed of or the world destroyed without proper foreshadowing in some way completely unrelated to the plot so far, and a good end is guaranteed conditional of the protagonist acting in good faith putting in a sufficiently superhuman amount of suffering and hard work and heroic sacrifices and so on and doesn't fall to their Tragic Flaw. I give you the most spectacular narrative of infinite hubristic ambition transcending ontology and all other bounds. Once I finish slash become the Friendly AI Singleton, if and only if it's actually friendly, you hook it up with whatever larger context let you become a ROB and whatever power I could have argued for here but didn't, to continue that story and attempt to one day eclipse even you. Feel free to throw in some other worldbuilding curveballs to keep things interesting, if needed. Either way, I'm going in blind."
