For my purposes, I'd want a setup that enables lots of drama and entertaining conflicts while aiming to improve the world with the secondary effects. The first genre that came to mind was sports, so how about this?

Everyone gains the ability to manipulate their own biology. At a baseline they can accelerate their healing, cure themselves of any chronic health conditions including ageing, turn off pain at will, and if seriously injured they reflexively enter a state of suspended animation until they recover.

However, with practice, it's possible to slowly shapeshift beyond the bounds of the human form and introduce new features found in nature, or indeed anything that's biologically possible.

This would fix lots of issues with the human condition for everyone. Ideally the power also removes the need for outside sustenance, so that even entropy isn't a concern. However, to reduce the power level it could instead respect conservation of energy and be made to operate more slowly.

In terms of narrative, my proposal is that it is four years until the first Olympic Games in which use of this power is permitted, opening up every competition to a vast variety of optimized body plans, and my mission is to compete to win as many gold medals as possible.

Naturally, along the way I'll encounter rival athletes with different philosophies for how to best use the power, such as whether to focus on enhancing the physiology of the human form, to turn into the most suitable animals from nature, or to become something entirely new that's focused on a specific task without regard for any other requirements.

As a backdrop to this will be all the societal changes. Anyone can choose to walk away and subsist off photosynthesis without needing to engage with the rest of humanity, and people will want to optimize their biologies for all sorts of different goals. That's not to mention how it will affect spaceflight, animal rights, warfare and law enforcement, dating and romance, and so on. The Olympic Games will therefore also serve as a platform for many of the arguments about how it should be used to be expressed during the events.

I think negotiation is necessary to avoid the risk of the resulting changes having bad outcomes, and weakening this power will still preserve most of the global benefits.
