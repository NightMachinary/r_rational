You have the power as described and it works reasonably well, even against trolls, but occasionally you interact with people that are outright insane, causing the good faith effect to force everyone to seriously engage with the insane belief, you most of all, and their insane view points propagate through you. Thus you periodically have to engage in wacky debates and debunkings such as (for example) explaining why the CIA aren't listening into or why Jesus isn't communicating through alphabet soup.
