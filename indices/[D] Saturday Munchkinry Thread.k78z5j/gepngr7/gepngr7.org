A Random Omnipotent Being (R.O.B.) is offering to give you superpowers/magical power. However it wants/needs interesting results: a good “narrative” in which the power isn't too OP. To this end you can add complications or conditions to the power, allow the ROB to give rivals/nemeses opposing powers, and/or allow the ROB to manipulate your life setup a few narrative plot threads in your life to force the circumstances of your power usage to be interesting. If you don't propose good complications/rivals/plot threads the ROB will add to them. With each power your propose you can either negotiate further and learn how the ROB will alter the bargain (to which they can respond further with their own alternatives or modifications to the scenario) or go in blind and get stuck with whatever the ROB chooses.

Additionally, the ROB adds a condition: the more you negotiate with the ROB to find out the exact limits you can get the weaker your powers will be.

I'll role play ROB, and you can propose a superpower/magic power and your complications/rivals/plot threads and either ask for negotiation or go in blind and I'll tell you how the ROB responds.

If I'm slow responding other people can role play the ROB.

If anyone wants to play ROB: I and 107 other random people around the world gain the ability to craft minor magical items. Unfortunately one of these people alerts several governments and now every major world government seeks to control these people. Going in blind, so whatever complications/enemies/plot threads you add are in.
