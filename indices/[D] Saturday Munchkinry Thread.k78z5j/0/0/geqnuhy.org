I think the best way to go about it would be to try your best to setup a Good vs Good conflict, one where there are two sides in general agreement about improving the world, but differing in what the eventual utopia is going to look like. To that end, I think I would probably focus on space colonization so that I can set up an augmented space race/exploitation narrative. The best contrast, IMO, is going to be myself as a scion of otherworldly expansion, while my enemies will be focused on Earth boosterism.

To that end, I give myself teleportation and the ability to tag people as teleportation delegates, capable of making any specific teleporation traversal that I've already made with them (or that they've made with another teleportation delegate), all of this pegged to gravity wells somehow so that when you teleport to Mars, you're actually teleporting to Mars, not to where Mars was twenty minutes ago. This power /also/ has some scalability, because once I've gone through the trouble of traversal, my delegates can do their own trips and expand the network, so long as I have people tagged in. Beyond that, it /also/ gives some narratively convenient complications, like who gets trusted with what, jockeying for position within the org structure, secret bases that only a trusted few can teleport to, etc.

My opponents, meanwhile, will be among the Earth Booster League, competing with me largely for resources and personnel in their quest to make Earth the shining central jewel on humankind. If my end goal is the rapid terraforming and colonization of planets, which requires people, technology, and seed materials, then their powers should also be dependent on those same things. (I've decided that they're a League, rather than one individual, because that allows for there to be more narrative arcs that can develop.)

Maybe there's a branch who have the power to make materials, one who can generate lots of common metals without the need for mining, another who can do refining, another who can make physically impossible materials, etc., and make it so that some of them don't scale particularly well, which creates pressure and tension, which is narratively good.

Another branch has special power over people, with one capable of sharing skills and knowledge, one capable of enforcing agreements, one who can biologically boost people, etc. You'd have to be careful about this branch, I think, but it would broadly cover the personnel and org challenges, giving the Earth-boosters a leg up.

The core of the idea is that we're not actually interested in sabotaging each other, and we both do best when we do best, the but the inherent conflict is inescapable, and at the end of it, the competition for humanity's future is going to leave people better off one way or another.
