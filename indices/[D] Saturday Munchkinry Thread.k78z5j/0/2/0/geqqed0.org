Accepted, and everyone gets the higher end version which cheats conversation of mass/energy a bit. Enough so that world hunger/nutrition is no longer an issue and shapeshifting doesn't need a special diet to fuel it.

In addition to the friendly but high stakes Olympic Game, however, you also have to deal with terrorists that have a quasi-religious (and in some cases actually religious) obsession with the purity of the original human form. They have targeted both the games as a whole for highlighting “deviant human forms” and you specifically for being one of the leading shapeshifters. The most extreme terrorists are planning bio weapons that will target those that utilize the shapeshifting the most.

You can renegotiate further, but then the power will start requiring more biomass/energy, enough to make high-end frequent shapeshifting something only people with expensive diets can perform.
