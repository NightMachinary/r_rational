"Deal!"

(The idea here is to exploit the converse of the negotiation = less power clause, by limiting negotiations to a single digit number of words. 'Adam West Batman' was chosen, on the basis that such powers would implicitly shift the 'genre' of the world toward the sort of conflicts which happen in a particularly campy, low-powered superhero setting, as opposed to anything incredibly destructive or intractable, as a wider reaching power might do. The above power lets you figure out important truths and obtain the necessary tools to do something about said truths, which when coupled with very nearly as much power as the Random Omnipotent Being was willing to give away, seems like one of the best offers to make.)
