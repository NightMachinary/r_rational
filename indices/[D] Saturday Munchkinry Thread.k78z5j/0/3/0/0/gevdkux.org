That already happened a bunch of times the last few years, and will presumably keep happening, no need for the ROB to do it. And I'm pretty sure me being a random private person with no relevant skills or special assets of any kind, and giant multi-billion corporations having it as a top priority already existing, makes that quite redundant. Likewise they are already almost certainly going to be unfriendly, so no need for subtle manipulation. As I said, this world is already ear-maximally entertaining and narratively engaging, the only difference is Eliezer is the protagonist, not me.
