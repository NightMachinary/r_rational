I don't think that's it. Fanfiction does not have to deal with the same themes as the source material. Nor does it have to use the same characters, or happen in the same world. It should almost certainly fit one of those three criteria, but none are mandatory.

Fanfiction is a label which tells the reader to refer to the original work for context, such as themes, characterisation, worldbuilding, and emotional investment. Subpar fanfic authors use this to patch over parts of the story where their own writing is lacking. It's a label which has to be added by the author, either explicitly or by using names from the source material. It's a label which can be deliberately removed, too - /50 Shades of Grey/ is not /Twilight/ fanfiction, even if it's only a find-replace away.

In any case, /Friendship is Optimal/ is not about the creation of the TV series /My Little Pony/, it's about the creation of a (fictitious) AI based on it. And if a story about creating a simulated world based on an in-universe television series isn't fanfiction, then /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][The Finale of the Ultimate Mega Meta Crossover]]/ isn't fanfiction of anything other than /Permutation City/.

/Friendship is Optimal/ also uses a lot of tropes that are characteristic of MLP fanfic. There's plenty of other stories about Equestria contacting Earth and humans turning into ponies, which I will not list here as they don't deserve the attention. FiO doesn't fall on the blurry line of genre boundaries, it's so far inside the fanfic norm that it's in a well-documented subgenre.
