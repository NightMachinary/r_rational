We just disagree with what makes the label "fanfiction" appropriate then, which is not going to make for a good conversation. I think what I disagree with most strongly is the idea that an author has some ultimate authority in deciding what labels can or should apply to their work (though I don't deny that they have /some/).

My argument against /FiO/ being fanfiction is that it doesn't take place within that world (except where that world is acknowledged as purely fictional), it doesn't share any characters (except when those characters are acknowledged as purely fictional), and so far as I can tell isn't about any of the same things as /My Little Pony/ (though I'll admit to not having watched more than a few episodes). So I don't see how it's any more fanfiction than a story about the production of the television series would be fanfiction, or a story about someone watching the show, or a story about a fan convention, regardless of whether the author thinks that it's fanfiction or not.

But as I said, it's a difference in definitions, which means that we're not going to convince each other.
