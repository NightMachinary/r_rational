I haven't read FIO, but I think fanfic should be an expansive term. For what it's worth, FIO is commonly described as an MLP fanfic and is hosted on Fimfic, a website dedicated to MLP fanfic. What else do you want? It's like arbitrarily deciding that only certain genres of fanfic are really fanfics. I'm sure there are people out there who would argue that HPMOR isn't really a Harry Potter fanfic because it changes a lot of background details in the setting and none of the characters resemble their canon counterparts.

Is Fallout Equestria a Fallout fanfic? It doesn't take place in the same world as Fallout or share any characters with Fallout.

Heck, by that standard, the average Highschool AU isn't a fanfic.
