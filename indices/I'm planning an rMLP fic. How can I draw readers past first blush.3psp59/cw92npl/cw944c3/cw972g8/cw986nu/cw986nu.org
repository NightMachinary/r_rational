When you write fanfic, you're making a transformative work. Sometimes this is an extension of the work, other times it's commentary on the work, but it's (almost always) contained within that created world itself.

Works like /FiO/ are a level up. It's like the difference between putting on your own production of /Lysistrata/ and putting on a production of a play about a production of /Lysistrata/. The additional meta level is not at all trivial; it makes the work about a totally different thing. /Lysistrata/ is about sex, feminism, and society. A play about a production of /Lysistrata/ will necessarily have to be about how people interact with /Lysistrata/, about art as representation, and about producing meaning in art (also, likely about interpersonal relationships between actors, directors, etc.).

That change in focus that comes with switching levels makes a huge difference in what the work is about and who might like it.
