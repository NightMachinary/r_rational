Oh good, someone mentioned that there's an entire LW group /on the main MLP fanfic site/. Because, far from having an ugh field, LW is one of the most thoroughly pony-ridden communities I've ever seen.

It's actually one of the few solid pieces of evidence I have that we're not actually just halfway-sociopathic, halfway-autistic, 100%-egotistical nerdling-people trying to justify a sense of superiority over everyone else in the world.
