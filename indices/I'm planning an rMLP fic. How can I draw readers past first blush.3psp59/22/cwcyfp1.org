You could start by not having MLP in the title. I'm sure everybody's seen the possibly-staged Tumblr thread where somebody says "wouldn't it be cool to see a story about tattoos just appearing on people at meaningful moments, and people having to figure out what they mean" and like three people saying they'd read the shit out of it until someone says "you're talking about My Little Pony."

Just make it a strong and compelling story, leave MLP completely out of the title, present it on its own merits, and let people sort it out on their own. Fans = realize in the first paragraph, everyone else = doesn't realize for a while, and gives your writing an honest chance.
