That's actually a very sensible point that I haven't seen terribly much of in rational fic. I suspect one of the flaws quite common in this community may be to forget that humans (or remarkably human like ponies) are far better served specialising and collaborating with other specialists than we are attempting to be omni-disciplinary geniuses.\\
An MLP fic seems like a very good venue for looking at how to manage a group of diverse specialists towards an end goal none of them could individually achieve.
