Let me second the recommendation of [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/174671/seeking-power][Seeking Power]]. It basically /is/ a rational Twilight, grown up and serving as Celestia's chancellor, having to deal with Nightmare Moon's return while having already figured out a lot about the Elements... but Luna is acting sane, and she has her own plans. This takes place in a somewhat different Equestria from the show, but [[/u/Calamitizer]] should definitely read it first.

I'd also recommend the same author's [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]]. In an Equestria starting out very close to the show, Twilight was rejected by Celestia... and mentored by Nightmare Moon in her dreams.
