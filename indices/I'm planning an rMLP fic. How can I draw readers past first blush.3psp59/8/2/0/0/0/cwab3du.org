I've seen rationalist Luna (and Star Swirl), but again they tend to be quite noncanon. I'm not even sure there's a canon character who could be considered actively rationalist.

Part of that, of course, is that rationalist characters tend to push changes (particularly technological and social ones) which eventually spread to the society they're in, and FiM is /almost/ a status-quo show. It doesn't mean you couldn't have a background character rationalist who was just starting out and thus operating on a small scale from somewhere that wasn't Canterlot or Ponyville, or one from a land outside Equestria, or one from the past or future. Or, in a fic (most likely a between-seasons one), you could have Twilight discover rationalism in a book and gleefully convert to it, she being the canon character most likely to be swayed by that particular mindset.
