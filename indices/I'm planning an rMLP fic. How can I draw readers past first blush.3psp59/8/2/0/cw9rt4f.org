Speculation. Rationality tend to be written about in fiction as a single clear-headed protagonist acting on rational principles, often regardless of whether that would cause friction with other characters or the society they're in. Equestria appears to rate friendship and sociality above the kind of single-minded focus characteristic of, for example, pre-S1 Twilight Sparkle.

Of course, what might be interesting is a rational character who /embraces/ the tenets of Equestria and deliberately sets out to enhance themselves and others through friendship and close relationships.

Thinking further, there's also the issue of Celestia. It's not unknown for rationalist characters to become sufficiently powerful (or at least influential) that their actions start having political consequences. It's not too far a stretch to imagine that at some point, Celestia is going to want to talk to such a character. Depending on the character's intelligence and willingness to compromise, and the degree of flexibility Celestia is being written with, there may or may not be conflict between their visions for the future.
