I would certainly give it a shot, I enjoyed FIO enough to post geeky rants about the backstory. If the intelligent character ends up deconstructing some of the problems in the genre backstory I will be delighted.

I seem to recall a couple of munchkin!MPL fics where one character was smarter or more genre-savvy, but I can't pull them to mind right now. I'm not an MLP fan, and I only vaguely recognize the canon characters, so there's no strong anchors to pull them up from the swamp of my memory.

Edit: I'd also love to see some rational!Elfquest, rational!Xanth, rational!Cerebus, etc etc etc...
