  Also, has any straightforward "character X is smarter" MLP fic been (successfully) written before? I haven't really seen anything like that.

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/lesswrong]] has a lot of similar fiction to what you suggest. I don't think the basic straightforward HPMOR premise of making just a few characters smarter and only tweaking the world building slightly has been done before all the way to a good and complete fic. The Great Alicorn Hunt and Mortal are both pretty close to that premise though. I like MLP fanfiction and I think on average MLP fanfiction is better than other fanfic (like 99% of other fanfic is crap while only 80-90% of MLP fanfic is crap if I stick to fimfiction) so I would probably read any r!MLP that you write, but if you want to really catch my attention, an original and clever deviation different from the straightfoward make x,y and z characters smarter would be required.
