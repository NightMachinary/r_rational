  A liking for MLP shows that?
#+end_quote

A liking for MLP shows a liking for friendship and social stuff. Remember, the [[/r/hpmor]] community divided itself into "Dragon Army", "Chaos Legion", and "Sunshine Regiment", and seemingly significant segments of the rationalist community find Robin Hanson and other, nastier things genuinely persuasive, as ideologies.

I require evidence that the community doesn't solely consist of those for whom valuing other human beings is just a matter of ethical affectation, and by gosh, liking MLP might as well be it.
