Also if you've not seen it I recommend the story of [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/73404/through-the-well-of-pirene][through the well of pirene]] It's one of the better pieces of fantasy fiction in general I've read.

Not rationalist but it does have a semi-rational villain arc that I absolutely adore.
