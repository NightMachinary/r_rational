But ... I don't love ponies?

I'm saying that /here/ mostly because if someone wants to know how to get around the fact that people have pony aversion, they probably want to hear from someone who actually experiences pony aversion.

Are you suffering from the typical mind fallacy? Sometimes when a person says that they don't love ponies, it's not because they're lying for some absurd reason, it's because they actually don't love ponies.
