  Are you suffering from the typical mind fallacy? Sometimes when a person says that they don't love ponies, it's not because they're lying for some absurd reason, it's because they actually don't love ponies.

Not so much typical mind fallacy as "experience with [[/r/rational]] users sufficient to make frequentist estimates of what counts as typical." When I said "all", I was speaking metaphorically.
