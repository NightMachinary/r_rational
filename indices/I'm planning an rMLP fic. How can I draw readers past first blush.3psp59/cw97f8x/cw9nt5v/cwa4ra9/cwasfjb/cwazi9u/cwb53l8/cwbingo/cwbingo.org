Humans display a lot of behaviors that are adaptive for some reason, without consciously understanding the reason. As long as the behavior /is/ adaptive, the meme will gain an advantage in competing against other memes, and you end up with people doing things that could be described in rational ways that they don't actually understand. So although they don't consciously weigh statistics, they still act as if they consciously weighed statistics.
