Obviously it's not literally true. But I think it's evenly distributed enough that you won't get much useful information. In a lot of groups, individual variation is much larger than group variation.

For any statement you make that's not directly related to the definition of group membership, there's a good chance you can find a counterexample.

Also, bayesianism only works if you have meaningful numbers. Did you actually conduct a survey to determine how much the trait is expressed on average? Was the methodology sound? Or are you just pulling traits out of the air based on salient individuals?

It's not even about bronies specifically. This is true of any sufficiently large group.

Even when you do have solid evidence, there are always lots of other factors to consider. For example, it's well documented that in America, black males are much more likely than others to go to prison. But if I asked the next 5 black males I see, I bet that none of them have been to prison. People I meet is obviously a biased sample of all Americans.
