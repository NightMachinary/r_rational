I stopped reading the /Austraeoh/ series somewhere in the middle of the third book--not because of any purpleness (as far as I can remember--this was some years ago), but because there were too many groups of characters in widely-separated locations for me to keep track of.

In any case, I much prefer /[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198][Background Pony]]/ out of this writer's works--it's probably my third-favorite fanfiction story (behind /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][In the Blood]]/). IIRC (I last read it quite a while ago, and that was only my second reading of it), it's even more purple than /Austraeoh/, though...
