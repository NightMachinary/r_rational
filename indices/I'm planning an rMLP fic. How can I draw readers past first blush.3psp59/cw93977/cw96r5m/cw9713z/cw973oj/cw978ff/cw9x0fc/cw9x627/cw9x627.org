  This is the exact opposite of rational! Sasuke decides to be secretive and vague instead of getting blood tests ASAP.
#+end_quote

I thought that the investigation of Sasuke's relationship with Ino and his children was very interesting to read, even if I hardly understood his motivations. Unfortunately, [[#s][spoiler]].

  Naruto is oblivious to his mother showing up with Haku as her bodyguard.
#+end_quote

(shrugs) It's Naruto--I don't expect /that/ much of him, even if he's Hokage. And, anyway, didn't he last see his mother (or the remnants of her chakra in his seal) thirty years ago? And that was an image of her when she was an adult, not a child, as the clone is--he probably has no photographs of Kushina as a child. Likewise, he last saw Haku thirty years ago, and has had no reason to think about him since then.

  Karin neither clamps down on the secret nor investigates further.

That's a hint for what's behind the clones...

  Way too many plotlines.
#+end_quote

Actually, this is one of the very few stories with multiple plotlines that I've enjoyed reading. Maybe it's because I already know most of the characters so well, so it's less confusing than /[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/88713][Innavedr]]/ was. I'll admit that I got a little bored with the clone!Kushina/clone!Haku storyline, though, and I had little liking for that dumbbell farmer boy who became a ninja.

  800k is too much, even for me.

(Some of the final chapters are skippable, by the way--163-169 are comprehensive notes from the author.)
