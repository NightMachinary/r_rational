I think Friendship is Optimal was actually quite popular, all things considered. Ultimately, there are a fair amount of limits on what you can do to make a fanfiction popular to an outsider since the range of people who understand it is dependent on the fandom. For example, a fanfiction of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (JoJo's Rational Adventure anyone???) is going to have a smaller audience than a fanfiction of Harry Potter simply because Harry Potter has a much larger fandom and is much more widely consumed in the general populace.

Picking MLP as your base for your fanfiction will help you because many people are familiar with the original work. It will hurt you because many people are not familiar with the original work. If your goal is to try to get readers who haven't watched MLP, your best tool is probably basing the fic off of something other than MLP. I think MLP has an active fan-community and is widely watched, though, so I wouldn't really worry about this.
