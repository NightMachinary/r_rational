I would suggest something that nobody else has here: Figure out why there is an ugh field around MLP fandom. Then try to figure out how--or if--you can demonstrate that the reasons for that field don't apply.

(I suspect a lot of it is just Bayseianism about what can be predicted about a person, on the average, from the knowledge that he is a MLP fan. And you can't just tell people not to be Bayseian.)
