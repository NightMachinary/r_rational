A quick search through fimfiction turned [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/272422/spike-and-the-methods-of-rationality][this]] up. It appears someone else has had a similar idea.

That website ([[http://www.fimfiction.net][fimfiction.net]]) might be a decent resource for you. It appears to have a FAQ, writers guide, IRC chat and some other community functions. Not to mention that it seems to be a pretty nice place to host fanfictions. (At least a lot better than fanfiction.net.)
