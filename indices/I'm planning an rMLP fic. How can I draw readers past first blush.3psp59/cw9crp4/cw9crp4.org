I've seen Twilight in particular be cranked up the genius scale a couple of notches in stuff like [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/13616/arrow-18-mission-logs-lone-ranger][Arrow 18]], where she not only learns the language of the protagonist over the course of the story, but a range of advanced science and technology.

There's also a far more brutally rationalist Twilight in, for example, the AU of [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]].

However, due to the sugarbowl nature of the show, rationalism seems like something which would grate on society in most of Equestria, and be treated almost as a moderate-to-severe personality fault. You could probably get away with doing rationalist Star Swirl, but for any other character you'd have to have some reason as to how they managed to function in Equestria, unless they were part of a non-pony society (for example, being a diamond dog).

It'd also be interesting to see a non-unicorn rationalist. While magic is the obvious overpowered leverage point in MLP fic, how might a pegasus or earth pony rationalist take action?
