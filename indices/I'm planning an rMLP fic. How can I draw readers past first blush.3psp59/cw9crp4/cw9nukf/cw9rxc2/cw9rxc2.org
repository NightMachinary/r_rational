Rational doesn't necessarily imply being anti-social. However, someone who has the strength of character to take rationalist actions in the face of social expectations or norms could easily be perceived as such.

It's entirely possible to write about a character who follows social expectations 95% of the time and fits in rationalist actions around the sides and edges of those expectations (or takes actions which are not optimal, but are as much so as they can manage while still conforming to others' expectations), but that's rather softer and more balanced than most of the rationalist fiction I've read, which has a tendency to leap for the jugular.
