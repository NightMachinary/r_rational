Write this (any) fanfic with enough elaboration and explaination that it can be read without googling the actual series, but try to make it interesting, in some way, to people who know the setting- or minimize the time spent on it. (to the stars did this reasonably well for me- the only thing that really confused me was the madoka references. HPmor did it pretty well too, if not flawlessly- i think- i already knew hp canon, which messes with it..)

Lots of rationalfic falls more or less flat, and mlp does have an 'ugh feild', (that i've personally gotten past.) but i can promise i'd try it, regardless of MLP- I try to try any fanfic posted here, at least the first chapter. I can't promise i'd follow it, not when i haven't seen how interesting your plot is, but i'd try at least one chapter. I suspect i'm not the only one.
