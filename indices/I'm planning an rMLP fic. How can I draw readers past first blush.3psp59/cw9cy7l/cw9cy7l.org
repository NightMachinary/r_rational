Considering the resounding success of Friendship is optimal (even though it isn't really a fanfic) and Fallout: Equestria (even though it isn't quite rational) I'm sure there's a big enough overlap to get you an initial audience. If it turns out to be good, word of mouth will be enough to bring more people to it.
