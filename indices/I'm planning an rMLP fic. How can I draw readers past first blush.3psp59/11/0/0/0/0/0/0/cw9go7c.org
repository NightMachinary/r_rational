The real-life /My Little Pony/ franchise does exist within /Friendship is Optimal/, and it's acknowledged as fictional. And if the story had ended in the first couple of chapters I wouldn't be confused. But /Equestria Online/ is Iceman's invention, extrapolating from the real-life MLP episodes, just like fanfiction. It's like if someone wrote a story about the production of Season 8 of the TV series, and included detailed storyboards or scripts of the episodes. Is that just fanfiction with a framing device? That can't be right.

I'm sorry, I shouldn't be looking for an argument. I know you're a better writer than me, I just want your advice. Is the distinction between fictional-fictional and fictional-real important here, or am I missing the point?
