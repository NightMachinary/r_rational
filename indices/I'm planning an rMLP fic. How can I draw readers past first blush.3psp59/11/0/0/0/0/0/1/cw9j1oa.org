To some extent, I feel this is false. It felt to me pretty obvious when reading that David, the character who eventually comes to identify with the name Light Sparks, is pretty much intended to be a Twi*light* *Spark*le expy in many ways, for all his initial humanity and gender; And David is a product of the 'real world' of the story, at least initially, as opposed to the world-within-a-world containing meta-fictional characters.

That said, whether or not FiO 'is fanfiction' or not is the sort of meaningless label-fight that comes down to arguing about what the definition of various labels 'should' be, and is therefore completely pointless to debate or discuss.

For what it's worth, I don't like MLP:FIM canon / source material very much, and there are like ~3 stories that come from it's source material that I enjoy, of which FiO is far and away the best.
