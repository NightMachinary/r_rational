I guess I think of labels as being about predictive power, and one of the reasons that I exclude meta-level works like this from "fanfiction" is that I think they don't often share too much with other things that we'd agree are fanfiction.

I think giving /FiO/ the label "fiction about /My Little Pony/" gives a far better idea of /what it is/ than saying "fanfiction of /My Little Pony/". It's obviously moot here, because we've both read it and know what it is more fully than the distinction could encompass.
