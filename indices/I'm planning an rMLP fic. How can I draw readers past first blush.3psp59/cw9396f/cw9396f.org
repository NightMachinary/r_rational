I would be strongly resistant to any pony-based fanfic. The reasons that I read /Friendship is Optimal/ were that a lot of people highly recommended it to me, it was complete, and it was "not technically fanfic" (in the way that a story about a bunch of people living in a virtual version of the /Enterprise/ is not technically fanfic of /Star Trek/).

I don't actually think that this is an example of an ugh field. It's not a matter of being conditioned against those stories, it's an honest assessment of probability. The odds that /any/ fanfic is going to be good is low. The odds that I will enjoy a fanfic about a franchise which I don't enjoy is low. The odds that a given serial work will be abandoned is fairly high. The odds that I will enjoy a serial work which is incomplete is low. The only real way to counter this (for me) is for me to read some rave reviews that cause me to adjust my level of probable enjoyment.

This leaves you in the Catch-22 that lots of writers fall into; people don't want to read what you've written without assurances that it's good, but people aren't going to assure others that it's good until they've read what you've written. Having it be MLP fanfic only makes this problem more extreme.

Sorry if I don't have great advice on how to solve this problem. The best I can offer is to just write well continuously until people start to take notice; eventually you'll pass through some barriers as your story garners recommendations, which will get you more readers, which will get you more recommendations. But that takes a lot of time and effort.
