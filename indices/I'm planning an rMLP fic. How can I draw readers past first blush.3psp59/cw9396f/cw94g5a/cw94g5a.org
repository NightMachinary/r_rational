  The odds that I will enjoy a fanfic about a franchise which I don't enjoy is low.

That's how I felt about HPMoR and MLP:FIO, but one of the things that I enjoyed most about them was that they lampshaded the hell out of the things that annoyed me about the canon genres. Inserting a rational or genre-savvy character into any irrational genre is going to have a huge popcorn effect for me.

And I can't see any rational!MLP that didn't bust the genre actually being rational.

Starting out with a few genre-busting epiphanies would ensure a jet-assisted take-off.
