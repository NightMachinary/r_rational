  Would you, personally, be willing to give it a shot?

I am fairly MLP-indifferent. I have seen a couple of episodes when I happened to be present when others around me were watching. I did not find I had any burning desire to see more, but I also was not made actively upset by watching them. I'm not a part of that particular passionate fandom, but as a person who has been a member of other passionate fandoms in the past, I don't disparage.

My answer to your question is yes, I would be willing to give it a shot. If it were well-written and compelling --- and didn't rely on me having more knowledge of MLP than my few random episodes plus general cultural awareness has granted me --- then I would be willing to stick with it.
