Are you really proposing that a Wednesday Worldbuilding post would count as fiction if only there were enough of a focus on describing the world and not asking other people for their thoughts?

A description of a fictional scenario is not, in itself, fiction.

Your initial post makes it abundantly clear that you're looking for a fight. The subreddit rules are plain and simple; please do not require the mods to include a five-page dissertation on what is and is not actually a story.
