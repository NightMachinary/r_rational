I asked about whether people were interested in this on Friday, and a few people responded. I was already writing it, so I've started putting it up on SV.

Taylor got a shard called Conflict Resolution. Her powers prevent her from having psychological disorders, let her see disorders in others, and let her cure all psychological disorders on touch. Expect more feels than fights.

This is the first time I've written anything, but I've put a lot of thought into this. Constructive criticism welcome.
