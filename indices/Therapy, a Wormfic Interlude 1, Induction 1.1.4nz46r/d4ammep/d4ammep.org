  If I touched, say, Kaiser, things would go downhill for the E88 fast.

This implies that Kaiser's activity, or maybe his racism, is /primarily/ driven by some form of mental illness...

This power is gonna get awfully controversial awfully fast.

In fact it looks like your comment section has already gleefully restarted the eternal "what counts as a mental illness?" argument. With guest appearances by Asperger's, sociopathy, and minority sexual desires.

I'm both anticipating and dreading the times where you'll have to drop Word of God on the grey areas.
