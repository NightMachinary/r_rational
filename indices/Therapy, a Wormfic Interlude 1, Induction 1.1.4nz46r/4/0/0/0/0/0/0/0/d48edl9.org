He broke the Spacebattles spoiler embargo for Star Wars: the Force Awakens, and got a one day ban for it. SB was really strict regarding anything that was looked like a SWtFA spoiler for a while there, and did not allow any spoilers (even properly tagged ones) outside of a special forum, had a bunch of site-wide announcements about it, and came down hard on anybody anywhere near the line. As I understand it, Mr. Zoat has a really long, unbroken daily posting streak, and at least part of jumping ship was to keep the streak going.

In his own words from the Story FAQ on SV:

  *So... Spacebattles?*

  On the 30th of December I received a one day ban from Spacebattles. This was due to me posting the following:

  'I've seen the film, and I'm still not sure how a government backed paramilitary counts as a rebellion.'

  This fell afoul of the then Spacebattles policy of coming down hard on anyone talking about a film that may possibly involve... Wars. And maybe Stars.

  My opinion is that this was complete overkill, and after my appeal was rejected I decided to move the thread to Sufficient Velocity. It will not be going back.
