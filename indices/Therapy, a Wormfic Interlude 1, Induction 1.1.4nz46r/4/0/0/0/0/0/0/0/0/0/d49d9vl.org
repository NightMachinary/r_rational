It's entirely in keeping with how SB was running their moderation for Star Wars stuff. Any spoiler, however slight, if made outside the appropriate forum, qualified. Here is what I [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-eleven.311139/page-2121#post-20295073][wrote]] at the time:

  I see why mods did what they did, and it was within their bounds to do so. It also seems to be the case that NOT banning Zoat while other users were banned for similar infractions would in fact be making an exception for him. I understand the temptation there was (a temptation to which the moderators yielded) to treat everyone equally and ban Zoat. That being said, this is your guys' house. You make the rules, you enforce the rules, and there was nothing stopping you from saying "Zoat gets to technically break this rule in a small way, because he's an important member of the community." Some would say that such a solution is bad. I'd say that it is always the right choice, especially given his contributions. I'm sad to see him go.

  These rules were made in service of man, in service of SB, that they might help us. They are not your masters, they are your tools-- a means, not an end. Never forget that.
