These would all be near the top of my list, though /Manager/ is a little lower than the others. /Cenotaph/ is great, but IMO the trilogy keeps getting stronger through /Memorial/ and /Legacy/ (in progress) - there's some brilliantly executed development of themes as well as top-notch characterisation and technical skills second to none.

If you can handle unfinished stuff, Ryuugi has left a number of brilliant short pieces which died too soon - /Zenith/, if you have to pick one, and /Here be Dragons/ (finished!). /Copaceptic/ is probably the best post-canon fic, blending slice-of-life with... other... elements.
