I lost track of the one where Cassie being manipulated to suicide was labeled as probably-crayak so asking here:

Was the teleportation out of the blast zone mutual then? IIRC there were some low-cost moves where morph-gates were moved, and some super-high cost moves like Erek and Tom. I assumed it was Ellimist bc it resulted in a yeerk in Ax's head, which resulted in Helium.
