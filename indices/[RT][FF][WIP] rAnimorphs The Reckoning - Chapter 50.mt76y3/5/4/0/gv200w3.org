Elfangor's weapon simply malfunctioned; each of the gods was /ready/ to intervene but neither had to.

In Chapter 32, the first time they spied on the Visser, they couldn't actually kill him because Kodep was there. Separately, them talking themselves out of it was also not divine intervention, but just them being themselves.

The Ellimist wanted them comatose/out of the way so that the Visser's disarmament of Earth could proceed apace, so that when the Howlers arrived, there would be essentially zero chance of a successful human resistance, so that the Animorphs would readily evacuate in an ark rather than sticking around to fight.
