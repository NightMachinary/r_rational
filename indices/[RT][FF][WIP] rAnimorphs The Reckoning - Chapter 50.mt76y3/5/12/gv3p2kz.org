In Chapter 39, the Visser comes to the conclusion that:

  Without the Earth, completing the conquest of the rest of the galaxy will take five times as long, and be twice as likely---or more---to fail.

In Chapter 40, Jake says:

#+begin_quote
  He shouldn't still be here. He's got no business being here. It's like---it's like---look, no matter how valuable the Earth is, compared to the rest of the galaxy, he doesn't need it to win. He's been running circles around everybody for two years straight, and then he gets here and suddenly all kinds of headaches start popping up. He should've just blown us up and left. But he didn't.
#+end_quote

Godly intervention? Alloran's not-really-explained method of manipulating the Visser even after he dissolved? Something else entirely?

Along similar lines, did one or both of the gods cause Jake to have a black box on purpose? Writing down a long string of rock paper scissors victories in advance seems a bit much to have happened naturally.
