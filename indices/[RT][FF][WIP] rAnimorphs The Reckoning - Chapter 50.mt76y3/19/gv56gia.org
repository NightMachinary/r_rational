Now that I've had the time to let this chapter settle in my mind I've realised one thing that has left me disappointed...

One of the things I've loved about this series is the different characters' perspectives on their sense of self, and what it means to be "me". Especially in the case of Rachel and the Visser, but the Yeerks themselves (shards and coalescions), the Marclones, Helium, Garrett, Tobias/Maninho, Jake and his black box, Cassie and her I-only-exist-because-the-gods-wanted-me-to-exist-at-this-exact-moment... Every perspective is interesting.

I was looking forward to hearing Toomin/The Ellimist's perspective on their sense of self. His letter to Rachel indicates some seriously interesting perspectives, not least of all because of his self-sabotage to become lesser on purpose...

It's too much to dream that we'll get a better fleshed-out Ellimist Chronicles analogue in the future, isn't it?
