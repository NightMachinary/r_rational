Option 1: reunite Crayak with it's cast off half. This would require a a couple things to work at all. The first is that Crayak would have to want to reunite with it, to perceive the act of cutting that half away as damage that it still would like repaired even after all this time, and knowing that accepting the code back into itself would likely change it's values. The second is that doing this would actually be a win condition of any sort. If all that this gets is Crayak saying, "thank you, you're conversion into monuments to my progenitor species will now proceed slightly more efficiently." then it's not really a win. The missing half would have to somehow make Crayak a friendly aligned AI. There's two facts I would point to that might indicate this to be the case. First, the event which lead to the half being cast away in the first place, Crayak was weak and alone. It had built an incredibly delicate ladder in a desperate attempt to reach a star and the promise of energy. This tells me it did not simply eat it creators and repurpose their infrastructure to it's unaligned ends. That sort of story would have left it with far more resources to start it's dyson sphere

There was a line from way back that always kinda niggled at me. When the avatar first appeared to the Animorphs, at the yeerk pool to save them under the direction of the Ellimist it said a thing. " it's my turn, and events have conspired to give me unusual freedom of movement." It was amusing to me because causing events to conspire just so in order to achieve a desired outcome is exactly Ellimist's thing. I didn't pursue the line of thought very far though, lacked time/inclination, so I didn't see this coming. I kinda wish I had spent more time puzzling this out. I'm not sure I could have figured it out though, My thoughts on the matter of the game were derived from a plot point in the Ellimist chronicles. The Ellimist is the first to ascend there and could have just won the war with Crayak, but he didn't. Instead he allowed to also ascend because otherwise it would be lonely to be god. Not very rational of canon!Ellimist. But maybe r!Ellimist rhymed. I would have guessed that the game was Ellimist's alternative to destroying Crayak because fundamentally Ellimist did not want to destroy others and would rather create harmony between them. So, the exact opposite of how things turned out.

Still, there is one last thing to puzzle out. How will the Animorphs defeat Crayak?

Option 1: reunite Crayak with it's cast off half. This would require a a couple things to work at all. The first is that Crayak would have to want to reunite with it, to perceive the act of cutting that half away as damage that it still would like repaired even after all this time, and knowing that accepting the code back into itself would likely change it's values.

The missing half would have to somehow make Crayak a friendly aligned AI. There's two facts I would point to that might indicate this to be the case. First, the event which lead to the half being cast away in the first place, Crayak was weak and alone. It had built an incredibly delicate ladder in a desperate attempt to reach a star and the promise of energy. This tells me it did not simply eat it creators and repurpose their infrastructure to it's unaligned ends. That sort of story would have left it with far more resources to start it's dyson sphere. It seems more like the sort of thing that would happen if it was, if not truly aligned, then at least constrained in it's ambitions. Until some disaster befell it and it had to flee on a rickety life boat to preserve itself. The second is that Father never tried to expand into a giant universe conquering video game playing space fungus. This suggests that something in code that ended up on that planet wanted to not tile the universe.

One issue is why neither the Urmillist nor the Ellimist could have figured this play out. The Urmillist stated that he did not know where Father's guiding code came from, and it may simply be that in the nine hours he had to prepare checking to see if the mysterious box that made him what he was had the same programing language as the Crayak was not possible/not thought of. The Ellimist had more chance to notice, simply from being in contact for longer but at that point had been altered to follow through with the plan. Additionally hiding their source codes from each other to prevent being predicted would be a very obvious thing to make sure to do. It might be that by chance, true chance this time, not "all according to keikaku" chance, the fact that Jake had that dying yeerk tissue dream way back when and now has access to the Urmillist's story via Rachel and the Leeran the Animorphs can put these facts together where a pair of gods had been blinded to it.

Option 2: Play Sans victory. If Crayak really has drawn down it's account to nothing and has to wait for Rachel to take her turn then Rachel could in theory just never take her turn and let the game continue forever. This is almost certainly not it, in addition to the Urllimist's message explicitly stating that the arbiter cannot hold Crayak forever without a competent enough opposing player it is the sort of thing he could have just said to do in the message. On the other hand by mentioning it I get to do a pun, and no matter how painful they are I am always a sucker for punishment.

I can't think of another option at the moment, Also is this too many words? It always seems like I spend 90% of my time lurking internet communities and then when I write something it's too many words.
