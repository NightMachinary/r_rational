  This, too, is allowed by the rules of the game. There are a trillion trillion pieces, and all of them significant, their interactions governed by a shifting web of causality as delicate as a neutrino and as old as time itself. The web may be touched---nudged---shifted---once in an epoch, or possibly twice, a single strand may be snapped. Any more than that, and the game is forfeit. The players dance in slow infinity, calculating the fractal geometry of self-fulfilling prophecies, anticipating the impact of anticipated acts, and acting in reaction to events far in the unfixed future. Thus do cause, effect, and chaos mix, until even all-seeing eyes begin to miss things. There is always error, after all, and it is a chief characteristic of error that it is random---it being reliably willing to cancel itself out, it may safely be ignored. One can only go so many places beyond the decimal point before one is wasting resources more wisely spent elsewhere---a waste one's opponent will spot, and convert into advantage in accordance with the rules.

  On Earth, a girl is born. Her name is Rachel, and she is not supposed to be there.

Here--all the way back in Interlude 2--we see Toomin arranging for Rachel's creation. And, further, we see both the Ellimist and Crayak assume that since neither of /them/ are responsible, then the event must be unintended. Precisely as planned.

  A lump of rock falls into a star. The star explodes, as it would have anyway---the fire peaks a tenth of a degree hotter on a scale measured in the hundreds of billions.

We even see where, as Toomin describes in this chapter, he "hid himself in the heat". Absolutely gorgeous foreshadowing, five years in the making.

There's something poetic about the fact that as the Animorphs waltzed in Crayak and the Ellimist's game, so too did Crayak and the Ellimist waltz in Toomin's last-ditch strategy. And now three layers have collapsed into one: there is nobody manipulating Crayak's game any longer, and the Animorphs have been lifted up to fight him on the closest they'll get to even ground. I can't quite think how to be effusive enough in my praise, but few stories I've read have ever impressed me quite so thoroughly.
