Ok I fully admit I was one of those people who were getting real bothered by the lack of agency that the main characters were experiencing. As the story progressed it moved from:

- 'Save your home town from an alien invasion'

to

- 'Save the world from an alien invasion'

and then with added sidequests

- 'Try to save more than just humanity'
- 'Get yanked around by one or both gods (repeatable)'

and the latter sidequest eventually kind of swallowed up everything else like V3 spreading throughout the galaxy. There's a few writers out there who get so caught up in their own clever ideas that they absolutely botch the conclusion of a story. I wasn't sure if this story was going to run into the same problem.

Well.

I'm blown away by this chapter, truly. As many others have pointed out, this was hinted and foreshadowed at, and it doesn't feel like a complete wtf development. I mean, I'm wtfing, but how we got here makes sense. I'm reminded of this snippet from Chapter 36:

#+begin_quote
  “If you were seeking to destroy all life on Earth, you might first create an industrial society of intelligent beings capable of doing the job thoroughly, rather than risking a quicker, more haphazard solution,” the creature said. *“Such a plan might look eerily similar to, say, a plan for human ascension---right up until the critical moment. You wouldn't ordinarily expect two plans with opposite outcomes to strongly resemble one another [...]"*
#+end_quote

We have reached the critical moment.

Finally, my goodness. What a nod to canon. Rachel is about to matter - a LOT.
