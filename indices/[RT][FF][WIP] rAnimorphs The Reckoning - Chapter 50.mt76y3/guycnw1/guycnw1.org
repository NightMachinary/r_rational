  It called itself Father. I never fully understood where it had come from, who or what had built it. It had crash-landed---was broken, or incomplete---seemed to be less than half of itself, with no memory of its beginnings. But it was powerful enough. A mad god, a half-conscious wreck of a machine following the incoherent exhortations of a piecemeal program. It drew us in, as it had drawn in thousands of other ships over the centuries---ensnared us, absorbed us, buried us in its twisted simulations, playing us off against its millions of other victims.

Hello there, discarded half of Crayak's progenitor. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/m57xps/rtffwip_ranimorphs_the_reckoning_chapter_47/grakpbo/][I totally called it!]]

Anyway, this chapter answers so many questions and in a really satisfying way. I'd often wondered why the Ellimist seemed so /different/ in this story compared to his canon version. Of course plenty of other characters are different too, but usually those differences are in the service of creating /enhanced/ versions of the originals. V3 is a lot like his canon self but way more competent, the Animorphs are like their canon selves but also more competent (and more outgunned to match), and so on. Almost every character and species feels like a more fleshed out and/or more fully realized version of their canon selves.

But the Ellimist? He never really seemed like an enhanced version of /Toomin/ to me. His actions and behaviors and beliefs never felt like they were what happens when you start with the canon Ellimist and then take him to the next level. A lot of the time he seemed more like Different Crayak rather than being a more fully realized version of the things that defined the original character.

And now with this chapter, that odd note of confusion is finally resolved. The version of the Ellimist we see here, the /real/ Ellimist, is everything that an elevated version of Toomin should be. Fucking bravo.

P.S. was the communication via stitched-together memories thing inspired by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLrhQspf9Dw][this scene from Star Trek Voyager]] at all? That was the first thing I thought of when I saw what was happening in the chapter here
