I think Crayak never knew what happened to the cast-off portion of itself. But even if it did find out eventually, I don't think that knowledge really matters either. What mattered for Crayak is that it came across another superintelligence that was in the way of its goals, and it decided to take up the offer of the game as a better way of winning their conflict vs open war. How the enemy intelligence came to be is largely irrelevant to that conflict.
