That was a nod to canon, in which Jake experienced visions of Crayak when a Yeerk controlling him starved to death. I translated it to the morph-control-Yeerkish-interface dying, causing the same visions.

Crayak didn't know that Ellimist inherited its cast-off chunk.

Note that Ax/Helium experienced visions from Ellimist's point of view.
