Author's headcanon:

- Crayak got Cassie to the point of self-sacrifice
- Ellimist allowed it/didn't block it as a way to preserve Cassie's moral objection
- Ellimist brought Cassie back to prevent xenocide, leaving "emigrate from the system and start fresh with collaborative Yeerks" as their obvious alternative
- Crayak set up Tobias and the Chee as a surprise third option
