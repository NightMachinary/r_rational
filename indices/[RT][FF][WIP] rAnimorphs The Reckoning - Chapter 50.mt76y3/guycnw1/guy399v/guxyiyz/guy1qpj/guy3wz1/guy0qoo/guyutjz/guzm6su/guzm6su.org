  Any ideas what Crayak's most recent game moves were? Can anyone think of recent pre-ascension heavily godly stuff that happened? Cassie was presumably an Ellimist move, the Howlers would not have required lots of direction to reach Earth, was there anything else?

The intended interpretation is, when Marco and Tobias are all, like, "where the hell did this key thing come from?" that Crayak has been pulling strings behind the scenes to get resources to the Chee/prep them to reach out to Tobias.
