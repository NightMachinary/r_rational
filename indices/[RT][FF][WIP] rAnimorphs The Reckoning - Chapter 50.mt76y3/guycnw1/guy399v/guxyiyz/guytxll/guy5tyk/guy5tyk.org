It's like, a summary of the /Ellimist Chronicals/, but if the author treated the K2 superintelligence like a K2 Superintelligence. And Crayak is simultaneously more concerning for his portrayal, not as slightly greater than the Ellimist, not as expelled by a K3 entity, but as the tendril of a K3 tiling agent intent on consuming the universe. ... And yet, somewhat less, because it feels like the Animorphs somehow have a chance against a physical god that scared another physical god into preemptively sacrificing itself for the faintest hope of victory.

And while the use of Rachel's memories to communicate is interesting as a tool by itself, there's also the little part where it covers so many fragments from her life as to reconstruct anything about her character that might have gotten discombobulated or forgotten along the way. It reminds us (and her) who she is, in a way that her thoughts on it post-message make clear were intentional. (And I am a sucker for both Tumin and Rachel's comments / thoughts on preservation / restoration and change, I guess.)

It's like, basically nothing actually /happened/, but it was so needed and helpful and satisfying and structurally precious that this is more welcome than acceptable.

...

Do it again? <3
