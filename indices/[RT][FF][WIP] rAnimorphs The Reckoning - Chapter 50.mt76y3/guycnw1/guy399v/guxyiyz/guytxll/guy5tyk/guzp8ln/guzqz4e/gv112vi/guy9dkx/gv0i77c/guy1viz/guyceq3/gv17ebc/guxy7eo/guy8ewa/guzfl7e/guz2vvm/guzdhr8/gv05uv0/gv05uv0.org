The Arbiter is one of the hypercomputer's functions. Probably its main function. Ellimist proposed it and Crayak agreed to the idea. They built it together, doing everything out in the open and leaving no room for deception in its design or implementation. And in building it they subjected themselves to it so fully that they could no longer act independently from its rules.
