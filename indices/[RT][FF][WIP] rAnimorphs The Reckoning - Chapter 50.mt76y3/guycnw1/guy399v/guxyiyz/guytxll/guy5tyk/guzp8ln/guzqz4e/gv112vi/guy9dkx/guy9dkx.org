Man, maybe it's the residual alcohol in me from hours of day drinking earlier, but I'm just straight-up stunned by this update. I don't even know what to think. Rachel is kinda becoming the new Ellimist?! That's /cool/. Does she get to ascend? Are the final chapters going to take place over, like, hundreds of trillions of years? Are the god!Animorphs going to use the "there-is-nothing-that-cannot-be-unbroken" logic to bring back Ventura and all the people that got Howlered? I doubt it, since Toomin made it sound like it's pretty much just normal Rachel playing against Crayak now, with no intelligence or longevity bonuses or whatever.

More realistically, it sounds like Rachel had a pet named Appa that got hit by a car. Fresh lore! Good taste in TV, too.

Does anyone know how Toomin started going by "Ellimist?" In canon, Ellimist is basically just his gamertag, which he made up to sound breezy - maybe it's the same here, but I don't think I saw it in the chapter.

I was starting to get worried that the fic was going to end with some kind of super cheesy crossover with canon, but that possibility seems to have just dropped off significantly, so my breathing is back to normal. Now it looks more like Toomin tried to set things up in such a way that (something close to) the events from canon would happen, but something happened he didn't account for and the trajectory changed a little. The Escafil device didn't get invented, but the Iscafil device did; Tobias didn't get trapped, Rachel didn't start to date him... lots of other stuff too.

Interestingly, Toomin refers to Elena and not Eva, so whatever sequence of events he predicted couldn't have been the LITERAL canon book series. (Not that we couldn't have just assumed that. What kind of insane god would purposefully bring about a universe including Nartec?)

I'm wondering if he set up some kind of seizure or something for Elfangor and V1/Elena that was supposed to just-so-happen to arrange their neurons a certain way - like, for example, Elfangor's brain was supposed to end up exactly the same, but with the addition of the prophecy about the Animorphs. But the version of Elfangor's brain that Toomin prepped to paste in included a bunch of stuff from the state of the universe Toomin expected but which didn't come to pass, and that's why Elfangor has wrong memories. Same with Elena. Perhaps this also means the Time Lattice never existed.

Anyway. Love love love it. Can't wait for more.
