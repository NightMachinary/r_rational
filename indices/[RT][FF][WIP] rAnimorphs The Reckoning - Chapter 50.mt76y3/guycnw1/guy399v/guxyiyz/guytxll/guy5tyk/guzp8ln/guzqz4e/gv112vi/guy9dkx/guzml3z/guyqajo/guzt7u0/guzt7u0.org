It all makes sense now!!! See, because a Ketran goes on to become God, and the Nartec are basically narrative Satan. I've connected the dots.

Or maybe the actual hidden lore is that KA Applegate's mousepad said "trance" on it or something. Apparently all the alien words she didn't steal from LotR or Star Trek were just the result of her casting around for the nearest object and rearranging the letters in its name. For example, the Andalite word /nothlit/ comes from KAA looking out the window and seeing a Hilton hotel.
