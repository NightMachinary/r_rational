  I must be clear, lest you misunderstand me, and develop false hope:

  This is not a plan.

  This is not a prophecy.

  There is no preordained path to victory.

  I will tell you this much, at least---based not on calculation, but on intuition, speaking as one with a frankly absurd body of experience: your chances do not feel terrible, or remote. I do not believe they are good, but they are more in the realm of one in three or one in thirty or one in three hundred, than in the realm of one in three trillion. For you have prepared---all of you---and even Crayak is capable of mistakes.
