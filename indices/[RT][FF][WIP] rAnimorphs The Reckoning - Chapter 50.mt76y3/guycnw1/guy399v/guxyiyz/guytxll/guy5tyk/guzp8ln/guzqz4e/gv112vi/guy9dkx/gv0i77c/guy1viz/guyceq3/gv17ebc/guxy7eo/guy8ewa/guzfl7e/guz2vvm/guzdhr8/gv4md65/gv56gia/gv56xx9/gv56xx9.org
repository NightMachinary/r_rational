I selfishly /also/ want an Andalite Chronicles analogue detailing the time shenanigans and fleshing out Elfangor's character. There are some neat perspectives in side characters there, too, like Elfangor's comrade (whose name I forget) who ends up as a Taxxon nothlit.

I guess I just see the finish line coming and don't want it to end.
