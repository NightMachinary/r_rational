Bridge and bubble were collaborative; V3 was being manipulated as part of the "main plot" that both Crayak and Ellimist agreed on in their negotiations. Like, "we gotta get this guy into this system, and isolate this system," and so forth.

Crayak and Ellimist were also both on board with the bridge, as a way to bring the Howlers in.

V3 discovering it ... I tend to think that Crayak wanted it and Ellimist was like, eh, doesn't really hurt anything in-system.
