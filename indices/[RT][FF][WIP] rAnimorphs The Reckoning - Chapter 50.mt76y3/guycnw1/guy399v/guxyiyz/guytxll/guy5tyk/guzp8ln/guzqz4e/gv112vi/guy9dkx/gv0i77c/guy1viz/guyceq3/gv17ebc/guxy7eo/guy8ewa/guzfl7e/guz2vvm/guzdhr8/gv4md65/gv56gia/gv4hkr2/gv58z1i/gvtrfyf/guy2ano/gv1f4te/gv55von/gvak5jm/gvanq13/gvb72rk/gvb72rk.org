I really like the idea of recombining Crayak and Father to correct Crayak's alignment. Father's whole "study people to learn friendliness" schtic succeeded in that Toomin just installed his values, effectively repairing the missing part.

I don't think it will work, though. It feels narratively weird, but there's also the question of Crayak's value drift, and also what happened to V3. It would be interesting if the Animorphs think of this, only to discover that Crayak absorbed V3 into the slots Father came from. I'm not sure what a V3 / Crayak values merger would look like, but V3 has spent a lot of time worrying about values drift and personality change, etc, and has also been shown being skillful at negotiating with entities whose values you'd expect to oppose his goals.

If V3 remains relevant, then Jake's section of taking a lot of interest in Alloran is probably important. I mean, that could have been Alloran's /Worm/ interlude, since he merged with V3 during that very chapter, but the way it was written makes it seem like it's important. Like, this is Jake's Black Boxâ„¢ picking up on something he can use later, while V3 was simultaneously concerned about the Alloran-Esplin merger. It seems possible that this is going to be crucial in some way, because Crayak on its own might be willing to accept the change from reuniting with his "determine friendliness" half, but V3 would refuse, and if V3 is still a major player, I see there being no victory without solving him.

But Alloran's main power throughout the book has not been his tactical genius. It's been his ability to confuse the brain parasite that has root access to his mind. Esplin can't tell what Alloran's been up to ever since he went quiet, and then they merged, and it's even more confusing. And Alloran can only be relevant in a narratively satisfying way if he's been made available to the protagonists ... which he was in one of Jake's most recent chapters. And another Jake chapter is coming up.
