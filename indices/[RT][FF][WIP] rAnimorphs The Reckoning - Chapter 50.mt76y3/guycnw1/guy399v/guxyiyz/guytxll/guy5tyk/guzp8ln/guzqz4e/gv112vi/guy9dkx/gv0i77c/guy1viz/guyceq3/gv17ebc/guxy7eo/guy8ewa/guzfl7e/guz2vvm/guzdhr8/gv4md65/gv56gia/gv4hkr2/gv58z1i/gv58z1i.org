No theorizing from me here.

I found this story about...3, 4 years ago? I got maybe 20 chapters/interludes in before I got distracted with other things.

Started reading it again a couple months ago, mostly during half hour lunch breaks at work. I finally, /finally/ caught up today, and I'm really happy to be here before the big finale.

Fantastic work of fiction, TK17. It's on the level of Dune, I think. Possibly the greatest fan fiction ever made? Then again I don't read fanfiction. But this is /good/.
