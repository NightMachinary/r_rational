/I began to build a better network---to surveil my kingdom, rather than trusting its safety to chance.  And more---as my creations matured, I began to fear the possibility of others like me.  Father had been my own beginning, yet I still had not discovered its origin.  And what if Father had been malevolent, instead of merely malign?  Proactive, rather than passive?/

/I was behind, I realized---should have begun ages earlier, might at any point have accidentally sowed the seeds of my own destruction, or been taken unawares just as I had been---as we all had been---on Ketran./

I wonder if history will remember Toomin's tragedy as his inability to trust other beings despite claiming harmony between them as his ultimate goal. Cooperation for thee, but not for me. Perhaps he could have arranged things so Crayak would be opposed by a pantheon of gods instead of one going it alone. Or maybe, after his own death, that's what he did, and the ascended Animorphs might see their force multiplied instead of divided.
