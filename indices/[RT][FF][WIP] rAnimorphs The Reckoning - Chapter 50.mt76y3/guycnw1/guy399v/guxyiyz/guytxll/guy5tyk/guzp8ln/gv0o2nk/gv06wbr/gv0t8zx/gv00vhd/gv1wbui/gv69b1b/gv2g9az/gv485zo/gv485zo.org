It's been mentioned that, unlike in canon, the pieces here are neither black or white, but grey- free to be manipulated by either player, and indeed both players interact and make use of both the Animorphs and V3. Yet there is a sense in which the Animorphs, especially Rachel, are the Ellimist's pieces, in the sense that Toomin isn't arranging for V3 to inherit his account. How accurate would it be to say that V3 is â€˜Crayak's'?
