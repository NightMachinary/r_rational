My understanding is that the Game is over, Crayak won, and the Game was just a distraction to keep Crayak from eating the universe. The Animorphs have until Crayak unplugs to use what they know about the Arbiter to defeat Crayak. Since V3 just vanished, and was promised a gift that might take time for him to get use to, I'm guessing we need at least one more chapter before we have enough information to come up with a solution.

So we either need Crayak to break the rules before he realizes they still apply, or ... Hmm. The magnitude of changes was one of the rules, wasn't it? Maybe Crayak's already screwed itself over without realizing it, because Rachel inherited the Ellimist account... but I doubt it. That'd be both convenient and would deagent the characters.

(One thing I noticed on reread, that I somehow missed in spite of it being mentioned at least 3 times, is that Erek is currently disassembled and serving as the shielding for V3's local vessel. If being disassembled means Erek wasn't eliminated when the Ellimist removed the Chee, he could plausibly be brought back into play. Though, whether that's as a robot avatar for V3, or because Rachel resurrects him for mundane firepower, I can't guess.)
