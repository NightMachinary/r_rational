That's been on my mind too. When Toomin talked about freeing all of the minds that had been consumed by Father by reconstituting them into physical bodies, the thought struck me that in trying to restore them to their former lives he was also condemning them to eventual death. And though he worked hard to spread life and bounty under his domain, he still left them subject to the natural order of entropy and decay.

And maybe the "pantheon of gods" thing is how the Animorphs can still come out on top. Toomin doesn't believe that Rachel can truly fill the void left by the Ellimist's death, but who says there has to be only one Ellimist?
