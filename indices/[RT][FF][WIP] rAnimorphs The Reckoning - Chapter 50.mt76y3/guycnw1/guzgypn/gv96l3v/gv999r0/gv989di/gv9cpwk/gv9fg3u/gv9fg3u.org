I'm not convinced it was intentional so much as a permitted glitch in the morph tech when circumstances allow for the control tissue to die, especially since none of the characters ever remember anything they see in those fever dreams. Though I guess it could also be a subtle form of manipulation since conscious recollection isn't required for either player to nudge an agent in the direction they want.
