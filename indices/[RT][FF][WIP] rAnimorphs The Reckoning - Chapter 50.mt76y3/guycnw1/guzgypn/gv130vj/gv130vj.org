I tell you what, this point of the Ellimist being the discarded remains of Crayak really adds a nice level of poetry, though.

Whether he realises it or not, Crayak is basically at war with himself --- Both halves are utilising reality-manipulating powers in an attempt to resolve the order/unity/silence vs chaos/harmony/noise paradox that seems to be at the core of /human/ need.

We need certainty, security, comfort --- needs that Crayak was probably born from and in his current form aims to protect. Without these, we live in fear, or never truly live at all.

So we paradoxically /also/ need /un/certainty, variety, challenge --- The very things Toomin/Ellimist has based his existence on. This is what brings us happiness in the end, and why risk vs reward is a thing.

So Ellimist vs Crayak is really one being trying to resolve two seemingly incompatible world views, just as we all are individually.
