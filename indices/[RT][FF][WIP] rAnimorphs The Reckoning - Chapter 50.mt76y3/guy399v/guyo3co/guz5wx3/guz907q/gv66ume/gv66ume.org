I agree that the lack of known win conditions is interfering with the feeling of "final battle time". I don't know what the Animorphs need to do to get to not-Crayak. Presumably they can make him violate the rules or win the game, but I don't know what the latter looks like.

And that could totally work if I knew they didn't know, or if I knew they knew and I had a hint. Not knowing whether they know is interfering though.
