Aiui,

- Crayak's goal is to tile the universe in habitats for its (long dead) creators.
- Toomin's goal is to make the universe happy / free / safe / generally better for sapients.
- Their order vs chaos motivations, as described by the Avatar, suggest that the Game is meant to generalize a competition between those goals, going more abstract, with the ultimate goal being to determine whose imprint is left on the cosmos.
- Win conditions for the Game remain unclear. Some lines in this chapter suggest that baiting the other player into breaking a rule, or sacrificing their values, was always treated as a win condition.
- The way I understand the Chee is as Toomin's gambit, creating something that the Ellimist would want to protect (the legacy of the Pemalites), but would be unwilling to allow to ascend because of the threat they pose at full power. Crayak is in agreement that they would be a threat, but believes that Ellimist can be convinced to sacrifice himself to stop them should they be unlocked, so sets up the plot to have them unlocked. This was Toomin's plan all along, so that Crayak could win the Game on Toomin's terms, leaving an opening for his Rachel gambit.

Iow, Crayak is a paperclip maximizing UFA, the Game was a trap to lure Crayak into a moment of vulnerability, and the Chee rising was Crayak thinking it had set a trap for Ellimist, but Toomin had always planned for Ellimist to lose the Game so Rachel would have a brief opportunity to damage Crayak for real.
