Side note: Back in Chapter 34...

#+begin_quote
  Centuries adrift, in the cold and the dark, my eye fixed upon the distant light of the nearest star, my first and final hope. Centuries of silent vigil, alert for any disaster, my fear throttled by ruthless caution. Once, a rock drifted past, its gravity tugging me ever so gently off course, and in the moments that followed I had no choice but to carve myself in two, sending half of my soul tumbling into the abyss to nudge the remainder back on track. I didn't know---couldn't know---what had been lost in that instant, how much of myself I had forgotten.

At first I thought this was Crayak, but is this actually a memory of Father? After all:

#+begin_quote
  It called itself Father. I never fully understood where it had come from, who or what had built it. It had crash-landed---was broken, or incomplete---seemed to be less than half of itself, with no memory of its beginnings. But it was powerful enough. A mad god, a half-conscious wreck of a machine following the incoherent exhortations of a piecemeal program. It drew us in, as it had drawn in thousands of other ships over the centuries---ensnared us, absorbed us, buried us in its twisted simulations, playing us off against its millions of other victims.

But then again, the remainder of the sequence in Ch. 34 seems to describe Crayak dyson-ing that same star, using it as fuel to overtake the galaxy.

And on a related note:

#+begin_quote
  An ephemeral web of light, stretched across the infinite black, every line taut and graceful and still, and then---

  ---no---

  ---a twitch, a tug, as of something pulling, something crawling, something from beyond the deepest, farthest shadows---

  ---NO---

  ---a nightmare, an unimaginable horror, clawing its way inward, unseen, the web trembling from its weight, warping, twisting, tearing---
#+end_quote

I didn't understand what this was at first, but in the context of this chapter, it seems to indicate the Ellimist's surveillance system throughout the universe, and the moment when it first detected the threat of Crayak. Very cool.
