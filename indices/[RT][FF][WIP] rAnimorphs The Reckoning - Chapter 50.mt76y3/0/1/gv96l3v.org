  It called itself Father. I never fully understood where it had come from, who or what had built it. It had crash-landed---was broken, or incomplete---seemed to be less than half of itself, with no memory of its beginnings. But it was powerful enough. A mad god, a half-conscious wreck of a machine following the incoherent exhortations of a piecemeal program. It drew us in, as it had drawn in thousands of other ships over the centuries---ensnared us, absorbed us, buried us in its twisted simulations, playing us off against its millions of other victims.

If Father had no memory of its origins, the Ellimist wouldn't have either. This leads us to conclude that Crayak must have been the one to give Jake a morph vision of Father's creation. But if Crayak knew that the Ellimist inherited the mantle of Father, that would seem to throw a giant wrench in the Ellimist's plans, right?
