It is a really neat idea, but I have to ask. How did it actually get far enough away from Crayak that Urllimist and Crayak ascended in different galaxies. The way the scene is described it sound like it was the fragment was pushed away STL, but crossing to another galaxy before Crayak ascends seems unlikely.

Or maybe Crayak abandoned the Galaxy after he recovered from what he had fled?
