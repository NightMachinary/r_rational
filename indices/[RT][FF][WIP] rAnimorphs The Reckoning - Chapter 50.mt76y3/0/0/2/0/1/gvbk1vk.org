That, and how did Father end up on a planet with a power source and have time to ensnare millions of people before Crayak went looking for its missing half? I think it must have been picked up by an FTL ship and driven to the watery planet, and nascent Crayak must have been extremely slow and careful with that first star. Maybe since there was "no margin for error" the titan that became both gods decided to cast off almost all of its risk tolerance?
