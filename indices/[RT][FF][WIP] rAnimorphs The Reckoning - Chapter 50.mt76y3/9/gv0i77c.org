I guess one open question: why did the Ellimist reveal the avatar body and react physically in front of an audience? Wouldn't a super-intelligence react far more quickly, on the scale of microseconds? And why did it need to commander Tobias's ship? I get that it's good writing and fun to see it unfold, but it seems very theatrical.
