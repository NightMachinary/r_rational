This is another place where Crayak was profligately spending down its accrued initiative.

The intended interpretation (signaled both by the fact that the Ellimist acted through the avatar at all, and by the fact that its appearance was substantially less graceful than under other circumstances) is that Crayak was holding the Ellimist back---blinding it, and then restraining it, until ultimately it had no other choice but to manifest via the extremely slow and clunky tool of the avatar body.

Hence its confusion, then epiphany, then sudden takeover.
