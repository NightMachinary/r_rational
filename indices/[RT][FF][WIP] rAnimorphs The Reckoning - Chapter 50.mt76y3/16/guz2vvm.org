This chapter pretty neatly ties up the confusion over which player made which moves in a bit too un-parsimonious way (parsimony is overrated when hyper-intelligences are at work). One interesting thing... I think this suggests that the vision that got passed to Visser 3 that encouraged that the Chee get unchained is actually a move of original-Ellimist, sabotaging their successor self and letting Crayak get closer to victory to setup the trap.
