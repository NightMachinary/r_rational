This is why i prefer to not give critique about a story until it ends. This chapter singlehandedly removed all remaining doubts i had with the story. All of my lagging issues with the lack of agency is more than repaid with the situation that the Animorphs find themselves in.

Also, i'm a sucker for complicated plans succeeding.
