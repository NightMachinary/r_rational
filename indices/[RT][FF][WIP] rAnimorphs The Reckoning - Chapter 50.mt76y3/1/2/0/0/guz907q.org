That's the thing, it's really hard to feel like anything's at stake when we don't still don't know the win conditions of the game. Because when anything happens, who benefits? Who loses out? If the Visser dies, is it a good thing because that's the Ellimist win condition, or is it a bad thing because it's the Crayak win condition, and the Ellimist win condition is peaceful coexistence with the Visser or somehow bringing him back to the light side?

Do we even care if Crayak wins or Ellimist wins? Because right now the only source that suggests an Ellimist victory is good is...the Ellimist, and he could easily lie.
