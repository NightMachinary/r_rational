I mean, all signs point toward Crayak's next move being to resume converting the galaxy to +paperclips+ terraria, starting with the Earth. But sure, the Ellimist could have lied about that.

But the thing that makes the stakes seem sufficient to me is, not the Game itself, but that it's over, and a megastructure just appeared out of nowhere, and where we had two gods, we now have one, who is apparently no longer bound by any restrictions. We no longer have a chessmaster god occasionally interfering with the plot; we have a final boss who the Animorphs should have no chance against.

Also, rereading, the Avatar mentioned once that the obstacle represented by the Vissor's ambition is the Game. That's phrased rather confusingly, but combined with what Player2 told the Vissor, and the circumstances of his disappearance, I'm not sure if Crayak took him out of play, or if it, like, raptured and assimilated him. In canon, when Crayak was tempting Rachel, he summoned the Vissor to test her powers against. Since Rachel just got powers courtesy the Ellimist, and the Vissor has been the big bad so far, I could see a merger of Crayak and the Vissor being the Final Form of the antagonist, or something in that category.
