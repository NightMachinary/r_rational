That was really good.

Really really really good.

An explanation for what the heck happened last chapter, an explanation for why the Chee couldn't see Rachel properly, an explanation for why Rachel came back wrong, an explanation for how both gods ended up playing a game they believed they would win.

And even more than that! The game between Crayak and the Ellimist might have ended last chapter, but it isn't over! Our heroes now have ~3 chapters to find a way to deal with Crayak, once and for all, with all of the Ellimist's resources but none of his planning ability and none of his protection. Their /only/ advantage being that Crayak doesn't know they exist and that he is still bound by the rules of the game.

...come to think of it, are the Animorphs bound by the game? Is only Rachel bound by it? The Ellimist transferred control of his account to her which suggests that she might only be able to make game-constrained moves. Huh. That changes things, I feel like. If the Ellimist with all his power and planning ability had no chance at all of defeating Crayak in 8 hours, what types of actions can the Animorphs even take that would do anything? Kicking Crayak out of our solar system isn't a solution even if it can be done and I have no idea how they'd even /start/ trying to kick him out of the galaxy or destroying him entirely.

I will be sitting on the edge of my seat for the next two weeks, as I have been for the previous two and the two before that and etc!

EDIT: Oh also! The disaster that befell Tobias and his subsequent relationship with Rachel??? This fits with canon where he became stuck in morph but there is no /way/ the Ellimist didn't know how morphing works differently in this universe. But the message also contained nothing about the timeline nonsense! Was that entirely Crayak? Was it just not important enough for the Ellimist to mention? Was it genuinely inconceivable to early Ellimist for some reason? Who knows! But now I at least know a possible starting point for the Animorphs' attempt to beat Crayak...

EDIT 2: Hmm. Rereading the Ellimist says Crayak used up lots of resources enabling the Chee to begin to ascend, forcing the successor-Ellimist to do all of the work preventing that ascension and thus being left open for a strike. Do we know /how/ Crayak used these resources? Even if Crayak is player 2, a message delivered to a random Andalite decades before it is relevant is a standard example of the types of subtle moves the players use. Any ideas what Crayak's most recent game moves were? Can anyone think of recent pre-ascension heavily godly stuff that happened? Cassie was presumably an Ellimist move, the Howlers would not have required lots of direction to reach Earth, was there anything else?
