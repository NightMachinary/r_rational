  the disaster that befell Tobias and his subsequent relationship with Rachel

I interpreted this bit to mean that the Ellimist predicted wrong: there was supposed to be a disaster and relationship, but actually it didn't happen, perhaps because Crayak or successor-Ellimist acted in an unforeseen way.

It is good that there is no predicted path to victory because, if the Ellimist was somehow relying on it, they would be doomed.
