  I don't understand how Marco and Magellan at least aren't asking all those questions after the Leeran mind meld. They seem all very determined instead of confused, but I have no idea why.

(Weakly) implied, but definitely true, and will be confirmed by retrospectives over the coming chapters: the mind-meld wasn't JUST them catching up on Rachel's memories; they also "debated" strategy inside the Leeran, and had disagreements, and made plans, and came to consensus on those plans. You'll see bits of that right from the start of the next chapter.
