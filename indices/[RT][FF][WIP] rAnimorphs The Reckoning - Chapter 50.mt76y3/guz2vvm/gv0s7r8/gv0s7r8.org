Nah, that was Crayak doing a sneaky and arranging for V3 to agree to the Chee's unlocking, which is something he wouldn't have done otherwise. Or at least that seems far more likely to me.

We know that Crayak was pulling strings to get the Chee unlocked and thereby force the Ellimist into checkmate, and I can't imagine how Toomin could have taken control of the avatar on multiple occasions without either player noticing. And given the incredibly subtle tools that he had to work with, time constraints, and his need to stay under the radar from both active players, I would also be surprised if he managed to repeatedly manifest his own independent copy of the avatar without gathering notice either.

But on the other hand, it's also unclear what Crayak's uses of the avatar look like from the Ellimist's perspective. We don't know if the use went undetected entirely, or if E knows it happened but wasn't able to figure out what the endgame of those manifestations was. After all, C went through great pains to make both the message and its delivery as seemingly disconnected from the critical moment as possible. And while E probably spent time and resources looking into the matter, there's only so much that can be spent without consequently leaving other parts of the gameboard neglected and vulnerable.
