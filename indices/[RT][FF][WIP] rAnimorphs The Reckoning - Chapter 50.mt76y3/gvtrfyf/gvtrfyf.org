Damn. The ways this story echos the canon continues to be my favorite part of it. Here rachel and toomin share their first and last true conversation, as or right after one of them falls.

Other thought: this chapter reminded me a lot of the crystal society trilogy, in particular the focus on first-mover advantage. The battle necessarily begins before first contact, and with super intelligences like these, it would seem the battle necessarily ends (is decided) before first contact.

I felt really sorry for toomin. The existential horror of seeing the unstoppable beast approach, the repeated death-of-self, the instinct to desperately fling his children away to safety. I wonder if I'd feel differently about him without the canon story to back this up, but I think his characterization was nailed without feeling repetitive.

Also holy shit I just realized father killed toomin's body, and crayak cost him his mind, so both times he was “destroyed” by that initial entity's subroutines/parts. The poetry of it is rly hitting me
