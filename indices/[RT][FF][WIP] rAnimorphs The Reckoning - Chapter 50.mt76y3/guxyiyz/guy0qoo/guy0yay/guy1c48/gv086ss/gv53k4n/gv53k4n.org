The universe might be such that something entirely not happening (or happening when predicted not to) might not mean that some /other/ plan won't work.

I'll find a quote...

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  /The complexity was almost unmanageable, even for me, but it is a fortunate truth about the universe that not/ every /event has consequence. Every speck of matter influences every other speck, but time is like a river---sometimes broadening to wash out across a wide plain, other times narrowing to a whitewater choke-point. Not every detail need be mapped out in advance---things could be allowed to wander and meander between crises, so long as those crises were carefully designed to impart precise momentum to the relevant pieces, sending all of them onward to the next funnel, and the next, and the next./
