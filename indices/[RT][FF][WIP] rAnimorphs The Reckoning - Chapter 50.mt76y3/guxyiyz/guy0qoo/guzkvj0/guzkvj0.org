I think the letter to Rachel leaves some important details out like: Is the game setting, the real Milky Way or just a simulation of it? If just a simulation, do the NPCs even get a win condition or does the simulation terminate with either outcome? How does Team Crayak win? How does team Ellimist win? What's it to... the Animorphs/V3/the Yeerk/the +Protoss+ Andalites? Why should you the Animorphs care about this conflict, at all? Why should you trust the player with "different word for murder" in his name over the one which just has creatively misspelled "crazy" in his name?

I don't understand how Marco and Magellan at least aren't asking all those questions after the Leeran mind meld. They seem all very determined instead of confused, but I have no idea why.

The Ellimist went all "Please win my stupid wargame for me" without giving a compelling reason as to why one should agree to that.
