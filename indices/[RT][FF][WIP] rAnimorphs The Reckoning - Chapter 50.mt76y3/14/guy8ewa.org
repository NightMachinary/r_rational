State of the narrative recap:

Questions answered in this chapter:

What was going on with Rachel? How and why is she special, and why has she been out of commission for the last 12 chapters?

What are the Ellimist & Crayak exactly, and what do they want?

What happened last chapter? Did Crayak win? (Yes, but actually, no)

Questions still unanswered:

Something fucky is going on with the timeline. What's the deal with Marco's mom, Elfangor and Tobias, and other references to the canon versions of events? (Notably, canon is much softer on the sci-fi hardness scale, meaning a satisfactory explanation has that much more ground to explain.)

Questions introduced in this chapter: What are a group of kids going to do with Toomin's power before Crayak notices he hasn't won?

Questions I am despairing will be answered at all: What the hell is a Leeran anyway? Why are they not mentioned in the mind meld? Leeran controllers/morphs are mentioned, so presumably they have some sort of brain and consciousness, but where did it go? That one froggy dude must have seen a lot since being kidnapped by the Visser...

Questions I really super duper hope will be answered with no:

Is that the end of V3? That arc does not deserve to end in â€˜poofed away as part of tidying up the toys after playtime'. I know he'd rather die than live with a blade at his throat, but you can't just give a speech about pulling gods into fishbowls to drown them and then die without so much as a parting line.
