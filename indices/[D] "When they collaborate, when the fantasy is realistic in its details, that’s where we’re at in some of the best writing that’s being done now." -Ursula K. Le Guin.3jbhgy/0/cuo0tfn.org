Speaking only for myself, I think I have a slightly different view of copyright because probably something like 90% of the stuff I read nowadays is fanfiction. So in that sense, a work isn't just there for its own sake but also forms a basis where I plausibly read more stuff in that setting from people writing outside of copyright than the original author's. So I can't help but see copyright as a risk to my authors instead of a support.

Also when she talked about the way that awards are the deciding factor for bookstore shelf placement, I sort of went "... and how is that the awards' fault again?" To go "and thus, the equitable distribution of awards must be in the interests of all" seems to be putting the cart before the horse somewhat; surely the fault here lies with the bookstores and their simplistic selection of material. But to be fair, I haven't bought a book at a bookstore for half a decade or so.
