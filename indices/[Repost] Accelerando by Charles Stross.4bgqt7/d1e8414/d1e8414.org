Couldn't finish it. Thought I would enjoy it a lot with how popular it is around here but the lack of rationality of the characters and the world just annoyed me too much. Like all the super extra processing power and upgrading and stuff yet everyone/everything seems just as dumb as normal. Sadly all the cool stuff would probably have been enough for me to enjoy it if I had read this long ago, wish I had read it then.
