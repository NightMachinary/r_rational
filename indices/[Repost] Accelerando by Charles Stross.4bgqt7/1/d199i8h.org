Great book, nowadays a tiny bit aged but still very high on my recommendation list. What most resonated with me is first quarter of the book, with the extremely high concept-density stross so liberally uses sometimes.

Also of note, Stross is on reddit as / u / cstross and frequently comments in [[/r/printsf]].
