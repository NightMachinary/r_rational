Quick recommendation time: if you're looking for social advice and dating advice, but pickup artists websites creep you out with their dehumanizing approach to relationships and their ethical outlook, you should checkout the youtube channel [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q][Charisma on Command]].

It's slightly creepy, and I really don't dig the Game of Thrones analyses (because taking examples from fiction is giving your points 'empty' weight), but otherwise I think he comes from a good place, and I found myself agreeing with a lot of what he said. He's advocating enlightened self-interest over lying and negging, taking time for yourself instead of sinking everything into your significant other, etc.

Disclaimer: I only have seen a few of his videos, so I don't have a representative sample of what his channel his about. But it looks good so far.
