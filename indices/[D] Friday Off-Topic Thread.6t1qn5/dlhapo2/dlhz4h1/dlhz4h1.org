[[/u/ketura]], because I've seen you mention it in the past: did you ever get to play the Pokemon Prism romhack? I know that some people over on [[/r/pokemonprism]] have been circulating copies, and that a new team of devs has picked it up. It would be a shame if you haven't taken a look at it, even if it isn't exactly rational.
