Well. They're mostly 18-20yo kids. I mean, they're legal adults, but most of them haven't had the opportunity to really examine things and, if they did, would be left out in the cold if they said anything. Just a few months ago some 18yo was abandoned by his family at a camping site after he admitted to having doubts; and there's an "Underground Handcart Company" whose volunteers try to arrange housing for people whose families cut them off.

Missionaries can be assholes, but anyone who's mean to them from the get-go, confusing these kids with the org that they represent, is not great stuff either.

(Also, missionaries can do some fine good work. There's stuff I did that I'm not proud of, what with convincing many people to take leaps of faith for an org that doesn't deserve it, but I also helped struggling families, oversaw addiction recovery, etc.)

Having been a missionary, my preferred approach would be to let them know that the door is open, that I'm willing to give them some lemonade and a break from the hot sun (or whatever the SF variant would be), and that we can talk but they shouldn't expect a miracle out of me.

I'd love to give a few things for them to think about, but attempting a full deconversion in a limited time frame is too much to hope for, especially because going home early is one of the worst things that could happen to a young adult in the Church.

As a missionary, I often had to be content just with the knowledge that I was planting seeds that might be harvested later. I can think of no better-fitting tribute to my mission than to exercise that same patience once again.

Hell, for some of them, what they really need anyway is not a strong attempt at deconversion but a demonstration that "exmos" can be nice people.
