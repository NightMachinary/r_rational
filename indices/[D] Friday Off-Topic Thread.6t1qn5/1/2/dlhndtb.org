"Brother G" kinda looked like it sounded like "brotheurgh", honestly. So yay!

Also I think in my head "Mormons" are grouped with "Amish" as "these weird American Christian cults", and I'd be kind of hard-pressed to differentiate the two. Do Mormons often use computers?

You're an atheist because you believe that, whatever 'God' or higher entity there may be, you have no moral duty to love it, and do and think as it wills. I believe the official name for that is 'Stargate Atheist'.
