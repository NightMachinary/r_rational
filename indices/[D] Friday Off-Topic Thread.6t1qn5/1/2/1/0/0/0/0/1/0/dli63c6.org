Haha. My earliest sign was probably all the times that I thought, /By Jove, I'm not an atheist myself, but I sure do trust the reasoning abilities of atheists more than I do most religious people/ and /Obviously what I'd really prefer is reasonable, right-thinking theists, but failing that, it sure would be nice to have some more atheists on this planet./
