  I don't remember Stargate and I may be projecting depth on it that it didn't have, but I think at least the Ori arc dealt with the fact that, no matter how real and omnipotent and godlike they were, worshiping them wasn't the right thing to do.

No, no, I'm pretty sure that's correct. I read it as sort of an indictment against Islam in particular when I was watching it, but, um, that was back when I was a jingoistic neocon shitheaded teenager.

  I meant it more as 'isolationist religion'

Oh, I see. I misunderstood. Yeah, Mormonism's weird. We try to be happy and welcoming, or at least claim to be, but when you get down to it we're pretty clannish and, as soon as we get the numbers to be in the majority, we'll shut you out faster than you can blink.

"No, Tommy, you can't play with those kids down the street because their parents aren't Mormons" is a story I came across too many times to count when I served as a missionary (I worked in and around the Salt Lake Valley, Mormon Central).

We do better when we don't have enough people to shut out everybody else and make our own community, but that's not exactly a ringing endorsement, is it?

I was hoping that things were going to get better, but the leadership of the Church recently declared that children whose parents were in a same-sex relationship would not be eligible for baptism until (1) they were adults and (2) effectively denounce their parents as no-good rotten sinners. Keeping in mind that we still baptize children whose parents are unwed (which is also a sin, and for the same reason, as it's a violation of the "law of chastity"), it looks pretty clearly like a move intended to exclude people who might grow up to be future troublemakers (a recent spat of excommunications has also suggested that the Church is no longer interested in real dialogue or change and would prefer to double down rather than adapt to the changing times).
