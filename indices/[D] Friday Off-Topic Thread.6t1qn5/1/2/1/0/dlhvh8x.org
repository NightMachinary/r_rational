I meant it more as 'isolationist religion', but yeah, fair enough. (I like 'spiritually abusive' as a label, by the way)

I don't remember Stargate that well and I may be projecting depth on it that it didn't have, but I think at least the Ori arc dealt with the fact that, no matter how real and omnipotent and godlike they were, worshiping them wasn't the right thing to do.
