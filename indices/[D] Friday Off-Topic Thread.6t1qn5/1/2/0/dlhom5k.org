Mormonism is large and heterogenous, unlike the Amish. The Amish and other Anabaptist groups don't use technology out of a desire for simple living (which manifests as an oddly specific tech level that includes modern metallurgy but I digress). Mormons have no such restriction, and I don't believe even the most extreme splinter groups like the polygamists have any prohibitions on computers.
