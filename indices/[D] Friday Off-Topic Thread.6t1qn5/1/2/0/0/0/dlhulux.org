I have done very little research on this, but I heard that the Amish philosophy is much more complicated than Luddites. Rather than oppose use of specific technologies, they are actually extremely committed to self-reliance so they refuse to use technology that would make them dependent upon people outside their community. There are some communities that use solar panels and cell phones, though they may not be privately owned, because their interpretation of the taboo is reliance on the power grid.

Additionally, the Amish also have a rite of passage ritual that requires people to explore the outside world before they can be considered full members of the community. So the people living there have all experienced some degree of life with modern amenities, only to return home and continue living there when they have the option to leave. There may be serious socioeconomic costs to leaving, but the option is there and these people are /extremely/ committed to "turning the other cheek".
