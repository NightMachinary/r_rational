First off: I'm switching my username from [[/u/callmebrotherg]] to [[/u/callmesalticidae]], for silly personal reasons that I'll elaborate on in a post attached to this (so as to not get tangential).

I hope that retaining the "callmeX" formula will carry the idea across for people who don't read this.

In other news, my application for graduation has been reviewed and approved, and my transcript updated accordingly. I have graduated from Brigham Young University of Idaho and can say:

- I have a Bachelor's (Communication major/Advertising emphasis; Philosophy minor)
- I am not a Mormon (anymore).

It is really, really nice to be able to say that, since BYU-I was a religious school where being on the outs with the Church could mean expulsion (or even expulsion plus a fight to get your transcripts in a timely manner). I had never been fond of that aspect of the school, especially since I was already an unorthodox Mormon when I went in, but my finances weren't great and I thought that I could stomach it in return for the low tuition that I would find at BYU-I.

Now that I can say, "I am not a Mormon," though, I'm wondering what I am. I know that labels aren't important and can even be detrimental and distracting, but I like to put things in boxes and the question is an interesting one.

I believe that there is a nonzero chance that we're existing in a simulation and/or that there may one day be, or already is (somewhere else in the universe), at least one artificial intelligence whose capabilities far outreach our own. Am I, then, actually an atheist?

One could argue that I am an atheist because I don't believe that the simulation-makers or the AI (currently existing or yet to be created) have spiritual bodies or are in any other way non-physical. However, as a Mormon I believed that God had a body of flesh and bones, and that spiritual substances were just another form of matter that we could not currently detect. This would mean that Mormons are atheists, which doesn't seem sound.

One could argue that I am an atheist because I believe that a superintelligent AI would still be bound by physical laws, and therefore an AI would not count as a god, but Mormons believe the same thing: God is limited by laws that preexist God's existence and, among other things, can neither create nor destroy matter. Again, it seems weird to say that Mormons are atheists, so I'm reluctant to claim that I am an atheist on this basis.

One could argue that my willingness to deal in probabilities, saying that we might not be living in a simulation, is a good basis for claiming that I'm an atheist. However, I've been couching things more or less in those terms for a long time, so this would mean that I've been an atheist since my mid-teens and that I was an atheist even during the years that I was praying to God.

We could say that the probabilities have to be high enough for me to be willing to act on them, but the simulation argument is mostly an academic one for me, and I'm not sure how my actions would be altered by it unless we made other assumptions (e.g. the simulation might be shut off unless we're entertaining, so my life should be made as exciting as possible for its makers). "What do I do if it's possible to create a superintelligent AI" is an easier question to answer, but if this is the deciding factor then it would mean that I could say, "I am atheist" one day and the next say, "I am not an atheist" because there is now a superintelligent AI running amok.

If we're in a simulation, then the beings who made it are apparently content to not interfere with us. If there is already a superintelligent AI somewhere in the universe, then either it has not reached us or it is not interfering with us. Either way, while we might use this as a basis to claim that I'm an atheist, there already exists a term for this: deism. And yet, one would not expect Eliezer Yudkowsky to begin describing himself as a deist were he to become convinced that we are living in a simulation. Maybe he'd be incorrect to not do so, but that's part of the question that I've been pondering lately and which I now pose to you: What am I, now that I am not a Mormon?

(Also feel free to AMA about Mormonism, Brigham Young University, why I left the Church, or anything else)
