Why did you leave the Church? My experience is primarily with Catholicism, and most people seem to just drift to the periphery and on out rather than actually deconvert for ideological reasons, but in your case it seems that you were going to BYU when you left and you are on [[/r/rational]], so I'd be interested to see what your experience was.
