I never actually stopped being a spiritualist, but I can definitely relate to your experience here. The exact same beats happened with me and New Age, though it was primarily due to rationality making me realize the pseudoscience I associated with New Age was invalid so I reexamined the rest of my beliefs and realizing it was impossible to prove them to anyone who hadn't undergone my subjective experiences.

I still believe in supernatural phenomena, because I'd rather not describe my meditation experiences of astral projection or communication with spirits as hallucinations, though I've disconnected those beliefs from my morals and am a deist in practice. I eventually concluded that I had a psychological need to believe in some form of religion and attempting to live as an atheist would only contribute to my depression.

I'd be happy to discuss theology with you, though I can't claim that you'll find any of my experiences enlightening. I was brought up Catholic, but my Mom was super liberal and I /never cared/ about church or scripture so converting to New Age felt like just worshipping God the way I always had been while encouraging me to explore other religions for useful ideas.
