Unfortunately, I can't supply too many links. There's [[http://leviathan-supersystem.tumblr.com/tagged/occult][Leviathan-Supersystem]], and you'll probably be able to find a lot of the others as LSS reblogs their posts, but a while back I unfollowed a bunch of people in an attempt to spend less time on tumblr and I can't remember their names (or maybe I can, in a few cases, but those names have been changed).

(Weirdly, the only people that I'm actually in touch with at the moment, who are Occultist Communists, do not actually blog all that much about the first half of that label)

[[http://leviathan-supersystem.tumblr.com/post/125549621189/care-to-explain-your-url-and-all-the-godbuilding][This]] is probably a good jumping-off point for the rest of LSS' blog.
