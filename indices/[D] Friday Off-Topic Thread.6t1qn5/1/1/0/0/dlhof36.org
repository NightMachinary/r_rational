Thanks for answering me.

As someone for whom typing on a phone is recently a necessity, I understand your concern but it came out well.

It's interesting to see the progression from what looks like relative moderation, to literalism, and then to deconversion. I've seen that pattern before and I'm not sure why - perhaps people overcorrect for a perceived lack of personal commitment?

That hunting range sounds really egregious. Any idea how they officially justify it, if they bother?

As to your family, good luck.
