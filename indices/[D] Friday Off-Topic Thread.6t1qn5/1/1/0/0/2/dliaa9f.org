  It's interesting to see the progression from what looks like relative moderation, to literalism, and then to deconversion. I've seen that pattern before and I'm not sure why - perhaps people overcorrect for a perceived lack of personal commitment?

My Guess: Moderation becomes literalism due to in-group pressure. I've also seen it happen through a competition-like, "Who takes the bible the most seriously is the most righteous person" thing.

From there, literalism makes their belief more rigid. Convince a moderate that one of their beliefs is wrong, and you've changed that one belief. But since literalists link every one of their beliefs together, convince them that one belief is wrong can break their whole belief system.
