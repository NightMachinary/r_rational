  I wasn't even someone with millions of dollars at stake, just a rank-and-file missionary, but in retrospect I can clearly remember the ways that I would jump through hoops to avoid noticing the flaws and explain e.g. why someone wasn't being healed (and I remember the times when they thought they were doing better and would try to convince me, even though I personally wasn't sure).
