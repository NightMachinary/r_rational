Ok. I've surfaced. I've read the entire comic and I must say I loved it. Like I really, really enjoyed it. It wasn't rational fiction per se but it definitely had a futuristic, transhuman-esque bent that a lot of us here appreciate. And the romance was very well done. It felt very realistic.

I also liked the size and the pacing. It was a way to spend a few hours and you got (in comic time) six months or so of a romantic slice of life tale.

The background music was also a very nice touch, though it was jarring to hit next and have the music suddenly cut as the next page loaded(which isn't the author's fault, obviously) so I had to mute it. But [[https://soundcloud.com/walkingnorth/sets][there's a soundcloud link to the music that I plan to utilize heavily in the near future.]]

Overall, a very fun story. I'm happy I read it.
