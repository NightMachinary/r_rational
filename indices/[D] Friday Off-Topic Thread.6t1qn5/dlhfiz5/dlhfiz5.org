Having finished the first half/season of the webcomic [[http://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/1-i-guess-thats-why-i-admire-her/viewer?title_no=557&episode_no=1][Always Human]] after [[/u/TimeWinders][u/TimeWinders]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6rrew4/monthly_recommendation_thread/dl9a7dc][recommendation]], I would like to sing the praises of it since I don't think they did it justice. The comic is about a lesbian romance in a transhumanist future where one of the girls has an immune disorder that keeps her from using nanotech mods and is a fantastic example of using a sci-fi senario as a metaphor for a real world situation.

The story is about dating with a disability from the perspective of both partners and explores the insecurities both of them feel in their relationship as a result of that. Austen is driven to push past the limitations her disability places on her, which prevent her from using things like memory-enhancing mods that other students take for granted, but is battling self-loathing over the difficulty of doing so.

Sunati first feels attracted to Austen because of her disability, admiring her courage and resolve in the face of adversity, but soon realizes that she's fetishizing Austen and has to figure out how to psychologically separate the girl from her disability while also questioning her own use of appearance-altering mods. Speaking as someone with a disability, both of these were handled beautifully and rationally.

The best part of it all? These two /communicate/. It is fantastic to see a romantic drama where neither partner keeps secrets from the other and they always talk with each other about what they're thinking, but still see interesting conflicts develop because of their fears and insecurities. They're both good people who want to be better and are trying to do their best, only to face all-too-real challenges this situation presents.

The artwork is beautifully abstract and colorful, sort of like a anime drawn completely with watercolors, and each chapter has some delightful background music to accompany it. I even think the atmosphere set by the surreal yet gorgeous imagery is supposed to be representative for the acceptance of LGBT people, but that's just a theory. So if you haven't checked this story out yet, I think it's definitely worth a look.
