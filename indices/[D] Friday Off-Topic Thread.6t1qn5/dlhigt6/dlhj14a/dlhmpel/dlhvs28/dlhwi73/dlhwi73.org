You know, the more of your posts I read, the more I feel that you have a systematic problem of some sort; that I wouldn't know how to name (and I don't really want to put labels), where you take things way too closely and too seriously.

Just my two cents on other people's personal issues as a stranger on the internet. Hopefully I'll make more sense after a night of sleep.
