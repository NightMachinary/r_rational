  I eventually concluded that I had a psychological need to believe in some form of religion and attempting to live as an atheist would only contribute to my depression.

I'm not sure that this is spot on for me, but it's definitely close to how it feels for me. I'm hoping that things might change now that I'm away from BYU-I and that, with other pressures relieved, this one might not be so burdensome, but I definitely have a God-shaped hole or hunger for ritual or whatever. Maybe I could try acid. >:P

I've got a few friends on Occult Marxist Tumblr and every so often I'm tempted to see if it's possible to fuse a little bit of that into atheism, sort of like a weird LARP or something, but...I am really attached to my identity as "Somebody whose base-level preference is to believe what is true rather than what feels good for whatever reason" and I'm a little worried that I might get sucked into the Religion Hole again if I don't stay away from it entirely.

I don't really know. On Tumblr, Tanadrin's mentioned that Sacred Harp helps to satisfy some atheists, and now that I'm in San Francisco I actually have the opportunity to check them out. I'd like to find a way to make symbols more meaningful again.

  I'd be happy to discuss theology with you, though I can't claim that you'll find any of my experiences enlightening.

Nah, but it might be interesting. A bit of forewarning, though: Even as a Mormon, I tended to approach religion (mine and others') like I do a fictional world, asking what Y is implied by the existence of X and how, if at all, A and B can be reconciled with each other despite their apparent conflict because of some apparently insignificant but conflicting details.

I don't want to tick you off, so let me know ahead of time if that would bug you. It's more in the spirit of "fully exploring/investigating" than "debunking," though.
