  It's interesting to see the progression from what looks like relative moderation, to literalism, and then to deconversion. I've seen that pattern before and I'm not sure why - perhaps people overcorrect for a perceived lack of personal commitment?

I don't know why it happens in other religions but, according to my philosophy of religion professor, Mormons have a strong tendency to fall out of the faith and into atheism rather than into another religion. It probably has to do with the central place that modern-day prophets take in our doctrine: if you thought that Joseph Smith spoke to angels and translated scripture by the power of God but this was wrong, then that forces you to reevaluate more ancient holy men whose stories have had even more time to accrete details.

Serving a mission also gave me an interesting perspective on what it's like to be the holy man: even as a believer, it was weird for people to look at me like I had some sort of special relationship to the divine and to be looking to me for blessings and special guidance; and as an ex-believer, it's even weirder to think about what it was like in my head.

Anointing them with consecrated oil and laying my hands upon their heads, I pronounced blessings on the troubled and healed the sick. I cast demons out of haunted houses and walked without knowing where I was going, sure that God would get me to where I was supposed to be.

It's some freaking heady stuff, I have to tell you, and...I still miss it a little, just a tiny bit like how I imagine a recovering alcoholic still yearns for the drink. It gave me another perspective on what it's like to be one of a so-called prophet, demonstrating pretty clearly to me that good people can buy their own press and keep the story going. I wasn't even someone with millions of dollars at stake, just a rank-and-file missionary, but in retrospect I can clearly remember the ways that I would jump through hoops to avoid noticing the flaws and explain e.g. why someone wasn't being healed (and I remember the times when they thought they were doing better and would try to convince me, even though I personally wasn't sure).

I definitely have a God-shaped hole, but I'm not sure that it was always there. I don't think I had it when I was younger. More likely, it developed on my mission, back when I was really getting into this stuff. More reason to discourage people to play with religion, I guess.
