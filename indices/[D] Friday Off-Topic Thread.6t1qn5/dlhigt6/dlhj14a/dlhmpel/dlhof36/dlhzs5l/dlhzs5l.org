Totally forgot the answer the second half of your post. Haha.

  That hunting range sounds really egregious. Any idea how they officially justify it, if they bother?

There's no official justification that I've found (not that people haven't been trying to get a response) but in [[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/770568/Tending-the-flock.html?pg=all][this news article]], one of the people who manages the place has this to say:

  Hunting and guns are a big issue, and some people question whether hunting should even happen at all. But the fact is, there are between 14 and 18 million hunters in America, and many more than that number own guns.

I just can't get over how the guy's response to "some people question whether hunting should even happen at all" is basically "well there are a lot of people who would pay for this, you know?"

At the close, the same guy remarks:

#+begin_quote
  Imagine if we got to the point that we could boost the price (of each permit) to $2,000 or $2,500. Times that by 250, and *it doesn't take a lot to understand that this could be a very profitable operation.*

I feel like I've come to terms with the Church, but my blood still boils over a little at what this guy is saying. I spend two years of my life telling people that this is a good church, that it has some flaws but does more good than ill and that its leaders are ultimately inspired by God, and then I come home to find that the God that inspires them is Mammon. I can hardly believe it.

It isn't like the guy is a weird outlier whose views contrast with the official line, either. As the article says, "Church land managers see it as a legitimate way to make thousands of acres of land productive that would otherwise lie fallow for lack of water."

Fallow? /Fallow/? There couldn't possibly have been a desert ecosystem there that was already inhabiting this area, could there? This couldn't possibly be the Church whose prophet said that one of the most severe things we would be judged by is our treatment of the environment and of less powerful creatures, could it?

Well, I know the answer to one of those. It's the same church in name only. Nobody teaches these things anymore.

  As to your family, good luck.

Thanks.
