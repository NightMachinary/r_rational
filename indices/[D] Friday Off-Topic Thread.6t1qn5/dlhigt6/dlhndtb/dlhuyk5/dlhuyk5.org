  "these weird American Christian cults"

Well, they're definitely weird, and... "Cult" gets used an awful lot, but "spiritually abusive" probably does a better job of actually conveying useful information just because "cult" gets used so much, in so many ways. Especially after some of the leaks that have been dripping out for the past year or so, I'd say that Mormonism isn't too far off from being "Scientology with better PR."
