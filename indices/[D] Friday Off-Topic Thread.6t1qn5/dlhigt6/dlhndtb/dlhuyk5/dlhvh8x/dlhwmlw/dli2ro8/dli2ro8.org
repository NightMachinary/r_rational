  No, no, I'm pretty sure that's correct. I read it as sort of an indictment against Islam in particular when I was watching it, but, um, that was back when I was a jingoistic neocon shitheaded teenager.

It's really kind of an indictment of organized religion altogether, but I would say it's aimed toward abrahamic faiths especially.

Even fairly mainstream christian churches can get pretty into this isolationist religion game. The church my friend grew up in made a large and concerted effort to be the center of all its members' social lives, across every facet. Combine several services a week with several youth group sessions, add a (separate, in a strip mall down the street) coffee/book shop made and furnished to be a casual hangout, and special events to supplant common holidays, like a trunk-or-treat for Halloween, and you've got an insular, disconnected faith community right there in suburbia that looks almost like a normal church.

Calvary Chapel is an evil death cult.
