Yeah. After knocking polytheism in the previous seasons (sure, the Asgard are goodniks, but they're still /not gods/), the focus on Abrahamic religions combines to make SG-1, in total, an indictment of religion (or at least god-following, since you could maybe make the case that New Age-y stuff is shown in a good light via the Ascended) in general.
