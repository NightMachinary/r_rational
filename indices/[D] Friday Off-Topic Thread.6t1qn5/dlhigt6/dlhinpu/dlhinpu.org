*Boring stuff about my previous username and the new one, for those who are interested. This is mainly being written so my first post with this account has a clear link to my previous account.*

The name "callmebrotherg" has apparently been interpreted by many people as "call me brotherg," but it was intended to be "call me brother g," as a nod to my religious convictions and the difficulty that most people encountered in trying to pronounce my last name. I was an unorthodox Mormon, to say the least, but I was devout in my own way and proud of those ties.

Increasingly, though, I don't feel good about those ties or the name that I chose to represent them. It might cause a small amount of confusion, but I've been considering this for the better part of a year and I'd really just like to leave the name behind. Even if nobody knew but myself, the name's meaning would still irritate, like a pebble lodged in my shoe.

I don't want to change my username again, so I spent much longer thinking about it than most people probably do. On a whim, I had slightly renamed the second edition of my Cyclopedia of Comparative Mythology, from Brother G's Cyclopedia to The Salt Cyclopedia. I'm not entirely sure why I chose "salt," but I was going to be selling this edition and I knew at this point that I wanted to be able to separate myself from "Brother G." Anything, even "salt" was better than that.

Not long after, I had to decide on a name for my publishing company in order to start releasing stuff on DriveThruRPG. I settled on "WMB Saltworks," referencing an old blog of mine (White Marble Block) and trying to make the "Salt" in Salt Cyclopedia mean something (Incidentally, I'd once considered an imprint called Glassworks years ago, for entirely different reasons).

I would have gone with [[/u/callmesalt]] at that point but my username had previously matched my gmail and I wanted that to continue, so I had to come up with something more because [[mailto:callmesalt@gmail.com][callmesalt@gmail.com]] was already taken. After spending far too much time on what was ultimately just some usernames and an email address, my girlfriend suggested Salticidae, a (taxonomic) family of spiders. In retrospect, this should have been obvious because I'm a big fan of Portia (a genus in that family) and am fond of spiders in general (though not as much as I am of birds, to be honest).
