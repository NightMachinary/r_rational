  Have you ever had a spooky Mormon hell dream?
#+end_quote

No. For a long time I did have this nagging worry that I was incorrect and Mormonism was true after all, but that was abruptly squashed when I discovered that my church was making money from sport hunting. There was no possible interpretation of that scenario which did not involve the fundamental truth claims of the LDS Church being false, and I've never been troubled since.

  What's the Mormon take on Satan?
#+end_quote

We all existed (in spirit form) before we were born ("Pre-Earth life"), and in the time before the Earth itself was created, Satan was our bro, in the sense that we are all siblings and God is our heavenly father. One day, God said that He was going to create a world and we'd be able to live on it, which would be Cool for reasons I'm not getting into right now because I'm trying really hard to stick to just Satan and not go into the whole "Plan of Salvation." Ask for elaboration on anything, though.

Anyway, Satan doesn't like some bits of God's plan, offers his own, and gets pissed when God says that it's a bad plan. Satan leaves, convincing a third of us to go with him, and dedicates his existence to fucking up God's plan, either out of spite or to show that it wasn't such a hot idea after all.

Here on Earth, Satan has used the "treasures of the earth" to "buy up armies and navies, popes and priests, and reign with blood and horror on the Earth," [[http://www.ldsendowment.org/garden.html][according to one of our religious ceremonies]]. Accordingly, he is the prince of this world, and we can rest assured that the dominant social order of the day is in line with his program.

His great question in this ceremony is "Do you have any money?" and his follow-up is "You can buy anything in this world for money."

Basically, (as might make more sense with additional context from scripture and other writings from Joseph Smith, but I'm trying to not give you the full load here) Satan is being associated with ruthlessly exploitative capitalism.
