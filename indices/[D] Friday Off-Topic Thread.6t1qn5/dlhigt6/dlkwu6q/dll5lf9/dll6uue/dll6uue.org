Is matter thought to be infinite in Mormon theology? My familiarity with Mormonism goes about as far as the pisstakes of it, but so far as I know God isn't considered capable of creating more matter, and there's the whole deal with that "as we are now, God once was, and as God is now, we too shall be" stuff/good Mormons becoming gods in their own right. If matter isn't considered to be infinite, is the problem of future gods potentially running out of matter to make their own worlds and stuff brought up at all? Is it even a problem or is it believed that we'll reach a point of "peak divinity" and not even need corporeal shit anymore?

And here I was thinking that whole thing with the hunting ground couldn't get more hypocritical.
