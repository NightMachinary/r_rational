  Is matter thought to be infinite in Mormon theology?
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure. I can't recall anyone explicitly saying "there is an infinite amount of matter in the universe" but people have said that the /universe/ is infinite, and without further clarification I think it's safe to assume that this implies an infinite amount of matter.

Certainly, nobody has ever expressed a concern with "peak divinity."

#+begin_quote
  so far as I know God isn't considered capable of creating more matter
#+end_quote

This is correct. God is bound by physical laws, which is pretty interesting (and part of the argument that Mormon Transhumanists make. that God is e.g. a superintelligent AI who has simulated our universe for the purpose of making more minds or something like that).

  or is it believed that we'll reach a point of "peak divinity" and not even need corporeal shit anymore?
#+end_quote

Alas, being able to make your own worlds and spirit children, who will go on to have their own divine children ad infinitum, is supposedly part of the appeal and God accrues "glory" to his kingdom via the expanding kingdoms of his children and their children and so on.

Basically, deification is a multi-level marketing scheme that never actually reaches the point of collapse (because we won't ever run out of matter in an infinite universe).

(I once theorized, as part of some really weird heretical teachings that I was delving into at the time, that the full cycle involved gods eventually deciding to erase their memories and start over again from square one, so I guess that's a way to get around a finite amount of matter)

  And here I was thinking that whole thing with the hunting ground couldn't get more hypocritical.

Haha, yeah. Oh, and they spent $1.5 billion on a mall for rich people just a stone's throw away from our most famous temple. But don't worry, they didn't use our tithing dollars to build it.

Not that they'll let us see the records that could prove that. Even though one of our holy books specifically says that the membership has to approve of the way that our tithing money is being used, and we can't very well do that, not /really/, if we don't actually know where the money is going.

Oh, and our leaders are making a six figure income /plus/ a healthy living stipend, /plus/ royalties from the books that they love to write. That also kind of annoys me (that, plus the fact that nobody knew until it was leaked by a helpful church insider).

Meanwhile, people who are struggling to pay their tithing (ten percent of your income in donations to the Church) are told to tithe first and pay the bills and feed their children second, Because Faith.
