While it is not particularly rational, I'd like to recommend [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-scourge-of-earth.39057/][The Scourge of Earth]] anyway, which is an ongoing Worm fanfic that received far too little attention since it started for it's above average quality. Starts with OC PoV, but Ridley (the OC) and Taylor are protagonists and viewpoint characters in equal measure. There is some despair porn (due to circumstances of debatable plausibility) in the first arc, which might or might not be your thing, and while the author does not exactly avoid everpresent fanon scenes and tropes, he does manage to put fresh and interesting spins on them.
