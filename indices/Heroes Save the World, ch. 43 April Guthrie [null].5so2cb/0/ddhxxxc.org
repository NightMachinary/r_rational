I feel like the latest style, for the past three chapters, have been a little too effective at their goal of getting the reader to feel the confusion and chaos of the scene, because we've seen this from three different perspectives and the only thing I think I know is that Hannah was talking to green suit and dress lady partner, Simon almost touched green suit and then someone cut green suit's hand off to presumably stop Simon's power from working on him, and then no idea.

I don't know if that is because I'm not trying hard enough to understand it or if there's another issue with the writing itself, but figured I'd bring it up to see if it's an issue anyone else has had.
