Correct! Although I made a small retcon a few days ago (just the index finger being lost, as opposed to index and middle) because I spent too much time trying to work out the scene in my head (which is difficult, since I'm not very good at the whole mental imaging thing) and it wasn't really working right. I wasn't sure if anybody would notice that detail, since it was only mentioned once.
