  Feels like the chapter ends before it gets to the good stuff.

The upcoming chapter should make up for that, hopefully.

  Wonder who is downvoting your HStW posts. Maybe someone's miffed you pushed their Naruto/My Little Pony/Harry Potter fanfiction off the hot page?

Yeah, I've got no idea what's going on there. Maybe somebody who doesn't know that you can just click the "Hide" button to get rid of stuff that you don't want to see.

It had me worried this time, though, because I got two downvotes almost as quickly as the thread went up, and I wasn't sure if the thread would be displaying for anybody else after that happened.
