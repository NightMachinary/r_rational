Aw, poor bot was only doing what it was told to do. The issue was that we accidentally told it that its first posting was supposed to be May 18, *2015*, which was a Monday, rather than May 18, *2016*, which is a Wednesday. So Monday rolls around and the bot thinks that he's supposed to post a thread, because we told him that happens every Monday.
