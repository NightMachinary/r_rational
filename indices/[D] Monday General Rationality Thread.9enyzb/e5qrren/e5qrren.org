I have taken up piano as a hobby but am struggling with the finger dexterity parts of playing. I have small hands so playing some of the beginner pieces is becoming a struggle for me. To offset this frustration I've taken to practicing for only 50 minutes at a time.

Does anyone else have techniques or routines for practicing things they are struggling to force themselves to do?
