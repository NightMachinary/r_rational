I've really enjoyed Blood Crest.

I think it's biggest selling point is that there doesn't seem to be a true authority on magic. Capable and powerful wizards all seem to have different and sometimes mutually exclusive ideas on how to go about practicing magic, which does the best job I've seen of creating an atmosphere of scientific inquiry.
