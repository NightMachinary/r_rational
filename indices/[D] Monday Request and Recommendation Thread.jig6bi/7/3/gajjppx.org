I looked at the stories I read of Harry Potter fanfiction, and here are the ones I remember enjoying:

Realignment: "The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about."

The Many Deaths of Harry Potter: "In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die, and repeat until he gets it right."

Magicks of the Arcane: "Sometimes, all it takes to rise from greatness is a helping hand and an incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now."

The Firebird Trilogy: Firebird's Son - "He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How could one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe."

The Denarian Renegade: "By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artifact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight crossover with Dresden Files."

Almost a Squib: "What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successful in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly, AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning Harry."

Final Battle, Pokemon Style: "Wild VOLDEMORT has appeared! Go, HARRY!."

Harry Potter, the Geek: "The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.

Weeb: "Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Timeline moved to the modern day."
