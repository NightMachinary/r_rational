[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] This was my favorite time travel Harry Potter that I read a long time ago. It's first person and Harry is driven a bit insane from time looping so it does read almost like a fever dream at times.

edit: I just skimmed some chapters again and it feels kinda edgy and Harry is a bit cringeworthy. I hope it is as good as I remembered, but I may have just been looking back with edgelord tinted glasses.
