Pith is basically grimdark Harry Potter, where the school / political institution of wizards is pretty corrupt, but so is the rebel org of muggles fighting it. A big part of the story is that magic lets you switch your soul ("pith") into other bodies, but bodies are an extremely expensive commodity and so inequality is really felt. All wizards have a capability ("vocation") that they are natively good at, usually right off, but other wizards can learn other people's vocations if they have the background and talent. The fights are pretty cool, you have people fighting it out each with 1 major power a, 0-2 medium-sized powers, and an assortment of minor but relevant powers like pattern recognition or "nidging" unprotected minds. It's well thought out, sometimes the characters trying to be moral in a situation where the morality is so impossible to work out is a bit tiresome (think early Practical Guide to Evil if that means anyway).
