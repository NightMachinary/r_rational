For a RoyalRoad novel, it's surprisingly good and unique. Carl really takes advantage of everything and stuffs everything he can gets his hand on into his inventory, which sets up a lot of clever moments. Virtually every litrpg novel has some form of infinite spatial storage, but I've rarely seen anyone abuse this ability more than Carl. He exploits the mechanics as much as he can, and those plans actually feel really clever and natural with the given rules and loopholes. DCC is a lot better than one would expect.
