[[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][/Pact/]] by Wildbow (author of /Worm/) is absolutely this, to an even greater degree than /Worm/. A lot of readers bounce off it because the danger, tension, and pure nightmare fuel is so unrelenting, but it sounds like it might be your jam. It's excellent, but a tough read for all those reasons.
