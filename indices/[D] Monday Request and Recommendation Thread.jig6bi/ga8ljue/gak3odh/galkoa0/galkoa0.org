I absolutely recommend Pact, but I wouldn't call it rationalist. The world itself pretty much forbids attempts at rationalism, the Karma system basically forces people to conform to tropes if they want to acquire power.

If that's not a dealbreaker, then by all means, dive right in. I'd also recommend [[https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/][Deep In Pact]], a podcast with one new reader and one who's already read the story going though chapter by chapter.
