I've been reading a lot of fantasy fiction (both classical Western, LitRPG, and xianxia) lately, and I've noticed a gap. It seems like all magic systems in these works assume that magical "resource gathering" is something that occurs over a long time, such that all these gathered resources can be whipped out and expended all at once in a time of need.

Is there a ratfic (or just any fiction that's not irkingly irrational) that explores the alternative --- magical "resource gathering" being something that needs to happen /during/ battle?

Y'know, like what happens in a match in an RTS/4X game; or the "mana ramp" in a TCG like /Magic: the Gathering/.

A magic system where everyone has to "start at power-level 1" at the beginning of a fight (unless they've already been ramping up in anticipation --- which probably has negative consequences, otherwise everyone would do it.) And where you can only build up your power level to "unlock" your higher-level techniques so quickly during a match, unless you've specialized in arts that accelerate mana ramping, at the expense of your other powers. Basically, a narrativization of something that is, at its core, a /deck-building/ magic system. (Though it doesn't have to look that way to the people in the setting.)

I'd expect this would mean that high-level techniques only have a point to learn, if you've already mastered your low-level arts to the point that you can reliably "win up to" the point in the mana ramp where high-level techniques become relevant. The first exchange of every fight would always be decided with only low-level techniques on both sides, and so even the most mysteriously-gifted would be "balanced" with raw apprentices for the first few rounds.

All that being said, I wouldn't want to literally read rational!YuGiOh. I'd prefer a story with a "real" high-fantasy magic system, not a story about people playing a game where the deck-building magic system is a property of the game.

Or, for an alternative thought, couched in economics: what about a magic system where people work like corporations? Where instead of just having to worry about "capital outlay" (equiv. to spending mana / artifacts in a fantasy battle), they also have to worry about "operational expenses" / "cashflow" (equiv. to something more like "a need to breathe" --- a constant consumption of an environmental magical resource, whose flow can be blocked or redirected, and where increasing in power level can increase this "burn rate.")

Anyone here know anything /good/ in this vein?
