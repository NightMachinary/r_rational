  Or, for an alternative thought, couched in economics: what about a magic system where people work like corporations? Where instead of just having to worry about "capital outlay" (equiv. to spending mana / artifacts in a fantasy battle), they also have to worry about "operational expenses" / "cashflow" (equiv. to something more like "a need to breathe" --- a constant consumption of an environmental magical resource, whose flow can be blocked or redirected, and where increasing in power level can increase this "burn rate.")

The City And The Dungeon has something a bit like this.

There is a dungeon. People can become basically immortal by becoming adventurers. The catch is that you have to constantly consume monster cores to stay alive. Monsters drop these cores in the dungeon. The drops go up in quality the deeper into the dungeon you go, but the dungeon also gets much harder. As a person levels up they need high quality monster cores just to survive.

There are a few mentions in the book of the city rulers trying to balance population levels based on the amount of loot that people can pull in. In general there were a few interesting bits of exposition about the economics of the world.
