Another missing settings is to build magic like WW2 war economy. Magic require huge expenditure of resources, and mage casting spell is merely the end point of long pipeline of resource gathering and processing done by organized labor force. Social consequences would be the mages are not necessarily absolute top of the social pyramid. Another would be "mages don't fight mages if possible". Instead of hitting enemy mages it's more efficient to hit production lines feeding them.
