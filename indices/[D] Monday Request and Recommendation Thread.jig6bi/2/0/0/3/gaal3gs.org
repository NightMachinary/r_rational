The issues being discussed might be worse for pure mages who only use magic, as opposed to some kind of mix of combat abilities. This makes sense for tabletop games where specialisation and build decisions are key, but less so in real life or a story where skill, situation, and character development add variety to combat even if everyone's build is "some mix of weapon skills and magic".

But to answer OPs original question: One of the 3 paths of magic in Polyhistor Academy is like that. It suffers from the ramp-up issues and ambush problems, but that's the trade off for increased flexibility and endurance (as opposed to raw power)
