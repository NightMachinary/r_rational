  For one, it makes ambushes extremely effective.

My naive assumption was that stories in a setting like this could employ something like MtG's old concept of [[https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Mana_burn][mana burn]] --- wherein any spiritual energy that is gathered /must/ be released within a few seconds through the use of some art (with no option to simply "put it back" or "bleed it off"), as not doing so results in backlash damage proportional to the amount of energy that was gathered.

Essentially this spiritual energy would work like an electrical grid: power generation gets spun up to meet demand, but if power generation ever greatly /exceeds/ demand (plus storage capacity), bad things happen.

Or, in the small: a magic-user needs to put a "load" on the spiritual-energy "circuit" they're creating, or it'll be a /short/ circuit, grounded through them :)

This could be made even more strict by removing the ability to decide /how much/ energy you'll be gathering at any given point --- you'd be on a set mana ramp, that you can only influence by choosing to "step on the gas" or not each turn. By analogy with MtG, it'd be like as if lands auto-tapped every turn you had them in play. You can only choose whether to play a land or not each turn; but you then have to spend your mana "income" for the turn, or face backlash. Which, of course, would be just /awful/ in combination with a mana-burn mechanic in a deck-building game where you aren't sure what cards you're going to be able to play; but would mostly work just fine in a story setting where wizards just /know/ their spells, and can cast them whenever, energy allowing.

(What happens at the end of a magic battle, then? Maybe it'd possible to just reset your mana ramp back down to zero at any time. That'd mean people would have a lot of tactical flexibility to ramp up and down between 1 and 0, but would lose that as they ramp higher. /Or/ you could /not/ do this, and presume the setting is full of passive abilities designed to burn off the excess energy high-level magic-users are stuck permanently consuming now that they've ramped up to that point---perhaps with global environmental consequences. Both options seem "fun.")

  you're placing some hard limits on how useful a combat mage can be.

Well, sure, but those are the same limits D&D places on its Wizards, just in microcosm. "Can't survive on their own and must be defended; but gradually gain self-sufficiency; until eventually they're an invincible nuke" --- but it happens over again every battle, instead of being their lv1--lv20 growth arc.

Personally, I'd love to see a story about such a combat mage /and their bodyguard/. Seems like a fun character dynamic. Somewhere between a buddy-cop comedy and /KonoSuba/.

(Alternately, it could be a highly team-based setting, where mages cover one-another in shifts like real tactical squads, with some mages "taking watch" by ramping up to a set level where they can run wards / summoned mooks / etc., where someone else is supposed to ramp up to the same point in time to cover them so they can reset and go to sleep; all to protect some /other/ mages so they can be kept fresh for actual fighting.)
