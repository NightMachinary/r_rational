Not magical and not rational but this is a very interesting topic to me and I wanted to bring your attention to this comparison.

Some Shounen is very much like this system in specific reminds me a lot of Saint Seiya.

They need to ramp up during a fight, low level techniques are used at the start as bread and butter and later ultimate techniques como into play as finishers. A talented low level/class can get to the same level as a high level with enough burning time/buffs like Athena's blessing.

Also they have some build-in counters to the downsides for example they use heavy armor used as protection while ramping up and main difference between low and high level users is that high level users have a faster ramp up, their low level techniques are more powerful versions and can maintain the peak performance for longer (during battle) but in theory both can reach a similar ceiling.
