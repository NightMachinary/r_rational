I could swear I read a story like your first request ages ago, but it was the first book in what seemed to be set up as a trilogy (and then no further books were published).

For magic-as-economics, though, I wholeheartedly recommend [[https://www.maxgladstone.com/series/the-craft-sequence/][Max Gladstone's Craft Sequence]] - a series of novels where magic is money, more or less, and those high flying financial wizards are /literal/ wizards.

The first novel opens with the main character getting kicked out of magical law school, which is a problem because it's built on a flying island and they didn't give her a parachute, and then getting a job auditing the books of a dead God.
