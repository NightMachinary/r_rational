For things that get posted on here that are in some sense /about/ relationships, there's of course Vampire Flower Language and also that one Valdemar fanfic (I dunno man, google your own googles).

I'm sure there are more around here with more "incidental" gayness, but for the life of me I can't search my mental index for them. Baru Cormorant, my brain says after much effort.
