I don't think anyone argues it's /badly/ written---it's just very explicitly /not rational/. It's not a terrible story by any means, but I imagine this community has a bit different priorities than most when it comes to fiction.

I'm definitely not gatekeeping this recommendation thread, and there are plenty of works getting rec'd here that are not rational, but this is a particularly egregious example, IMO.
