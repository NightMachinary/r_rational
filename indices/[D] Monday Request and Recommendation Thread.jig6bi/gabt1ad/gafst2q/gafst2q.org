I liked the story and do recommend. Not sure I agree that it's badly written -- it's arguably just a different kind of story. YMMV but I couldn't put it down.

The primary conflict was between different moral ideals, rather than much of the usual risk of being killed for not having enough power yet that protagonists usually face. This extreme power discrepancy could have been used as a humor premise (and often is, in Royal Road fics), but went in the direction of moral philosophy instead.

I also particularly liked that the author didn't outright take away the win, but did force the MC to acknowledge the terrible cost of the path he took. He actually does lose considerably, it's just that what he loses are bits and pieces of moral high ground. He's also forced to leave his comfort zone as a shopkeeper to fill the new role he's created for himself by winning.

It's a complex story and could have been done badly, or turned into an anti-immortality cautionary tale as most moral philosophy tracts do. Many times we have to be reminded that he's not a sociopath (at least, not the extreme type who lacks kindness and human feeling) because he's so confidently using means that horrify to combat an even more horrifying reality. (I sort of feel like this must be what it's like to work in politics.)

Overtly evil characters as well as well intentioned good people are used as foils. We're also given hints that he'd find our world rather horrifying as well, and that his success may not turn out to be as complete as he hopes.

Could have been harder for him to rise to the degree of power he obtains, there are some shortcuts the author uses to get him there which might feel a little cheap, and his moral struggles are sometimes more tell than show, but I'd say a pretty good story as it is.
