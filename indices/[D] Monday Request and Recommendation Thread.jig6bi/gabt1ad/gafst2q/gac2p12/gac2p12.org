Finally this story has been posted in this thread again, so I can de-rec it!

Despite a very rational(ist) premise, NDT's actual contents are anything but. Aside from a select few, characters are shallow and act the way the /plot/ requires them to. Many of them build complex, insane plans that shouldn't work---but of course they do, because /plot/. The main character, despite allegedly being a genius, makes abnormally stupid decisions out of sheet stubbornness (you guessed it, to advance the /plot/). And finally, the /P L O T/ itself is unexciting, with many twists and turns coming mostly absolutely from nowhere and others being seen a mile away despite zero foreshadowing.

I also found pacing to be outrageously fast, but that's subjective.

What (probably) isn't subjective, though, is the absolute lack of tension. MC is overpowered from the start and only gets stronger over the course of the story. He gets everything he wants, and, aside from the finale never really loses nor do you /ever/ expect him to. The outcome of every battle and every event is laughably predictable.

This is power fantasy at its worst.

Though I don't know why I expected anything else from Void Herald. He's great at worldbuilding and humor, but otherwise his writing is mediocre, especially for such a complex premise.
