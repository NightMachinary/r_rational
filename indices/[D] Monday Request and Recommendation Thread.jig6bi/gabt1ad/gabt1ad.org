[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32067/never-die-twice][Never Die Twice]] bills itself as a story about a necromancer offering solutions to problems that he causes, and while it tells that story well I recommend it here as a story about a necromancer working to secure immortality for all. It's pretty tightly paced for webfiction, and recently finished at a relatively short 505 pages.

It also examines the question of "Do the ends justify the means?", with neither side feeling like strawmen.
