Some knowledge of the source material is useful and not too painful to acquire (the likeable characters and solid storytelling of the first three seasons are why the 'brony' phenomenon exist[s/ed]). That being said, you can honestly jump into pretty much any alternate-universe pony fic (including the ones I linked above) without much knowledge of the source material besides watching the first episode. Or if even that is too much of the source material for you, here's a quick summary of the salient points:

- The immortal and capricious Princess Celestia rules Equestria with an iron hoof, her control over the motions of the heavens the only justification necessary for her autocracy.
- On the 1,000th anniversary of banishing her usurper sister, Princess Luna to the moon, said sister returns to claim her throne, defeating Celestia and ushering in an age of eternal night
- The 'Mane six' (Celestia's pupil Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Applejack) band together to find and reactivate a set of primeval weaponry known as the 'Elements of Harmony'
- They confront Princess Luna, self-styled as the 'Nightmare Moon' in a forgotten ruin, and vanquish her with the power of the Elements of Harmony and the fell magic it enables, twisting her mind until she consents to the rule of her elder sister.
