I wrote a Lovecraft crossover called [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/126735/at-the-mountains-of-discord][At the Mountains of Discord]]. Some of the individual chapters really worked, I think, but the story as a whole didn't quite catch the proper atmosphere. Still, I'm moderately pleased with the result.
