Since the problem of ambushes was bought up, the solution to that could be detection - the first magic skill mages learn is working out the amount of power someone has access to at any moment, meaning any time a mage gets antsy and draws in mana, they get revealed to everyone else around them, and suddenly any surprise is measured in milliseconds.

That brings up interesting specialisations in development for mages, with ramping speed, ramping cap, and effectiveness with the lowest power level of spells. Additionally training of detection range versus other magic skills is a trade off, since a powerful mage could theoretically train as a sniper.

The left-field solution is that any mage can detect any other mage at any time, regardless of held power, meaning stealth isn't an option, but that also means a sufficiently powerful mage can round up all the weaker/in-training mages easily before they grow to oppose them and act as a magic dictator.
