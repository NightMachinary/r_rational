[[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086YZ6LDW?ref_=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_tkin&binding=kindle_edition][Street Cultivation]] is a novel series that's specifically "economics has happened to cultivation". To quote the blurb:

#+begin_quote
  In the modern world, qi is money.

  The days of traveling martial artists and mountaintop masters are over. Power is controlled by corporations, modernized martial arts sects, and governments. Those at the bottom of society struggle as second class citizens in a world in which power is a commodity.

  Rick is a young fighter in this world. He doesn't dream of immortality or becoming the strongest, just of building a better life for himself and his sister, who suffers from a spiritual illness. Unfortunately, life isn't that easy...

There's a differentiation between your "cultivation base" (capital) and "generation rate" (cashflow?), but I'm not sure how well the economic metaphor lands, not being an economist myself.
