I guess HxH powers are consistently used? The powers themselves are set in stone (for the most part), it's how people use them cleverly that is interesting. Outside of the Chimera Ant Arc ending, most of the powers in HxH were really consistently used.

Also similarly, Zombie Knight saga does power classifications (like enhancement, transmutation, etc. in HxH), with each classification getting an opposite that the user is weaker against. Powers in Zombie Knight Saga, however, are much more consistent than HxH. People usually only get the one power that slowly improves with time and use, and it's up to them to use it cleverly.
