Also recommend this. It took me a long time to read it because I really didn't like the premise, but the actual story is quite good and well written.

Though I wouldn't call it "rational", as to me the premise kind of got in the way of my suspension of disbelief, but if you can get pass that the characters act in reasonably rational and logical ways.
