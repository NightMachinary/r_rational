I mean, if you are in the free sims, then who's making money? It is an arguably torturous simulated hell that they aren't paying for....so what's the incentive? Sure, simulating the rich people makes sense. Drain them for as much money as you can until they run out. But at that point, why continue? I get that some people's fear of non-existence may make them opt for whatever shitty simulation they can get (at least for a while), but /why are the companies offering it/ if those people explicitly /don't have any money left/
