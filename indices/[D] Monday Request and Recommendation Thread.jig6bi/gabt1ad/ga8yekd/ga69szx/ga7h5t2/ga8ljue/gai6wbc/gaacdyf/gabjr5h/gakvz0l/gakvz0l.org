"Whales and Unicorns" of the same author was terrible. Before starting author should have try to get at least rudimentary understanding of medieval society and medieval combat. You can't hit horse in the eye using bow and arrow in the night. Medieval armies can not march through mountain passes during the night using torches. And more like that.
