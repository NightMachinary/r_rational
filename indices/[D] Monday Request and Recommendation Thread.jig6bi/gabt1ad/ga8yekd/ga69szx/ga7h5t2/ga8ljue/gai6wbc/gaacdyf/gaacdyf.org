I'm still reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/somebody-that-i-used-tahno-a-lok-si.670771/page-47#post-64848900][Somebody That I Used Tahno]], and it's one of the top SI stories I've read. The premise is that the author inserts into Tahno in Legend of Korra before the main plot starts. Starts with some of the more annoying SI tropes but after a bit turns into a genuinely good story. Not very rational, but fun and sometimes funny too.

Another story I've been enjoying a lot is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29027/a-city-stranded-cowboys-robot-mercy-killing-business][A City Stranded Cowboy's Robot Mercy Killing Business]]. The story is every bit as absurd as its title, but it's really funny at times and the world is very interesting. The closest thing I can compare it to is John Dies at the End by David Wong, without as much body horror. The premise is also pretty out there, so I'm not gonna spoil it for you. Just be ready for some absurd humor.
