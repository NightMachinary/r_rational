Some that are on my ff.net favorites list:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] - Dead, but 1 million+ words. Complete AU, and very good worldbuilding.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] - Complete. Very cute and well written, and above all very original.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][HP and the Forests of ValbonÃ«]] - Completed. Good prose(rare!) and worldbuilding.
