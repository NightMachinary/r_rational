DCC has a ton of munchkin gratification, but while readers can't always accurately guess the expected results of a mechanic, the plans are satisfying in hindsight.

Also one of the things I like most about Carl is that he comes across as a realistically worldly millenial, unlike many litRPG protagonists who often seem socially stunted. Part of that is probably the author's own depth of experience (he seems like quite the character) and a lot of the mundane experiences of Earth make it through to the narrative in a natural way.
