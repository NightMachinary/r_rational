Upload uses it's premise of Transhumanism as a play set for its comedy and commentary on wealth inequality, vapidness, and a few jabs at the question of what it means to be alive. Which is kinda funny give Amazon is the one footing the bill for it.

The Uploads don't age, have to pay for micro-transactions every day, can't duplicate themselves, and are not even aloud to participate in the economy at even a creative level, let alone a productive one. The few attempts at 'hacking' into the uploads environments is all for laughs, and the administrators for the system have enough power / control to casually modify uploads memories.

This is a Comedy, borrowing a sci-fi concept to re-iterate on without adding anything new. It's an alright comedy. The Orville is the most recent similar setup I can think of, and that show does a good job blending the familiar sci-fi elements with new ideas to keep them fresh.
