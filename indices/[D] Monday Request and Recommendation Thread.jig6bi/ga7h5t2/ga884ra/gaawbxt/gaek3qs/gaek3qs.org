Did you get to the abyss / warp filter part? It's a ways into the sand area and I think it's the best part of the series. Could be worthwhile to power through to that, depending on where you are.

I don't know if I'd recommend much further than that though. It keeps introducing what should be fun ideas, but the author seems to have stopped having fun writing it.
