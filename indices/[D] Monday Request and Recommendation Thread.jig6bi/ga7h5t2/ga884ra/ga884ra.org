[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager/chapter/379308/chapter-1-calvin-the-almighty][Wake of the Ravager]] impressed me with its creativity regarding powers. It's power wank-ish and not rational by any means but it's a fun read.

Another fandom that has a lot of powers and creative use of them is Naruto. [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/about/][The Waves Arisen]] is a great rational fic in that universe.

edit: another good rational naruto fic is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/naruto-lighting-up-the-dark.51004/][Lighting Up the Dark]], by our very own velorien, which just resumed after a long hiatus!
