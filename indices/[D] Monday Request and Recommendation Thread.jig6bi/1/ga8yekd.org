I've been reading some pony fics lately and have been struck by how satisfying realistic, and in particular realistically dark takes on childish settings can be. (for example, pokemon OOS or even HPMOR to a lesser extent.) Anyone got any recs in that vein?

And so I'm not coming in empty handed, here are some MLP:FiM recs im that vein. I understand that most of the people here arent bronies, but I urge you to look at the summaries of these stories based on their own merits, rather than as MLP fanfiction. These works have transcended their source material to creat something truly interesting from their common frameworks. All these works are complete
