The main work of /Friendship is Magic/ is the show, which is 9 seasons long and has 222 episodes. Then, there is /Equestria Girls/, which is canonical to /Friendship is Magic/ but is deliberately constructed in such a way that it can mostly be it's own AU setting with parallel-universe human versions of the characters that FiM!Twilight occasionally visits. It started out as a series of 4 movies set in between seasons of /Friendship is Magic/ and then started getting specials and shorts and stuff. Then, there is /the/ movie, set between seasons 7 and 8, which is again canonical to /Friendship is Magic/, and there are several shorts and a couple of specials which are canonical to the main show as well. The comics and books you can ignore, since they are A) non-canonical and B) obscure enough that you are unlikely to encounter fanfic based on them. See [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic][the recap article]] on TVTropes for a complete breakdown.

Obviously, watching all this would be a huge time investment, and to be honest not all of it is very good. But the bare minimum you should do is watch the two-part season one premiere, which introduces the Mane Six, Spike, Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, and the Elements of Harmony. That'll take 44 minutes. If you can then watch the rest of season one, you will get to know Gilda, Trixie, Zecora, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, Prince Blueblood, and the Grand Galloping Gala, as well as getting a much better feel for the personalities and relationships between the Mane Six. That's 26 episodes, or roughly 9.5 hours. Season two is not quite as important as season one, but it still introduces Discord, Daring Do, Shining Armor, Princess Cadence, Queen Chrysalis and the changelings, all of which are huge in fanfic. But that's another 26 episodes, so now you are up to 19 hours of viewing time. And /then/ there is season three, which is short (13 episodes) and has some of the weakest writing so far, but includes King Sombra, the Crystal Empire, and most importantly, the season finale "Magical Mystery Cure" which introduces a huge change in the status quo and was obviously intended to be the series finale if the show didn't get renewed (see [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixtyFiveEpisodeCartoon]["65-Episode Cartoon"]]). So that's the most obvious natural stopping point. Unless you feel like watching the first /Equestria Girls/ movie, set immediately after season 3, which introduces Sunset Shimmer, Flash Sentry, and humans.

*TL;DR:* Seasons 1-3 of /Friendship is Magic/ and the first /Equestria Girls/ movie are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle][the 20% of /My Little Pony/ that will let you understand 80% of fanworks]].
