[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28307/the-zombie-knight-saga][Zombie Knight Saga]] has a really cool power system as well. The closest thing I can compare it to is Hunter x Hunter, which allows for consistent powers that nevertheless can become pretty crazy with restrictions. It also features undead monsters fighting each other no to kill but to subdue them, since they can respawn.
