I just read Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past (From the previous week's rec thread? I don't remember.). It was the best time travel HP fic I have read, and generally one of the best fanfictions I have read; It's incomplete and abandoned (though the author said 6 months ago that they are going to continue it and there was one new chapter in the last two years), but it covers the first three years, and a bit of the fourth year. Its not exactly rational, but does not have big, jarring irrationalities, either. Overall, I'd say it's rational-adjacent-adjacent.

PS: I'd love to hear HP fanfic recommendations. The other good ones I remember and enjoyed (pretty much all of them irrational):

- Delenda est
- Black Comedy
- Dimension Hopping for Beginners
- An Unforgiving Minute
- The Lie I've Lived
- Prince of Slytherin (Probably just the first two years? The story is very irrational, and gets more so as it progresses; But I really enjoyed it till the middle of the third year.)
- Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth is
- Timely Errors
- Seventh Horcrux
- Poison Pen (rather more mediocre)
