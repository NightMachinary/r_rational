Enjoyed and seconded. It's a rare thing for an ffn fic to make me think, or use the word epistemology at all.

Also, as my own recommendation for OP:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort]]

Kind of brutal and dark, as you would expect from the premise Outsider-Earthling dropped into Voldemort's body, skills and memories. I enjoyed the worldbuilding and logic in it.
