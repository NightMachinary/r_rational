The cliches were done relatively well? I just thought it seemed quite rational, top to bottom. Not HPMOR or anything, just a reasonable, realistic level of competence from everyone who ought to be competent. Did you get far enough in for it to start discussing necroenergy?

And what's so wrong with the cliches anyway? It makes sense for wizards to be stratified by their combat ability. If you're fighting in a war, then combat power and so on is quite important.
