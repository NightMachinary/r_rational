Ah, in that case I feel obligated to apologize... I mentioned it because it was my favorite part, not because it was the main topic of the whole fic. Furthermore, although it does a great job of creating that aforementioned atmosphere of inquiry, it hasn't really explored the different avenues in tremendous detail yet.
