I've 2 recommendations this week, one is a series called [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7826376/][Upload]]. People here would probably love it, it's near future scifi with a bit of pop culture thrown in which leads to really fun things like kids doing homework on 2013 songs they call classic dance and other silliness. It's a comedy, has transhumanist tendencies and it's from the same creator as The Office and Parks and Recreation. It's great and you should watch it. The only Con I can think of is that the MC isn't very relatable to most people.

The second is a short book I read on screenwriting and writing stories in general, some of the points from it have been really helpful to me as an aspiring writer.The tittle is [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49464.Save_the_Cat][Save the Cat]], it has tips on how to make characters likable, how to pace the story, how to give characters distinct voices and personalities etc. If this is something that interests you check it out.
