I think this is actually the case. It was a popular book, and it really goes into detail (if I remember correctly) about what part of Cambell should happen on what page. If you didn't want to write to a formula, you would read Hero with 1000 Faces. I really hate the example from the title (make your hero save a cat at the beginning to make them relatable or whatever), it's just so shallow.

From Wikipedia:

  Snyder's nonfiction book Save the Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need was the number one selling book among screenwriting manuals on Amazon and in 2018 is on its 34th printing.[10] The book describes in detail the structure of the monomyth or hero's journey, providing a by-the-minute pattern for screenwriting.[11

You might be able to get something useful out of the book, but it has certainly had a wide influence, and it's designed to be followed exactly, and that's probably how it was used.
