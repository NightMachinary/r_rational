To piggyback on Hard Reset, there is [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder]] (unfinished). Trigger warning: Torture. Spoilers: Alternate Equestria, failed timelines not reset by casting the spell, but exploded by the Elements of Harmony after the spell is cast, without Celestia knowing, EoH being intelligent, not quite Aligned and able to do metaloop magic.

It's a great story if a conflict of multiple loopers, 2 Good (Twilight and Celestia) and 1 Evil (Chrysalis), fighting against each other, each with their timeloop anchor at a different point in time, is your thing.

Another fic: [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][Friendship Is Optimal: Caelum Est Conterrens]]. Set on Earth. Celestia is an attempt at a friendly AI. Her utility function? To satisfy human values through friendship and ponies.
