Looking for a recommendation of rationalist ,or at least very rational /survival stories./ Deserted islands, shipwrecked survivors, lost in space, plane-crashed in the wilderness, anything goes, as long as it is one person or a small group vs relentless nature.

Ideally it should be something along the lines of Cast Away meets HPMOR.
