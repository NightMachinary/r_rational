I wouldn't say it's about economics. They use money to fuel their superhuman fighting abilities, but a real world metaphor would be competitive shooting and having to pay for your own ammo (while being poor). Its more household budgeting than macro economics.

Capo on on royal road is a similar concept. It's litRPG, except it's based on Grand Theft Auto, you level up by earning money using your Skills and some skills literally require you to burn money to power them.
