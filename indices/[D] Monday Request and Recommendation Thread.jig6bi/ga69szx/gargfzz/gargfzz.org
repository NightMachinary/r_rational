While I don't think this is viable as a way for all combat in a setting to work, there are ways you can contrive to make it happen regularly. The obvious one is sports. Another is thresholds past which a mage can't bring any mana, so they have to use techniques to build power on the other side. This lacks the fundamental symmetry sports has, so you would have to balance it by penalizing lack of initiative to the point that the opponent has to mobilize in response to an invader. So a mage could invade a pocket dimension occupied by a demon, and would have to take control over the dimension's mana before the resident demon mobilizes it against them.
