I'm not aware of any magic systems like that, but I can think of a few reasons why authors don't use systems like that. For one, it makes ambushes extremely effective. If a handful of apprentices start gathering energy a minute before they plan to fight someone, they have an overwhelming advantage against even a master. The faster that power scales over the short term, the bigger advantage you give to people who can start gathering power before a fight actually starts.

Another problem is that if you have some limiter on the staying at your maximum power that's strong enough to be a real dettriment, then you really limit the types of combat encounters you can have. Wars of attrition would be difficult to write, because there's only a finite time that your protagonist can maintain their stronger spells before burning out. I think there's ways around it, but it gives a large advantage to anyone who can hold out even just a tiny bit longer, or who has some weapon in reserve for when your protagonist doesn't have their defensive spells anymore.

Mundane weapons are going to be a big problem, because they definitely don't have the limitation of starting out weak. If even a master mage can be brought down by bows within the first few seconds of a fight, you're placing some hard limits on how useful a combat mage can be.

I don't think any of these problems are insurmountable, but it's sufficiently limiting that it isn't a very attractive method of writing your world. You /have/ to deal with issues like this, because otherwise your world can look shoddy for ordinary people not thinking of it, and measures you take to correct for the above can have world building or plot consequences.
