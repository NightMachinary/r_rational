  Then it's just a game of finding the stealthiest method of burning mana while you wait to ramp up in power.

I was also presuming that stealth was kind of impossible, in the sense that there is some sort of spiritual-energy field that everyone could feel "flowing" toward mages as they consume it. A sensation like being in a full bathtub near an open drain. You can't necessarily tell what they're spending the energy /on/, but you /can/ tell that energy is being removed from the environment, and at what rate, and a general sense of what direction it's going.

Who said anything about that sort of time-scale? I mean, that's a possibility, but I was picturing /hours/, not seconds, of ramp time.

As a good example of what I'm picturing, a fictional character that already basically has this sort of built-in "per-battle mana ramp" (but where this is just a trope, not anything built into the constraints of the setting's magic system per se) is /Dragonball/'s Goku.

Goku, by the end of the /Dragonball/ franchise (~past /Super/), is a veritable Matryoshka doll of power-up transformation sequences. Every time he is in a fight, he essentially has to go through all of them, in sequence, if he wants to get to the highest one.

Goku gains long-term strength in two ways --- by unlocking new power-up levels, yes; but also by /decreasing the refractory period between each successive pair transformation sequence steps./ (These periods start out quite long; by the end of the franchise, he's whittled the early ones down to be near-instant, but the top-end ones are still slow.)

In most fights, Goku never /makes it/ to the top level he's theoretically capable of performing at.

Mind you, Goku is /already/ quite strong in his default state, even at the start of the franchise; but he's weaker than everything he has to fight. He starts out, as a child, needing to use cunning against most opponents until he can get his ramping-up technique of the day in.

Also keep in mind, Goku's base level of strength /also/ increases over time. I think this makes sense as a general principle; though I wouldn't recommend copying /Dragonball/'s own decision to make this base strength actually fully keep up with other characters' fully-empowered power levels.

I feel like the best approach to long-term growth would be to have this type of character be always be /slightly/ weak "at base level" compared to their non-ramping comrades, but not /terribly/ weak compared to them. Someone the party always has to /protect/ --- but not someone who's actually getting /proportionally weaker/ compared to the threats they're facing over time.

Also, importantly, both Goku and MtG planeswalkers can /take a hit/ from a top-level threat, even when they're not ramped. In D&D terms, they continue to have per-level HP and natural resistance/armor class growth, even though they don't have (as much) base-state DPS growth.
