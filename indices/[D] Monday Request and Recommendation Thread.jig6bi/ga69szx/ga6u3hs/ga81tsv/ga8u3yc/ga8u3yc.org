  Essentially this spiritual energy would work like an electrical grid: power generation gets spun up to meet demand, but if power generation ever greatly /exceeds/ demand (plus storage capacity), bad things happen.

Then it's just a game of finding the stealthiest method of burning mana while you wait to ramp up in power. And like I said in the last paragraph, it has a lot of knock-on consequences that an author may or may not like. In a fight, your mage protagonist is locked into burning mana very frequently. There's not a good way to reposition, or pause to talk about your conflicting ideologies, or help your teammate: you are locked into casting spells or you basically forfeit the fight.

  Well, sure, but those are the same limits D&D places on its Wizards, just in microcosm. "Can't survive on their own and must be defended; but gradually gain self-sufficiency; until eventually they're an invincible nuke" --- but it happens over again every battle, instead of being their lv1--lv20 growth arc.

It's not a good dynamic. The D&D version is fine, because you're sacrificing being weak early game in order to scale super well, but going through that scaling for every fight is super bad. Other people will know about you being extremely weak when you're just starting a fight, they will know that mages get unstoppably strong after a minute or so of fighting, so in every fight against people who know about mages they will immediately open with lethal force against the mage to the exclusion of any other fighters. They don't have a good option to deescalate, because even pausing to try to talk gives up time where the mage is growing stronger. Ambushes using mundane weapons would work very well.

Using multiple mages to cover each other can work, but especially combined with the above part about spending mana, stealth isn't an option.

If you have your mage in a more traditional adventuring group, maybe they can cover for you instead, or stealth isn't as important. But in a mixed class adventuring group, a mage that ramps up in power really quickly over the course of a fight is going to be a liability in the start of every fight (not a terribly fun thing to write about consistently) and then either match up with the rest of the party or eclipse them. It's not unworkable, but you're going to have a tricky time balancing it, and you have the rather inherent part that isn't fun in every combat.

Again, the idea /can/ work, and it can maybe even have some neat dynamics, but it opens up a lot of problems you need to solve, when you could just go with the much more traditional systems of magic that do what you want with far less effort. Even if mages in other works can accumulate power over time to be front loaded in a fight, it's very easy to add limitations on how quickly they can actually dish out magic, or have some other very simple limiter that makes them not want to do that. Rate limits on spellcasting, difficulty in multitasking, expending resources that are slow/expensive to replenish. These are all very simple to do, and have much easier methods of slotting into your world building and plot. They're far less restrictive as well, in contrast to the first point about how limited your options are if you have to expend your mana as you generate it.
