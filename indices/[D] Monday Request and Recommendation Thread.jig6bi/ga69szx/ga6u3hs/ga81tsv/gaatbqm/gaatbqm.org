I feel like this idea would only really work if you exclusively had offensively-focused magic that must target another creature. Since you brought up D&D, I'll use D&D spells as examples; it's a bit of a problem if you have to use Meteor Swarm or be mana burned, but less so if you can repeatedly cast Invulnerability on yourself. Once you include buffs/utility spells, there's no real downside to keeping ramped up.

Unless there's spell slots as well, like in D&D. But then with the ramp up all wizards would burn through their low-level spell slots pretty quickly and be unable to ramp up effectively as they'd have nothing to burn off mana while ramping up.
