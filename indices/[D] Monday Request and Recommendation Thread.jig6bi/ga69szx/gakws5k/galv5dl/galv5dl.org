Interesting. You're basically just talking about the D&D conceit of Artifacts --- which are cheap to /use/, but do indeed require state-level resource expenditures to /create/. (The high-level D&D wizards who create Artifacts, have access to state-like levels of resources.) What you're proposing is a magic system where the /only/ type of magic, is Artifacts. You need to use Artifacts to build other Artifacts.

(Sort of like computers before microcomputing!)

Still not sure that that would imply a need for state-scale /manpower and logistics/, since this would still be a world with literal /magic/. One thing magic systems almost always enable is /logistical automation/. In every high-magic setting I can think of, high-level wizards can, and do, go around setting up resource extraction operations to feed their spellcasting resource requirements all on their own, with magical "machines" taking the place of manpower. (And, in many systems, much of the "casting" of a long-casting-time spell is implied to be a sort of bootstrapping phase where other spells are cast that set up or redirect resource-extraction to feed the final spell.)

In other words: imagine /Factorio/, but fantasy instead of sci-fi. That's what high-level mages are usually running around doing to the countryside.
