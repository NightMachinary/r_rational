Is the pacing/plot progression better? I really liked Delve but in >50% of the chapters it feels like absolutely nothing happens. I'm ok with a story that takes forever to get to a final conclusion (I'm still reading With This Ring which doesn't seem to have any real end goal at all anymore) as long as things are happening in the chapters/mini arcs at least. If I have to read 50+ chapters at once to feel like anything has progressed, then I start to lose interest real fast.
