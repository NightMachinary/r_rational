So, I found the test you were talking about, which happened a few chapters after I stopped reading (two years ago, approximately.) I distinctly remember Pisces owing her quite a bit, and offering to teach her magic, and her saying magic is useless, but my memory must be wrong, because I can't find it.

The closest I could find was him offering his services (and potentially knowledge) to her to escape justice, and her quite naturally refusing to harbor a fugitive. Not quite the same thing.

She does have a mage owing her money for several chapters, and fails to ask for lessons, but I guess that was addressed after I gave up.

Thanks for the correction--I see I've been spreading misinformation.
