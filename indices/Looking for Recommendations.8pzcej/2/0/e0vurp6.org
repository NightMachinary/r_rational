  as the two main PoV characters are frequently not terribly rational, to put it mildly.

They don't really react like people should, either. They're from earth, get transferred to a fantasy world, yet have zero interest in magic? That's like a medieval peasant being transported to modern New York, and being totally blas√© about skyscrapers and cars.

The constant emotional (and often actual) torture of the protagonists is what really puts me off the work though. There's putting characters through adversity, and then there's actual sadism.

It's in the same vein as "The Warded Man", "Worm", "Prequel adventure", and "Tales of MU", so if you didn't have a problem with those, you may like "The Wandering Inn."
