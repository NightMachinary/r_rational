Are you sure you're talking about the Wandering Inn? What I remember is that while Ryoka has ignored the leveling system, she's been very keen to learn magic when the opportunity has come up. There have been chapters where this is the main focus. And Erin was very disappointed to learn she doesn't have any innate magical talent. Maybe my memory sucks, but I don't really remember Erin just rejecting chances to learn magic because she didn't care.
