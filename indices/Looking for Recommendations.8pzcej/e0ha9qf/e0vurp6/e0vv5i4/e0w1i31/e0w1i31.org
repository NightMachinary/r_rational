Nope. I stopped reading after the author went on a rant about Trump winning, saying that he would then make the series even more dark and depressing. It was too dark for me before that, so I gave up. Was it after that?

I do remember the innkeeper character getting several chances to learn magic (for free, or close enough.) She refused, saying she had no interest in magic.

The runner character had even less interest.
