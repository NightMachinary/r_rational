Here's the list. But first, here's a shorter list of disclaimers:

- Not all of these use the CK2 system - I went for anything that involves building an Empire, or I thought was likely to have the same "feel" to it.
- This is not an exhaustive list of all such threads on SV, and doesn't even touch those on SB (Spacebattles.com).
- The list is roughly ordered to group sequels and threads inspired by others together, but no great effort has been made.
- Only a few of these are completed. Most are incomplete, and most of those are sadly dead - QMing a Quest is apparently quite hard work.
- I've tried to trim away all the quests that only lasted for a few updates, but I may have missed a few.
- Quality is likely to vary between Top-Tier and Just-About-Good-Enough-I-Decided-To-Watch. As a vague indicator of quality, threads with many pages or sequels are likely to be above-average, as that indicates a larger/more active playerbase.
