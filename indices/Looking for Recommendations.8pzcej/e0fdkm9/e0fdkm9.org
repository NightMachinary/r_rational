Hmmm, I know the sort of thing you mean, but I'm struggling to think of any stories that fit the bill...

Have you tried reading Quests? A look through [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/tags/ck2/][SV's CK2 tag]] will show +all+ *EDIT: most* of the quests using the CK2 system (which basically borrow the stats of Crusader Kings 2 and tend to use similar mechanics) might scratch your itch. Some are of course hot garbage, but a lot are very high quality writing in their own right.

I'll take a look through the threads I'm watching and see if I can make a list of good ones.
