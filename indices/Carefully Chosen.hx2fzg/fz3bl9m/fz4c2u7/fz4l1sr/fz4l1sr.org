I have [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gr438d/wish_smarter_not_harder/][one]] or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dhqba8/pi_when_the_captain_saw_that_you_were_human_he/][two]] other stories on reddit I've written in the last few months, but most of my other work is either not on the internet yet or old enough that it's comparatively pretty bad. Also a bit of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/hvufmk/rt_ff_worth_the_candle_a_uniquities_meeting/][fanfiction]], but that's already active in this subreddit.
