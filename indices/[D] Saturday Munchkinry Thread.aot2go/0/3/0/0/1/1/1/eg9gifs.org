"Resent" might not be the wrong word here, but I would definitely prefer to have not been born. There have been nice moments in my life, but there have also been a number of moments where I have genuinely and actively wanted to die, and those moments are going to keep happening, so even though I'm feeling okay /right now/, I would still prefer to be dead because, Outside View time, I know that my current circumstances are not going to last.

My outlook would be different if I thought that eventually I'd get to a point where things were mostly good and the bad stuff wasn't so bad, but all that I can reasonably look forward to is alternating between good moments and moments that make me want to kill myself until I develop dementia.
