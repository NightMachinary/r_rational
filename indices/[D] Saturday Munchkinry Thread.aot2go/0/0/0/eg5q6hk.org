  I want all the money. I then spend $44 trillion dollar to sponsor the transformation of all low carbon technology to sustainable energy. I just bought humanity another centuries to solve it's problems before it destroys itself.

This was mine, although investing in asteroid mining looks like it could be a good side-gig to keep the money rolling in. Artificial meat, massive algae plants to make gas and pump it underground, buying ships to scuttle or change them over to cleaner energy, aggressively advertising mini-splits, propaganda to make food match the area its grown in (i.e. increase barley consumption in India), could all use a couple billion. Also straight up buying car companies and forcing them to electrify wouldn't hurt.
