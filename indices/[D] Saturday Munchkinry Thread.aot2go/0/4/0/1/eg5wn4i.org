I could easily program a wish that involves recursion in the end result without having the wish granting entity grant it more than once. For example if I want access to all the latest cures even in the future, becoming a part owner of all the medicine research labs would get me there.

And these are just things people have already accomplished. There is a lot that would be humanly possible if only the right knowledge was put together or the right personalities met.

but it sounds like your definition of "moderate" is related to the outcome of the wish, not the amount of effort the wish-granting entity would have to take to make it happen.
