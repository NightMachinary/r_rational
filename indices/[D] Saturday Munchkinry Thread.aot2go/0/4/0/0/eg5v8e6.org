We're talking about a media empire whose claims a significant percentage of the world's population takes as fact without ever checking. They own both fox and the wall street journal, as well as about 30% of what you'll hear in the US and most publications in the US.

I'm not wishing for people to believe anything I say, I'm wishing for this massive empire whose words are taken for granted, and which /already exists/ to start saying the things I want people to believe.

Sure, it'll only reach 30% of people, but many are clustered in influential geographic areas and 30% is a lot of people.
