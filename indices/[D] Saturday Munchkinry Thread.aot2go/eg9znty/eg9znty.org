The setting is the closest to Earth in the early 1900s (the decade).

You are an immortal being capable of three kinds of magic:

1. Creating white flames with any reasonable for a flame temperature (1.000-3.000 Â°C) within your field of vision. It requires energy; see below for details.

2. Shapeshifting without the energy cost, but shifting into and maintaining anything other than your default forms will require intense concentration; the transformation takes around half an hour. Said default forms are a middle-aged human female and a large (at least fifteen meters at the withers) white dragon. The dragons are not native to the setting. You start as a human female.

3. Summoning a sniper rifle (again, not native to the setting) for a neglegible amount of energy. The rifle fires magical bullets with an also neglegible cost in energy. The rifle dissapears after two hours and twenty-seven minutes and has to be resummoned. The bullets dissapear seconds after the hit.

Your enegy reserve has two limits: after reaching the first one you temporarily become mortal, while after reaching the second you are unable to use magic at all; you can produce around 100 km^{2} of flames in an instant before hitting the first limit, then around 15 km^{2} before hitting the second one. As for the bullets, you can fire well over a million before hitting the first limit. Your energy reserve takes around 24 hours to restore after being depleted completely.

The problem: you have around two months to neutralize (but *not* kill) a leader of a small magical cult. Members of the cult use very basic spells which can be safely ignored, but the leader can, by slightly concentrating, produce a water-like substance from any part of her body which can instantly heal wounds and undo damage to the surroundings. You are not sure how large is her energy reserve, but it allows her to /at least/ grow back all the limbs five times in a row.

If the leader dies, you instantly lose. Nobody would kill her on purpose, though, and she definitely won't commit suicide to make you lose. After two months you /might/ lose instantly at any moment, but you are not sure when exactly.

You don't care about casualties and collateral damage.

(Elaboration on the "neutralize" part: the leader must become unable to produce the magical substance.)
