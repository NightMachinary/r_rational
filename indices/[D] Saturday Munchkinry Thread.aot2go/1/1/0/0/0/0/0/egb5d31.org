A spends some time in Alice's body B spends some time in Bob's body

They possess Carl. ~50% of A and B's memories in reverse chronological order are stored in Carl. They have recent memories as Alice and Bob that are different, which are kept. As A and B were competing over brainspace, ~50% of the new memories were kept. A and B have shared memories and so when they compete for the rest of the brain, it is filled with these doubled memories.
