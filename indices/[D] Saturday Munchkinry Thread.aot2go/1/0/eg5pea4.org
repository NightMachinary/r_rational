I wouldn't use this on other people really. It sounds like it's equivalent of killing folks. What I would use it for though is to make clones and transfer my memories into it and then killing myself to live forever at the cost of a baby every 80 year. It is still problematic but at least the baby doesn't lose any memories and when it's cloned there nobody is feeling attached to it changing.

If I ended up deciding it anyway I would make sure that all copies I'd make would keep a GPS on them at all time, have one of them create a program that tracked positions and gave alerts if people came close. I would also figure out how to keep or grow brains and keep backups of each of my copies' mental states in case something did happen. You could probably do some voting hacks and vote clones of yourself into various political positions. Actually, scratch that, if you believe that you yourself are superior to other people just take over the world by making everyone into you.

If I were fighting against someone like that I would send a missile in and always stay 1km away from said person. I would find out if that person have any trauma/phobia and exploit that all clones would have the same triggers. I would kidnap a clone and have psychologists make detailed profile. If things were bad enough I would resort to torture since each clone have all sensitive information of the original. Now I know the passwords/secrets/safehouses/patterns of the original and can probably defeat him with those.
