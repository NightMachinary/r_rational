I'm confused by your third paragraph.

When a clone walks within 100m of me I die and take over their body?

When a clone walks within 100m of another clone what happens?

Anyway my thought is to divide the world into quadrants and get a clone in every one. A 100m circle each with a 100m gap for safety. Eventually get gps tags on everyone so we'rel even safer.

I would obviously take over significant figures. Though full control is limited by proximity, but I'd eventually set up digital democracy so I could get full control.
