You can copy your mind in total (including memories, values, qualia and this ability) into any number of humans within a kilometre of yourself.

Physical coordination and unique knowledge or skills held by those humans is not overwritten - knowledge is retained to the degree that the human brain is able to store it, with older memories being dumped first in the overwriting process.

Instances of your qualia and values will be lost if two bodies containing it come within 100m of another, including the original body. In clones, this results in the original body's mind taking over again, along with your memories and this ability. Any lost knowledge does not return. In the original body, this results in brain death.

What communication methods would be useful in identifying and coordinating yourselves to avoid being overwritten and maximise your values? How else could this ability be used to maximum utility?

Reverse munchkin scenario: competing against a being with this ability (you may or may not have this power too, it is whatever's more interesting).
