As I see it, there are two tasks at hand: capturing the leader and neutralizing her.

For the capture, given that neither the underlings nor the leader herself can damage us and our dragon form should be capable of carrying her away into our base, the main problem is finding her. Neither of the three abilities is useful here, unless we can maintain conversation while shapeshifted, so we'll stick to old-fashioned bribery, stalking cult members and other methods. We already know her gender and ability, though, so whatever helped us find that out will most probably enable us to find her position. Then, we transform into a dragon, fly to that location and carry her to our base.

Depending on what counts as 'damage', imprisoning her by immobilization should be trivial.

Unfortunately, the neutralization is a much more difficult task and will require further knowledge on the nature of the ability. If it's bound to an organ in her body or some higher entity that granted the power, then it's an issue of finding the source and eliminating it; if we just need her to run out of energy once, forcing her to heal people or they die should do the trick.

As for avoiding detection by authorities, none of the abilities help us there, so we'll just set up the base in a secret location and transform back from dragon form somewhere far away from it; also, unless someone takes a photograph or the leader is under police surveillance, nobody will believe that a dragon appeared and carried her off somewhere.
