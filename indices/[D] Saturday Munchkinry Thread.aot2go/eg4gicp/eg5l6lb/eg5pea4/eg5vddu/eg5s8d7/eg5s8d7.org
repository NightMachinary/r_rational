If the original me was amoral enough to kill people by overwriting their minds with my own, the obvious next step would be my clones being amoral enough to kill the original me to save themselves. After all, the more clones the original me creates, the more likely two of them will come within 100m of each other and immediately lose their minds to their original bodies'. Best to kill the original me immediately to remove that problem.

QED let's never use this ability ever, regardless of your moral alignment.

As for fighting against this ability, that's easy enough: just make people group up. In cities, plenty of people will come within 100m of you every day, and even if you never leave your house your neighbours will probably come within 100m of you. This makes it really hard for the adversary to use this ability, because any two people in range of the ability that are within 100m of each other immediately regain their minds. And if anyone is within 100m of the adversary? Instant brain death.

So take two steps: First, move around in groups so you can quickly regain your minds if they are overwritten. Make protocols to ensure that members of your anti-adversary force come within 100m of each other member very often, to ensure there can't be too many clones of the adversary hidden among your own forces.

Second, get camouflage and stealth. The best way to kill the adversary is to secretly be within 100m when the ability is used. Build underground tunnels, pretend to be a corpse, hide within piles of trash, etc. One careless use of this ability while a member is within 100m and you win.
