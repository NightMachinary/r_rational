So two copies of myself could "contest" a body cooperatively to make a third copy that has none of the host's original memories? That would help because if two such copies come too close, it produces two potatoes instead of two new copy mages.

With some more effort, I could make copies that can coexist: Get enough bodies/power to strongarm someone to a remote facility, get him the ability, force him to contest with one of me on another of me to produce a fusion of him and me, repeat with the fusion to create ever closer copies of me, until I have a whole bunch of copies that are close enough to me to have my personality and priorities, but not exactly close enough to cause resonance. If getting too close is enough to cause resonance, strongarm more people to increase the number of dimensions within which I can surround myself in mindspace.
