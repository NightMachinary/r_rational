Yes but a LOT of your memories could be lost. The new individual would have an equal amount of clone-experience memories from both of you and double-ups of every other memory from before cloning working down in reverse chronological order. Risky as you may run out of space and have amnesia

Edit: However. You could possess genius minds and combine them into a new individual. You then possess the new individual. They lose all the double up memories to store a copy of your original mind leaving behind memories and skills of the genius minds (minus a little noise as the new original you would have slightly more memories than the first set of clones). With a lot of planning and recursion, this could lead to a very smart individual coalescing.
