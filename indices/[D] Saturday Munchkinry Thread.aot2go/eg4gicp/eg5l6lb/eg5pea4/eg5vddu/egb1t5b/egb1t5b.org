You're not inately aware of everyone in that radius. There isn't any special interaction if someone else's clone comes too close.

Consciousnesses are nested with an arbitrarily high limit. If you are in Person A's body and are overwritten by Person B‘s clone, Your mind is treated as the “original” which will take over in the event of B getting too close to another B. B can come close to copies of you without nested-you being lost (but if B were to lose control of the body and you took over you would immediately also lose control for A to come back)

Regarding a body under contest, both minds start overwriting the brain at a similar rate (determined by concentration of the overwriter) and whoever has the most memories in the brain at the end takes control (leaving no memories of the original mind, deleting any minds nested in the loser). If it was exactly even, whoever started first has precedence. If it was even and at the exact same time, the controlling consciousness is a fusion of the two treated as a new individual with no nested minds and no Ability.
