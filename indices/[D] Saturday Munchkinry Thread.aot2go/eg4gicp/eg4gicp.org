You are granted a moderate wish that can grant you anything that is reasonably within current human capability, but not anything beyond that.

So for instance, you could wish to be as rich as the richest person, or have the maximum life expectancy humans have ever achieved, or be as strong as the strongest human ever or be elected president of a country, or build a majestic palace, etc.

But you cannot wish for things outside of human capability, such as becoming god, or building an FAI, or gaining knowledge no other human possesses, or getting more wishes, or traveling backwards in time, or building a galactic empire, etc.

What do you do with your moderate wish?
