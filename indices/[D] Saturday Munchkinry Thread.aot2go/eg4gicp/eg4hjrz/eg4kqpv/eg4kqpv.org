Wouldn't that turn all humans into clones of each other? Granted beauty is subjective, so getting maximum beauty won't make humans all look identical, but everyone is still going to lose a lot of what makes them unique.

Also I imagine lots of people would resent having their minds and bodies magically modified, even if the result is higher performance.
