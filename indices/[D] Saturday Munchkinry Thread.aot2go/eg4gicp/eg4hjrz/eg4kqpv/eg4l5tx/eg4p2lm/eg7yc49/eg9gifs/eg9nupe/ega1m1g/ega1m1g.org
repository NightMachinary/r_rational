There is a sense in which I hold my parents accountable, I suppose, but most people are hardly aware that there's a natalism debate, let alone capable of describing the anti-natalist argument. There's no point in even mentioning my feelings to them, unless perhaps they were somehow considering having yet another kid.

That said, if my birth had been made possible only through some kind of human sacrifice (akin to the destruction of the original personality that is replaced by the modified one) then I would probably have to do something about that, though I'm not sure what it would be.
