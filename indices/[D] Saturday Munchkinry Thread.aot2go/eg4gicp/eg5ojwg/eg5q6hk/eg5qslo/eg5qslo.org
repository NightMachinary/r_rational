All good ideas. I looked at Forbes and it seemed to imply that the richest man only have around 110 billion $ which honestly surprises me. We of course won't just lose all of the 44 trillion, clever use would give some return back but maybe solving global warming won't actually be feasible. I'd probably spend the majority of the money to buy up literally all ads in the western world and sculpt the mind of people to care about EA issues.
