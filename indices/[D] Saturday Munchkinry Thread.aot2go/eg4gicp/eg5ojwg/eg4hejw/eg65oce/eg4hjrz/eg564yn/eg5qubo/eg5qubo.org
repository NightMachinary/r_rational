  Am I immediately going to get shot down if my wish includes a repeated result where each iteration is powered up by the previous?
#+end_quote

Yes, because that is like having multiple wishes, since the second iteration takes effect after the first. And it's completely overpowered because you could wish for human capability to be increased by the best method within human capability, repeated over and over until humanity becomes god-like beings that rule the entire universe.

Wishes along the lines of "I want people to believe me" work to some extent by making the things you say seem like they come from the most believable person ever. Which would get you plenty of believers, but wouldn't let you convince literally everyone. Nor would it let you convince plenty of people about something obviously wrong, so if you said "1+1 = 3", not many people would believe that.
