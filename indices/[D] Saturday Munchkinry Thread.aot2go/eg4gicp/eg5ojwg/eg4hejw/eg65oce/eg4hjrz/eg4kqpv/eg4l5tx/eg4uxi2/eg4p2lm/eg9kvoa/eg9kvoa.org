I'm saying the simple way to complete the wish (aside from making this world vanish, and another appear in its place which meets the conditions) is

1. All humans die. (As opposed to all humans are modified.) Some genies might stop here - every living human does possess the maximum in X - there aren't any which don't that are still alive. (Or just most humans die - those which don't possess the maximum.)
2. The genetic profiles and the infrastructure (the cloning vats) are designed and implemented.
3. Mass production begins.
4. etc.*

*This might take the form of the Matrix - while try to create a real world with maximum happiness, when you can go digital? In fact, why have physical humans at all?
