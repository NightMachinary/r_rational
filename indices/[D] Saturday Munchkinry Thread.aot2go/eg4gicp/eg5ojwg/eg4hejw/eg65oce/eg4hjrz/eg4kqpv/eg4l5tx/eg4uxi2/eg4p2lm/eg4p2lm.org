  "1)" No, all the old people are dead because maximum happiness.

Ah the old "they can't be unhappy if we force happiness upon them" trick.

  3) Does there exist a set of magical modifications which (if conducted instantaneously and painlessly) you wouldn't resent receiving?
#+end_quote

I imagine this varies from individual to individual. Personally, I'd be okay with most positive modifications, as long as they don't touch my mind. Mental modifications I would consider on a case by case basis because many seem quite likely to cause death of personality. For instance, if the empathy mod works by making my thought patterns more similar to other humans, I would very much resent receiving it.
