I wish I could speak, read, write and otherwise understand all languages that are spoken and understood by living humans.

This is well within human capability, but at the same time very useful; merely translating scientific papers between languages could encourage a lot more research in areas of interest to me, for example.

It also gives me backup employment as a translator if necessary.
