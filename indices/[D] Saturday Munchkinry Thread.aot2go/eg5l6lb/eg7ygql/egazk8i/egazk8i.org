Sorry for the unclear writing.

You overwrite Bob. There isn't enough space in his head so the first 23 years of his memories are lost. The rest of the brain is filled with your memories. Bob's are deleted as you write new memories to the brain.

Oops you got too close to another of your selves. Bob's mind returns and takes control of his body. He can't remember his first 23 years but has all the other memories that are in his brain, ie: yours and whatever was left of his. He also has your ability.

If the original you gets close to a clone, it has no other mind to take over after its is deleted. The body immediately shuts down and dies.
