Am I aware of everyone in a kilometre radius, so I can target them?

If two of me come too close, the former hosts get the ability? What if different people's clones come too close?

If there's a chain of people 900 metres apart at each step, one end is clones of me and the other is clones of a rival, what determines who can eventually take over the whole chain?
