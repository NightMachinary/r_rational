The principle of your solution is quite sound though.

Every human being needs to be within 100m of every other human being at all times to ensure only a single clone exists.

If you do just daily passes then they can just jump minds.

So first group the entire world into 100m squares, spread them all out so they are over 1km apart.

Then you bring groups together. If two people snap out of it then you're good. If neither group has anyone snap out then you're in trouble. You can't tell if there's only one or if there's none.

You also can't take the groups apart because the moment they're out of 100m range they can just take over another one.

OK. Randomly bring groups together and apart. Make sure they walk 1km away multiple times (out of the range).

Bring multiple groups together and apart randomly.

Eventually you win. Or they had an odd number of clones and you don't win.

But if they never use this ability you can't find them so...
