Everyone possesses the clone ability so if your original made clones then so would your clone. Your logic doesn't work since it would mean your clone would kill itself.

Both the clone and the original have the same value proposition, what on earth is changing between creating the clone that would make the original suddenly want to kill the clone?

Also one careless use removes one clone/original , that's hardly winning. Presumably by the time you started grouping people they have a few million clones scattered across the globe.
