Way late, and a break from the main story, but I'm back. And speculating about what might go wrong for someone with Breakpoint's powers should keep readers busy for a bit 8-)

Breakpoint's danger sense was inspired by that of a well known arachnid-themed superhero. His weakness detection was inspired by a lesser known hero--Karnak of the Inhumans, with nuances from King Peacock of Top Ten.

Enjoy 8-)
