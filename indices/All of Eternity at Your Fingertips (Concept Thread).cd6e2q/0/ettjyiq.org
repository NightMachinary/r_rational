I'm not familiar with QQ and the msg says that my post is pending moderator approval so I'll just doublepost it here.

I think this could be pretty interesting. I think the road to world domination would lie in a mix of witch magic and compulsion, and honestly I think we can do this without being capital Evil.

I vote for us starting with very little, as those stories are the most personally compelling to me. Perhaps with a compulsion from our master that we have to circumvent?

Locate a wealthy person close to death and make a compulsion to give you their fortune after death. Do this a few times and we now have a sizable sum to work with. Spend the money to buy stakes in some big companies so we can A) continue growing our power and B) control decisions. We can then hire investigators to research the occult which hopefully will lead us to witches. Then we want to hire scientific researchers to understand witch magic until we can use it to fight Originals without dying or turn ourselves into something with the same power/stronger as an Original. Or something.
