Most improtant Question, would the main charachter be from our world and know about Vampire Diaries? Or would the quest just be about a random generic vampire who was freshly turned. Because one has a lot more advantages than the other.

I also think depending on when this takes place the best thing would be to would be to fully disregard the canon Vampire Diaries plot(beyond things that happened before, and those that are inevitable like the existence of dopplegangers). Because it absolutely made no sense how Vali changed so many things to the point that his followers controlled the governmentfor generations, and yet not only turned human society out to be excatly the same, the entire setting of mystic falls was the same with the same people being born with with same names, ages and personal relationships.

Actions like what Vali did in the past should definetly have consequences, that should render the Setting pretty much unrecognizable a thousand years later.

There is also the existence of Michael limiting the amount of attention a vampire can direct uppon himself without geting him to visit and burn down the place you live in. Vali only got away with it because he was Michaels favourite son and the only one he didnt hunt. Like sure its easy to think of doing things like compelling rich powerful people and using vampire blood to wipe out diseases and have people worship you, but any number of witches can and would take you out, unless you start turning vampires to increase your numbers, but even their loyaltly isnt guaranteed and their action would probably draw the attention of Michael who is extremly hard to beat. Thats why I think the best time would be

Of course you could still try, but this really seems like any attempt to munchkin the setting as a non original has a high chance of killing you. Otherwise you could have the quest take place shortly after Abby takes out Michael, but that would only give you a little above a decade before canon starts and a bunch of factions try to enact plans that could destroy the world.

I would honestly be interested in reading this, but I think it would be rather hard to write and I really doubt that it would be viable as quest wihout the players choices causing the MC to die(players in Quest usually choose things that sound cool, instead of doing the reasonable thing).
