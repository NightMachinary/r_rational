  Not much opportunity for munchkinry if the MC doesn't know world history.

There is a certain advantage in just being a inteligent person who is not controlled by tropes, like the only attempt to use science to enhance vampires in the series showed [[https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Augustine_Vampire][great results]](even if it was used against vampires), but was never mentioned again.

  You didn't complete this part?
#+end_quote

I think I accidentally deleted it, but now that you confirmed that ths is a SI(kind of), Id think that the best time would be the 1800s since we actually know enough about the plot and locations of important charachers in that era so the MC doesent die, its also not that long ago that you cant make some prediction about how things could turn out, and there is enough time to make reasonable preperations for threats to come, its also one of the earliest times where you have a chance to get a daylight ring(but I suppose it would be interestng to read something where the vampire actually has to stay out of the daylight).

  He creates many plausible failure modes, and adds tension to the story.
#+end_quote

I suppose so, but I think that even without Michael there is still enough tension with the challenges a ambitious generic vampire would face like,

1. securing a regular source of human blood without drawing attention and killing too many people
2. dealing with the vampire weaknesses like sunlight, vervain, or needing to be invited to enter a house
3. Witches generally disliking vampires and being hesistant to work with one and interfering with plans
4. Werewolves seem to hate vampires quite a lot and until receently there seem to have been quite a lot of them.
5. Vampire Hunter magicaly enhanced and mundane ones, considering the amount of weaknesses vampires have any group of humans who know about vampires pose a real threat, and are likely to oppose a vampire expanding their power near them
6. Other vampires(especially older ones and large groups) who want to take control, eliminate a potential threat, or merely live and behave reckless.
7. Spirits actively limiting what kind of magic can be used

The problem with Michael compared to the others is not only how hard he is to kill, but that even if you kill him you not only risk the wraith of the original family(he was still their father after all), you also removed the reason why the Original had for not settling down and expanding their powers. Like the first thing in canon Klaus does after he killed his father, is to create an army of hybrids.

  I agree. And as a quest master I would be perfectly okay with writing a bad end.
#+end_quote

Which is perfectly fine, but I think there needs to be something to be improve the odds, like having the MC be part of a already established groups of vampires, or maybe a mortal background that gives them some power like being the child of some politician/noble or maybe be related to witches and acess to their Grimoire.
