  Most improtant Question, would the main charachter be from our world and know about Vampire Diaries? Or would the quest just be about a random generic vampire who was freshly turned. Because one has a lot more advantages than the other.

Not much opportunity for munchkinry if the MC doesn't know world history.

  I also think depending on when this takes place the best thing would be to would be to fully disregard the canon Vampire Diaries plot(beyond things that happened before, and those that are inevitable like the existence of dopplegangers). Because it absolutely made no sense how Vali changed so many things to the point that his followers controlled the govermount for generations, and yet not only turned human society out to be excatly the same, the entire setting of mystic falls was the same with the same people being born with with same names, ages and personal relationships. Actions like what Vali did in the past should definetly have consequences, that should render the Setting pretty much unrecognizable a thousand years later.

I agree. The butterfly effect is very real.

  There is also the existence of Michael limiting the amount of attention a vampire can direct uppon himself without geting him to visit and burn down the place you live in. Vali only got away with it because he was Michaels favourite son and the only one he didnt hunt. Like sure its easy to think of doing things like compelling rich powerful people and using vampire blood to wipe out diseases and have people worship you, but any number of witches can and would take you out, unless you start turning vampires to increase your numbers, but even their loyaltly isnt guaranteed and their action would probably draw the attention of Michael who is extremly hard to beat. Thats why I think the best time would be
#+end_quote

You didn't complete this part? But I like that Michael is there. He creates many plausible failure modes, and adds tension to the story.

 

#+begin_quote
  Of course you could still try, but this really seems like any attempt to munchkin the setting as a non original has a high chance of killing you.
#+end_quote

That's intentional. :V

  I would honestly be interested in reading this, but I think it would be rather hard to write and I really doubt that it would be viable as quest wihout the players choices causing the MC to die
#+end_quote

I agree. And as a quest master I would be perfectly okay with writing a bad end.

 

#+begin_quote
  players in Quest usually choose things that sound cool, instead of doing the reasonable thing
#+end_quote

I agree, and I've actually written a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cdiql5/quests_and_the_intelligence_of_hiveminds/][post on this]].
