The issue regarding Michael is that the only way to make him less of a threat is to set up the MC as an Original but if you do that, the journey becomes trivial. Either the MC is an Original or they're not, and that difference represents a discontinuous jump in difficulty. Frankly, I'd prefer the non Original version. That said, I'll look at progression mechanics to perhaps lessen the difficulty.
