I dont think turning the MC into a original is required, you could just give him some form of advantage specifically against Michael, maybe have him aquire some kind of magical item that allows him to know the location of michael(or maybe of all originals), locator spells were very common in the series so its not that far fetched.

I dont really think a progression mechanic is really necessary since with age the MC would automatically become stronger and aquire allies, knowledge and magical items. The problem would be to get started in the first place, which is why I think they should start with some advantage, that is linked to their origin instead. Damon and Steffon for example had plenty of advantages even though they were regular vampires, when they were turned they were rich, had already knowledge of vampires, had daylight rings, and most importantly a place in a family of vampire hunters which even allowed Damon become the leader of founders council a hundred and fifty years later.I am not saying that the MC needs quite that many advantages, but even one in addition to the Meta Knowledge would highly increase their chance of survival.
