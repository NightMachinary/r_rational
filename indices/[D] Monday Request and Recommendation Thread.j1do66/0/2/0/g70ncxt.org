I did read it on my kindle as it's far too long to read on a normal display, so I made an ePub version and I can edit it here tomorrow if I remember.

If you have access to a computer and prefer doing it yourself, you only need to install this extension (works on both a Chrome and Firefox): [[https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub][WebToEpub | Github]] Though I recommend you actually use the web store for your browser if you are not too sure how to install from source.

Then just go to some page where they have the full novel, like this one: [[https://novelfull.com/lord-of-the-mysteries.html][Lord of the Mysteries | Novelfull.com]]. Just make sure you see the index starting at Chapter 1 (else you'll need to reorder chapters and it's a pain) and click the WebToEpub extension on your browser. Then all that is needed is to click download and wait.

Edit: Download ePub with the entire novel: [[http://www.filedropper.com/lordofthemysteries-cuttlefishthatlovesdiving][Lord of the Mysteries ePub | FileDropper]]
