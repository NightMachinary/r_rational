I've just finished reading Lord of the Mysteries today and I'd say it's definitely up there in my greatest of all-time list along with Mother of Learning, Legend of Sun Knight, and maybe Ballad of the Desert.

What I like about the novel: the story progression, world-building, and character development. What I don't like about it is the quality of the translations, the sometimes unnecessary complexity, and the uneven overall pacing.

Regarding the world-building, after finishing Book 1, the Author said that he still has some unreleased characters, (e.g. the whole member of Aurora Order from Mr B to Mr Z. He said that not all characters he created would come to play. Their purpose was just to make the world's background and structure grander and more realistic.

Regarding the pacing, the first few volumes, the main character power progression is relatively slow. Maybe he levelled up one sequence a volume. But the pace is really picked up near the end of book one where he suddenly goes from sequence 2 to 1, then suddenly having an apotheosis ritual to become sequence 0, and even trying to accommodate uniqueness to be above the sequences and become Lord of the Mysteries in less than 300 chapters. The weird thing is, I feel like the fast pace doesn't seem to be forced.

For those who have read the story (or doesn't mind spoiler) and would like to find more about the novel, I suggest reading the english translation of an interview with the novel Author [[https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteries/comments/h8tm5y/we_interviewed_the_og_lord_of_the_mysteries/][here]].
