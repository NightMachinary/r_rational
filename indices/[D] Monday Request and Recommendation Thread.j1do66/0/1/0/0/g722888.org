Maybe it isn't relevant for this story, but I wouldn't call it a cancel culture reaction to skip a story if people say it's somewhat transphobic. The situation is less like boycotting an actor for unethical behaviour and more like avoiding a random restaurant because you heard a rumour the waiters are rude. You might as well just go to a different restaurant instead of risking something minor spoiling a nice experience.
