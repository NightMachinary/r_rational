Has anyone else here read Lord of the Mysteries, and what's your opinion of it? It's the biggest hit on [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]], and it's well deserved. Translations can be rough at times, but it's a fascinating series, surprisingly good for a Chinese web novel.

The characters seem pretty rational, the MC always uses divination to check for danger, thinks over the problems and scenarios, and always prepares for everything. He's never too rash either, and avoids clear traps and uncertain situations. It's especially impressive in a mystical world like in LotM, where evil gods, mysticism, and other hidden existences are common.

The worldbuilding and setting of this novel is pretty unique among all the ones I've read so far. It takes place in an industrial revolution-esque world with heavy Cthulu mythos and SCP inspirations. There are mystical elements in the form of the 22 pathways, each with their own Sequence powers, like Seers with learning and twisting Fate, Lawyers distorting laws and Order, Spectators that can influence the mind domain and control imagination, Sailors that control the sea, and so much more.

I've almost finished the novel, and it is amazing. The fights are all really creative and make use of all the abilities really well, which is especially impressive when there are abilities where an opponent can steal someone's destiny, distort order(for instance, you can grab someone 45 meters away and physically grab them by distorting the distance from 45 meters to be 45 centimeters), turn into a wraith and teleport from one reflective surface to another, and so much more. All the abilities and Sequences are concretely laid out and there is relatively little bullshit in their definitions and power scaling.

It's almost certainly the best mystical novel I've read, it excellently uses these elements and incorporates them into the novel. When the powerful figures like Kings of Angels, the Creator, and those even stronger are revealed, their influence and the fear they generate is palpable. You really understand why there are sayings like "Do not look at "Him" directly," or why it's a bad idea to randomly summon or pray to these entities, or even /knowing/ of them.

The writing is surprisingly good as well. I'm terrible at writing reviews and explaining things, but the author can write great emotional moments, emphasize the horror of mysticism, make every character feel meaningful, and truly make the novel feel alive. I was especially amazed by his writing in [[https://wuxiaworld.site/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries-novel/chapter-1335][Chapter 1335]], "I".

The horror and mystical elements are perfect. It really captures the horror and fear of SCP and the Cthulhu mythos. For instance, there's 0-05, a Sealed Artifact that's a quill. Anything feasible it writes will happen. Say the owner is surrounded and about to be killed. He could write "A strange and friendly spirit world creature appeared and helped him escape", and it could happen. You can basically control the actions of anyone around you and lead them to certain results without them ever knowing. It's truly fearsome and deadly in the hands of a foe. Not to mention the fact that it can write autonomously and will seek to kill it's owner through writing, and the fact that knowing of 0-05 will cause it to know of you as well. Or a Die of Probability that will randomly roll itself every hour, and the result will determine your luck. Even if you're a god, you could die on a peaceful day if you get a 1! Worse, leave it unsealed long enough and it will gradually grow in strength until it can affect the luck and fate of every living creature.

I'd expound on the Cthulhu Mythos influences, but they're all major plot reveals that deservedly earned and revealed, but rest assured they are incredibly impactful, both for the characters and the readers. The villains and antagonists are suitably terrifying. From the birth of an evil god's son, the descent of evil gods, Kings of Angels and true deities, they are all intelligent, mystical, and terrifying. One of the later antagonists is a guy that can create errors in things and steal just about everything. He can steal your destiny, and everyone you know wouldn't notice that you're gone and treat him as if he was you. He could steal the day and turn the night dark, and then bring out the day again during the night, or steal the distance between one place and another and instantly arrive there. He always has a monocle on his right eye, and it's incredibly terrifying, for both the characters and the reader, to wonder if that person, that corpse, or that animal could suddenly put on a monocle and turn into him right in front of you.

I think this sub would really enjoy Lord of the Mysteries, so if you haven't read it, I'd recommend it. And if you have read it, what are your opinions of it?
