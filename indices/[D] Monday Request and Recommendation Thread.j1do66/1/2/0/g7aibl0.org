Exactly what I was gonna say. The Curse of Chalion also fulfills most of OP's criteria. There's a general optimism about the problem, even if the situations that arise can be and /are/ terrible. The conflict has ties to the biggest beings in the world, but in the end it hinges on the more mundane problems. Cazaril is perhaps one of the kindest, and most unambiguously good, main character I've ever seen. Highly recommend.
