In general, I think that what you are describing is somewhat of a feature of webnovels in general. Because of the more episodic nature, the structure very often tends to follow the resolution of small problem to small problem, with a grander story behind it all.

So I don't know how many webnovels you have read, but I would advise you to look the best rated ones on Royal Road (their search system is quite good btw, recommend filtering for number of pages / rating / genre)
