I've found most of my favorites by complete and utter chance, and seen them recommended basically nowhere since. Anime is more a medium than a genre, and with that size come difficulties to coordinate for ratings and such. It doesn't help that the stigma it still carries makes it so only the most popular series, the ones that have already pierced the barrier, get recommended.

I'll rec Mugen no Ryvius, though it's kind of old and it shows.
