Diamond dogs by Alastair Reynolds is interesting. It's certainly not rationalist, it's about irrational behavior. It's about how people will fight tooth and nail for the chance to destroy themselves piece by piece for no apparent reward. Superficially it seems to have an anti-transhuman message I'd sooner compare it to some of those documentaries about doping in the Olympics. I also rather like it's descriptions and ideas.
