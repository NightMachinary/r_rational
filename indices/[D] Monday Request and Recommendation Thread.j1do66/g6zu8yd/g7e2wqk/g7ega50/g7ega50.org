From what I have heard regarding the fast pacing near the ending, the author said he couldn't take it slowly since that would compromise the intelligence of the main villains, and he'd rather have them competent than to have more chapters. Makes sense, devious and old monsters wouldn't just let potential threats power up to their level in peace, which is why Klein is constantly in danger. The pacing does still feel way too fast, and the powers and abilities at the end could use a lot more explanations.

The effort Cuttlefish put into the novel is phenomenal in terms of worldbuilding, it's a complete and detailed world, so much so that a lot of things are left out so it wouldn't clutter the novel, like the other members of the Aurora Order and the details of the other major countries, similar to Will Wight's writing process in Cradle where he keeps the volumes short for brevity and to cut off the chaff, but he still has a complete and detailed world and lore, which can be seen with all the lore tidbits he gives out in his occasional answers. Speaking of left out worldbuilding, LotM2 will supposedly take place in a different country, focusing on a different Pathway, Hunter, so it should add more to this wonderful world.

But yeah, for such a great story you can really feel how the translation barrier lowers its quality.
