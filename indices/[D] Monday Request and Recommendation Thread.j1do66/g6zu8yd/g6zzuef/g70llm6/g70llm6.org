I won't say your reasons for dropping it are invalid, as any reason is good enough, but I will say that the transphobia accusations are a touch overblown by certain "too sensible" parties.

I'm trying to say this as delicately as I can and it's certainly true that I, not being trans, can probably not fully grasp how damaging certain attitudes can be, but I think that taking a character's views of something happening in the story shouldn't necessarily compel a cancel culture reaction.

Mild spoilers ahead.

One of the pathways turns everyone using it into women at a certain sequence (there's also one that does the same but to men instead). This is seen by Klein as something he would never wish to do and weird in general, but that is one character's opinion and is perhaps influenced by the fact that the next sequence up requires one to basically control people through sex as a women (and the ones further up are unambiguously evil things like spreading plagues).

There is one true transgender character that we see in any detail, and she indeed uses this sequence to become a real woman. She is a pawn of another character and her fate is pretty grim but she is not bashed for being what she is (that I noticed anyway).

On the issue of this being a translation, that is indeed the case and you notice it, but I'll say that the pacing from book 2 onwards draws you in enough that you actually stop noticing it (except when he uses strange words like lampoon). For what it's worth, this is one of the best (non-published) translations out there.

On the ending, I'll only say that the last volume was rushed and it shows, but the author does plant the seeds for the breakneck pace for entire volumes. A slower pacing would be completely unbelievable considering what is going on in universe. Part of what makes LotM great is that the enemies are allowed to be as smart (or more) as the protagonist, and they will cheat and lie to stay ahead.

In a world where magic power is a strict pyramid (with each sequence being one pyramid), the number of places at the the top is limited by design and unseating someone is much harder than being the first to reach the throne.
