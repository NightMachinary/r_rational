A few obvious ones:

From the New World =>The Promised Neverland (somewhat similar premise/tone)

Psycho Pass => Madoka Magica, Fate Zero (same author)

Katanagatari => Monogatari (same author)

KlK: Gurren Lagann (same studio)

HxH => Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (similar tone and focus on a large cast)
