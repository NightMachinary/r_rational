Seconding Twig. Pact has a fascinating setting, but also a lot of pacing problems. I loved Ward but doing it back to back with Worm feels like a mistake (also would consider listening to We've Got Worm in the interim). Pale isn't done. Twig has a unique, very Wildbow setting, more nuanced characterization, and, more than the rest of his works, knows how to slow down.

I'd also suggest maybe not reading multiple Wildbow works in a row, he can be a bit exhausting. Maybe Mother Of Learning or Unsong. They're on the fluffier end for well-regarded web serials.
