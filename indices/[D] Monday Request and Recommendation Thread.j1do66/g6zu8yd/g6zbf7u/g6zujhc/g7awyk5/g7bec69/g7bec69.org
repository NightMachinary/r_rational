Neat! Open source contributions would be nice.

The site really could use HTTPS.

I also think the prior on its Bayesian ranking feels like it's too strong. Depending on if it knows when individual ratings were submitted, it could even be upgraded to a Kalman Filter to take into account the potential for drift in the community's tastes.

It'd also be good to be able to edit works and/or vote on edits, but I'm not volunteering for that, that's a total chore.
