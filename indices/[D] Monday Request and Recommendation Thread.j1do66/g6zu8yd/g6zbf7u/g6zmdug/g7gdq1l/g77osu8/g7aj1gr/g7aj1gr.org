The story is somewhat controversial in this subreddit, but imo Ar'Kendrythist absolutely fits. The problems the protagonist faces are almost always big and world-encompassing, but there is still focus and development given to solving the mundane problems. There are chapters that focus on Erick's community involvement, from farming to baking to finances. The big problems aren't taken care of through mundane means, but more often than not the reasons for the big problems are really human ones. And in the end, the story never quite loses the wonder at magic. It never turns into just another source of personal power.
