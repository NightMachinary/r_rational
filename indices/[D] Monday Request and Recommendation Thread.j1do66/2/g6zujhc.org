Last week someone linked [[http://rationalreads.com/][Rational Reads]], a recommendation engine for the sorts of stories this community likes. It looks like it would be a great resource, but it's a few years outdated and needs some attention. So that's my recommendation - go add some works you like and your ratings to that site. It only took me about 15 minutes to go through the entire archive rating everything I've read, and I found a few stories I'm interested in on the way.
