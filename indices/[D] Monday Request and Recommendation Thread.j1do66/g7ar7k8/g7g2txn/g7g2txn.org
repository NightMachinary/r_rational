[[https://anidb.net/][AniDB]] has been consistently useful although I tend to read the reviews and check the "similar anime" rather than scores. Also the front page for the currently popular, and for recommendations per decade, etc. The last minor masterpiece I saw was Chivalry of a Failed Knight, though the awkward fanservice made me cringe too much.
