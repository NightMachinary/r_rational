Starting an ep is probably one of the most effective ways to gauge quality. Most bad series reveal themselves pretty quickly.

If you like a particular director/writer/etc. check out their other stuff. If you get familiar with the source material pipeline, any new anime based on a manga/LN/VN won't surprise you because you'll have been aware of it for years beforehand.
