I recently played [[https://goose.game/][Untitled Goose Game]]. It's a game where you're a goose who has to bully people. There's no real plot to speak of, it's really short, and the controls aren't anything to speak about. However, it's also the most fun game I've ever played. I would highly recommend this game, especially if you want to entertain kids or anyone else who isn't a "gamer."
