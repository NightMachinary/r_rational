Goose Game is about understanding your environment and the people in it, and using experimentation to achieve your goals. There, I justified it in the context of the community.

(I've been playing Kaizo Mario hacks, which I do not have a rational justification for. Would still recommend to anyone who enjoys hard things. Quickie World 2 was particularly good, both in terms of quality and as a starter.)
