This sounds like a really good idea.. Canon Dumbledore is already a brilliant genius so you wouldn't even really have to change his characterization much.

I'm loving the idea of a young ambitious Dumbledore trying to optimize the world and explore magic. You could really delve deep into the HP magic system and its strange intricacies.

I especially like your suggestion to distance HP magic from muggle science. This is a big pet peeve of mine. Too often in fanfiction magic is explained away as exotic muggle physics or some other reductionist materialist explanation is used. I mean come on, its /magic/.

Like you I'm not much of a writer so hopefully someone else can write this story.
