Yeah. I am very much a victim of this.

I find that the best solution is to do some minor idea bouncing in big groups if you need a problem solved or want holes to be poked (as I intend to do in a couple of weeks with a vampire story I'm cooking up), but to then do the heavy idea pouncing with just one or two people.

The key, though, is that these need to be people who are going to be invested in your story and will be disappointed if they don't get to see it completed, in the same way that any of us will be disappointed if HPMOR stops updating tomorrow.

I started doing this to help with my problem of getting two-thirds through a novel and then deciding that it's horrible and needs to be thrown away and never, /ever/ talked about again, but I think it's a general-use tactic.
