Ideas are cheap. Writing stories is hard, especially if they're meant to be good stories with coherent themes and solid characterization, not to mention a plot. That's one of those unfortunate truths about the world (and more specifically, this subreddit).

I'm actually against posting ideas. I think that it short-circuits some of the mental reward mechanisms that get people writing stories. You start describing this awesome magic system that you thought up with all these neat analogs to how online communities work, and you're getting this low level stimulation that erodes at the desire to write it out into an actual story.
