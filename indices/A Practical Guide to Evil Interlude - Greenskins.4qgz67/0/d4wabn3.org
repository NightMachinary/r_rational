(I keep forgetting to comment on this: Throughout the series, I've found myself chronically distracted by how often terms for characters swap. Specifically, it feels as though both the narrator and each character has a bag of words for every other character, and is shuffling them every time they need to refer to that character. I've seen the protagonist think of an enemy formally as 'The Lone Swordsman' one moment and intimately as 'William' a few moments later. I've seen one distant character referred to two different ways so consistently that for a long time I thought they were two separate characters. Here, though not to the extent of some cases, I was reminded of this by seeing 'Robber'/'the tribune'/'the yellow-eyed tribune' which at the third name made me stop and try to remember what a tribune was and how many of them there were in the conversation. Then, 'Juniper'/'The legate'/'the Hellhound'/'The grim-faced orc'/'she'/'Juniper'/'the Hellhound'/'The legate'/'she'/'Juniper'/'she'/'The Hellhound'/'Juniper'/'she'/'Juniper'/'The Hellhound', during which I began to feel mentally dizzy from the swapping and remembered I'd wanted to mention this.

Overall, though I can understand the appeal of trying to keep the flow varied and interesting, and while this is effective when replacing a term every once in a while in an unambiguous context for extra emotional impact (such as using 'the Hellhound' just once in a section when she's about to do something particularly Hellhound-like), overdoing it feels as though you're playing a game of hot potato (which we then have to chase round and round) with their names to try to stop them from turning into Names.)
