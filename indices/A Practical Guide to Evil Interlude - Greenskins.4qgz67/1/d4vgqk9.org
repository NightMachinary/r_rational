I'm surprised no one has posted here yet!

Fantastic chapter; I was worried because it was an interlude that we would have another round of waiting for the battle to begin. Instead we had three fantastic POVs, all of which were unique and interesting.

I especially liked Robber's POV. I imagine that teaming up with goblins is like teaming up with a bunch of mini, green-skinned Deadpools. Hilarious to read about, good to have as allies (though a bit scary too, given their tendency to blow themselves up), and nothing less than terrifying to have as enemies. Too bad devils and the corrupted cannot feel fear...
