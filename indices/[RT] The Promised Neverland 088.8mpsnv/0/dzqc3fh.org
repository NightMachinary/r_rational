Yay, anime!

I had sort of hoped they'd use the explosive bullets as conventional weapons. That is, since they seem to be potent explosives, use one just to cause great harm and debilitate, then follow up with the second shot to the mask. Oh well.

With the thumbnail picture I was afraid they'd be skipping right ahead to reintroducing Norman, but it seems that was just since he'll be figuring in the anime they're promoting.
