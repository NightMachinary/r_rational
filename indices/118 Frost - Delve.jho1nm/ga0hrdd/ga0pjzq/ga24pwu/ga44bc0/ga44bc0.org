I'm a little bit miffed that Rain just completely writes off Ava. Like. She's Awakened. She's a better (and more experienced) mage than Kettle is at twice her age. She's a better shot than anybody in the company other than Amelia and Jamus. She's a /fire mage/ in an /ice dungeon/. And didn't she directly save Rain's bacon at least once during the Rank Shift? I distinctly remember her having a Big Damn Heroes moment. And Mlem is even also going.

But because she's a young person, he writes her off a even a possibility to go.

I know nobody is going to agree with me and I'll probably get downvoted to hell, but it makes me sad to see competent young people overlooked just for being young.
