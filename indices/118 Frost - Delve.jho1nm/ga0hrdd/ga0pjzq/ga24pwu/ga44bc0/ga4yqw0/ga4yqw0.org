If you can avoid bringing a preteen (isn't she like 8??) into a combat situation, don't bring them. That's nearly always going to be true. You're saying "just for being young", but it's very much a relevant factor.

Less experienced, less reliable under pressure, and good odds of lifelong trauma from being a combatant at a young age. Rain is from our world, and I'm guessing his opinion of child soldiers is not high. It would super OoC to take her if nothing else.
