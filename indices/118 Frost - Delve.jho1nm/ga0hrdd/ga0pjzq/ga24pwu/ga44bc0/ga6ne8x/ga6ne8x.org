Aw yeah, time to see what a balanced party with defined roles can do. This reminds me of the feeling I used to get before a big cape fight in Worm.

Also, I'm really glad to see that Delve hit #1 by followers! All the whining about pacing/leveling in this sub gave me the false impression that the wider community didn't enjoy the story. Happy to see I'm in the majority that don't have that problem.
