Just honestly forget about it for awhile. If you're checking these posts you'll find out when it's worth jumping back in. There will be 100+ comments on the chapter he raises his cap, or the chapter 8 before that one when people in here are all buying the patron to read it.

If you look there was a good run of early-mid chapters that all got 75+ comments, now we're sitting around like 25-40. Just watch these threads for the next few months.
