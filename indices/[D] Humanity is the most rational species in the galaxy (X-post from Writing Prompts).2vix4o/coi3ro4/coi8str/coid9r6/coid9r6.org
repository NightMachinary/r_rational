They are famous science fiction authors who've wrote about the Singularity and how humanity might behave during the Singularity.

Charles Stross's book [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][Accelerando]] is probably the one being referred to when they said 'Strossed'. His other books are good too.

'Eganed out' can be referring to any number of his books since a lot of them involve transhumanist themes and the Singularity or similar stuff. Check out the Wikipedia entry on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Egan#Novels][Greg Egan]] for a list of his novels.
