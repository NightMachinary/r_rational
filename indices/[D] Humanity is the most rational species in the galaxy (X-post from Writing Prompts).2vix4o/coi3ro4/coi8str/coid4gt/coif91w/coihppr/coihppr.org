Who's stupid, the character or the author?

Paul Durham has weak experimental evidence that his idea will work, and he's more than a little delusional. Stupid, but narratively acceptable.

Greg Egan was writing a story about the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis. It's only stupid if the MUH is... and all right, the MUH is pretty stupid, but at least it's asking the right questions.

Now, there are also at least two major plot holes in the book, which are tied so closely to the premise that I don't think they could be fixed without rewriting the entire thing. Those are indeed stupid.
