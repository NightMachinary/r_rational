Basically, deontology is defined by obligation to follow a set of rules, justified on a basis other than (or not solely by) their consequences. How these rules are justified and what they are is determined by what branch you adhere to, such as divine command theory, or Kantian, or whatever else.

Virtue ethics by contrast is defined by the character and intentions of moral actors, rather than universal principles. As a simple example, a deontologist might judge an act to be good if it does not treat another human being as a means to an end, while a virtue ethicist judges the act on whether it was motivated by justice, love, temperance, or whatever, and whether it was executed to the best of the actor's competence. Again, there are many varieties, such as Aristotelian, Confucian, agent-based, care ethics, and so on.

I say that your position is an agent-based one because it's based on you holding a set of character traits you find admirable, and then emulating a(n abeit fictional) person who possesses those traits. Feel free to disagree, there are fuzzy areas between the branches, like rules-based utilitarianism.

Which is great. The most sophisticated moral system in the world doesn't amount to jack shit unless it motivates its adherents to do good.
