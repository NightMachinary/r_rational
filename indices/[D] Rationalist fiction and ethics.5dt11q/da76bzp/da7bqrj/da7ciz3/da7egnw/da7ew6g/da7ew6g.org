That sounds an awful lot like "beliefs that predict reality, predict what I'm going to experience, are more useful".

I think you imagine prediction as a bit magical, instead of the the more mundane examples. The belief in gravity helps you predict the behavior of a falling ball.

Repeated experience and observation is another way of saying that a hypothesis has predictive power.

It doesn't mean xanatos pileups.

When we say a belief needs to have predictive power, it's not how I think you're imagining it. That's where the "bayesian" thing comes in. Percentages, not certainties.

I'm not explaining it as well as "making beliefs pay rent in anticipated experiences", but hopefully that explains what I'm talking about more or less.
