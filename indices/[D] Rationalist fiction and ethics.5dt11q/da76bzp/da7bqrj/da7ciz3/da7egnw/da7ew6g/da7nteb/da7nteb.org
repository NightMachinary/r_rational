  When we say a belief needs to have predictive power, it's not how I think you're imagining it. That's where the "bayesian" thing comes in. Percentages, not certainties.

I do think like that. And your first bit is clearly explained, thank you.

I don't want to read the HPMoR spoiler.

I suppose the phrasing 'predictive power' isn't an epistemically useful way for me to think about things. I'd rather not internalize that paradigm, especially since I've arrived at the same place.

Thanks for explaining.
