I would love to know more! Here in Western Australia Mormonism is not exactly widespread. I must confess that my knowledge of Mormonism comes from: Fallout New Vegas, cursory reading of the first Mormon website on google search, and some anecdotal stories about Joseph Smith. If you wouldn't mind, would you mind telling me what the central tenets of Mormonism are?
