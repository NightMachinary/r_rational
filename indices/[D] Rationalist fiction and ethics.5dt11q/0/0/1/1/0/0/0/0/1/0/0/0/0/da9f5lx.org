  do they still have these plates
#+end_quote

Unfortunately not (unfortunate for scientific inquiry, at least). It appears that the angel who showed him where to find the plates was also responsible for keeping them safe, and when Joseph was finished translating them, the angel took them back.

Since the metal used in making the plates was apparently some alloy of gold (probably because of its durability and ease of engraving), security of the plates was actually a significant issue, with many attempts at theft being narrowly thwarted.

However, there were 11 witnesses who signed statements that they saw the plates. [[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/three][Three]] stated that they were shown the plates by an angel, and heard the voice of God telling them that the plates were genuine, while the other [[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/eight][eight]], on another occasion, simply hefted them, examined them, and passed them around. Their statements are printed at the start of every copy of the book.
