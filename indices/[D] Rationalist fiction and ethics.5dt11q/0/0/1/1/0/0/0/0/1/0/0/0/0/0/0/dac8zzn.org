Hmm...how do you measure trustworthiness? They were longtime associates of Joseph Smith, not strangers he pulled off the street; whether that makes them more reliable (because they were under more scrutiny) or less (because they might be biased by association with him), I'll leave to you. I don't know all of their personal histories, but I gather that they were known and generally respected within their communities. Martin Harris was a wealthy gentleman farmer, and Oliver Cowdery was a schoolteacher.

What I can say is that all of the three witnesses later became disaffected and were excommunicated from the church, along with several of the eight witnesses, and only a few returned - but none of them is known to have ever denied their testimony. Indeed, David Whitmer (who did not return to the church), near the end of his life, made a public statement in the newspaper affirming his testimony of the Book of Mormon, in response to allegations that he had denied it. So even when they felt no loyalty to Joseph personally, they were still apparently convinced of what they saw.

Ultimately, though, the best test of the Book of Mormon's truthfulness is contained in the book itself. First, does it teach true principles that help people to become better (eg more focused on what matters, more concerned with others' welfare, more understanding) than they were before? And second, the book gives an open promise that we can receive confirmation of its truthfulness directly from God, if we are willing to meet the conditions.
