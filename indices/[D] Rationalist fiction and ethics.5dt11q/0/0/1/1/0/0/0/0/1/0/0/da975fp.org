  What were Joseph Smith's claims and evidential support?
#+end_quote

Er...I think I've already addressed a fair chunk of that above. But in more detail - he stated that a number of heavenly messengers visited him over time, and gave him directions, including:

- A personal visit from God and Jesus Christ, when he was fourteen, instructing him (in answer to his question at the time) not to join any existing church;
- An angel, several years later, directing him to the location where the Book of Mormon (engraved in an ancient language, on metal plates) was buried, along with a device that assisted him in translating it into English;
- John the Baptist, and later three of Jesus' original Apostles (Peter, James, and John) giving him priesthood authority;
- Various other messengers and visions (mostly related to directing the activities of the church and revealing doctrinal principles) at various times.

The most visible evidence is the Book of Mormon itself; whether or not it is genuine pretty much determines whether his whole account is genuine. He certainly couldn't have legitimately translated anything from an ancient language /without/ external assistance of some kind, and moreover the text itself speaks about the man who would bring it to the world, saying that he would be Joseph the son of Joseph (which Joseph Smith Jr was). So he stands or falls with the book.

Other kinds of evidence are generally much harder to quantify (such as impact on individual lives), or not demonstrable to others (such as personal revelation), but if there are particular kinds of evidence you'd expect a prophet to produce, I'm happy to discuss.

Although actually, the above-mentioned types of evidence, while not demonstrable to others, can still be reproducible. There's a good discussion in the [[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.17-43#16][32nd chapter of Alma]].
