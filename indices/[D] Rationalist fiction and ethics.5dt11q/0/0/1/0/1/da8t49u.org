To be honest, I don't go to /quite/ that extreme (I would defend myself or others from injury, etc.), but I can kind of see their point. I've thought about it, and decided that if someone broke into my house, I'd talk to them, help them get what they wanted, and call the police afterwards (in large part because their showing up could trigger a robber to take a hostage i.e. me).

But... well, the reason for my behaving that way is more because of my personality and the fact that few people are psycho/sociopaths, even robbers. I don't have the build that would be capable of physically restraining them, and even if I did I wouldn't feel right to do so over /property/ -- it can always be replaced, where I could do serious damage bludgeoning someone over the head with a crutch or whatever, much less shooting them. I figure I'm better off talking it through -- or pretending I'm asleep -- and seeing if I can't get them to see me as someone who cares about them.

...well, that was a little rambly.
