You know what, I can respect that. If they believe that violence is wrong, then their commitment even unto death strikes me as brave, not foolish. The question behind the question is: are they right? If yes, great people. If no, unfortunately misguided people. Interesting point on divine reward! I guess the classic rebuttal would be that reward is a byproduct of obedience, not the reason for it. The reason for obedience is not because it benefits us, but because it's one's function. And the fact that reward exists is a cause for celebration.
