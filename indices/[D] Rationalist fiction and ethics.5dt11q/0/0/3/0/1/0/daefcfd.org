There are arguments for being a little stricter, but I feel safe in saying that this is the bare minimum. I think that this is a similar situation to a Christian whose actions evince only "belief in belief" and not actual belief. If you claim to have been convinced of a particular ethical system, but you don't even wish you would try to act in accordance with it, then I would point to this as evidence that you haven't actually been convinced.
