How would you call someone who believes that utilitarianism is correct but chooses, on purpose, to not do the right thing?

To give an example, I personally agree that eating meat is Evil (and not a necessary evil) but I still do it. And I plan on continuing to do so until society disadvantages me for it. I know that it is wrong from a moral standpoint but I accept that level of immorality from myself.

I thought I was still a utilitarian when it comes to my beliefs and world view, but it sounds like in your opinion only people who either always act that way, or always try to act that way, or at the very least wish they /would/ try to always act that way can consider themselves utilitarians.
