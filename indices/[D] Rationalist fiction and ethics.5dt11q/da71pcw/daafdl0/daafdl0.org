It's interesting to note the Ten Commandments' take on this. Generally the 8th is rendered as "Don't lie", but actually it's "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour." So it prohibits false accusation, but it doesn't blanket-prohibit lying. Which could apply in cases like the above.
