  Claiming humans are the only known animals that meet your requirements for moral worth is suspiciously convenient but not inconceivable.

Here's a variant I don't know if I've actually seen, but seems self-consistent: there is a certain probability that solipsism is actually an accurate description of reality, and that oneself really is the only being with moral worth. It's not a particularly /high/ probability, but in some highly-uncertain, near-balanced edge cases (of the sort which authours tend to love inflicting on their characters), then that tiny probability may be enough to nudge someone's actions in one direction rather than another.
