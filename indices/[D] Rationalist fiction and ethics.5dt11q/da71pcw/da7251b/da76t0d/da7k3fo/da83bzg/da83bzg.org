  if you're a utilitarian without any speciesism in your system, then it totally follows that you should be a vegan

  the most common kind of utilitarian

So vegan utilitarians are vegan, and you have met a lot of vegan ulitlitarians. Which together I don't find convincing or universal.

Claiming humans are the only known animals that meet your requirements for moral worth is suspiciously convenient but not inconceivable. Usual arguments about language get there with only a little special pleading. There are other arbitrary but not unreasonable goalposts you could choose to disqualify whatever animals you wish. It's not obvious to me that there should be a strong consensus among utilitarians. Personally I doubt the consciousness of insects, and milk and cheese.
