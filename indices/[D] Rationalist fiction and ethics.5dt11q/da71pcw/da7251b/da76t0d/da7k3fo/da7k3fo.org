  any more than it's necessarily more rational to be a vegan.

Except that if you're a utilitarian without any speciesism in your system, then it *totally* follows that you should be a vegan, at least unless you make certain arguments which are only true under particular conditions that may or may not exist.

If you say "utilitarian" without qualifying it, then I'm going to assume that you're talking about the most common kind of utilitarian, who tries to maximizes pleasure and minimize pain on a universal scale (and in my experience is either vegan/vegetarian or recognizes that not being so is a shortcoming rather than something that Isn't Wrong After All)
