I didn't mean that it wasn't rational to be a vegan, I think it can be quite rational. However, it's not axiomatic that veganism is more rational than non-veganism, you need a justification based on some chosen values. My issue isn't the conclusions they came to, more the fact that the values and ethics presented in that story are presented as if they were self-evident. The story would be stronger if there were a carnivorous (hemoverous?) vampire to articulate that side of the argument, even if they were set up to lose the debate.
