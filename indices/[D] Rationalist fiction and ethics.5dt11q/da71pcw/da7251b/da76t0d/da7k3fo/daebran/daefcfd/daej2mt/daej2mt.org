I'd more compare it to someone who believes that the Christian God exists but decides to not follow his commandments. Although the lack of a hell-like threat in natural philosophy makes the analogy less than perfect.

In other words I believe that utilitarianism is the ultimately best path to do good or even to know the difference between good and not good in any given scenario. I just choose to not always do good, if that makes sense.

That doesn't mean that I am completely selfish or in any other way consistent in all my actions. My deliberate evil is pretty limited as far as I know. And I am human and thus don't do all the things I would like to do as well of course, including some things where I actually would like to be more consistently good. It simply doesn't extent to everything.

I am a happy meat eater, I place more value in my friends and family than in any amount of complete strangers, I am a self-proclaimed pro-human specieist and if there were a pill to "cure" me of all of those things (and more) I would vehemently refuse it. Yet I think that taking said pill would make me a objectively better person morally speaking.

But maybe you're right and the term utilitarian doesn't apply to me. No idea what term would instead though.
