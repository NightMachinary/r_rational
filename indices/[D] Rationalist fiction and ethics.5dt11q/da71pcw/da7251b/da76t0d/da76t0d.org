This is my problem with stories like Luminosity. I just find that level of extreme altruism to be unbelievable. It's just not how people act, even good or saintly people. There is also nothing more inherently rational about not drinking human blood as a vampire, any more than it's necessarily more rational to be a vegan. The question comes down to your goals and values, or utility function as they say around here.

If you want stories about self-interested protagonists that can occasionaly veer into the rational, try Wuxia stories like ISSTH or WMW. The prose can be a bit sloppy in translation, though.
