Given how we're raised on the axiom that caring about innocent bystanders and other such actions signals the hero, while not doing that signals the villain, I think what you're looking for, to an extent, is the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist][Villain Protaognist]]. From the above hero/villain traits, if such a story ever talks about morality, the protagonist is usually classified as evil, but that doesn't stop the villain from having a sympathetic portrayal.

I just recently finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], recommended from another thread here, in which when Voldemort died his identity overwrote Harry's, and Harry!Voldemort decides that going through life again as the saviour of wizarding Britain isn't so bad. It re-imagines Voldemort as less 'completely evil' and more amoral with a tendency to believe what's told to him (a byproduct of growing up in the house of purebloods after living in a muggle orphanage; he has to give off the impression that he already knows what they're talking about, and knew it all along, or else they'll turn on him). It's a rather funny story, and Harry fits the bill of always having a selfish motive for whatever he's doing.
