I guess I find it interesting how certain things are assumed as moral axioms without justification. As in, "do the thing that benefits the most people" is often the reason for the protagonist to go against the world-conquering despot, but rarely is it explained why they want to do that. I guess deep down I just want to read a story where there is a completely self-absorbed protagonist, if only for novelty's sake.
