Speaking as someone who was an ardent pacifist in the waning days of his theism, it can vary according to the theory that you subscribe to. I was personally considering learning aikido, which was designed to be "an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury."

(and truth be told, I still hold "thwarting violence without killing anyone" to be the ideal, and as [[/u/eaturbrainz]] has said, we should regard it as a horrible, tragic thing when someone is killed, even when there was literally no other option, because a mind was just destroyed forever and it is awful that things ever had to get to this point)

You could also probably find pacifists who are okay with inflicting temporary harm but not draw the line at killing.

It's a much easier philosophy if you believe that the world is ruled by supernatural beings who are willing and able to make sure that everything turns out right in the end.

I'm on a tablet right now but if you're interested in more, then let me know and I can elaborate as much as you'd like when I get to my laptop. Most of my knowledge is from a Mormon pov, but I'm familiar with some other traditions, like the Jains.
