  Could you elaborate on that?

It's in [[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5?lang=eng#2][the last chapter]] of the book, inviting us, after reading it, to consider its message, and ask God whether it is true. Other conditions include "a sincere heart" (so asking just to see what happens will likely get no answer), "real intent" (which to me means, you're prepared to act on the answer if you receive it), and "faith in Christ" (although the word "faith" can be misunderstood; see [[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.17-43#16][Alma 32]]).

  Are you saying that there is, like, an accepted way in which you increase your chances to get a personal message from God or something? Do a significant amount of Mormons claim to actually have gotten such messages?

Yes, and yes - including myself. I would be happy to expand on the details, but putting it into words doesn't really express it properly. Consider: how would you describe the taste of salt? If the other person has tasted salt, you don't need to describe it, and if they haven't, there's really nothing you can say that will help them understand it. The experiment can't be demonstrated, only reproduced. But the answer to both of your questions is yes.
