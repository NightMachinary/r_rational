  how are prophets confirmed as prophets?

It's a pretty straightforward succession. When the current president of the church passes away, the council of the twelve apostles meets and unanimously appoints his successor (which, to date, has always been the most senior Apostle), then appoints a new Apostle to fill the vacancy. All of the Apostles hold the keys of presidency, but dormant while there is a president.

I myself have a piece of paper in my wallet, tracing my ordination (as an elder in my local congregation) back in a chain through Joseph Smith, to the original Apostles (Peter, James, John), and thus to Jesus Christ.

So, the burden of proof, then, basically hinges on whether Joseph Smith indeed received any authority.

Well, everyone has to decide for themselves, of course, whether they believe Joseph Smith's claims or not. Exhibit A in his case would be the [[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm][Book of Mormon]], where we get our nickname from. It's a volume of about 500 pages that Joseph claimed to have translated (through divine assistance) from an ancient record of the Americas, written by prophets between 600BC and 400AD. As stated in the introduction, "We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true."

You might be particularly interested in the first 4-5 chapters of Nephi, as they relate to the original topic of utilitarian vs deontological ethics. Nephi is commanded by God to kill someone for the greater good, and he freaks out a bit about it (even though the man in question had robbed and attempted to murder them, and was likely still hunting them).

What kinds of evidence would you anticipate from a prophet?
