HJPEV is Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, the protagonist of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (the founding story of rationalism as a literary genre, imo - beforehand there wasn't really a concept of rationalist literature as an area). A lot of people on this sub (maybe even most) have read it.
