Hmm...hadn't previously heard of Fallout: New Vegas (I run Linux, so I lean more toward running old games in Dosbox, that kind of thing). Just from the passing reference in Wikipedia, though, it's probably not a very accurate representation :D.

Well, if you're starting from a blank slate, probably the best starting point is our [[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng][Articles of Faith]]. They're a good summary regardless.

If you're comparing with other Christian faiths, we believe that the church must be led by prophets who have received specific authority from God to do so, somewhat like the Catholic view. However, whereas the Catholic church teaches that that authority has been passed down from the original Apostles in an unbroken chain, we believe that with the martyrdom of the Apostles, the priesthood authority was lost, leading to the Dark Ages, and that God gave authority again through specific revelation and heavenly messengers in the 19th century; since that time, it has been passed down through a line of prophets, who lead the church.

If you're curious about how my faith interacts with spending time on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and Less Wrong, I'd say that we're strongly encouraged to examine and test our beliefs, to ask questions, and to accept & benefit from true principles wherever we find them. The restoration of the gospel and priesthood authority started with a boy asking, Who/what should I believe, and how will I know?

On some topics that are often of interest in rationalist circles...we do believe that "miracles" occur, that God interacts with humanity in ways we don't understand, but we don't view these as violating any laws of physics; rather, they reflect His vastly superior knowledge and understanding of those laws. Any sufficiently advanced technology looks like magic, after all. If HJPEV actually succeeded in his ambitions of living forever, learning everything about the laws of physics, and getting so smart that he could actually make the right decisions, every time, instead of just having the language to describe where he went wrong - then we might find that he would have a lot in common with the God I believe in.

We do accept the existence of spirits, that we are inhabiting our bodies like a hand in a glove, but they too are composed of (a finer, generally-invisible form of) matter. On the other hand, there is an element of dualism, since our scriptures do state that "Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be" - though that's pretty much at the limits of what has been revealed on that subject, leaving the rest to speculation.

And we take literally the Biblical statements that we are God's children. We anticipate that through a gradual process of teaching us correct principles, refining our moral character, testing our willingness to act on what we know, etc, He is preparing us - if we are willing - to create and govern worlds of our own.
