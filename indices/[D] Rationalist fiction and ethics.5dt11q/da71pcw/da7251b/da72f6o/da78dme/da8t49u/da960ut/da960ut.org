I agree with your property statement. My problem with killing and the like is that it is so definite. I am removing in an instant any future probabilities for this person to be reformed and happy for the sake of my own protection or protection of my possessions. The thorny side of it is when you are killing for the sake of another- then you are prioritising one life over another.
