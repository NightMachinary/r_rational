Matthew 5:38

#+begin_quote
  “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.
#+end_quote

They take this seriously and literally. They /are/ allowed to run (but there are some instructions in the texts not to), but not at all allowed to use force upon another person. That is, you're not allowed to break someone's leg, punch someone in the face, or even to use force to restrain them without harming them. There is no such thing as a just war, to the extent that paying taxes which will be used for a war is either forbidden or strongly discouraged.

[[http://www.homecomers.org/mirror/martyrs152.htm][/Martyr's Mirror/]] is one of the most important Mennonite texts, which has stuff like this:

#+begin_quote
  Being brought before the lords and judges, he was asked, whether he had been baptized upon his faith, which he finally confessed and acknowledged, not ashamed of what he had done by the command of his Lord and Master Christ Jesus, though he certainly knew that they did not ask him to be taught of him, but only to get a word from his mouth by which they might sentence him to death. When the lords and criminal judges had heard this Christian confession, they rose up and went to sentence him to death; and having returned from their evil consultation, they pronounced and declared their sentence over this servant of God: that he should publicly be burnt alive at the stake till death should ensue.
#+end_quote

(This was during a time when being a Mennonite was cause for death without any other crime being committed.) And insane stuff like this:

#+begin_quote
  When the executioner had come to him, he commanded him to put out his tongue, which he (faithful and pious servant of God), willingly did, since he had not a member on his body, which he was not willing to deliver up to suffering for the name of Christ, being well assured that all the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the joy and glory which God has promised them that overcome. Matt. 10:22; Romans 8:18; Rev. 2:7.

  And when he put out his tongue, the executioner fastened it with a piece of iron, and screwed it very tight with a vise or screw, and then touched the end of the tongue with a hot iron, that swelling, the screw might not slip off or become loose. O bitter cruelty and great tyranny.
#+end_quote

The moral lesson here is basically that if someone comes to you with a searing hot iron to pull out your tongue, you act as a willing participant. (Though there always appears to be some consequentialist thinking in these things, because there's explicit acknowledgement that God's glory is greater, and things like "whose reward is the crown of eternal, imperishable life" which very much seems to be an argument that in part this is all done with the expectation of reward. That's always something that I struggle with though, because I'm not sure how much I'm reading these texts with my own utilitarian mindset.)
