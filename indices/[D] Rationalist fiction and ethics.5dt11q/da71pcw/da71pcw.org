Most people here think of utilitarianism as being the "correct" moral framework.

But beyond that, rational fiction tends to put a focus on thought, and it's difficult for me to see how that exists within a deontological framework. That is, if you're a deontologist, you just ... do the right thing, even if it has bad consequences. Where's the thought in that?

Kant said that it was wrong to tell a lie to save a friend from a murderer. If you put that into a story ... I just don't see how that works /unless/ it's a deontologist flirting with consequentialism.

The current story that I'm writing for National Novel Writing Month /does/ have a deontologist protagonist paired with a utilitarian protagonist, with both utilitarian and deontological villains, but it's not super rational, and in part it's an argument against absolutist moral rules.

I was raised Mennonite, a rather extreme sect of Christianity which holds that non-resistance is morally correct, e.g. if a man comes to your house and attempts to rape your wife, you and she are both obligated not to resist him. Reading some of the interviews with Mennonites from the World War I conscientious objector board is a look into the eyes of moral madness, in my opinion. Edit: [[https://archive.org/details/conscientiousobj00kelluoft][/The Conscientious Objector/ by Walter Guest Kellogg]], starting in the section "The Mennonites and Others", though I think the whole book is worth a read; it was written by one of the three members of the Board of Inquiry which assessed whether those seeking CO status were just faking it.

  You can not get him to say whether in his opinion the United States should triumph over Germany or Germany over the United States --- he will tell you, "It is not for me to judge." He will, in all likelihood, testify that if some brute were to break into his mother's or sister's room and attempt to rape her, he would allow his mother or sister to be raped before he would shoot or otherwise injure her assailant. He will not admit having been in any fight or having ever used force against a human being since joining the church.

(Now that I think about it, I did actually put some of this into [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][/Metropolitan Man/]].)
