As Kellogg says, Mennonites didn't know anything about the first World War. (And more to the point, it's not even their rejection of war, including defensive war, it's their stance towards ever using force against another human being.)

  I had spent some time in examining Mennonites concerning the sinking of the /Lusitania/, but nothing significant developed from my questioning: many of them were equally unsatisfying when asked regarding General Foch and Edith Cavell. It occurred to me one day to ask a Mennonite what the Lusitania was. He did not know! He had, he told me, never heard of Edith Cavell, nor of General Foch, nor, strange to say, of General Pershing. Nor, I later ascertained, was his case an exception. I have examined at least fifty Mennonites at random in widely separated camps who did not know what the /Lusitania/ was, who Edith Cavell was, nor who General Foch or who General Pershing is. Others had heard of the /Lusitania/ --- that she was a boat which they thought had been sunk by the Germans, but they knew nothing about the surrounding facts. Several thought her an American ship; one said ''she had got into a glazier (sic) of ice." Two or three had an idea that ''Edith Cavell was some nurse who was shot." About half of them had heard of General Foch; one said he was "the manager of the French army." Pershing was more familiar; he was "the American general" or, as several of them put it, "one of the big men in the American army."

  Such ignorance, to one who has seen many of them, is hardly surprising. They are an isolated people; they do not mix freely with others.

But in any case, you couldn't get CO status if you just objected to /that particular war/, due to how Congress had drafted their criteria:

  The objector who happened to disagree with the Congress or with the President regarding our entrance into this particular war clearly did not come within the Congressional enactment requiring that the objection be "against warfare in any form."

Which is its own thorny moral issue.
