  Reading some of the interviews with Mennonites from the World War I conscientious objector board is a look into the eyes of moral madness, in my opinion
#+end_quote

Wait, really? The USA entering World War I was very beneficial to their interests, and it broke up the years-long stalemate between the two sides, but otherwise it was very morally neutral at best. Allying with Germany to defeat France+UK+Russia would not have been any less ethical than what they did.

I mean, maybe the people in whose interviews you read had very poor reason to hold their position. But I don't think it's an invalid position at all.
