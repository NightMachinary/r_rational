  Earths isn't nearly enough to balance out the Kolmogorov complexity of the hypothesis in question
#+end_quote

As the same time, rhetoric and scope insensitivity. Notice I included "add a few more billion". That particular one isn't a mistake, and I'm aware that's too low. But adding more arrows isn't how you explain the problem any better.

My hope is that a billion-billion earths is almost understandable, and then then I said "if that's not enough, they can always claim more as needed".

I also posted it well after the link to the actual article was posted.

  you're not quite correct when you say that "the standard lesswrong decision theory... fails completely".
#+end_quote

I'd argue that the standard lesswrong decision theory doesn't include that. They didn't cover it in the CFAR workshops I went to, etc. But I'll be sure to include that if I cover it again. Call it the "advanced lesswrong decision theory", where mostly what gets covered in the sequences and CFAR is the standard.

Also, post-hoc exceptions and all that. But it does seem pretty reasonable. If it becomes more widely accepted I'll count it.

  Finally, I'm not sure why you think Pascal's Mugging is simply a rephrasing of Roko's Basilisk.
#+end_quote

Roko's basilisk coming to fruition is a very unlikely event, that was treated seriously because the results are /so/ horrible. I suspect that pascals mugging is a direct result of Roko's basilisk, and attempt to prevent the lesswrong decision theory from choking on it by providing a safe example where these horrible things are so obviously not a problem.

Part of my suspicion is just the timing, and I admit is just a suspicion. But someone devout (someone who's forgotten the common sense rule) who's been exposed to pascals mugging is less likely to fall for roko's basilisk.

It addresses the core problem that could cause some people to fall for roko's basilisk, and that's why I think it's a response to it. It does ignore the acausal blackmail stuff, but that's cut-off already if you're trained not to take is seriously. Not simply a rephrasing, but saying that one solves the other is useful.

So I concede the point, but I'm still going to keep saying it.
