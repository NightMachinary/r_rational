I think the thing with Roko's basilisk is that according to some people it /isn't/ necessarily an unlikely event. If you a) believe that a super-intelligence of that power level is likely to be /eventually/ created (as in, before humanity's extinction), b) expect that said super-intelligence would rather be created earlier than later if it has the choice, and c) think that acasual negotiation with completely binding precomitments are a thing even between creatures of uneven power, then the Roko's basilisk problem can seem downright probable to you.
