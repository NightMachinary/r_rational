Yes, to come up with the axioms you need to study consequences, though those axioms have been evaluated over time. (Often a lot of time.) Kantian ethics isn't really about purity from consequences, though, it's about an ideal. That is, if everyone were to behave that way, then what would the world look like? If no one were to kill other humans, then there would be no murder, etc. The point of interest (or level of abstraction, or whatever) is set here in the moment you make the decision, not really at the point where you set up the moral system. In that way, deontological ethics seems kind of scientific. You precommit to a set of actions that have been determined to work (at least in general) through a process of long-term observation.

The post is interesting. I think if people were (or are) that clear-eyed about consequences and didn't (don't) overestimate their ability to forecast, then utilitarianism could (does) work. It seems like the mental homework you have to do to be an effective consequentialist is substantial. There might be more useful flexibility in that worldview. though.
