Looks like we're in agreement then. On one hand you have flexibility and ability to tackle new problems for which people are yet to come up with working deontological axioms; on the other: ease of use, resistance to abuse/mistakes, and the perks of precommitment.

I think that the lack of flexibility is a major factor in why we don't see much deontological reasoning in rational fiction. When you're dealing with decisions that will affect hundreds of lives, the lack of finesse can be very deadly. Rational fiction usually isn't about some store clerk whose potential mistakes won't cost hundreds of lives trying to have a happy married life, or something similarly mundane.
