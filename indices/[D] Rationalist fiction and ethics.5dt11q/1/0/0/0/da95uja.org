Could a useful deontological ethics system even be constructed without smuggling in consequentialism in one form or another? When you're establishing a rule against experimentation in some medical field, or a rule against lying, you're using your knowledge of the world to predict which rules will perform better. Any consistently useful system will in the end depend on predicting the consequences of the actions, there is simply no alternative that I can see. So, as I see it, the argument about deontological reasoning being advantageous due to the world being hard to predict doesn't really work. That's my sole point here. I'm not claiming that consequentialism is superior in some absolute sense, or even that it performs better in most real-world situations, I just think that particular argument from unpredictability to be flawed.

I think deontological reasoning has its place and can achieve better results in many cases. Ultimately though, I think it's a kludge that works as well as it does purely by the virtue of being optimised to counter human stupidity, rather than any inherent elegance or optimality. The less stupidity there is to counter, the less advantage over consequentialism it offers.

Amusingly enough you can also recover a fairly decent approximation of rules against lying if you [[https://sideways-view.com/2016/11/14/integrity-for-consequentialists/][add some fancy decision theory to consequentialism.]]
