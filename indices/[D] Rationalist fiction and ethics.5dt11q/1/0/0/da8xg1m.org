I'm sympathetic to your point about prediction, but I think conflating ethical and non-ethical decisions isn't fully valid. Experimentation might be ethical in one sphere and not in another, making iterative learning and planning acceptable in, say, planning milestones for a coding project but not in deciding when to tell the truth to your partner.

Funny enough, Kant uses a failure mode in describing deontological ethics, and it's the most famous example...the story with the crazed man running down the street and asking the location of your loved one. (Unfortunately a terrible branding exercise for deontological ethics.) I think justification for a deontological stance isn't really something I can bring across in this format, since a preference for deontological ethics or utilitarianism comes about through personal experience, and I'm no exception to that. But I will say that many (in my mind) impressive Weltanschung or systems of seeing the world are based on accepting the extent to which we don't have control in life, and these systems are therefore more compatible with deontological ethics. I'm thinking of stoicism and zen Buddhism among others. Note that Christianity is actually more utilitarian in my mind, as it's based on deciding you know exactly what the outcome of your actions will be (heaven or hell).

I think the extent to which Kantianism appeals to you will also have to do with personal experiences of control or acceptance, i.e. has there been something in your life that wasn't solvable and the extent of one's acceptance or non-acceptance of that. I personally think deontological ethics are generally undervalued, not just here but in general. Lying, for example, seems to be something people do very casually, often because they think or assume the lie won't come out. In my experience, lies come out far more often than people predict and a policy of never lying, even in extraordinary circumstances, has paid off with dividends for me over the years. I think part of being rational (a large part) is accepting our shortcomings. Deonotological ethics does that well. That's not to say I'm a perfect deontologist (it's hard) or that there aren't failure states (there are). But my experience has led me to believe that there are better outcomes when you make decisions based on the ethics of your actions rather than the relative desirability of that which may or may not follow.
