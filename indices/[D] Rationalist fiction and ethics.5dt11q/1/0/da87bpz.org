I think that dismissing utilitarianism just because the world isn't totally predictable is a mistake. It is at the very least disingenuous, if you don't also bite the bullet and extend the same argument in favour of discarding any kind of planning and prediction in life and just simply live by following some set of rules. I think that when you try to extend deontologist reasoning to every decision it becomes obvious that we are indeed capable of imperfectly predicting the consequences of our actions to some degree and consequentialist reasoning really makes more sense most of the time.

The issue with people doing otherwise unacceptable things is a failure mode, true, although it's a failure mode of the user, rather that the system, and can be avoided in principle. Deontological reasoning has similar failure modes and you can easily construct scenarios in which rigidly following it leads people to make decisions which will have obviously unacceptable and quite predictable consequences, unless you smuggle the ability to make consequentialist judgements into it.

Consequentialism is vulnerable to abuse, but giving up on predictive reasoning entirely is throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
