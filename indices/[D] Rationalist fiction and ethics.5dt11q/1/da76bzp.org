I think it's about control. The deontological moral framework acknowledges that attempting to predict the future that will result from your actions is at best a crapshoot and at worst a goad to do otherwise unacceptable things. In real life, this is spot on. Humans always think they can predict the future, and in general fall short.

Rationalism as presented here is largely a way of attempting to better predict the future or understand the present. I think this appeals to a certain kind of person, and in my opinion makes a great (and different) kind of story. Unfortunately , in the real world, even people who have reread Thinking Fast and Slow and hang out on Less Wrong should probably build their ethics around the assumption that they can't predict future events. So I guess the answer is that a story about a deontologist might actually be more rational, as it acknowledges reality and our inability to actually do the things we read about in stories like HPMoR. On the other hand, it doesn't allow one to indulge in the fantasies of control that characterize most rationalist fiction, which admittedly I find as appealing as anyone here on this subreddit.
