Ah, apologies for the spoiler. Entirely my bad. I don't think it spoiled any major plot points. I'll mark it as such though.

I like prediction because it's important to doing good science. It's easy to come up with a hypothesis that fits the data post-hoc, and often time those hypothesis are wrong.

Phrasing it as predictive power does two things

- Reminds us that a hypothesis is worthless unless it's /actually/ giving as useful information

- Reminds us to create hypotheses before we get the data, which reduces mistakes a whole lot.
