No worries - I didn't read any of it.

To me prediction is too similar to making assumptions. I'll assume and presume, and will act accordingly, which might result in mistaken action.

Instead, I'll have an understanding; if I feel my understanding is lacking certainty in some scenario, then I'll seek to update or alter my understanding.

I see you're viewing it as:

- Experience ---> Post-hoc Hypothesis

Whereas to me that small segment is on a continuum looking like this:

- ... ---> Experience and Observation ---> Hypothesis ---> Experience and Observation ---> Hypothesis ---> Experience and Observation ---> Hypothesis ---> Experience and Observation ---> Hypothesis ---> Experience and Observation ---> Hypothesis ---> Experience and Observation ---> Hypothesis ---> ...

From that continuum you can just as verily focus on Experience and Observation ---> Hypothesis as you can on Hypothesis ---> Experience and Observation; I rather like to view it as the latter than the former, if I'm to focus on just one segment.
