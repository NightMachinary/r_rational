I don't form my understanding of reality and myself based off of predictions; I base it off of observations and experiences. I have few strongly held beliefs, and those I do hold are either formed and consistent with my values or have become strong through repeated experience and observation. Even those are subject to change should I notice inconsistency.

Spending time trying to predict the consequences of my beliefs sounds like a waste of it.
