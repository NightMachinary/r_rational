One "problem" for writers is that, once you've decided to make your villain not-incomprehensibly-evil, it's actually really easy to come up with morally good reasons for what they're doing; and having morally complex villains is much more interesting than having relatable but morally-incomplex ones.

Take HPMOR, for instance. Yudkowsky /could/ have just made him a Voldemort that likes puppies, aka relatable but evil, but it's not such a huge jump to say "Nuclear bombs are a huge threat, so Voldemort wants to stop that" (so much so that Rowling herself has now done this with Grindelwald, in Fantastic Beasts). He's correct, even if not all his methods are, and even if he's only worried for his own safety and the safety of the things he enjoys doing; and this is more interesting than if he just liked puppies but was otherwise Voldemort.
