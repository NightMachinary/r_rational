Depending on the scope of the story you're telling on type might fit better than the other. In small scope stories or beginning arcs of a story small time relatable evil enemies can be fun and fit well, when we are dealing with final bosses or larger scopes a morally complex villain is a better fit.

​

How interesting the villains are will depend on the skill of the author of course, but there's also something to be said about scope and story stage.

​

We don't need the final boss to burn the hero's village to kick start his journey, sometimes it could be more interesting to have been something small like a bad mayor or criminal, not only will the initial goals be more reasonable, some pay offs will happen earlier, and the story will start with a better pace, instead of needing training arcs and time skips and other similar things.
