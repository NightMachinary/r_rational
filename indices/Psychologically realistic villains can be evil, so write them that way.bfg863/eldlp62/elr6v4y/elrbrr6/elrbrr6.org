You're right, I prefer immoral. A lot of my contact with the word "evil" has been via sensationalist media and simplistic stories where the villains only wanted bad things because they were bad (so, sensationalist media), so that colors my preferences.

I see "evil", I expect simplism. For example:

Nazism is an ideology, which means that many nazis believe they're doing the right thing. Is being wrong evil?

Or, if we're only judging results, there's bound to be nazis who make a net positive impact on the world: if 'nazis are evil' and 'doctors who volunteer are good', what does that make a volunteer doctor who only treats white people?

Nazism is wrong, easily motivated by selfishness, and highly destructive: does that make nazis automatically evil? The Nuremberg trials would have been so easy if it did, except the part where they carried out the sentence on millions.
