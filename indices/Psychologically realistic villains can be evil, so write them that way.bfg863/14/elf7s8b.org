I just want to point out that "evil" is simply a label for misalignment or value systems past certain degree. Whenever one encounters rhetoric or behavior that one precieves as having a sufficiently negative utility (according to one's value system), one calls it "evil".

This is why "true evil" must be incopmrehensible, since it is based on completely alien values, and why when we (as readers) are shown the villain having a "human" relatable side, find it hard to consider them "truly evil", as we were just demonstrated that, fundamentally, their value system is quite close to ours and that whatever makes them a villain of the story in the first place is comparatively minor.
