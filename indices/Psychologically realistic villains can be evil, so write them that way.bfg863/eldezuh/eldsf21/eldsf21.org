I see a lot of amateur writers writing weak villains out of a misguided belief that they must avoid having evil villains because evil villains are unrealistic.

Efforts to convince people that evil people are realistic run into the problem that realistic people are not evil---i.e., by the time people understand why someone has done something, they no longer feel like the person is evil.

This would be fine, but we talk about villains in terms of good and evil, so I have seen a wave of new writers who feel like they must avoid writing an entire class of villain who are perfectly fine to write and good for many stories.

Why do we have such narrow and restrictive standards for what constitutes evil? Even /literally Hitler/ is not considered evil if we acknowledge that he liked dogs and was nice to secretaries.

There are two reasons.

One reason is that we believe that evil should be responded to in evil and stupid ways, and we do not want to be evil and stupid, so we do not call things evil if we can avoid it.

The other reason is that we genuinely have trouble empathizing with evil people because the evil within us all does not manifest until we are in position to do evil.

But if we just consider evil to mean "really bad guy," then it should be pretty clear that you can write realistic, complex Evil bad guys.
