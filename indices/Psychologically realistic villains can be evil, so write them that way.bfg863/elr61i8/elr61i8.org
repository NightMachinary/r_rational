  Surely they aren't denying that he was literally a human, wasn't he?

But they are, that's the point. Dehumanising is traditionally a very simple way to treat enemies and make sure they stay such. The problem is the fear that letting in on the slightest bit of human understanding or empathy for a monster will make it less monster-like, thus your hand less certain in slaying it. Next thing you know you'll be all buddy-buddy with it.

In many ways, you want to retroactively write real life villains as cartoon ones because that's what makes it easy to get people to hate them. Explaining them as humans and /still/ making a case that they should absolutely not be understood or imitated is much harder, because holding two seemingly contradictory ideas at once is hard. The reason why this is done IRL is the same as why this is done in fiction - our brains have far less trouble dealing with a simple, straightforward scenario.
