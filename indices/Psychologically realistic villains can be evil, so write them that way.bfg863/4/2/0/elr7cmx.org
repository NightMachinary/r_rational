  Burton's Joker doesn't operate on any internal logic. He just does random evil crazy stuff

It's the Joker, though. Not having any internal logic /is/ his logic. His whole shtick is complete nihilism: the world doesn't make sense, it is a cruel and random place that will strike you with suffering without rhyme or reason. Joker embraces this and takes it a step further, by trying to turn it into a joke. A dark, deadly, killing joke (see what I did there?), but a joke nevertheless.
