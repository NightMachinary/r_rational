  Doesn't that dilute the word "evil"?
#+end_quote

My point was that there are degrees of evil. (This essay uses "evil" in place of "absolute" or "colossal evil".) To put it roughly - to make one person's life worse is bad. To do so to a greater degree is worse. To do the same thing to 2 people instead of 1 is twice as bad. To a 100 people instead of 2 is 50 times as bad, etc. (The opposite may be said of good as well.)

  If I gossip about a coworker so that way she's passed over for a promotion, does that make me evil?

It doesn't sound like it makes you good.
