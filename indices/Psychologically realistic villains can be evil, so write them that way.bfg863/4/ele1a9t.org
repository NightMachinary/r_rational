It's tricky because there's a risk of going the other way: having someone who literally just wants to kill people For No Reason, and that makes it hard to hang more plot hooks off them.

Like, when I write villains, I try to think of what their motivations are and run it from that. But I'm not writing "burn down the school and masturbate over the ashes" villains, I'm writing "ruin someone's life to get you one rung higher on the social ladder" villains, so maybe there's a difference? Like, my villains are motivated by "duty" and by "status" respectively, and all their "evil" actions are done in service to them. They don't kick a dog they walk past to demonstrate they're evil, because that doesn't have them fulfill their duty/increase their status.

But maybe that means my villains aren't evil, they're just, well, antagonists?

What's "good" about writing "evil" characters? Like yeah if you want to write /Silence of the Lambs/ then have the person with weird sex stuff around murder, but the average sci fi or fantasy story, do you need evil? Isn't it enough that the King makes the peasants work for 12 hours a day with meagre rations without him having to torture the children Just For Fun?
