thank you so much for writing that out for me, because I didn't get that from the OP at all, but the way you've said it is much better.

I would say, though, that with the Sagewa example, "he hungers for human flesh as a terminal value" would be /harder/ to hang plot hooks off than "he hungers for human flesh because he believes if he eats people he gains their beauty" (I'm familiar with the Sagewa story and I believe his motivation for eating was not for wanting to taste it but more along those lines? like he coveted his victim's beauty in some way? or he thought no woman would ever sleep with him so eating them was the best he could do? this is purely memory though, but there /was/ something more than "i wonder what long pig tastes like" going on for him).

Let's assume it's the "beauty" thing though. As an author, the "beauty" line gives you some interesting places to go: it tells you more about him. Not only does he want to eat beautiful people, but he thinks beauty is important. Does he put a lot of effort into his appearance to be beautiful? Does he not put any effort because the only way to be beautiful is to eat beautiful people? Does he like art? Etc.

IDK, for me it just seems... more interesting? Gives you more to work with? More flavour (ha)? If you don't just "stop" at "the evil thing is their terminal value". For many of the "worst monsters" it was, though, but I'm not sure stories about "those monsters" are what I most care to read or write?
