No, I'm not. I'm saying that the word ‘evil' has a meaning, and this meaning is uncomplexly applied to Hitler. There is still room to make more nuanced factual claims on what Hitler is or isn't, and I'm not arguing against you doing so, but this nuance isn't in---and shouldn't be in---the term ‘evil'. There are much better debates for that, like whether the use of nuclear weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki was evil.
