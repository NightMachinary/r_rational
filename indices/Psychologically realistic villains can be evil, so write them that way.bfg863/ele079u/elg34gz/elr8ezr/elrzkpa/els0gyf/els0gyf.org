I mean, they basically treated them as animals and considered them less than human, isn't that the general idea?

That said, I don't think they literally thought that, mine was an extreme example of how ignorance can produce the same results as sheer malice. I think though there genuinely was at least in some of them a component of belief that Jews and other undesirables /did/ harm Germany, always in the framework typical of fascists that casts all life as some kind of deadly struggle for survival in which there is no room for weakness or disunity of any sort. I've also read some theories about how Hitler really thought that the Jews for some contrived reason were the origin of a passive mentality that prevented humanity from going back to its natural state of eternal strife. It's all absolutely nuts, of course, but it's not like the point was simply to use them as scapegoats. There probably was some kind of good faith belief in some absurd reason for which they were to be considered harmful.
