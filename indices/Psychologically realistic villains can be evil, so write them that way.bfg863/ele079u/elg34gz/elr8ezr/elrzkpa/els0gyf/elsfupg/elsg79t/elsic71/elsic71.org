‘less intelligent, self aware, or capable of moral reasoning' is a belief one gets when one is trying to justify their superiority, a higher social standing that gives them ‘right' to disregard ethics. An inebriated man 30 IQ below me is also less intelligent, self aware, and capable of moral reasoning than I am, and yet they're still obviously capable of suffering. This is fundamentally negligible in a moral sense for this class of decisions, and a far cry from ‘I have a genuine, justified belief that the being I am torturing is a p-zombie incapable of suffering.'

A racist is trying to justify why it's OK not to care about the suffering of the people they target. A genuinely misguided but not intentionally evil person is mistaken about the fundamental quality of what they're doing.

A person who is OK with boiling lobsters alive because they don't believe lobsters have the hardware to have conscious experience, feel pain subjectively, or suffer from it in any real sense, has a much stronger moral standing /even if they turn out to be wrong/, heck, even if lobsters have as much capacity for real suffering as humans. ‘Is a p-zombie' is actually a reason, a thing that you can in theory be mistaken about in good faith, and that moral agents will predicate their actions on.

This is my concern with your argument. You are suggesting we consider the Nazis to inhabit a space of genuine confusion about what they were doing that does not reflect reality. You then say that this is evidence that evil is about results, not intent. But the Nazis weren't confused, there is no ambiguity whether they were actually intently evil, and there is an important distinction between purposeful evil and accidental harm that we shouldn't run over by reframing evil deeds as things they were not.
