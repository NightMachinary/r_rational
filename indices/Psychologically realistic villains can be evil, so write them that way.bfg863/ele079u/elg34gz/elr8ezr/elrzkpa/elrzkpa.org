This would be a position worth much more analysis if there really was reason to believe the Nazi's possition was “we realize this looks ethically monstrous, and we would agree, except that we have good reason to believe the people we're torturing and gassing, including the Jews, the disabled, enemies of state, as well as the people we're murdering in war in order enact this, are actually p-zombies, unlike the rest of the German people.”

I don't think there's any real evidence for this. Certainly it's not a position they could have got to through ethically neutral reasoning.
