Even Hitler's morally abhorrent actions - could they not be considered "rational", even "good" from the perspective of a rational agent given bad information?*

​

I feel uncomfortable even typing "morally abhorrent". I am not sure that belief that "morality" exists is a rational one to hold. I would say that a more precise statement would be that Hitler's actions and his party's beliefs would create a society that would be incompatible with my personal continued survival, as well as most people on earth. (since most people don't have the phenotype appearance he was looking for).

​

Thus if morality is decided by popular vote, his actions were abhorrent. Anyways, Hitler had millions of partial or full supporters, and hypothetically if they had won, conquering the earth, they could have mass murdered everyone that wasn't a follower of this kind of "morality", making his actions suddenly be "moral" as they would be the majority of the "morality voters".

*Play a game simulation where you are trying to conquer and hold all of Europe and all of the USSR. Or just imagine one. Pretend that it's just a computer simulation and no one is hurt by your actions.

​

The reason you can't succeed is that you can't hold that much territory because you won't have enough loyal homeland troops to suppress uprisings over that much territory. In fact, the more territory you hold, the slower your gains become as more and more troops are tied up suppressing revolts. This is one limiting factor for empires throughout history.

​

Similarly, without computers and forms of automated surveillance we still only have in prototype form today, you /need/ a population of loyal bootlickers who report anyone who isn't a conformer. This is because you can't really detect non-comformers automatically.

​

The Jews were a nonconforming group that wasn't being subsumed by the majority population. At one point in time, Europe would have been splintered into much smaller subgroups of rival tribes and rival kingdoms, but by the time of modern nations, each nation was mostly a "melting pot" of people sharing common ways of life, language, and interbreeding with each other. The jews - and the other 5 million members of lesser groups that Hitler murdered - were non-conformers.

​

I'm not saying this wasn't an absurdly evil thing to do - but if you're imagine yourself as just an agent, not a human, and your goal is to control as much of Europe as possible - it seems like a /potentially/ effective policy. (I think this is questionable in the real history - all that mass murder took a lot of resources that could have gone to the direct fighting - but for a rational agent considering plans and working with limited information, it might end up being the plan with the highest estimated chance of success. A move doesn't have to actually succeed for it to be the optimal move in an environment with stochastic outcomes and limited information)
