This always bugged me, when harry takes the five minutes to reevaluate voldemorte's intelligence: He mentions that the base rate of high intelligence of a person picked at random from the populace is very low and that makes it less likely that voldemorte is intelligent. Voldemorte was not randomly picked. you're talking about the base rate of high intelligence in persons who successfully terrorize entire countries and manipulate entire populaces for decades on end. the latter requires the former in all but the most lucky situations
