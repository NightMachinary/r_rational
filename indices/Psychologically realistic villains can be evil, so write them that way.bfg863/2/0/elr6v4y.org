  so even characterizing nazis as Evil is dangerous.

I think "evil" ends up being such a charged word because it's got some faintly spiritual/religious connotations, it seems to suggest the existence of some independent force of the universe of which these people are tools. But ultimately, you can say "immoral", same thing. The Nazis were immoral, or in short, evil. Sure, by my own measure of morality, but by what other code am I supposed to live or judge people? Even though I can understand the motivations that made them tick (in fact, it's useful to do so), the key point that OP is making is exactly that an action having /reasons/ doesn't make it less evil. A paedophile who kidnaps, rapes, and kills a child has logical reasons for all those steps (he has a desire to have sex with children, and doesn't want to get caught so doesn't want any witnesses). He still did something that we can all very much call "evil".
