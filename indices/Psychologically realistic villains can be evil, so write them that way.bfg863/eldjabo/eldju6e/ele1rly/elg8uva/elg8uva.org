I'm not sure it's consequence free. Like sure he could murder and get away with it, but there would be consequences. They could be good or bad consequences. The problem with murder is usually that you can't take it back. In stories, authors who kill their characters/protagonists quickly run into problems. They have to come up with new interesting/likable characters, its much more economical to grow/torture a character without killing them. In real life, killing someone has butterfly effects, which again could be good and bad. There is a reason why its usually a bad idea to touch anything when you have travelled back in time, no one can really predict the outcome of their actions. You steal unicorn blood without killing, you enchant a broom to not work properly, you petrify someone, all of the above can be taken back some of the time. Not all of the time, the effects can sometimes ripple out before the act is reversed, a fear of Basilisks that lasts a lifetime even after unpetrified. Murder just can't be taken back.
