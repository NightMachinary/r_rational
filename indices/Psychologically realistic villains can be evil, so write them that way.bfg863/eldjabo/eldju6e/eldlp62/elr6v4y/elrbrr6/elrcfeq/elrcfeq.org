  Nazism is wrong, easily motivated by selfishness, and highly destructive: does that make nazis automatically evil? The Nuremberg trials would have been so easy if it did, except the part where they carried out the sentence on millions.

I mean, that goes into politics. There's a whole subcategory of issues that are basically dealing with /collective/ guilt. And these include practicality. Even if you thought that every single German who voted for or supported the Nazi party was effectively an accomplice of its misdeeds (and in a moral sense, they were), you can't just punish a whole country and expect it to turn out well. WW2 was at least partially spawned because this is exactly what the European powers thought they could do after WW1.

I think there's an interesting case against /overcomplicating/ things, when moral judgement is involved. Put enough effort into it, you can rationalise anything, and utilitarians are especially prone to that. Thus says the deontologist: here I draw a line, and nothing justifies crossing it, which allows me to brand it as 'evil'. It's a flawed system, they all are, but you can consider it a sort of "better safe than sorry" measure to prevent you from talking yourself into doing horrible things.
