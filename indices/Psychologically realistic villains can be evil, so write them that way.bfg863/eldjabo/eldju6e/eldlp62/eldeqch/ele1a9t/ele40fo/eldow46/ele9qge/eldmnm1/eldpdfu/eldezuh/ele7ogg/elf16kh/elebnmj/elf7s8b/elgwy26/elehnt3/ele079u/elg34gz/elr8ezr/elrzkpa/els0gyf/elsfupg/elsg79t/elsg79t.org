I don't know specifically about Nazis, but a lot of racists seemed to genuinely think black people were somehow just less intelligent, self aware, or capable of moral reasoning than whites. Not outright P-zombies, maybe, but that's the general direction.

And my point is, since the outcome is the same, both are still evil. I think the issue is exactly that people do tend to have justifications for what they do, but that doesn't preclude what they do from being terrible. That's the notion that OP is criticising - that "justified" is the same as "not quite as evil". Evil without /any/ justification is probably extremely rare.
