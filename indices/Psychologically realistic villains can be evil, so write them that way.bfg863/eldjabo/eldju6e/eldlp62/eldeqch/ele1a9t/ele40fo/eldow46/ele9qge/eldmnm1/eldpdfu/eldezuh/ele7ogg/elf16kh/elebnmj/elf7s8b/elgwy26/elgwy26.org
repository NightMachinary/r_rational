Might be a confounding bias of author subgroups versus the population at large (people just love labeling black and white, good and evil). (Good) authors naturally probe deep into the heads of their characters; one concept from r!Animorphs that stuck with me is that once you truly, absolutely understand another person, you can /be them/. And they say that nobody thinks of themself as evil. It's easy to write incomprehensible or obvious evil, but hard to label the villain as "evil" once there's /anything at all/ to sympathize at.

Another factor might be the appeal of redemption to authors. Evil is so final and pass√©, whereas morally complex, redeemable evil is an audience favorite.

P.S. OP is like 70% rant...c'mon.
