I agree with a lot of what you've said; your ‘they're misguided but we should still stop them' quote is something I find very important myself.

However, I /also/ think it's important to protect the Simple Truth. You say “I don't think anyone /chooses/ anything, ever,” and again I'm taken aback. When I select between two different brands of toothpaste, I'm making a choice, I'm choosing something. This is a Simple Truth. You don't need to understand exactly what a ‘choice' constitutes to know that's a pretty darn solid example of one.

The philosophy response to “it's true that 1+1=2” is “ah, but is that really /true/, or is that just a particular statement valid under a particular set of axioms which could have been chosen otherwise?” And yet it is true, Simply True even, and whilst the philosopher in that conversation has demonstrated knowledge about the underlying mechanisms of mathematics, they've also demonstrated that they're deeply confused about how reasoning works. You don't get brownie points just for being unsure about things. One of the reasons maths and science work so well is that people have a foundation of trustworthy claims they can build upon, that they /don't/ have to continually question to figure things out and do new stuff.

Here too this holds. Hitler was Evil. People make Choices. A Simple Truth does not preclude a Complex Answer elsewhere.
