You're adding complexity to a topic that neither needs nor wants it. Hitler is evil because his aims were evil and his actions were evil. His aims were evil and his actions were evil because they involved the mass, unmitigated torture and slaughter of meaningful, sentient lives.

You do not need to settle the question of whether your morality has objective basis or not, or figure out if Hitler's actions are reproducible by a purely rational agent with a specific goal and poor information. Regardless of whether there is an objective morality, regardless of whether such a morality may accept the torture that entailed, regardless of whether killing Jews was an effective way to control Europe---/Hitler Is Evil/, and if someone doesn't understand what that means, the problem is not with the message.
