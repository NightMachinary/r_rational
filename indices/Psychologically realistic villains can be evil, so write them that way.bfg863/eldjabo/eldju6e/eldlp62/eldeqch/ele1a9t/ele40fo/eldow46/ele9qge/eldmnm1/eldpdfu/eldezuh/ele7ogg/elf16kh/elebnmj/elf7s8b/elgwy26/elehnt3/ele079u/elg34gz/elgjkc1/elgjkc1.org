  *Play a game simulation where you are trying to conquer and hold all of Europe and all of the USSR. Or just imagine one. Pretend that it's just a computer simulation and no one is hurt by your actions.

  The reason you can't succeed is that you can't hold that much territory because you won't have enough loyal homeland troops to suppress uprisings over that much territory. In fact, the more territory you hold, the slower your gains become as more and more troops are tied up suppressing revolts. This is one limiting factor for empires throughout history.

I feel you've never played a good map painting game. Try ck2, or EU4, or Victoria 2... Ck2 in particular is very good at showing how being evil can help you conquer the world. Just go to it's subreddit and take a look around. Or just search watch some youtube videos on it:
