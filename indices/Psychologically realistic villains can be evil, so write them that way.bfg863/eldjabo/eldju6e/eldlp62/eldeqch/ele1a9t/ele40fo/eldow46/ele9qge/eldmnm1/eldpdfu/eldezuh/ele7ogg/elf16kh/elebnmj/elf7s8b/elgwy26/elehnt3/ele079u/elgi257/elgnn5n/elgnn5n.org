You weren't very engaged in the previous post and one wonders if you changed at all from it.

You start off disagreeing with comments on your last post but you never responded to them then. What a strange method of conversation.

I'm also not sure you got anymore concise, I read the previous one but skimming this seems like you've repeated yourself.

This is very long like the last post and I wonder if it couldn't have been more brief without restating the same points multiple times.

Also if the problem is the word evil then don't use it. It's pretty obvious to me why it's not a good choice. You're evil for not devoting your utility to maximising universal utility etc.

Plus it all falls apart when you get out of the dichotomy that the antagonist is good tm and the protagonist is bad tm. Baru Cormorant, Prince of Thorns, that one about the rational monk, to name a few
