You're being irrational. You can't claim someone is evil just because you say they are. You're actually trying to say that a hardcoded piece of your brain that was developed by evolution is telling you this - but our instincts aren't objective truth. We have irrational fears and desires that are not consistent with objective reality.

It very well is likely true that everything you said is true - but this needs to be constructed, brick by brick, from fundamental, empirically testable truths in the form of a proof. We can't just take your word for it. (or any human's word)
