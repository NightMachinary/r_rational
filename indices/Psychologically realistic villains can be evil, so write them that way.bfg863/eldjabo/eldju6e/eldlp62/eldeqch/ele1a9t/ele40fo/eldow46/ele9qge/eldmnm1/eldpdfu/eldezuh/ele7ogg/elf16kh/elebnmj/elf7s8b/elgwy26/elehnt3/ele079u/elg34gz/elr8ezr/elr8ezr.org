  You're adding complexity to a topic that neither needs nor wants it. Hitler is evil because his aims were evil and his actions were evil. His aims were evil and his actions were evil because they involved the mass, unmitigated torture and slaughter of meaningful, sentient lives.

They're not really distinguishable from the actions of an especially ill-informed agent, however. A genuine racist believes the object of his hate is non sentient - they see them as basically P-zombies. This is of course catastrophically bad and also horribly irrational just for how unfalsifiable it is (quick, prove me that YOU are not a P-zombie!), but if you acted on that logic you could even carry out the freakin' Holocaust while thinking that you're either doing good, or enacting a necessary evil. Doesn't make it less serious, doesn't make it less necessary to just take you down and stop doing whatever it is you think you're doing. Just because you're delusional, or because there is a complex cause and effect reason behind your actions, doesn't mean you don't need to be stopped. In fact, in a materialistic world, there is no free will, and there /always/ is a complex cause and effect reason behind your actions. We can't really rely on the model of 'choice' to attribute guilt. Maybe you're just completely crazy and have been raised all your life with a completely distorted epistemology that now makes you believe absurd things and your actions are, to you, entirely logical. But if killing you is the only way to stop you from murdering millions... you'll still get killed. While in general I'd certainly agree that anyone, and I mean /anyone/, would be better off simply put in condition not to cause any harm and then helped get out of whatever delusion caused their actions, in practice when you have a tyrant who's already commanded the loyalty of a whole fanatic death cult army it's probably a bit impractical to set up a rehabilitation program.
