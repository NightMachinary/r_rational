  You are suggesting we consider the Nazis to inhabit a space of genuine confusion about what they were doing that does not reflect reality. You then say that this is evidence that evil is about results, not intent. But the Nazis weren't confused, there is no ambiguity whether they were actually intently evil, and there is an important distinction between purposeful evil and accidental harm that we shouldn't run over by reframing evil deeds as things they were not.

I'm saying that relying too much on "evil as intent" leaves us open exactly to the exploit mentioned by OP - give a villain the slightest hint of a justification, or some kind of misguided belief, and suddenly they look sympathetic. I think misguided beliefs are behind a lot of evil things (though people to some extent do indulge in beliefs that already are convenient to them; there is often an element of self-delusion and rationalisation), but that doesn't make it especially better. Of course it's different if you've literally been indoctrinated from birth or if you've developed those ideas yourself, but even one who's been indoctrinated may be beyond saving at some point, and only perpetuating that same evil.

I get the impression it all risks falling into an argument from free will - that people who are evil are only those who /choose/ consciously to do evil even though they know it to be evil. But while I can picture what you'd mean by that, in a certain sense, I don't think anyone /chooses/ anything, ever; and I don't think we can just call it a day when someone does monstrous things in good faith. When people believe that, it also pushes others to dehumanisation (e.g. of Nazis) because of the fear that, if they were humanised, we'd start empathising with them and stop thinking of them as villains. I think the dichotomy "this person is a human acting for reasons that are understandable and make sense to them, BUT they're also absolutely wrong and must be stopped" is an important one to be able to hold in one's mind. Which, seems to me, is also OP's point.
