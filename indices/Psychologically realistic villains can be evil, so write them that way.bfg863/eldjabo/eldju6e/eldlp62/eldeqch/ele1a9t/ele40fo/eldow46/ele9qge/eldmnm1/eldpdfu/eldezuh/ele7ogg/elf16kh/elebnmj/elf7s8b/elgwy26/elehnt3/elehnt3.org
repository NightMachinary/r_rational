I think one of the biggest problems you will have is that you have to *define* evil in a meaningful fashion, while also convincing others to use your definition of 'evil'.

The problem with this, at least in English, is that the word 'evil' has as many connotations, definitions, and interpretations as the word 'love'.

This is the foundation of your problem, of which there are numerous tiers built atop it that have to be agreed upon. Subjective evil VS objective evil (ie: Some things are evil differing on viewpoint or culture, while other things should be considered universally evil), selfishness VS selflessness, power and sacrifice.

I think your primary problem is a category error where you declare that you have a definition of evil, and a majority of other people have a different /single/ definition. In reality, almost /everyone has a different definition/.

Also, it would help greatly if you /paid attention to the source material/. Fire Lord Ozai isn't just randomly crazy and murderous. He has events in his past which shaped him and his philosophy, and he's operating under a really big sunken cost fallacy (thanks to the actions of his ancestors) to continue finishing the family's work despite all the destruction it's caused and will cause in the future. He's not murdering people for the lulz like the Joker, he's doing it as a means to an end--make the entire world as prosperous and quick to advance as the Fire Nation, /exactly/ as his ancestor wanted to do a century ago. There was even an entire episode based around this, where we see his motivations, those of his ancestors, and exactly how things got so screwed up.

In addition, your interpretation of Sodom and Gomorrah is equally simplistic. Sure, God *could* have decided to just brainwash them all and magically turn them into good people (which, if you're on Rational, you should immediately have a gut-clenching reaction to the functional destruction of their 'self' that this entails). Or maybe he could have turned them into rabbits or something silly. But that's just /you/ coming up with the ideas for someone else's story, completely ignoring everything else.

The way the story was actually written, God said he was going to destroy the towns because their people were evil both in deed and in the oppression of other good people. Abraham argues with God, saying that it's not right to kill the good people with the bad, and starts by getting God to agree that killing 50 good people in the process is not the right thing to do. After a bit of haggling, Abraham gets God to agree that killing even 5 good people in the process is bad. Abraham seems content at this.

Of course, in true rational fashion, having a human try to outwit a much more powerful and knowledgeable being doesn't end how the human expects. And thus it's no surprise when God sends a couple messengers (angels) to just go get the small group of good people, lead them out, *then* level the cities. And in the process, we see what kind of person Lot is, and we see what kind of people live in those cities, and we realize that, hey, maybe places where its socially acceptable for citizens to form mobs and sexually assault visiting foreigners /probably/ aren't the kind of cultures you want enforcing their subjective moral frameworks.

Now, for some scraps that require individual attention:

#+begin_quote
  But when I think about being in a position where I can totally do whatever I want to people, suddenly I kind of do want to hurt people.
#+end_quote

That's your lizard hindbrain talking, running on primitive instinct and the use of said power. Higher-order evil, the non-primitive kind that uses the big wrinkly parts of the cerebrum, that one comes up with /ideas/ on how to get more power or to force others to abide by your whims.

Sure, hurting individual people is great on the short term, but wouldn't you rather simply take all those stupid people or the ones who oppose you and move them somewhere else? If you never have to encounter them again, never have to have those spikes of hatred or wanting them dead, isn't that better for everyone? And, you know, if you get your underlings to run the program for you so you don't have to waste time on it, isn't that even better? They can do all the work, and you can go through life never needing to feel those primitive urges, because the people who support you, they are helping you with this problem. You have such good people! Finally, what happens if your underlings instead follow /their/ primitive urges, and decide that its much more effective to just eliminate those people, perhaps even use a little bit of their thinking forebrains and point out how that keeping 'those' people alive requires you to spend more time and resources on them, so wouldn't disposing of them be a good idea? You're not just helping you or your nation, but the entire world! You have a solution for those people you don't like, and it's great for everyone!

You may call it a slippery slope if you wish, but it's not /that/ difficult to go from spiteful little man with some power to Hitler. Just a bit of rationalizing and a /whole lot/ of power. The problem is that most people don't want to /admit/ that, because they'd prefer to Other-ize the Evil in order to protect themselves from the realization that /they might do the same thing, if given the chance/. Because evil is a part of them, too. This is the thing that most people don't want to admit, because their pride gets in the way. How /dare/ you say that they are capable of such? Don't you know they'd /never/ do such a thing? Heh.

  The necessary condition to psychologically understand evil is to be in a position to do evil.
#+end_quote

Nonsense. A monk or a philosopher or a writer can come to a psychological understanding of evil /just fine/, even while being separated from others or dealing in a strictly hypothetical, non-physical framework. This foundation is built on sand.

  It's hard to understand why a lot of weird sex acts are sexy unless and until you're doing it, at which point
#+end_quote

At which point you might just be bored and confirm what you already knew--that stuff isn't for you. Those 'weird' things, which are called /kinks/, don't apply to everyone. It's worthwhile voyage of discovery to find what you like, though.

#+begin_quote
  It just seems gross and even boring. How were you getting off to that?
#+end_quote

That's because you've "released the pressure", so to speak, and your body is less interested and thus your mind follows.

#+begin_quote
  So please stop tying yourself into knots trying to write psychologically realistic villains. Evil is psychologically realistic.
#+end_quote

I /think/ you might want to rephrase that.

Finally...

#+begin_quote
  If you talk about culture war things in this thread instead of talking about writing psychologically complex and realistic Evil villains, then you are Evil.
#+end_quote

Considering your references to 'punching Nazis', this carries so much hypocrisy that it hurts. I'll assume you're trying to be humorous when you imply that anyone who doesn't do what you want is somehow evil. ;)
