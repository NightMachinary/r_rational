I think part of the issue is that people like stories of falls. Which often involves good intentions souring or inching into extremism, or relatively minor mistakes poorly handled with worse actions to fix or conceal them. Or they jumped to the deadly endpoint via rapid magical corruption, Arthas-style. A fall is a bridge from here to there, as it were. But if that is not the focus of the story then sometimes authors try to include hints to in in the world building or villain-focused episodes.

But is "morally complex" the right phrase here? "Complex" seems sufficient. I don't think that fact that a villain is motivated by intentions that are not necessarily evil, or used to be good, or has regular familiar human traits, really has a moral function for the character in the here and now. And I don't think that understanding a character makes them less of a monster worthy of revulsion. I don't think the fact that a murderous psychopath had their own family struggles in their youth makes not "not evil". Pitiable in that respect, perhaps. Tragic, maybe, if those experiences are what set them on their present path.

Exploring how an ordinary person might go bad, or be secretly fundamentally bad all along, is an important function of fiction.

For me, one of the greatest villains I've seen is one we haven't even seen properly in that villainous capacity yet: Solas of Dragon Age: Inquisition. All the way through that game he is your quiet and earnest confidante, intelligent and thoughtful in ways few other characters are. You get to know him well, or at least you think you do. Many of the lies he tells are true, which is what makes them so believable even as you get the completely wrong idea, though in my view he is more skilled at lying to himself than to anyone else. And then at the end of the Tresspasser DLC he betrays you and pledges to destroy the entire world for reasons that I completely understand. I can't even bring myself to hate him. I don't just want to stop him to save the world, I want to stop him to save him. Even after what he did and what he has set out to do, I can't stop thinking of him as a friend I need to help even as I know we're both going to kill a lot of people to win, people who we both would rather have lived. I think this is probably how Charles Xavier feels about Magneto.
