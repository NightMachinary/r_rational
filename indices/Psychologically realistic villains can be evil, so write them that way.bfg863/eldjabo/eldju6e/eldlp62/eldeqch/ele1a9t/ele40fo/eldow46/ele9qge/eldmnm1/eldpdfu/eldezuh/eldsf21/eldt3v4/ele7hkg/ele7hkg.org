I think evil only exists in that unnerving divide between action and personality. You ply the character with likable traits and then make them do awful things without remorse. Thats when a character is evil, where it doesnt match their personality.

I mean inherently hitler isnt evil, he just did evil things ergo makijg him evil. I dont think anyone who does things for a belief that they are trying to improve the world can be evil like hannibal lector or something. The complexity comes from the duality of the readers responses to realising hitler likes ice cream but he likes to kill jews more.
