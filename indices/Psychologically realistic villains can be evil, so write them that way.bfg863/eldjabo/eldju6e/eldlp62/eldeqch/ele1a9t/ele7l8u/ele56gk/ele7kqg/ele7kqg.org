Doesn't that dilute the word "evil"?

If I gossip about a coworker so that way she's passed over for a promotion, does that make me evil?

If the point of this essay is "it's OK to write people who are just evil", then if evil is literally anything that isn't Right, then, well, that's not very satisfying is it?

Like is what I'm meant to get out of this essay "you don't need to tell people Hitler liked dogs in order to write him as a compelling villain", and yeah, fair enough, but the other extreme is having Hitler be like "I want to set up concentration camps and kill and torture people just for funsies!" and then that doesn't give you things to help you write the rest of the story (he likes concentration camps and killing people... but how does that relate to his military strategy? IDK), whereas if you give him a motivation - say it's "take over Europe and destroy weaker races" - then you can say "well he thinks $COUNTRY is full of weaker races, so that would make sense as his first target" OR "well $COUNTRY is nearby, has a weak army and lots of resources, so that makes sense as his first target".

I don't know if that articulates my point? Like, writing stories with villains that act rationally / consistently is hard, and giving them motivations that aren't completely inscrutable helps make them have a "consistent" set of actions, and gives you more story ideas later?
