  It's tricky because there's a risk of going the other way: having someone who literally just wants to kill people For No Reason, and that makes it hard to hang more plot hooks off them.

Why? Are you making this conclusion based on the fact that someone who wants to kill people "for no reason" would be an irrational actor, and thus they would have completely unpredictable behavior that wouldn't be compatible with the construction of a rational plot? Because it's possible to write a villain that rationally pursues an irrational goal.

For example, take infamous cannibal Issei Sagawa. Clearly, his desire to feast on human flesh was irrational. However, his behavior is not "random" or "unpredictable." [CW: cannibalism/violence] He didn't go into public, attack strangers, and start gnawing on their faces. Instead, he found a classmate he selected on the basis that she was beautiful and healthy (characteristics that he felt he lacked and wanted to "consume"), he invited her to his apartment to participate in a reading assignment, and asked her to read several passages into a tape recorder so that she would be distracted/immersed in the assignment and unable to see or resist him at the moment that he shot her in the back of the neck with a rifle. After consuming part of her body, he attempted to dispose of her remains in a nearby lake, he was caught, but clearly he was taking steps in trying to /not/ get caught: he didn't just sling her corpse over his shoulder and waddle down to the lake; he carved up her body so that he could fit her into several suitcases, which would allow him to transport the remains away from his apartment without revealing that he was wheeling around a human corpse. His goal ("eat human flesh") was irrational, but his method for achieving that goal was arguably rational.

I think that OP's point is that writing a story about a cannibal who kills people because he wants to eat them is not so different from writing a story about a vigilante who kills criminals out of a sense of "justice" in several respects: first, they would still have some set of criteria that they use to select victims. Secondly, they would still presumably try to formulate and execute their plans to kill people without getting caught.

They don't have to be motivated by things like "duty" or "status," presumably the hedonic motivation (the "urge to kill" or "the desire for human flesh" whatever) is all that they need. I believe OP's point is that we would look at the vigilante and say, "Oh, that's realistic because the vigilante's motivation for killing people is justice, which is at least adjacent to my own value system, they just have a warped sense of justice." Why can't we also look at the example of someone like Issei Sagawa and say, "Oh, that's realistic because (apart from the fact that Issei Sagawa is a real person who did those things in real life) his motivation for killing people is a hedonic urge, and I know what it's like to succumb to hedonic impulses that make me want to engage in unhealthy behaviors, it's just that his 'unhealthy hedonic impulses' made him hunger for human flesh instead of chocolate, and also he lacked a self-imposed or externally-imposed morality to keep him from murdering people. But, uh, if a person has hedonic impulses that drive them to kill people, and they lack a sense of morality that would prevent them from killing people, the word 'evil' could probably describe that person. In fact, one could argue that 'lack of morality' is the definition of the word evil, and 'killing people in order to achieve a selfish end' is also probably encompassed by the word 'evil.'"

To revisit your premise:

So like, we would look at the example of the Issei Sagawa story and say, "Oh, that poor woman, she died For No Reason." But in the literal sense, the reason for her death was that he wanted to consume human flesh, and she was a readily-available option for him to achieve that end. From a narrative standpoint, you can still have a villain who has things like "motivations" that are central to constructing a functional character and a functional plot, while also making those "motivations" alien to us.

  They don't kick a dog they walk past to demonstrate they're evil, because that doesn't have them fulfill their duty/increase their status. But maybe that means my villains aren't evil, they're just, well, antagonists?
#+end_quote

I dunno, if someone killed millions of people to fulfill their duty and increase their status, I'd still call them evil, even if they never went out of their way to kick a dog. I doubt Hitler and Stalin kicked dogs on the regular, but it would be pretty difficult to define evil in a way that doesn't include Hitler and Stalin. (I say this fully aware that there are people who have definitions of 'evil' that do not include Hitler and Stalin, and I will stand by the position that these definitions of 'evil' are not useful for anything.) Having a motivation/goal for something doesn't magically cause your actions to be "merely antagonistic, not evil."

  Isn't it enough that the King makes the peasants work for 12 hours a day with meagre rations without him having to torture the children Just For Fun?
#+end_quote

Again, I think OP's point is that if someone was going to write a story about a King who makes peasants work for 12 hours a day with meager rations, in attempt to make the story more "realistic" they might talk about how the king really believes he's doing this for the greater good, or because he had a tragic backstory, when in fact he could just be doing this because he wants to accumulate more wealth for himself. Hey, working peasants to the bone just so you can have a marginally more pleasurably existence sounds pretty evil to me! In fact, I think that the king making peasants work for 12 hours a day with meager rations is /exactly/ what OP is talking about when he says "just let villains be evil."

I don't think OP's point in saying "Just let characters be evil" was to say "make your villains kick dogs more," I think it was more, "Just be content to say 'they steal because they're selfish' instead of trying to tell us that they actually have a more complex motivation for what they're doing (e.g. "a misguided sense of justice") or pretending that they only do these things because they were abused as a child."
