I'm not really sure there's such a thing as an "irrational goal". You can pursue a goal in a way that's irrational, but what exactly makes one goal more rational than another? Basing it off of what the average person desires is obviously nonsense; wanting to be happy wouldn't suddenly be an irrational goal if 99% of humanity (for whatever reason) wanted to pointlessly suffer.
