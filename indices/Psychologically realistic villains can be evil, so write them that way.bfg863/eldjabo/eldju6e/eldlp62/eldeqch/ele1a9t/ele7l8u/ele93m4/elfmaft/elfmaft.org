  I don't think OP's point in saying "Just let characters be evil" was to say "make your villains kick dogs more," I think it was more, "Just be content to say 'they steal because they're selfish' instead of trying to tell us that they actually have a more complex motivation for what they're doing (e.g. "a misguided sense of justice") or pretending that they only do these things because they were abused as a child."

Yeah.

Might write some stuff later about portraying cartoonishly evil villains as complex and evolving characters. I think Zhao from /Avatar: The Last Airbender/ is a great example of doing this right.
