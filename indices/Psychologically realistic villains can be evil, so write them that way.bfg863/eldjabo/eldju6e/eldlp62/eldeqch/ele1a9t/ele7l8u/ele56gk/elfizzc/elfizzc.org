I think that Burton's Joker and Nolan's Joker are good contrasts here. Both are supposed to be "evil" and "crazy" but Burton's Joker doesn't operate on any internal logic. He just does random evil crazy stuff. Meanwhile, Nolan's Joker is still an unsympathetic force of nature, but he operates (however imperfectly) under a set of principles. That makes it easier to understand his goals, even if I don't sympathize with him.

Contrast that with the new Joker trailer where we learn that he...loves his mom? This is obviously designed to make him seem human and relatable. In a way that the other Jokers are not.
