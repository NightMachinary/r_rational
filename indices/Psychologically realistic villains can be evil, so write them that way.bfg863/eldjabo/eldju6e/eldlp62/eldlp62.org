I feel the word Evil was invented as a means to distance ourselves from even trying to understand our enemies. It's a useful deception when you're trying to live with yourself while fighting a war, or when you want to only ever worry about your in-group. I believe in apathy, selfishness, destructivity... but Evil? Characterizing people as Evil is so often an excuse to turn off our moral muscle that I distrust any attempt to do so in real life, and fiction trains us for real life. Nazis are nazis because they characterize jews as Evil, for example, so even characterizing nazis as Evil is dangerous.

So I'm glad when some storytellers decide that the reader will be able to empathise with the characters that the protagonists find inconvenient: it builds habit.

There's also the part where a lot of battles in epic storytelling play out like debates, which is a very powerful tool: on top of the often boring question of "will x win?", they're adding another: "should x win?"
