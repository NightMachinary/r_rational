Amoral vs Immoral is an important distinction. also, morality is defined by culture. cultures of cannibals did exist, and for them canibalism was 'good'. this resulted in some unique parasites, so it was a bad choice on their part overall.

Sadism is one explination for some evil. the sadit enjoys causing pain, and gravitates to roles where they have power over others. you know, teachers, caregivers, prison guards, and so on.

evil can be petty. look at all the stories of petty corruption at schools. and homeowners associations (a true sourcer of petty evil indeed). not murderers or felons, just people making the lives of others into a living hell because they can.

oh, and dont forget the appeal to authority villian. they cant be wrong, they go to the right church! this does not need to be misguided, its quite possible they are just sociopaths and know full well what they do.
