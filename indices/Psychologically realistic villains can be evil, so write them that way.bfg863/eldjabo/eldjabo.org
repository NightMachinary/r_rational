Major food groups of villains:

- psychopaths, literally doesn't care about anyone: Hannibal Lector

- ingroup caring only, immense horror wreaked on outgroup: Genghis Khan, Adolf Hitler

-- closely related: generally goodish person who has a hate-on for a morality-excepted target, and poor deontological guardrails in pursuit of that target

- selfish, follows own incentives, inadequate-equilibria villains: concentration camp guard who doesn't enjoy his work

- fanatic in the service of an obviously wrong "Good" with no deontological guardrails; reader is not meant to question whether these morals are actually right

- misguided person with obvious false beliefs trying to serve an agreeable Good-as-final-goal; reader is not meant to question whether these beliefs are actually right

- the opposition has reasonable beliefs in the service of reasonable goals and abides by reasonable deontological guardrails; either this story is being cast as high tragedy, or readers should experience doubt about who's in the right

- the opposition is correct and the protagonist is wrong: Amelia Bones / Dumbledore during the Azkaban arc

- Good vs. Good is primary focus of story: readers should be arguing years later about which party was actually in the right
