I mean, everyone in that arc is wrong. The authorities are trying to keep people in Torture Prison, which is obviously wrong. Harry is breaking a mass-murdering psychopath who tortured his friend's parents into insanity out of the prison which contained her, which is wrong. That Voldemort is wrong goes without question. That whole arc is just a tragedy.
