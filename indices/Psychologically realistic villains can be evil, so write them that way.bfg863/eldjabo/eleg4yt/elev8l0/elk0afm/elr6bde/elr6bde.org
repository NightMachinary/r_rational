Reminds me of a similar situation in the Impel Down arc of One Piece, where Luffy tries to break out his brother from the tyrannical government's prison, and in doing so frees a lot of political prisoners... but also a lot of murderous scummy pirates who will surely cause a lot of trouble to the world in the following years. Some of which he had spent whole arcs making sure they'd end up IN there in the first place!
