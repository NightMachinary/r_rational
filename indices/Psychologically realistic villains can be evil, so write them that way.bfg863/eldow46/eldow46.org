I wish there were more Occasional Villains. That is, ordinary people who briefly fall into the Joker's pit, a.k.a the One Bad Day that pushes you over the edge so you hit your wife or your kid, or you ram that idiot's car in a rage, etc.

One bad impulsive decision, then the character tries to cover it up because they're still in denial over it, then the discrepancies or lies start spilling over, leading to more bad decisions, etc. Or possibly, characters that are only evil once because the circumstances just push them there for a brief moment.
