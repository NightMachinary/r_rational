Part of the problem with finding psychologically realistic villains in fiction is that authors are human; and the villain is there to elicit specific emotions from the reader. A psychologically realistic villain elicits multiple types of reader response. Some root for him. (An author who tries to create a /really evil/ villain might feel that he is failing if people are rooting for the villain - didn't he make it clear enough that Evil McEvilson is /really super evil/? Perhaps slip in a few more scenes of him kicking puppies and hating ice cream, just to drive the point home...)

Worse yet, giving the villain non-villainous qualities risks some readers /identifying/ with the villain. If the villain has a favourite ice cream flavour, then some reader might say "Hey, that's my favourite flavour too!" - and then, a few pages later, "Nooooo! That person who likes the same flavour ice cream as me is a mass murderer! This book is /insulting my ice cream choices!/" (It's worse if the villain is, say, Jewish. Then your book runs the risk of being labelled as antisemetic. Regardless of any other factors.)
