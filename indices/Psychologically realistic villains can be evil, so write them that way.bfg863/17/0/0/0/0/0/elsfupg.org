There's a big difference between ‘I'm OK with torturing them because I don't care about their suffering, we are superior, and they are out-tribe' and ‘I'm OK with torturing them because I genuinely believe that they, specifically, can't have subjective experience and thus cannot suffer'. The first is blatantly evil, the latter is debatably still evil, but at least confused and much less blatant about it. Nazis were in the former camp.
