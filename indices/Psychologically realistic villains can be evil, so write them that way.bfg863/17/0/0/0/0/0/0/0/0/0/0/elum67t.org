I just mean I don't think there is anything anywhere we could define as 'free will'. There is just a big gap of knowledge due to the chaotic nature of human beings as a physical system, but the more we know, the smaller that gap becomes. Everything you do will be the consequence of either your genetics or something you learned, experienced, etc. Hence, relying too much on the notion of choice as if it was removed from these physical influences risks undermining any ethical system.
