Given that he can safely stand on top of a snow bank while other people have to trudge through, I think that this:

#+begin_quote
  Suppose that Legolas has a mass of 60 kg
#+end_quote

... is not a safe assumption. From the books:

#+begin_quote
  With that [Legolas] sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the snow.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how this ability works (they're probably not /actually/ lighter, since that means a hit to their shield would send them flying) but it probably accounts for some of the giant dump that Legolas is taking on the laws of physics.
