Per /The Silmarilion/ and other histories, elves basically have 'ignore physics' as an at-will power.

All of the older elves left in Middle-Earth can leave their body somewhere while they explore as 'unclothed souls', heal by imparting a measure of immortality, see the future or past, craft impossible things, etc.

Walking on snow, or up falling stones, is clearly impossible for humans (and shitty CGI). For an elf it's simply a matter of living more in the nonphysical world for a few moments.
