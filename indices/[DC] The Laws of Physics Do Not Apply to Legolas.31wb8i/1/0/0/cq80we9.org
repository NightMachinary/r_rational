I haven't watched any other version... frankly, the whole idea of "The Hobbit" being longer than a single movie implies more padding than I can sit through.

This version is still too long for my tastes. I agree, Alfrid could have been excised, along with 95% of the lake-town politics. And the barrel ride, and at least half the battle of five armies. What I'd like to see added in? I can't believe they left out Thorin's funeral and the final fate of the Arkenstone, but apparently that's Peter Jackson's blunder.
