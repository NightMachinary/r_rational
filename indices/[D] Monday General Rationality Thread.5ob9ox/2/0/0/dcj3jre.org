I think a way to test this would be to do a partial functional hemispherectomy. Instead of cutting off all sensory input and motor output, just limit some of the inputs and none of the outputs (e.g. functionally deafen the other hemisphere, but leave vision, touch, motor movement, etc. intact).

You would then monitor the patient to see if you can attribute any changes in behaviour to distress as a direct result of that operation. If not, it strongly implies that there is no "other person".

Of course, you'd rightly be denied ethics approval for any such experiment even if we found a drug that could have the same effect (or a reversible procedure). After all, if the hypothesis is true then we're mutilating another person (and even if it's false, we're mutilating one anyway).

You might be able to achieve the same result by putting an eyepatch on a patient who has had a corpus callostomy, but I don't know enough neurology to say.
