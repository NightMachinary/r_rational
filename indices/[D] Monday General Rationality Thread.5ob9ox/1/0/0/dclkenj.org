#+begin_quote
  then the second should score more.
#+end_quote

And that's the issue, in SethBling's code, the function has a harsh penalty for taking time. The first will almost always be a higher fitness in his code.

#+begin_quote
  small advantages like that would have little impact compared to legitimate progress.
#+end_quote

The fitness function does not account for that in the original code, and I struggled to create a fitness function to account for that myself. Part of why I left the code behind.

#+begin_quote
  lines through the map that indicate progress
#+end_quote

Right, that's a potential option, but there is a way to dynamically tell if a direction is the correct one in general. It however, does not define the exact correct path.

You should run SethBling's code on the first of level 2 in Super Mario World, as your understanding here would be greatly increased on what I'm talking about.
