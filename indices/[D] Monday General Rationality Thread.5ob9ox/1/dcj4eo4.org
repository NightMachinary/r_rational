Here's a post on adventures in ai:

So, here's a question, and I'm going to give you a mid-complexity answer. How on earth do we even make GAI? One step at a time.

I know that there's plenty of people who are knowledgeable in the area here, but I don't think we can actually stay away from discussing it for too long. In 2015 (oh dear it's been a year and a half now) SethBling came out with MarI/O - a neural net designed to play Super Mario World on the SNES. (link here: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44]]) During that time, I became infatuated with AI and machine learning in general, and read scholarly paper after scholarly paper on the subject. This was during the time when Andrej Karpathy wrote [[http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/]["The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks"]]

That article and SethBling's MarI/O ai ate about a 6-month period of my life, and I had a ton of fun with the basics of ai from a programming standpoint. If you find them as fun as I did, you might even start playing with the ai yourself! Anyway, Andrej has made his ai package publically available via Lua - (SUPER SLOW WITHOUT A GPU) there are versions which work with OpenCL and CUDA available on github, check it out. Additionally, and more simple to setup, you have MarI/O which is available to run via a pastebin post of his Lua code. You'll want to run the code on the latest version of BizHawk found here: [[http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources.html]]

After reading SethBling's original code, I noticed that there were a *LOT* of weaknesses in the code which I attempted to improve upon on my own git repo here: [[https://github.com/Dwood15/LuaNEAT-rnn]] For more information on what I saw wrong and attempted to fix, the readme on that page should suffice. On an existential note, this AI does not actually have any indication that there is anything going on other than Mario. That is its reality, its Biome, if you will.

For those that have no desire to read the code, here's what's going on: First, we set up a lot of constants, we create a "Species" pool, and go from there. ([[/r/restofthefuckingowl]]) Sorry, this is all based off memory, and I'm lazy. Once we have the desired number of individuals and species for our generation, we run each one in mario, evaluating their fitness. Then we literally kill off the failures (delete them) and breed the ones that were acceptable according to our fitness function.

Originally, Sethbling's fitness function was merely just tracking how far to the right the ai would go, and penalized any delays whatsoever quite heavily. Instead, I chose to mess it up a bit. I have it so that no run ends early unless the ai hasn't transitioned the screen in a certain amount of time. This allowed me to ensure that the ai wasn't doing nothing, but at the same time, let me have it so I could go vertical or to the left, or down even.

Anyway, after all's done, each individual is "bred" with each other to produce a new individual or two, or three or four, which biases the ai towards progress, as defined by our fitness function and our culling function.

It does not adequately determine how different an ai is from another- if they all jumped off the cliff in the 2nd level, it would still pick the ones to the furthest right.

** This means, that for MarI/O, we need a new fitness function.

Anyway, I'm getting kind of rambly. It's late, so the post is getting cut abruptly. If this interested you, download my ai from my github here: ([[https://github.com/Dwood15/LuaNEAT-rnn]]) And run it on super mario world for the SNES! (BIZHAWK ONLY)
