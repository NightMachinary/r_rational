Reminds me of this study I read about paying for information (and how many people ended up doing it wrong).

Basically, information only has value if it has the potential to let you to make better choices as a result. Cynicism or nihilism that says "nothing can be done" or "nothing matters" is completely worthless if it causes you to behave the same as someone who believes everything they hear.
