That's what I thought to, until I spoke to people over at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/5f0u62/what_fact_checkers_do_you_trust/][r/AskTrumpSupporters about fact checkers]]. This actually is the false logic some people are using. Populists have internalized the notion that all media is biased, including the ones they follow, but have not attempted to fight against bias. It's an insidious form of cognitive dissonance that masquerades as rational thought, since it results in people embracing their own tribes in response to the dangers posed by other tribes doing the same.
