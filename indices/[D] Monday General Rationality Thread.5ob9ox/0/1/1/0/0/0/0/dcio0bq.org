  I see many fewer progressive types willing to admit that, say, NYT, WaPo, Politifact, etc have political biases than conservatives willing to admit that their media has biases. This is understandable, most conservative media is explicit and open about where it falls as a marketing technique

The tagline for FOX News, the largest conservative news network in the country, is "Fair and Balanced."

  whereas progressives has sunk an enormous amount of effort into marching through the institution of media, and acknowledging the resulting bias to an opponent would negate the point. Hence "NYT and NPR are bastions of objective journalism, while Fox News is worse than Bagdad Bob" seems like a fairly common progressive opinion regarding media bias.

And conservative media has sunk an enormous amount of effort into painting themselves as the brave underdogs against the liberal titans of hollywood and places like the NYT, despite FOX consistently having the highest ratings among cable news stations and conservative talk radio blanketing the national airwaves, with the sole notable exception of NPR. I think you might be confusing "more open with their bias" as "more ready to admit their biases."

  This, I think, is why the "fake news" meme went off the rails so quickly. A large chunk of progressives were super-primed to think of most/all conservative media that way long before someone came up with a catchy phrase to describe a different phenomenon.

Super-primed by who? Jon Stewart pointing out all the lies on FOX, or FOX for printing and broadcasting the lies in the first place? Or are you going to defend FOX's journalistic integrity?

I'm not saying that CNN or MSNBC aren't biased, and you can make fun of liberals for taking "facts have a liberal bias" seriously rather than tongue-in-cheek, but when the forerunners of conservative news is FOX and Rush Limbaugh, comparing them to "liberal media" is false equivocation.

"Politics is the mindkiller" is not an excuse for cynicism or the golden mean fallacy. "Both groups are biased, but conservative media is better at admitting it" is a slanted view, just in a different direction than "Conservative media has more bias than liberal media" is a slanted view.

#+begin_quote
  Oh, I don't know that they're actually better at recognizing it. My point is that they have an incentive to admit it, even if ironically, they fail to truly take it into account. Conversely, progressives have an incentive to pretend that the powerful institutions that they own are unimpeachable paragons, even when they are demonstrably not.

I've seen liberals attacking those "powerful institutions that they own" far more often than conservatives have their own media. Jon Stewart grew his most irate at FOX, but he facepalmed over CNN or HuffPo fairly often too.
