  I'm not saying that CNN or MSNBC aren't biased

I haven't checked recently, but I remember CNN being a /centrist/ network. When I see their coverage today, it seems basically identical in tone and content. It seems to me that if people now think CNN has a liberal bias, it's more logical to conclude the center has once again shifted rightward -- as it has been /nonstop for the past 37 years/.
