  From my observations, I see (generally speaking) "we're all biased, but my side is better/more honest about it" from the right, versus "they are fake news but my side is solidly factual" from the left.

Speaking of playing football... to make this kind of claim, I feel like you have to either be affected quite a bit by some sample bias in what liberals/conservatives you speak to, or misattributing the epistemology that goes into decrying "fake news" as just "news that is biased." Or you just think that liberals are inherently more prone to irrationality, which... you know. Speaking of biases and all.

The phrase didn't gain traction when FOX was every liberal's punching bag and conservatives blamed every fact they didn't like on "the liberal media." It only became a national talking point when literal fake news began dominating social media... and by both [[https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.ho61n9AXN#.kiJMmQgPk][research]] and one of the major creator's [[http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/17/purveyor_of_fake_news_says_he_targeted_trump_supporters_influenced_election.html][own admissions]], the fake news that got the most attention and most shares were the ones aimed at conservatives against liberals.

[[http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/29/conservatives_aren_t_the_only_ones_who_believe_fake_news.html][That doesn't mean that liberals can't fall for fake news]], or that their side is "solidly factual." But the idea that conservatives are better at recognizing bias in their own media, by any appreciable margin, is not supported by any evidence I've seen. If you have some, please share it.
