I take issue with people distrusting fact checkers for the same reasons i dislike mistrusting scientists. While I believe science is much more important and reliably true, there is still a clear methodology for determining objective truth that the profession enforces within itself to maintain its credibility. I don't implicitly trust fact checkers and no one should, but a mistrust towards the field in general strikes me as anti-intellectualism.
