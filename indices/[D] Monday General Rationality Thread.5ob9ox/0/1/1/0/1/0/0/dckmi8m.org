How do you know they have a double standard? Everything I've read by Politifact, FactCheck.org, and Snopes has seemed like an objective viewpoint based upon verifiable evidence. I don't put them on the same level as scientists, but there is still reliable methodology for researching and verifying claims. The fact checkers I follow have consistently held to those methods, so I see no reason to doubt them implicitly.
