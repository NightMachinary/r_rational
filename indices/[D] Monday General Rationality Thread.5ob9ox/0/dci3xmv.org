This comment about propaganda in modern politics has been making the rounds on both [[https://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5ntjh2/all_this_fake_news/dceozzo/][r/bestof]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5ntjh2/all_this_fake_news/dceozzo/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=AdviceAnimals][r/depthhub]], so I thought I'd share it here due to the incredibly important implications it has for the current state of rationality in our society.
