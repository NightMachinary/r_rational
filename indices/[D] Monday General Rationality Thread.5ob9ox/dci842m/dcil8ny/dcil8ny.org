That was really interesting, and reminded me of how interesting split brained people are. Unfortunately, while reading about this I learned about "the functional hemispherectomy", which is probably the most horrifying thing I've learned of in a long time.

  If that is unnerving, try this on for size: In some cases, the hemispheres aren't just severed from each other. In the past, the right hemisphere would sometimes be completely removed (hemispherectomy). This could cause all kinds of complications, so eventually a new procedure was developed - the functional hemispherectomy - which severed all tissues supporting sensory input and motor output from the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere doesn't die, but it can no longer access any sensory information (sight, etc.) and it can no longer cause the body to move. At all. It just lives on, in the dark and silence, unable to do anything at all. These procedures are sometimes still performed. (Ben Carson was actually one of the pioneering neurosurgeons behind them!)

    So my question for you is -- what do you think happens to that person who is in an empty hemisphere, locked out of all sensory input and motor control? Do you think they're conscious? Do you think they're wondering what happened? Do you think they're happy that the other half of them is living a happy normal life? Do they sit rapt in unconditioned contemplation of their own consciousness like an Aristotelian god? Or do they go mad with boredom, constantly desiring their own death but unable to effect it?
