Julian Jayne's [[http://www.meltingasphalt.com/hallucinated-gods/][Bicamaral Mind]] has been on my brain ever since I read about it, and it seems like a fascinating theory that maps closely to my own lived experiences, and it makes for a fascinating read. Even if the theory is totally wrong, it asks some important questions that no one else seemed to ask. Maybe the answers to those questions that Jaynes gets are wrong, but he's asking the right questions.
