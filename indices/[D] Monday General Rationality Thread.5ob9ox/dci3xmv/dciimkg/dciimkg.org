  Someone else pointed that comment out to me recently as well. My initial response is that cynicism, believing in nothing, is rational. It takes a lot of work and mental energy to sort signal from noise. There's a lot more news (or things that look like news) and the overall signal is starting to be overwhelmed in noise. So it's a rational sort of response to just write the entire spectrum of information off as a lost cause.

  However, I don't think blaming the victims (the public) is a good approach to solving this issue. Yes the news is noisier. Yes, people are starting to disbelieve all of it. But the solution isn't to shame and blame people for not taking the mental energy and time to parse the news. That just taxes everyone to maintain the status quo. The solution is to remove the noise from the signal, create punishments that hurt noise-miners.
