I would say that "field" is severely overstating things. There are what, four fact checkers? Two of them well known enough to be cited, ever? Mistrusting "scientists" is a vastly less dicey proposition when there are 4 small research institutes in the entire country, and all of them are funded by oil companies.

Frankly, placing those fact checkers on the same tier of presumption as "scientists" is /insane/. We have several /centuries/ of evidence for believing that even if many scientists are wrong about something, the truth will come out. We have barely a decade of evidence regarding fact checkers, and much of it says "they have a giant, partisan double standard".
