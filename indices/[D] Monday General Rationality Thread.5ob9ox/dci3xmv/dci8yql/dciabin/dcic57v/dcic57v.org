Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Why do /you/ trust self-appointed fact checkers? Would you trust one funded by Breitbart? Even if they could point to a few times they said a Dem was being honest, and a Rep was being dishonest? You mention in your linked post that you consider them unbiased, but that's honestly laughable, particularly from someone in this sub. Everyone has biases, *particularly* when talking politics, because Politics Is the Mindkiller. Someone claiming to be totally unbiased is a major red flag that they are full of shit. If they at least mention which way they think their biases go, well, that's a show of good faith. It means they're at least trying to take it into account, and that /I/ can take it into account as well.

"Everybody is biased" is a much more common (and reasonable) claim than "everyone is false news propaganda". From my observations, I see (generally speaking) "we're all biased, but my side is better/more honest about it" from the right, versus "they are fake news but my side is solidly factual" from the left. Neither of them is falling into that cynicism pit you originally linked to.

The simple fact is that there are only a few formal "Fact Checking Organizations" and all of them are associated with leftwing outlets. That's not to say factchecking doesn't happen on the right, but it's decentralized. You say in the linked thread that you trust them because they hold themselves to a higher standard than regular journalists, but that could still easily fall below acceptable standards. Remember politifact's nonsense over "if you like your plan you can keep your plan"? Iirc, their defense was essentially that Obama did in fact make that promise, so totally true. On the other hand, I've seen them give republicans "mostly false" for not bending over backwards to mention potential counter-arguments to their own claims, /while admitting the claim itself was basically factual/. The whole debate over factcheckers has seemed to me, since 2012, to be mostly about one side wanting to be able to Appeal to Authority after their previous authorities (academia, newspapers) had lost a lot of credibility.

But that doesn't mean the people doubting Fact Checkers are disputing the concept of facts in general! Just from reading Instapundit during the course of this last administration, I've seen thousands of factchecking articles. They're just offered on their own merits, without any appeal to authority. And I've seen, online, on TV, and irl, the very fact of someone disputing the authority of the Fact Checkers being held as evidence that they dispute facts/logic/reason/etc in general.

TL;DR; This complaint comes off as someone in full football equipment, standing on a football field, in the act of throwing a pass, intently insisting that they're not playing political football. You are.
