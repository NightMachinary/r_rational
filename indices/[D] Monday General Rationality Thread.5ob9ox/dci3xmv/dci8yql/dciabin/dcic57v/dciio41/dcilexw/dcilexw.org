  Speaking of playing football... to make this kind of claim, I feel like you have to either be affected quite a bit by some sample bias in what liberals/conservatives you speak to, or misattrobuting the epistemology that goes into decrying "fake news" as just "news that is biased." Or you just think that liberals are inherently more prone to irrationality, which... you know. Speaking of biases and all.

I see many fewer progressive types willing to admit that, say, NYT, WaPo, Politifact, etc have political biases than conservatives willing to admit that their media has biases. This is understandable, most conservative media is explicit and open about where it falls as a marketing technique, whereas progressives has sunk an enormous amount of effort into marching through the institution of media, and acknowledging the resulting bias to an opponent would negate the point. Hence "NYT and NPR are bastions of objective journalism, while Fox News is worse than Bagdad Bob" seems like a fairly common progressive opinion regarding media bias. Meanwhile, conservative media is much more likely to market itself as such, as an "answer to liberal bias" or whathaveyou, so conservatives have much less incentive to pretend that Breitbart et al are perfect paragons of objectivity. Instead, they say that openly choosing sides is more honest, and a reason why their bias is lesser/better than progressive bias.

That was the case even before the "fake news" meme, and was independent of that meme. We've had almost a generation of a large percent of progressive types hearing Jon Stewart spend 2 hours a week telling them how Fox news lies and distorts and makes shit up. Remember "facts have a liberal bias"? Do you remember that that was a joke, before a disturbing number of people defended it as a face value truth?

This, I think, is why the "fake news" meme went off the rails so quickly. A large chunk of progressives were super-primed to think of most/all conservative media that way long before someone came up with a catchy phrase to describe a different phenomenon. Which is why, in a span of days, we went from "people are publishing Batboy-level political articles for clicks" to "here is a list of 200 vaguely conservative sites that are all shills owned by Putin".

Even just look at the OP here. Factcheckers are paragons of fairness, but his opponents just hate facts on principle.

I don't know that progressives are "inherently more prone to irrationality". I think both sides have quite a bit of it, and the incentive structures for both differ in interesting ways. One of those differences is in the way they describe the relation both sides share with partisan bias.

  But the idea that conservatives are better at recognizing bias in their own media, by any appreciable margin, is not supported by any evidence I've seen. If you have some, please share it.

Oh, I don't know that they're actually better at recognizing it. My point is that they have an incentive to /admit it/, even if ironically, they fail to truly take it into account. Conversely, progressives have an incentive to pretend that the powerful institutions that they own are unimpeachable paragons, even when they are demonstrably not.
