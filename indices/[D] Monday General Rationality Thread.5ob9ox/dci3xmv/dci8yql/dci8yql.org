Eh, seems to be a lot of projecting going on in that post. "Fake news" as a term was destroyed by the people who first coined it; the strict sense of "clearly false news written purely for clicks" lasted maybe a few days before people were using it to mean "everything from the other side". Then the other side applied that standard back at them, they squawked in impotent, idiot outrage for a few weeks, and are now calling for the term to be retired, having completely backfired.

Similarly, the bit from Sartre would be at least as familiar to any libertarian or conservative as it is to a progressive. The_Donald didn't invent that crap, they stole a technique and a gave it a new, gleeful vibrancy.

All that aside, the basic thesis seems invalid to me. The dynamic of cynicism doesn't work the same way in a dual party democracy as it does in a single party autocracy, because there's always someone from the other side to call out bullshit and lies. People either flock to the media of the side they lean to, which they more or less trust, or they conclude that it's all /bad/, but some truth can be gleaned by consuming widely while taking biases into account. That sort of cynicism is something that I think is rarely truly felt, but sometimes offered up as a sort of conciliatory gesture between people of different factions. "Let's accept that they're all garbage instead of arguing about which of us has a slightly greater credibility".
