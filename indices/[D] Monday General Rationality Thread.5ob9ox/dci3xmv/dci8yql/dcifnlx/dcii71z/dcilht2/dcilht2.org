I think cynicism and disdain for politics (eg "politicians are all assholes and people who listen to them are morons") often But Not Always come from toxic mindset that is hard to describe but easy to recognize. Basically, it's that attitude of "everything is fucked up because of /them/ and it will always stay this way, so it's not worth trying to make sense of it or make it better" that really annoys me.

Basically the intersection of learned-helplessness, tribal thinking and contrarianism.
