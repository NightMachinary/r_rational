Cat cannot have a draw with Pilgrim since that would set up a pattern of three, but what if she /lost/? Malanza needs a "victory" here to prevent the peasant revolts that the Augur foresaw, but that doesn't necessarily have to do with a battle between armies.

So what if Cat uses herself to buy time for her army to retreat, setting herself up for a heroic stand, and then allows herself to be captured by Pilgrim who will then force her abdicate as punishment. That's a victory for Malazna, a loss to break the pattern, and something that Cat has been planning to do this entire time anyway.

Cat would need some sort of failsafe to prevent them from just killing her when she "loses", and I don't see how this will give her leverage over the Grand Alliance. Also, this doesn't account for Kairos at all, so maybe a separate scheme there? Maybe the portal to Arcadia rips open at the last moment before they can kill Cat after her "loss", and this will force Cat, Pilgrim, and maybe Kairos to team up to defend against it. Teaming up with the familiar villain against the greater evil is a classic trope that Cat can swing in her favor, although this would cut very close to a redemption arc that Cat would need to avoid.
