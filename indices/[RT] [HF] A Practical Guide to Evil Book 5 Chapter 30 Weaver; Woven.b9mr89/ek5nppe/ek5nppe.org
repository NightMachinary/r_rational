Pilgrim's victory condition virtually requires Malanza to win a battle against Cat. Cat wants everyone to walk away without losing too much, and without a draw. Preferably while gaining leverage to implement the Accords and getting Black's soul. And Kairos wants truce talks for some unknown reason.

Although...rebellion might not occur if popular opinion shifts...

Kairos has some unknown source of information. What if they predict when/where a chunk of Arcadia comes into Creation, devils attack Malanza, then the Army of Callow comes in and saves the day?

Seems unlikely; too many points of failure. But it's unlikely that Cat would accept a loss against Malanza; too much risk of one of them being taken out of the playing field...

I suppose they could convince Kairos to attack Malanza, then betray him. Though Kairos may not want to attack, and might actually try to betray them first...
