I think she's overstating a bit how bad a single loss would be for her reputation.

People went to the street and called for blood when she was declared Arch-Heretic. People are sharing stories about her going to Keter and setting the place on fire. They already loved her when she was a blatant patsy for Malicia, and now she's dictating terms to continental powers. It would take way, way more than a defeat to shake her legitimacy in Callowan eyes.
