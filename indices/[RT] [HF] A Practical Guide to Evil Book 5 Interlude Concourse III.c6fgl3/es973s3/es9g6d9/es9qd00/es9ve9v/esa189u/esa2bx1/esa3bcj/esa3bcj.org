The dilemma that Cat is Cordelia's best and only real ally against the Dead King at the moment, also that Cordelia's standing and arguably the whole Grand Alliance is built on extremely uneven ground. Cat at this point could force the whole thing to come down just by being defended by troops from Procer against any Good nation. That every nation in the Grand Alliance has been ground down by either fighting Praes or fighting Callow, and that the casualties that they know are going to come from fighting the Dead King are going to leave them vulnerable. The kind of vulnerabilities that other ostensibly Good nations are quite willing to take advantage of if they have the advantage.
