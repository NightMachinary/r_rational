But does it work like that? the passage that i was thinking of was in chapter 34 " But what you will be surrendering, in truth, is rather more abstract: it is you ‘right to rule'." and then later clarified to be

"Though the earthly crown will not be taken from your brow, save if you yourself do so, you will have lost the authority of a ruler in the eyes of the Heavens,” the Grey Pilgrim said. “Lingering in that role after discarding it before Gods and men can only bring calamity.”

“I figure it'd be subtle at first,” I said. “Small nudges. Crops get a little worse, people listen a little less. If you keep holding, though, then it's a different story.”

“Disease and strife,” the Peregrine said, “and they will only grow, so long as authority is kept.”

​

And to me it's not super clear that you can necessarily separate the right to rule or the general leadership out from the more Kingly authority. Like he can certainly say that it's his inherent position based on his birth but does him saying that it is so define the situation? Like the way that i interpreted the assassinating of the Seljun was that Grey Pilgrim has a claim to the position but because he doesn't have it yet and so can't give up a crown that he didn't have, but Grey Pilgrim doesn't explicitly have the position that he's arguing that he's giving up in anything but the unofficial capacity in the first place. If that makes sense.
