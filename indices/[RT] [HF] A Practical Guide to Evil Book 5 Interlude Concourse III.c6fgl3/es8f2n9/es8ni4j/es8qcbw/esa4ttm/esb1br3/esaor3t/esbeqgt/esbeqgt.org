He is the Grey Pilgrim which in this case gives him if not outright rule then at least the beginnings of it especially considering he's of the family of a, but also the, Grey Pilgrim which gives him claim to the seat of Holy Seljun. Which is as he says the closest thing to a ruler that the Dominion ever has. But the problem is that he's not officially a claimant for the throne, he is only "a man who'd once been proposed heir to the Tattered Throne." from Peregrine II (the Tattered Throne is in reference of the position of Holy Seljun). Any authority that he had was gained based on his own actions and to a certain extent the Name that he had.
