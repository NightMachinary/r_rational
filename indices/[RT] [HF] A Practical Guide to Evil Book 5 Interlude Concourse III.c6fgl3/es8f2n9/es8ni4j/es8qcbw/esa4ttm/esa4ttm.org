I wonder if Grey Pilgrim's now lost influence over the Dominion was keeping some of the extremes at bay, like he was the unofficial leader people were looking to him for guidance previously is that included in their metaphorical crown? Like Saint was only kept under some kind of uh leash to be blunt by Grey Pilgrim's you know authority did that influence the situation? Rogue Sorcerer also started being more vocal in his protests post crown sacrifice but at the same time the situation was rapidly snowballing downhill.
