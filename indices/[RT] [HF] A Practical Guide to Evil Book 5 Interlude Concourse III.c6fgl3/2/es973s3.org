The part that gets me about the 10th crusade is that Cat offers to give them safe passage through Callow. She literally offered to join up and fight the Tower with them.

They had every opportunity but value-rigidity blinded the Crusaders to alternative plans. Dammit, they went to the work of cutting a stairway through the mountains so that's the route they're gonna use !!1
