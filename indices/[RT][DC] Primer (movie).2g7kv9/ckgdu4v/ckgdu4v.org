Sam Hughes ([[/u/sam512]], author of /Ra/ and /Fine Structure/) has written a number of things about /Primer/; [[http://qntm.org/primer][Primer Explained]], [[http://qntm.org/commentary][Fan Commentary]], [[http://qntm.org/coffin][Time Travel in Primer Explained]].

I love this movie. I rented it when it came out on DVD, mostly on a whim since I knew nothing going in. After I was done, I immediately had to watch it again, in part because I felt like I only understood half of it. /Primer/ is one of the best "a plot that the viewer solves" movies of all time.

This calls into question what sort of model of time travel is actually being used in the movie. At first it seems like it's the static universe (used in HPMOR, /The Time Traveler's Wife/, /Terminator/, and many others), then it seems like it's the branching timelines model (used in /Terminator 2/, the new /Star Trek/, and many others), but that incident sort of calls that into question.
