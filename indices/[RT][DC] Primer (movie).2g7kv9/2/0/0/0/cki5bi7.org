Going off memory, I'll try to hit all your points. The following comments might be inaccurate simply due to memory decay over time. SPOILERS HO!

  I liked the red-haired girl and I liked the main guy but I was either indifferent to or actively disliked every single other character, especially that teenager who talks like a four-year-old. If an actual four-year-old talks like a four-year-old it's cute, but when a teenager does it it's just creepy.

Mayuri(Mayushi?) has dependency issues from her parents(or grandparents, who were already raising her?)dieing when she was young. Probably thirteen at the oldest. Something happened when she was visiting their graves. Like, she was preparing to be taken away by her parents ghosts to be with them or something, and Okabe rushes to her, catches hold of her, and proclaims to the heavens that he, Hououin Kyoma, is taking Mayuri hostage from the heavens and she can't leave so long as he needs her for mad scientist experimentation and the like. Thus, Mayuri and Okabe fall into the roles of Mayushi and Hououin.

  What's with the fat hacker guy? Does he have any personality at all?

Daru? He's... eh.. Daru seems to just hang around Okabe because they're both misfits. Daru spends most of his time on the computer. The two most commonly noted things he does are hacking and playing.. um.. Love simulator/story games? He also apparently spends a bit of time on the *chan board they have, giving Christina(Damn, I can't remember her actual name for the life of me) the nickname of 'Channeler' when he finds she goes on them, by tricking her into completing the AYB meme.

He eventually finds a goal when the wandering warrior arrives, and it is implied that he improves as a person while trying to reach it.

  If you're going to do a slow start the characters really have to be solid and they weren't.

Mm. A valid point. As a time-travel story, a lot of the past was shown at the end as it was caused, wrapping it up in neat-ish self-caused timeline. It (probably?) could've done with a bit of the characters' background to set them up.

For curiosity's sake, how far have you watched?
