Movies are allowed. I've only seen it once on Netflix, but I certainly enjoyed that watch. I'll get around to a second viewing someday (and third, and fourth....).

Honestly, the most impressive aspect of this film is not the plot but the budget. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film][It was completed for $7000, and with only five people]]. Seven thousand! Five people! It's amazing that a timeless piece of cinema can be done like that.
