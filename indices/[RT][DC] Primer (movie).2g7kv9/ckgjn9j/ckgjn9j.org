In the vein of 'good timetravel movies', I recently saw Timecrimes (Los Cronocr√≠menes) and enjoyed it a lot. It was no Primer, but it was more tightly plotted and very fun. I recommend not reading anything about it before seeing it, it'll probably be more fun that way. It has some nudity and so forth so is not suitable for all ages.
