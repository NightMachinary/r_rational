I liked the red-haired girl and I liked the main guy but I was either indifferent to or actively disliked every single other character, especially that teenager who talks like a four-year-old. If an actual four-year-old talks like a four-year-old it's cute, but when a teenager does it it's just creepy. What's with the fat hacker guy? Does he have any personality at all? If you're going to do a slow start the characters really have to be solid and they weren't.
