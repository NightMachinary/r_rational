I understand the concept narratively, I just don't see how it works practically. How can these earths all have the memories of a default timeline that never existed? If time travel is normal in all the timelines, they shouldn't have any idea of what an earth looks like without time travel.

Sorry I like the story and the idea, I just wanna know how the author reconciles the above worth the idea of an HE cuz it's captured my interest.
