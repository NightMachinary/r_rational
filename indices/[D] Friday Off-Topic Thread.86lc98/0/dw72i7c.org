Aaand I just spent my week reading the whole of /Worth the Candle/. Curse you, alexanderwales! Hope you're planning to do something really evil and world-shattering with all these weeks of free time we're /sacrificing/ to you!

Seriously though, it's funny how many works of alexanderwales I've read that I expected not to like from the blurb/high concept and from the first chapters; usually I find myself with nothing to do and thinking "Eh, may as well read this weird thing he wrote, how bad could it be?", and bam, there goes my day/week. /Worth the Candle/, /The Dark Wizard of Donkerke/, /Shadows of the Limelight/, and /Branches on the Tree of Time/ so far (still can't get into the Frozen one, though).

On the one hand, maybe that means the author should advertise a little harder (I know the current blurb would have attracted me way more than the blurb at the time the story started). On the other hand, I think it's just the normal investment problem, where you can't really know if a story is worth investing hours into before you've invested a few hours into it, and that point you're kind of trapped either way.
