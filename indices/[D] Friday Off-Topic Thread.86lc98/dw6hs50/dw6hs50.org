Recently came across a show called [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WTOaGLSSXE][Thunderbolt Fantasy (youtube link to ep1)]]. Written by Gen Urobuchi, it is an action show in the style and medium of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove_puppetry][Chinese Glove Puppetry]]. I have almost zero interest in puppetry, but I respect Urobuchi enough that I decided to watch 3 minutes of this show.

"I'll give it 180 seconds, then I'm going to go back to reading," I thought.

30 minutes of enraptured watching later, I was immediately looking for where I could find episode 2. It's available on Crunchyroll for Americans, not sure where else to legally get it for non-Americans, or if Crunchroll bought the license in your jurisdiction.

Prepare to be amazed.
