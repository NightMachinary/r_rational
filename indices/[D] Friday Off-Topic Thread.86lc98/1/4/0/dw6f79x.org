You could be agender, non-binary, genderqueer, or something that I haven't heard of yet because identity is complicated. Let me give you some advice, don't settle for the “default option” just because you're used to it and you think it‘s easier to stick with.

That's the rationalization that kept me from figuring myself out for years after learning about genderfluidity and my self discovery has been euphoric. Do some research about how your feelings compare to others and liberate yourself from what you think is normal.
