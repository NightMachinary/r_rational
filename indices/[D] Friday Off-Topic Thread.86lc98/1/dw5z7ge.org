I'm genderfluid. I just found out this week and that revelation has resulted in me feeling really /really/ good these past few days. I thankfully have no body dysphoria or depression related to my gender identity, everyone I've come out to has been very supportive, and I don't think I've ever felt this confident or secure in my persona before.

This is like a childhood dream come true. I feel like a shapeshifter who can wake up each day as a different person who's still me but likes different things. This week I've been a woman, a man, and somewhere in between while always being validated by everyone I interact with. I'm excited to explore my femininity and I feel like I finally get to be masculine on my own terms.

Tomorrow I'm going on the first shopping trip that I've ever looked forward to. My style has always been very bland and purely utilitarian, I think because I was so insecure in my identity, but now a whole world has opened up to me and I can't wait to experiment with what I like. Granted, I broke new ground yesterday by willingly wearing a long sleeved button up shirt so everything will probably feel novel.

I've never really tried to express myself with my appearance before, but now that I am I feel much more extroverted and less anxious when socializing. I'm not as uncomfortable around people when I present myself the way I identify and boy is that liberating for someone who finds communication difficult. I'm so lucky to be in the position I am right now.

One of the reasons it took me so long to figure this out is that I have a fetish for transformation and crossdressing, which I of course felt really insecure about. It was this week when I realized none of my sexual fantasies involved myself. It never felt like a fantasy because it was still just me and changing felt normal. At the same time, I'm glad I've had this much time to educate myself and others in preparation for my self discovery.
