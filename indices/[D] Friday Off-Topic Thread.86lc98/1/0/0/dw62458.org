I especially like the point the writer makes about advocating for "normal" causes that are almost as good as your weird ones. I've long played with the theme in my writing that "perfect is the enemy of good," especially with the moral absolutism I see prevalent in US nowadays. I see a lot of people demanding moral perfection from their politicians, leaders, heroes, and historical figures, and failing to realize that people are not perfect, even the great ones. I see people denigrating Stephen Hawking for his younger misogyny as if that completely discounts the man's incredible legacy as a scientist. I get the waters are hot right now, but it's just something that bothers me that I've been trying to articulate in a way that doesn't make me sound like I'm just complaining about SJWs (because, on the whole, I am a left-leaning individual)

(sorry OP for hijacking your original post, I'm very glad you're sorting out your gender identity, I just wanted to speak on a point in this article)
