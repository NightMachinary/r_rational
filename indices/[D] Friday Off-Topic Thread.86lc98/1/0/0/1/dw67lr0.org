As someone who has recently had a weight lifted off of my psyche that has been beating me down for my entire life, I think it is /extremely/ important that we fight against the culture of abuse and discrimination in our society at every turn regardless of the pedestals it targets.

I was raised a straight white man and grew up believing things that dehumanized other people and stunted my own self actualization. I have improved significantly and didn't know what I do now, but that doesn't make up for the objectively harmful things I did, believed, and enabled.

I think people have a moral obligation to criticize that wherever it shows up, even when that criticism targets someone who did as much good as Hawking. When I criticize him or anyone else past or present for the same, it is not intended to discredit his accomplishments but to point out that that we all need to watch out for that.

I don't think of myself as an SJW because I associate that term with a person who thinks they are above prejudice, which I definitely do not believe about myself. I must be criticized as well and the burden is on me as much as anyone to show compassion for people who lack the privileges I do.

If that sounds hard and like it could easily rationalize self hatred, you're right. But I'll do it anyway because I cannot compare the pain I feel to the suffering others endure that I believe people should never suffer. I've had a only small taste of that suffering and it was worse than anything else I've ever felt, if I had had it any worse it would've broken me.
