I completely agree with you overall: "don't light myself on fire to warm other people" is a pretty good common sense policy.

That said, I kind of disagree with the "effectively choosing to be prejudiced in spite of my evidence" part. People don't choose to be prejudiced; ultimately, we're all Bayesian machines all the way down, some with different priors.

I think that arguing convincingly to prejudiced people -as in, not "argue really well to prejudiced people and shake my head sadly when they disagree", but "argue in a way that sometimes convinces prejudiced people"- is a valuable skill that you would probably benefit from, given what I know of you.

And yeah, I really don't respect sticking to norms for the sake of it, or [[https://xkcd.com/137/][censuring yourself to blend in]], but I think that there's something to be said for seeing where "normal" is and working from there. I see it as leverage, I think?

It's a little abstract, but it's like, metaphorically... being aware that it's not enough to push, you need your feet to be on solid ground. Knowing "my position" and why I believe in it isn't enough, I have to know "normal", and why people would be there; what obstacles there are between "normal" and my position, and respect these obstacles as serious enough to warrant a true effort.

I think this is a process a lot of people fail at, because they see a different opinion, they see their opinion, and they just fill the gap with generic [naïveté / cognitive bias / prejudice / pure evil / a society that never taught them better / stupidity] in a way that's reassuring (my position is the right one, but people disagree because they're stupid and they grew in a prejudiced society) but not actually good at finding ways to "bridge the gap". So they just say "this is why my position is the best, you really need to realize that", and that's only enough for people who are already almost convinced.

And... I'm pretty sure I'm not getting through to you, but I'm mostly writing for myself here, for future reference. Sorry for being a nag :(
