That's a fair concern and I don't take offense to you bringing it up. I was worried about it too and I‘ve had to remind myself that masculine and feminine are things I get to define for myself instead of falling back on stereotypes and norms.

However, I think this is actually a case of me overcoming my tendency to overthink because I had rationalized away my gender identity until this week. I woke up from a dream about genderfluidity and knew that was how I felt.

I'd felt unsatisfied with my gender before, but I had always thought it was only a fetish since I didn't have the dysphoria transpeople do. But that morning I knew that I had gone to sleep feeling like a man and woken up feeling like a woman.

Then I remembered all the times I'd felt off before and how I'd wanted to be able to change since I was a little kid. I realized I'd always been this way and had been taught to deny it. I have literally felt euphoria since then because I feel like I'm...more.

It's like I've only been allowing part of my mind out my whole life and I finally get to experience the whole of who I am. I no longer feel forced into being a certain way, I can be any way I want and change it whenever.

I'm ready to explore these “new” parts of myself and my loved ones are there to help me. I have fears and doubts, but I feel more confident and courageous than ever in facing them. Not because I feel like I'm special, but because I finally feel like /me/.
