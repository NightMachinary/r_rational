I really don't want to say anything rude, and I'm glad that you've found something that works for you, but... you know that (as far as I can guess by your posting history) you really /really/ have a tendency to overthink things, right?

The talk of "being a shapeshifter" in particular reminds me of labels I'd tried to put on myself back when I was in a teenager in therapy. Trying too hard to fit reality into concepts and all that stuff.

Again, it's great that you found your niche, but... maybe be aware of that part of your brain than wants to place labels on everything? I guess my point is, you can be different without trying to put the different in new interesting boxes, which is something I think the genderfluid community takes a lot of flak for.
