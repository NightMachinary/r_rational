My dislike is not concentrated on only that word. Just as obviously, =sheep=, =deer=, =you=*, and other such words should be fixed to remove ambiguity between singular and plural. Unfortunately, however, alternatives for those words are unavailable. =They=, on the other hand, already has alternatives that people inexplicably refrain from using.

*This is the hilarious double meaning in my current flair, bee-tee-dubs.
