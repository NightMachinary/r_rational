=They= commonly /is/ used as a singular pronoun. /Should/ it be used in such a fashion? Absolutely, incontestably /not/, because such usage promotes confusion and ambiguity. Just as obviously, =sheep=, =deer=, =you=*, and other such words should be fixed to remove ambiguity between singular and plural.

*This is the hilarious double meaning in my current flair, bee-tee-dubs.
