Thank you. I don't actually have any actionable requests for people, but that's an attitude I think everyone should have toward LGBTQ+ people. I've been considering going by they/them pronouns by default, though I personally don't have a problem with being misgendered.

Even using public restrooms hasn't been an issue for me because of my lack of body dysphoria, I'll use a urinal for the sake of convenience any day no matter how I dress. All I really care about is being treated as my currently preferred gender identity, which isn't going to be as big an issue online.

I guess all you can do for me here is think of me as not being a specific gender and see that as normal. Some days I'm one or the other, a mix of both, or something not quite either. It would be nice to know that people are making an effort to be better even when I can't tell they are, and it might help out more people than just me.
