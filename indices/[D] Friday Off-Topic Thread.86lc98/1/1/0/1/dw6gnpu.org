I would like to ask a somewhat personal question, but if you feel like this question is too uncomfortable, that's perfectly fine by me. Don't answer if you rather not at all.

How do you think being genderfluid affects your sexual orientation or romantic desires, if it does at all? Basically I'm wondering how your experience of gender relates to romantic relationships, but I understand that a lot of people wouldn't want to discuss something like that.
