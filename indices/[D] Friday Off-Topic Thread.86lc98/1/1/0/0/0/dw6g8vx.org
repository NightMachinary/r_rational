Well it wouldn't really look like anything to me since I can't tell what people are thinking, but it is the way I think about myself now. I was forced into a particular view of my gender that does not represent people in general, let alone me, so now I just dress how I feel and want people to see me. I can't tell if people online are doing that, but I can ask them to think about how they view me.

Yesterday I wore a salmon jacket with a necklace and swayed my hips as I walked, which led to female coworkers inviting me into a discussion of fashion. The day before I had baggy masculine clothes on and fit in with the guys on the assembly line. That doesn't represent everything about me and what I want, gender is not binary and neither am I, but it's what has happened so far and I liked it.

I really do feel like a shapeshifter who can look like whatever I want. I want to be recognized as me no matter what, but I also want people to acknowledge that the way I choose how to look is indicative of how I feel and want to be treated. That doesn't come up online as much, so it becomes more about asking people to examine their biases about gender for the sake of LGBTQ+ people in general.
