Inexplicably? There are clear reasons not to use those alternatives.

"Xe/Ze" marks you firmly in blue tribe, which means not only will conservatives not use it, but even left leaning people who don't want to loudly signal their own political affiliation will avoid it. And I also speculate that both of these are unstable. The words sound remarkably close to both "he" and "she," which (fun fact) is how "he" and "she" morphed into their present forms.

The word "it", when applied to people, is used for the purposes of dehumanization and depersonalization. Examples include a bully saying "Look everybody, it speaks.", robots being called "it", and wild animals being called "it" while pets are called "he" or "she."
