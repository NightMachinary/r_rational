It's not a problem for me at all, though thank you for being so consider are. As far as I know, sexuality is completely independent from gender identity. The way I feel about myself does not effect how I feel about other people.

My personal experience with romance is that I figured out I was pansexual years ago and have only been in one sexual relationship with a gay man that I broke off for reasons unrelated to sexual or romantic preferences, though we never went “all the way”.

If I find a romantic partner I do not know if they'd have to be bisexual or pansexual or something else. It's possible that I would be fine if they were attracted to men since I do not have body dysphoria and might not have preferred pronouns.

I would want them to still be attracted to me regardless of which gender I present as, but their attraction could be conditional solely on anatomy or be completely independent of it like my own. You could ask [[/r/genderfluid][r/genderfluid]] or [[/r/DualGender][r/DualGender]] for people with more experience.
