I think this is a useful strategy for the persuasion of people whose views are based on ignorance, but I don't currently have a reason to consider compromising the way I present myself and even if I did I wouldn't be willing to.

If a person didn't accept me after I had explained myself, effectively choosing to be prejudiced in spite of my evidence, then any value they gave my life by being in it would not be made up for by the emotional pain they would cause me.

I'm very lucky to not have any prejudiced people in my life, but if any of them were I would've just cut them out of it. I'm not going to feel empathy for people who refuse to feel empathy for me. Trying to love someone who hated me was how I got emotionally abused by my own sibling.
