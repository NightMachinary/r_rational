I can admire the American Founding Fathers for their contributions to democracy and Enlightenment thinking while still loathing all the things they did that no person should ever do to another. Injustice is not justified by culture.

Historical context is what allowed them to do the terrible things they did like own slaves, kill Native Americans, treat women as objects, and enact policies that served elitist agendas. All things that still happen today and should not have ever happened.
