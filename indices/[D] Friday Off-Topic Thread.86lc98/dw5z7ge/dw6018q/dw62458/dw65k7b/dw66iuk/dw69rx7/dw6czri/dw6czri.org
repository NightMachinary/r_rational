I seem to have started more of a discussion than j meant to, haha. I absolutely concur with your points. Perhaps I was just particularly irked that people went around my feeds calling people out for admiring Hawking for his achievements, implying that people who did admire him were complicit in his misogyny somehow. I don't think admiration of someone's good traits is approval of their negative ones, but I've been bothered by the assumption that if I praise a historical figure for one thing, I'm praising them for all their things, which should be obvious is not the case.
