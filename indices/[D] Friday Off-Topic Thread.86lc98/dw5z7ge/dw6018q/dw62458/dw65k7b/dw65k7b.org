I see this argument a lot wrt us politics, and it's horseshit. Because generally, the policies held up as good instead of perfect are actually bad, just not the worst possible policy. Take for example "medicare extra for all." It purports to be a liberal compromise with medicare for all, but it drops the most important part: health insurance companies delenda est.

It's not a new thing, either. The same tendency drove the campaigners for compensated manumission in the lead up to the civil war.
