I don't really get how the ontology there is supposed to work, but good on you, and it's nice to hear you're not overthinking things again. I would say you should try to avoid spending too many Weirdness Points on your genderfluidity in highly memorable ways, just in case at some point you do find your internal maps of yourself being updated again.
