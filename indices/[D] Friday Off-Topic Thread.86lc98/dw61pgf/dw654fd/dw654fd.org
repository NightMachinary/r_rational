I'm not sure if Khan Academy would cover what you are learning in your class, but if it involves organic chemistry, then here are the list of [[https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry?t=classes][videos]] you can check out. Note that Khan academy can be hit or miss when it comes to college level subjects so I'm not sure if the chemistry videos are beyond high school level like the academy's math videos can be.
