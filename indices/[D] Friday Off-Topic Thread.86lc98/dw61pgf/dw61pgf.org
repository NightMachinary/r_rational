Chemistry is not my subject. I'm getting my ass kicked this semester. I'm in Chem 2 and I feel so lost compared to my other classes (I'm a physics major, doing pretty well across the board except in chem). Are there any good resources for better understanding of chemical principles? For reference, I did decently well in Chem 1, got a B.
