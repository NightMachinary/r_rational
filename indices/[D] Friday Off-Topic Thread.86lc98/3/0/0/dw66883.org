I'd just be mildly dissapointed and move on. Plenty of other fish in the sea, plenty of other discussion boards available. I'd miss a few of the communities here (most notably [[/r/rational]] and [[/r/parahumans]]) but I suspect many of us congegate on the SB/SV/AH/^{^{QQ}} network of forums anyways.
