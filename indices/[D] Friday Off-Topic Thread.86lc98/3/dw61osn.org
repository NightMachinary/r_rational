If you weren't aware, Reddit has (without warning) [[http://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj][banned]] various subreddits that were focused on selling and trading items ([[http://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/dw2a8h0][partial list]]). Some speculators surmise that this action was precipitated by [USAian politics that cannot be discussed in this subreddit].
