Have there been any discussions on this subreddit about possible migration venues when reddit gets bad enough? Companies that get obsessed with increasing their investment valuation can be prone to making sudden and otherwise ill-advised decisions; and I wouldn't want all the archives of conversations in [[/r/rational/]] to suddenly get nuked with no chances of recovery.

In which sense each additional day of the community staying here is one more day's worth of potentially lost data.
