An em is running on a simulation. A dream of an em is a simulation running inside a simulation. As such, it will be /far/ less complex, the same way that our dreams are not completely accurate physics simulations. If, for some reason, the em could borrow the processing power of the computer running it, then the dreams would probably be considered "real". But otherwise, the dreams characters wouldn't really be any more conscious than our own dreams, which is what I assume you mean by "real."
