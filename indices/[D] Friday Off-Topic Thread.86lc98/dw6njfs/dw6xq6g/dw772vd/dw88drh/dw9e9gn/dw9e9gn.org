It'd have to be a conceit of the setting that digital minds need, or at least want, to dream this way. The more power the mind uses, the more detailed their dreams need to be in order to keep them sane. So society is left with the question of what to do when someone's mind accidentally dreams people into existence and don't want to just delete them.

I'm kind of imagining an inverse Westworld. Transhumans decided that artificial life was still life and the standard of free will is arbitrary when the creator has absolute power, so they keep any simulation going that demonstrates sentience and try to integrate it into their civilization. What kind of sci-fi world would that be where dreams are foreign nations and that people emigrate from?
