I agree with you on all counts, but I'm not sure the line between the em and the computer would be so easily defined. It's possible that a digital mind could scale their processing power up and down, so that they're “borrowing” resources whenever they think at all.

I imagined a hypothetical scenario in which the em needs to be given the ability to dream, as opposed to just entering standby, which could be as important to their mental health as human REM sleep. There may not be a clear ontological difference between the levels of simulation.

If that were the case, what are the implications? Does their imagination create a form of life that it would be inhumane to delete? Would singularity-level AIs dream whole worlds into being? What could and should be done with dreams that are determined to have created new people?

I've never liked the hypothesis that we are living in a simulation, it's unprovable and I never saw a reason to create self aware simulations anyway. This possibility I've envisioned about digital dreaming has me interested, though. I'll discuss it more at the next Worldbuilding thread.
