[[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/62787551366/stories]] has a (not always up to date) list of the novels and most of the short stories. No synopses, but short descriptions of a few of the stories. I generally include a link to that page as the second link in the introduction to each chapter or story. Hope this helps.
