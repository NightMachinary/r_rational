Can you clarify a bit more on how this ability works? Are you transferring paint from a bucket or are you just magically creating it out of thin air? Can you use any substance you want, as long as it forms a paint-like appearance? If it appears out of thin air, can you use your ability to mass produce substances?

When I use my ability to paint with a touch, is the quality of the painting perfect? Or only as good as my actual painting skills? Can I mass produce indistinguishable counterfeits?

When I paint on a surface, it creates a plane that hovers a couple of microns away from the surface. But, a plane is by definition, a smooth flat surface. So can I paint on top of my painting?

What exactly happens when a painting is suppressed or destroyed? Does the paint layer just vanish? Is the destruction localized to the point where the plane is intersected or the surface changes? Or does the destruction spread throughout the entire painting? If it is the latter, it could be used as a form of communication. Morse code could be sent by repeatedly tapping one end of a painting and thus flickering the suppression on and off on the other end.

Also, does this paint weigh anything? If not, I could do fun things like making super thick layers and layers of paint on the outer hull of ships, vastly increasing their volume without increasing their weight, and thus making it much easier for them to float. Assuming that the paint isn't suppressed by water, and can be made waterproof.
