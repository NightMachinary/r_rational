See if you can munchkin a 'guidepost spell' that came up in a RP group recently. I didn't make this spell, but when told about it I thought it would be interesting to munchkin.

Note that the local tech level is Edo period Japan, the year 1605. Explaining the entire setting would take all day.

#+begin_quote
  You have earned favor with a nigh-omniscient guiding god. Once per day you can cast a spell that allows you to see the 'shortest safe path' to your party's destination. You pray to the god, tell them where you want to go, and then they make you hallucinate lines on the ground leading you there.

When I heard about this I naturally had some questions.

- 'Safe' in this case means 'your chance of death if you follow this path is less than x%' where x is a unknown small number. The god can see many possible futures and will guide you on the path that gets you to your destination as soon as possible while keeping your chance of death below x%.

- You don't know x just because you know the spell.

- If no path is possible that keeps your chance of death below the threshold, the path offered will ignore safety concerns entirely and happily guide you to your death.

- If no path is possible regardless of safety, you see nothing.

- If you ask for 'the nearest pile of treasure worth X' it will guide you to a pile of treasure worth that amount. It will also guide you to people you've met or can imagine in sufficient detail, or even vague things like 'the nearest person who likes the color blue more than I do'.

- You an only see the lines out to a distance of ten kilometers. The lines disappear after twenty-four hours, even if your journey would take longer than that.

- The path might rely on you doing things like 'stealing a boat' or 'not drawing the attention of a group of bandits'. The guiding god deliberately rejects meta thinking on your part: if you think "I can just waltz past these bandits, the path is safe!" they will attack you.

- To elaborate, your mind state when you ask for the spell is all the god considers. (Presumably the simulations substitute some generic version of 'you' when deciding how safe a path is, and that version of you pretends it's not following a path. This part confused me.)

- Despite that, the spell is vulnerable to abuse from those outside your party. For example, if you arrange to be killed by someone outside of the party unless your path takes you to an address that is the combination for a lock, the god will guide you to that address if it exists.

- The god simulates everyone in the universe perfectly except for those in your party.

How would you munchkin this spell from inside the party? From outside?

I will answer questions about the spell as best as I can.

Edits/answers:

- The power only guides you to things that currently exist.
