Give one trusted friend a crossbow, a second a knife. Write down three paths that you could take through a small section of forest to a small inn. Pray, and intend to walk very slowly while you walk.

If you take the left path, tell your friend to shoot rob rich house A. Path middle is house B. Right path is house C. Any other path is no robbery today.

If your friend is successful in his robbery, he is to meet you at the inn. Tell your other friend that if the first does not get to the inn first, he is to attack and stab you with the knife right outside the inn.

Now you have the perfect robbery oracle machine.
