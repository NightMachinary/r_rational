I like it! The second of your protocols was a little hard for me to parse--the basic idea is that if it sends you to the room before you reach a thousand letters, you know messages of that length are inherently dangerous?

I suppose we should make the stakes use numbers instead of letters, to be translated later. That eliminates the 'cracks the gatekeeper' solutions for path finding--much harder to convince the scribe to open the door with a string of numbers.
