Set up a room with a door and a small viewport. The door has a lethal trap on it. In the room is a lever that arms/disarms the trap. Have a scribe lock himself in the room and watch stakes beyond the viewport. Ask for a way into the room. If the path leads to the viewport, then through the trap, find a scribe less susceptible to breaking protocol through bribery and threats such as the god's model of you can improvise. Protocol options:

- Tell him to roll a d20 each time you walk around a stake, and disable the trap on any 20. The number of loops you see gives you an estimate of x.

- Tell him to write text corresponding to the letters on stakes you walk around, and disable the trap after a thousand letters. The number of loops gives you an estimate of the security of the setup - a bribe or threat such as a god can divine, or the name which summons that devil which will gladly teleport you into the room for your soul, or Cthulean whispers that may break any number of preconceptions of reality. Needless to say, think twice before executing the divination of any text with at least this many letters.
