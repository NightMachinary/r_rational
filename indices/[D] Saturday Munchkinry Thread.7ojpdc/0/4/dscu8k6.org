  Despite that, the spell is vulnerable to abuse from those outside your party. For example, if you arrange to be killed by someone outside of the party unless your path takes you to an address that is the combination for a lock, the god will guide you to that address if it exists.

Huh. Got an eidetic memory? Draw two parallel lines on the ground, one for 0 and one for 1, both stretching out to a distance of 10 km. Then every program's binary code corresponds to a specific path, zigzagging between the two parallel lines until you reach the end. Arrange for someone to write down the program code according to the path you walk, and kill you if the program is incorrect. Now ask god for a safe path to the end.

Provided the program is sufficiently concise, this should allow you to ask god for the code for any program. Now ask for the code of a friendly AGI.

P.S. For larger programs, you could make use of the third dimension as well. Extend the two parallel lines into two parallel walls, and get tools so you can wall jump between them on your path.
