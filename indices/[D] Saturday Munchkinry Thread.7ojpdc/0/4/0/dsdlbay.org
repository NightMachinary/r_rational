That's clever, even though there aren't any computers around to test the program. Although...

Lets suppose I asked it for the code to /Doom/ instead of an AGI (since I can't look up the size of an AGI). At 2.4MB, if you try to display /Doom/ over ten kilometers each bit is 1/20th of a centimeter. Memorizing the shape of that path is solidly beyond human capability, I'd say, and writing it down at a rate of 200bits/second (to finish just in time for the spell to run out) is not really possible either. Beyond that, you have to perform your safety tests before you reach the end of the path as well, which is a tall order for many programs. Don't be surprised when it's just the first level of DOOM--that path is a lot shorter, I imagine.

Of course [[/u/SirRaiuKoren][u/SirRaiuKoren]] has revealed that the god you pray to will see your intent and try to fulfill it, so you perhaps don't have to test anything. You've kind of got the ear of an AGI already.
