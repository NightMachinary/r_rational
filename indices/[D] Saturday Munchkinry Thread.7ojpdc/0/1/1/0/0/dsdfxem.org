  could I ask for a path to the visiting delegation, and thus find out whether or not they were trustworthy?
#+end_quote

Well, you could find out if they wanted to harm you on sight, sure. If that is the sole or primary requirement for trustworthiness, then I suppose so.

#+begin_quote
  Useful. So it's not just a literal genie, it actually tries to be helpful!
#+end_quote

This is correct. The source of the spell is perfectly capable of intuiting your intent and will use that intent to determine the proper destination in the event you seek a non-specific target, such as "any weapon that can kill a vampire." It will always give a true path in good faith to your intent, even if that path would lead you to an unexpected result - in the vampire example, you may be intending a sword, but you find the path has led you to a magical garlic field because the source knows you could use the garlic to better effect than a sword. (In the game world, the source is fond of giving unexpected results that are both true and more useful than the seeker imagined).

  Hmmmmm. So, I could ask for a path to 'yesterday' and it would give me one, just one I am unable to follow?
#+end_quote

There are two answers to this: a hypothetical answer, and the real answer.

Hypothetically, yes, it would give you a path that a mortal could never follow on their own, such as a path that leads you to a shrine in the mountains dedicated to the Kami of Time, where you would have to pray and just hope that the Kami would grant you time travel.

However, in my game world, time travel does not exist, with one exception. Hell is a realm that exists outside of spacetime, a plane of eternal darkness and endless nightmare, where time and space have no meaning and all that exists is the tormented minds of the inhabitants. There is precedent that if a soul somehow escapes hell, they could appear anywhere in the universe at any time. I'm not actually sure Tsukuyomi (the kami that is the source of the spell) knows about hell; most non-death/non-underworld gods don't, and even they don't talk about it out of fear. We can argue that hell cannot enter the spell's predictive model of the universe because it exists outside of the universe. I might have to think about where that path would send the player, but I know the spell is designed to always give a path that is true, so I must assume there is a correct answer.
