  *THE* delegation next door will take you there regardless of their murderous intent. *A* delegation anywhere would lead you to the closest delegation that wouldn't threaten your safety.

Ah. An important point to bear in mind. So, a delegation who wanted to threaten my safety could avoid the entire trouble by making sure that there is a second, completely innocent delegation standing on the side of the room closest to me, then?

  Additionally, if they know you have this power and might use it to that effect, they could not foil it in such a way. The power would know they were waiting ten minutes and thus leading you there would still threaten your safety (it is capable of perfect predictive models).

But surely there must be some limit to this. What if the delegation is perfectly honest - but negotiations will unavoidably break down, leading to a war in which I have over a 90% chance of dying within the next ten years?
