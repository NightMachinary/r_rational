  So, the visiting delegation could avoid that by waiting ten minutes before they try to kill me?

Actually, I think I was unclear. The path will lead to your destination regardless of the danger if that destination is /specific/. *THE* delegation next door will take you there regardless of their murderous intent. *A* delegation anywhere would lead you to the closest delegation that wouldn't threaten your safety. If that would take you past the one next door, you know they bode ill for you.

Additionally, if they know you have this power and might use it to that effect, they could not foil it in such a way. The power would know they were waiting ten minutes and thus leading you there would still threaten your safety (it is capable of perfect predictive models).

We were talking yesterday about an assassin that knows you have this power and tells you, "Walk around these letters in such a way to dictate a perfect plan to rule the world or I will kill you." It is assumed this assassin is certainly capable of doing so despite your best efforts. She instructs you to then designate the other side of the room as your destination, and will kill you if you do not produce the plan before reaching that side of the room. What happens?

The answer is that the path would lead you in such a way that - if you followed it accurately at a normal walking pace - would cause the assassin to Final Destination themselves in their attempts to kill you (some incredibly improbable event would occur leading to their death, such as tripping and breaking their neck). That is the shortest, safest route to the other side of the room.

Tsukuyomi frowns greatly upon abusing people to whom he has given his gift.

  Well, then, clearly the One Path must go via there. Does it matter whether or not Tsukuyomi knows about it?

The Kami of Knowledge would certainly be the most plausible result, that's good thinking. If Tsukuyomi doesn't know and has perfect prediction models, he would know that the answer lies outside of the material universe and would then lead you to someone who DOES know about such things.
