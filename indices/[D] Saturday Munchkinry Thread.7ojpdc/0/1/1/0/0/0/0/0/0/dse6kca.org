  So, a delegation who wanted to threaten my safety could avoid the entire trouble by making sure that there is a second, completely innocent delegation standing on the side of the room closest to me, then?
#+end_quote

No. Leading you into that room would still put you in danger, presumably.

#+begin_quote
  But surely there must be some limit to this. What if the delegation is perfectly honest - but negotiations will unavoidably break down, leading to a war in which I have over a 90% chance of dying within the next ten years?
#+end_quote

There is indeed a limit, though it is designed to be opaque (though I have seen some good ways to discover it in this thread). I can say that leading you to that room would not put you in any /immediate/ danger, with immediate referring to the duration of the spell (for the sake of the argument), which is 24 hours, and so the path would lead you there.

  So, he /personally/ designs the path every time?
#+end_quote

Yes.
