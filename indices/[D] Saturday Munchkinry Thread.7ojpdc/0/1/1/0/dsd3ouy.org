  The second scenario would show you the path to the /closest/ person who bribed Lord GamblingDebts, unless that person would harm you for figuring it out. It would, in that case, send you to the next closest person, and so on.

So, it's not just dangers on the path - it also takes into account dangers at the destination caused as a result of the journey?

So, if I were a diplomat, and I suspected the visiting diplomatic delegation in the other room was under orders to kill me; could I ask for a path to the visiting delegation, and thus find out whether or not they were trustworthy?

  The third scenario would lead /you to a magical weapon you could wield and use proficiently/ capable of slaying said vampires. It is implicit in the statement that the seeker wants a weapon they could reasonably use.

Useful. So it's not just a literal genie, it actually tries to be helpful!

  Side Note: One stipulation that was not directly stated (but is implied) is that the Path is always true and cannot fail. If you ask for an impossible destination, there will still indeed be a path, but one that a mere mortal could not hope to follow - that's the only route available.

Hmmmmm. So, I could ask for a path to 'yesterday' and it would give me one, just one I am unable to follow?
