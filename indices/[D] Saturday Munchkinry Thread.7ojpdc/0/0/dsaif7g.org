Depending on how lenient "vague things" means, you can have some serious shenanigans happen.

Carve large letters in the ground for each letter in your alphabet (and some characters for punctuation). Hire someone outside of the party to record which letters you step on.

Then, ask your god for a path to a scroll written by the person you hired that answers the question:

What are the instructions that will allow my party to control the country within 10 years?

What are the design specifications and explanations that will allow for the greatest advancement from our current technology level within 10 years?

What must I do to maximize my utility function?

...or any other arbitrary question. Also, if you don't trust your hired scribe, preface the question with "when decoded using the one time pad written in the book in my bag".
