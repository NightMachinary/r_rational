Suppose you could copy natural(read: anything that comes through genes and isn't learned) attributes from one living creature to another, replacing the corresponding(if existing) attribute in the second creature. Which would be the most useful attributes to get and from which genes? Which animals have particular interest? For example you could give some human a bloodhound's ability to smell.
