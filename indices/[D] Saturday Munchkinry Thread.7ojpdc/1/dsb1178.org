You have the ability to generate semi-permeable force fields that allow some substances to pass through but not others. So you could, for instance, program it only to be permeable to salt, and then dump a bag of pretzels over it and watch only the salt fall through. This substance has to be clearly specified and identifiable ahead of time, so you can't define the substance to be "only those Scrabble tiles that answer such-and-such question".

Aside from the obvious uses, such as panning for gold or purifying water, what else could these force-fields be used for?
