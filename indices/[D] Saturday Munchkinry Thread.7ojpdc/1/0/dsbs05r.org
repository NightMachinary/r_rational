I'm assuming you only want uses where the semi-permeability plays a role, so I won't mention the standard uses for forcefields such as shields or telekinesis.

- You could use forcefields to make yourself immune to poisons, simply by covering your body with one that is permeable to everything except every poisonous substance you can identify (start reading up on some toxicology so you can do this better). And not just poisons in foods. Your forcefields can clean poisons in air and water just as well. Depending on how large or easy it is to create such forcefields, you could extend your poison immunity services to other people, or even large buildings/cities/planets.

- If you can create sufficiently large forcefields and move them around, you could fight climate change by making gigantic forcefields that are permeable to air but not greenhouse gases, then using those forcefields to sweep large amounts of greenhouse gases out of the earth's atmosphere (either into the ground or into outer space).

- You can be a great customs officer by creating forcefields that are permeable to everything but drugs and other banned substances. Or join the police force and hunt down smuggling rings and drug dealers.

- What is a substance? Just chemicals? Can you identify people and create forcefields that only let some people in but not others? That would be a great way to ensure no spies are sneaking into your base.

- What about temperature? Can you create a forcefield that only lets hot items in but not cold items? What if the hot item is water vapor while the cold item is liquid water? If so, you may be able to provide cheap heating/cooling devices. For example, you could put a forcefield in front of a fan that is permeable only to nice cool air, not hot air. Since air typically contains molecules that are at a large range of temperatures, this should work to blast cool air at you. Just don't stand behind the fan where all the hot air is building up.
