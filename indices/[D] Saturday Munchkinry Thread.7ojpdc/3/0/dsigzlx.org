Exactly how much magic are we assuming here? Intelligence and the ability to speak are both (largely) genetically determined, so can we start uplifting viruses or tiny insects with this power?

Assuming a fairly generous amount of magic, the first couple uses that spring to mind:

1. The most obvious one: There are several species of tortoises that don't age. It's not a valid strategy to beat death altogether (because there is only one of you and 7 billion other people), but giving yourself and as many other people as possible biological immortality seems like a good start.

2. There are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planarian][apparently]] species of flatworms that are able to completely regrow damaged body parts. While that is a useful ability to have in general, the really cool trick is that if split down the middle both halves can regrow into complete animals. Both halves seem to retain the memories of the original animal, so hopefully whatever magic gives us these powers is copied along as well. /Now/ you can start mass producing immortality.

3. This is largely cool factor, rather than practical use, but uplifting other species and giving us more than one datapoint for intelligence seems like an interesting trick. This power also conveniently doesn't allow you to create smarter-than-human minds since we are copying humans to begin with. Do the modified animals pass on the copied abilities to their offspring? If so, try to stay away from species that reproduce too quickly (or only use animals that are beyond reproductive age), creating a population boom of new intelligent minds creates a lot of moral issues that are tricky to deal with.

4. With that out of the way, we can move on to the cool party tricks:

   - Almost too obvious to mention, but heat detection and echolocation from bats and colour perception from mantis shrimps.
   - You mentioned bloodhounds for scent, but both bears and elephants have them beat in this regards (between the two, iirc, elephants can distinguish more different smells, but bears can smell things from further away).
   - Wings would be neat, probably aren't going to be able to lift a human body of the ground, but still stylish as hell.
   - Prehensile tail would be handy too, giving you what is essentially an extra hand.
