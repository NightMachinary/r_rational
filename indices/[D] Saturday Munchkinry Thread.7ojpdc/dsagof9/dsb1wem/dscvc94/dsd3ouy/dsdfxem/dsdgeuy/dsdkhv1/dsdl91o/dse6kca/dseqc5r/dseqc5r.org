  No. Leading you into that room would still put you in danger, presumably.

Hmmm. So the dangerous delegation waits outside the building, while the innocent delegation waits inside - the dangerous delegation has to meet you separately, but you don't get any forewarning of the danger...

  There is indeed a limit, though it is designed to be opaque (though I have seen some good ways to discover it in this thread).
#+end_quote

Could a Dangerous Delegation take advantage of this by (say) using a source of True Randomness to ensure that they have a less-than-x% chance of attacking you?

#+begin_quote
  Yes.

So if there are multiple safe paths, he can choose the one that leads the party past someone he likes who could use their help?
