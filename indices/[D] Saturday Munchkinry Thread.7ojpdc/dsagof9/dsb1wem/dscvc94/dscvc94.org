It is I, the person who designed the spell and spoke of it to blasted0glass.

Even within the context of playing the game as intended, these would be perfectly valid questions that would return the expected result.

The first scenario would indeed show you to the room occupied by Mr. Black's murderer. It may not be in the hotel.

The second scenario would show you the path to the /closest/ person who bribed Lord GamblingDebts, unless that person would harm you for figuring it out. It would, in that case, send you to the next closest person, and so on.

The third scenario would lead you to a magical weapon /you could wield and use proficiently/ capable of slaying said vampires. It is implicit in the statement that the seeker wants a weapon they could reasonably use.

Side Note: One stipulation that was not directly stated (but is implied) is that the Path is always true and cannot fail. If you ask for an impossible destination, there will still indeed be a path, but one that a mere mortal could not hope to follow - that's the only route available.
