I suggested almost exactly the same thing.

The power only guides you to things that currently exist; asking for a path to a scroll not yet written returns no answer.

A further consideration: the god wouldn't care about your 'chances of success' in the instructions that result from this strategy. That is irrelevant to your safety while walking the path, so it would attempt to guide you to a blank scroll (presumably the fastest path you could physically walk). If you disallow a blank scroll somehow, the plan 'do nothing' is an answer with a small chance of success. Since no result can guarantee success, if you demand a foolproof plan the path doesn't exist.

Still, I thought it was a thing worth testing. Rather than carve large letters, I put stakes in the ground to walk around.

I didn't worry about trusting the scribe, though: good point.

Edit: Or there might be a path to things that don't yet exist, and the god might actually care about your chances of success. The spell as I imagined it wasn't the same spell the DM ([[/u/SirRaiuKoren][u/SirRaiuKoren]]) had in mind.
