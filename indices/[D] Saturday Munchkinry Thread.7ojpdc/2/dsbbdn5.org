You have the ability to 'paint' any sufficiently smooth, flat surface with a touch. This 'paint' takes the form of a two-dimensional plane which hovers a couple microns away from the surface to which it is affixed. It follows the movements of the surface, is suppressed temporarily if the plane intersects a solid, and is destroyed if the shape of the surface changes (with tolerances similar to the distance it hovers from the surface). The optical qualities of the image are always uniform across the plane, and can be tuned at-will. The plane's reflectivity over wavelength must be within (0,1) for all wavelengths and must be smooth, but is otherwise under your control. It's properties are symmetric across both sides.

What do you with this?
