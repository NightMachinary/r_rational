You seem to have misunderstood. You aren't depositing a substance in a layer. You a creating an insubstantial two-dimensional warping of the EM field. It is an 'illusion' essentially. Immaterial.

When you 'paint,' your 'color' (IE the reflectivity curve you choose the plane to have) is uniform across it. So you can only paint a surface one color. In order to create a complex image, you'd need a large number of slightly off-angle surfaces, and you would essentially be doing paint-by-number, each section being one solid color.

When suppressed or destroyed, the image vanishes, propagating from the point of suppression/destruction. You could use that to communicate, but it's only light-speed, which isn't much faster than literal Morse code on the scale of a planet, IIRC.

The 'paint' does not way anything because it is not a material. It doesn't interact with matter except reflecting photons and being disrupted by solids. It can technically be applied on top of itself, though I'm not sure what use this has.
