  The 'paint' does not way anything because it is not a material. It doesn't interact with matter except reflecting photons and being disrupted by solids. It can technically be applied on top of itself, though I'm not sure what use this has.

Perfect energy shield for a space ship? I'd think a ship with this could be a short distance from the sun (outside its atmosphere) and hardly get warm.

Can it be made reflective in non-visible wavelengths like gamma rays?

Actually, I suspect the ability to create 100% reflective mirrors would be wildly useful in a wide variety of ways.
