  It can technically be applied on top of itself, though I'm not sure what use this has.

Well, it could be useful for making dungeons. Apply several layers on a corner of a hallway to make it look like a dead end. Apply several layers on a hole in the ground to fill it up, so unsuspecting people fall in when they walk over it.

  You could use that to communicate, but it's only light-speed, which isn't much faster than literal Morse code on the scale of a planet, IIRC.

Hmm, how about a different method of communication then. Get a brick, apply a layer of paint on one side. When you rotate the brick, the paint layer also rotates right?

So first, hang the brick in midair (use a rope or just put it on top of stuff). Rapidly apply arbitrarily many layers of paint horizontally. Since the paint is weightless, this should be no problem. Now when you rotate the brick, you can bring the layers of paint upwards, forming a giant pillar, visible from great distances.

While light-speed may still apply to the rotation speed, this is now an extremely cheap method of communication, since all you need is a flat enough rock or anything you can rotate. You can now rotate it around in intervals to communicate using morse code. You can also set up several pillars if you are lost in a forest/maze and want to keep track of where you have been before from a distance.

The rotating pillar trick can also be used to blind enemies from a great distance. Get a large shield with a flat front surface (like a riot shield), now apply tons of layers of paint to it and swing the paint pillar into the faces of your enemies. The paint suppression means it won't hurt them physically, but it will certainly make it very hard to see.
