I host a rave to show off my only moderately impressive flashing color wall.

I then try to make a giant parabolic mirror death ray to fry everyone who said my power is dumb, and then I realize that a giant parabola is a parabola and not a mathematically flat surface.

I sulk away and black out my windows to mope in darkness.
