Uther killed tons of demons in hell itself using a magical hammer if I recall. Stuff that can affect other planes directly is uncommon but exists and worst case you can just open a portal down there with enough effort. The reason there isn't a full scale war is that the demons outnumber mortals and don't have a strong incentive to mess with the mortal world as things stand (or rather the parts of demon society that do don't have the power to challenge the parts that don't)
