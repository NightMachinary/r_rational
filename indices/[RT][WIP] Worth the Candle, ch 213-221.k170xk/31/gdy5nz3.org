It's curious that we haven't been shown the virtues for gold magic yet, given that Juniper has surely passed level 20 by now, and that the gold magic is driving the plot so much in this batch. I'm rooting for "virtues" that strengthen the call of the gold (it can detect gold from further away, it gets better at long-term planning, etc.)
