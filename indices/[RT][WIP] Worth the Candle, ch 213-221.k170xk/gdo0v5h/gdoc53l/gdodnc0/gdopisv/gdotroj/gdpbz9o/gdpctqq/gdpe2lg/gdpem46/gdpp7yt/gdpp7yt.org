Okay, I was definitely wrong about the virtues. And if you really think that you could achieve all of that as a peasant who doesn't have Joon's super-accelerated leveling, then I can see the appeal.

But even if I thought I could rub a magic lamp and enter Aerb as both a Grandmaster Bladebound and with mastery of a school of magic (either of which would probably take enough dedication to preclude getting the other in any other way), I still don't think it would be enough of an upside to offset the potential downside.

But arguing core values is, pretty much by definition, an exercise in futility. If you think it's worth the tradeoff, then cool. I just value "not getting tortured for all eternity" highly enough that there's very little I would accept in trade for a quantifiable risk of such torture happening. Not even cool shit like magical powers.
