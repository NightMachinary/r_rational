  Oops. That's a pretty significant difference in God's message...which should you believe?

If I were going to believe either, it seems obvious it would have to be the latter; the very existence of a choice of which to believe disproves the former, or at least makes it mostly pointless since the words technically being preserved is of no use if there's no way of knowing which words are the right ones. To believe the former would thus require accepting that you're probably not believing the correct version, which is obviously self-defeating.
