  And, even if it weren't, a Hell that could be avoided by following a few hundred simple rules like "don't murder people," "don't eat seafood," and "don't do any work on Saturdays" (or the even easier Christian rules of "Love God" and "Love your neighbour"), rather than one where if you die and can't be spiked, then sorry, you're damned... I still think I'd make that trade in a heartbeat.

Keep in mind that some of those rules are calls to positive actions that should be considered evil:

- If you are a man, stone your son to death if he doesn't obey you [Deu 21:18-21]
- If you are a man, participate in stoning to death the son of any rebellious son in your community [ibid]
- If you are a woman who is raped by a man, you must marry your rapist (more literally, /he/ must marry /you/, but marriage is commutative) [Deu 22:28-29]
- Kill all gay men [Lev 20:13]
- Beat your children with a rod when they misbehave [Prov 23:13-14]

And some are things that you've probably done at some point:

- Do not paint realistic pictures, sculpt realistic sculptures, or take photographs because that would be making for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. (NB: The command not to worship these images is separate.) [Ex 20:4-6]
- Hope that none of your parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents did anything to piss god off, because he will punish down to the third or fourth generation [ibid]

Then add in the fact that:

- At least for some versions of the Biblical god, some of the things that get you sent to Hell are thoughtcrimes. For example, you thought that barista was really hot, or you ever watched porn, or you ever got excited by a sex scene in a movie? Oops, you just committed adultery in your heart, it's hell for you.\\
- God visits punishment on the third or fourth generation

Short version: If you're Christian, it's almost unavoidable that you are going to hell.

EDIT:

Now, sure, there are a lot of apologetics for all of these things. Pastors, priests, ministers, etc basically make a living cleaning up the nastier parts of the Bible and explaining why a plain reading of the modern English text is not actually correct, despite Psalm 12:7 saying that God will preserve His words. Oh, wait...a plain reading of the KJV says that. A plain reading of the NIV says that god will preserve his people. Oops. That's a pretty significant difference in God's message...which should you believe?

KJV: "6 The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 7 Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever."

NIV: "6 And the words of the Lord are flawless, like silver purified in a crucible, like gold[c] refined seven times. 7 You, Lord, will keep the needy safe and will protect us forever from the wicked [...]"
