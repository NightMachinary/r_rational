This is entirely speculation, based on what I would do if I were the author.

Fairly early in this batch of chapters, there's some rumination on whether Joon would want to go back to Earth, if he had the opportunity. And his conclusion was, no, he's not going back. In fact, it's such a foregone conclusion that he states it before he gives the reasons why. I think something is doing to happen to change that resolution, and it's going to happen when he meets Arthur.

The biggest thing that wasn't mentioned when he considered whether or not to go back to Earth is his friends. We've met Aerb-Reimer, and he wasn't quite the same person Joon remembered. Now, Valencia has insisted that Joon go talk to his Aerb-father and Aerb-Tiff, before finally going to meet his own Arthur, the first encounter with anyone /really/ from his previous life since he got there.

The purpose, I think, of all of this, is to make the choice of Earth vs. Aerb a lot more difficult than Joon thinks it will be. The inconsistencies you mention would serve as foreshadowing. Someone - maybe Arthur, but more likely Amaryllis - could point out that, for all his insistence that he's more suited to Aerb, Earth is where his friends and biological family are, where his culture is, and the fact that he can't even acclimate himself to the standard terminology of Aerb. Probably because he doesn't truly believe it's real.

So, that would be my guess: this is trying to build up the idea, in advance, that Joon isn't quite so confident that he'd choose life on Aerb over Earth as he thinks he is, with the intention of having him make that choice at some point in the near future.

Again, this is just a shot in the dark, but if I were setting something like this up, that's the climactic moment I'd be setting it up towards.
