I'm curious what point is being made by all of Joon's Earth/Aerb fuck ups, because this batch seemed to be full of them---using "dollar" instead of "obol" a couple times in quick succession, the second time after correcting himself on it the first; using "planet" instead of "plane" and being corrected on it by Amaryllis; and, of course, not knowing what the mujahideen are and explicitly disregarding them as being Aerbian, just like he did all the time with Fenn. The corrections and the exasperation from Amaryllis seem to be making this into A Thing, rather than just a character trait, especially with it coming so close to what seems like the end, and I'm not sure where it's going to go.
