Okay I'm just getting caught up and loving the meta narrative discussion about meta narratives.

  “You're asking me if I'm an unreliable narrator?” I asked. “I mean, I haven't lied to you, except those times I did. There's probably some alternate version of this story where I didn't out myself the moment we met, and was able to keep the secret of being dream-skewered, or ... maybe pretended that I was just dream-skewered, without all the weird Aerb-Earth interplay. But I'm also not a narrator.” To my knowledge, anyway.

I literally laughed out loud to this. One of the best delivered fourth wall jokes I've encountered.

Love that we are talking about meta after having literally slain the postmodernist dragon.
