Agreed. Among other things, he's only at Achievement Progress: Super Exclusive 2/40.

I think we're going to see a lot more exclusions (some exploit of Gold Magic next) before we're done, to say nothing of the magics he hasn't even unlocked yet, like velocity. There's lots of fun to be had exploiting speedster powers. And lots of speedster pop culture lore to deconstruct.

Magics on his sheet, but not unlocked: Velocity, Revision, Rune, Plastic, Fire, Tree, and Wards.

I'll be really surprised if the story ends before we get to see Rune Magic. It's been flagged a number of times that he's got some clever ideas to exploit it. And if he triggers an exclusion of Rune Magic, the soul-extracting needles will stop working, condemning every single living person on Aerb to eventual Hell, if they don't exploit Valencia's power to "solve" the problem of Hell.
