The line about being a narrator is such a weird postmodern joke. I love it so much.\\
Actually, the more I think about it, I realize that WoC is doing something I've not seen before - one of the hallmarks of postmodernism is to be self reflective, but I've never seen a work that doesn't just point back to its own structure or genre, but explicitly points back to its own postmodernism. I'm sure other examples exist, and I'd love to compare them.
