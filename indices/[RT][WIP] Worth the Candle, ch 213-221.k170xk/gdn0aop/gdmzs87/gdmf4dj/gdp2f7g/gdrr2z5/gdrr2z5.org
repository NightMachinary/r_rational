Broadly speaking, I think the whole story's point is props for consequentialism, with this as a single elaboration on the theme.

Like, BitB is a monster for raising people to choose to sacrifice themselves for his ends. Mary is a hero for doing likewise. Juniper swooping down and slaughtering a few hundred frog cops in order to steal magic items from Bethel is heroic, because it might make him strong enough to stop people like the monstrous Onion, who kills far less people than that in duels.

This just keeps on happening, to the point that Perisev gets a whole 'this is why you suck' speech when she attacks Juniper because she's thinking too much about the narrative...one update before the team thinks a lot about the narrative and goes off to attack people.

You can handwave at the Second Empire comparison that keeps on coming up, if you like, where our crew repeats robotically to one another, over and over, how terrible the 2E folks were for wanting to take everything over, even as they strive desperately to become God and take everything over.

I don't think the point of all this is to make the characters great big hypocrites. My take is that the point is the other way round, it's Stephen R Donaldson's condemnation of innocence. If the party didn't do these things, they'd be helpless, frozen out of action because any action they take would be hypocritical/evil. The only way to actually affect the world is to take the risk that you are doing so in error, follow your moral intuitions where they take you and act in full knowledge that unbiased observers will cluck their tongues at you.
