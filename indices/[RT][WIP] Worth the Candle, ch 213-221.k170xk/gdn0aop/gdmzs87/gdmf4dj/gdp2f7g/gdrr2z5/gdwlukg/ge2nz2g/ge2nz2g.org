I feel like because constitutionalism is taken for granted by the rationalist community that it makes sense for alexanderwales to deconstruct/reconstruct it. The Second Empire is definitely an intentional deconstruction. If alexanderwales just wanted a bunch of bad guys he could have made them generic fantasy Nazis, but instead he emphasized how they had a mindset of scientifically brute forcing things that clashed against Aerb's logic. Juniper and friends failing to learn from its errors would be more surprising but not impossible, especially with the speculation about Postmodernist fiction which defies or subverts conventions.
