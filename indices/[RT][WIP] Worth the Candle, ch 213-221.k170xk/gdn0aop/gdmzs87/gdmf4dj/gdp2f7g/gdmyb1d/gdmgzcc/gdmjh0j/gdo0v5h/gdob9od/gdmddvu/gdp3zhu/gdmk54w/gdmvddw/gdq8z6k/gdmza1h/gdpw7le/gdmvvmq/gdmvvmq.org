Hell yeah, great batch! Kind of funny how from our perspective this is a set of downtime chapters, but for the characters its been very busy. Glad to see Valencia make a come back. It's kind of surreal to see them push so hard for Fel Seed. I don't expect him to be dealt with before Void Beast, but maybe there will be more to the story after Uther is found than I'm expecting. I also don't expect to see Gold Magic play a huge role in the Fel Seed adventure. It's just too antisocial. Its been actively working to isolate Juniper and reduce group cohesion. Its a lot of power, but especially after its just been used to clean up multiple threats off screen it would be unsatisfying I think. Besides two weeks is just not enough time to rope in Thargox and it'd be a waste of perfectly good foreshadowing for it not to play a part.
