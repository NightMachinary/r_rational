Matthew 5:18, KJV: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."

There are multiple interpretations of this passage and yes, you're right that one of them is "Hey, all that stuff I said before? I'm taking backsies. Don't worry about it." That's a minority opinion and all of the other interpretations I'm aware of say that yes, Christians are still bound by Mosaic law.

Still, I'll roll with it. Let's allow the Christians to keep the Torah (aka Old Testament) as part of their holy book but not be bound by any of it. You're still stuck with the part about a moment of lust for a woman sending you to hell, because you have committed adultery with her in your heart. You also have the problem that if you've ever prayed in church (or anywhere that isn't your closet) then you have broken God's command, because Matthew 6:6 says "But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."

Rejecting the Old Testament doesn't get you anywhere. The New Testament has just as many commands in it that make it virtually impossible to avoid hell. It's also far more immoral than the Old Testament -- the Old Testament God would turn you into salt, or blow up your city, or tell his people to dash your brains against the rocks while you were still an infant, but he let it go at death. The New Testament God will have you killed and will then keep you conscious so he can burn you forever.
