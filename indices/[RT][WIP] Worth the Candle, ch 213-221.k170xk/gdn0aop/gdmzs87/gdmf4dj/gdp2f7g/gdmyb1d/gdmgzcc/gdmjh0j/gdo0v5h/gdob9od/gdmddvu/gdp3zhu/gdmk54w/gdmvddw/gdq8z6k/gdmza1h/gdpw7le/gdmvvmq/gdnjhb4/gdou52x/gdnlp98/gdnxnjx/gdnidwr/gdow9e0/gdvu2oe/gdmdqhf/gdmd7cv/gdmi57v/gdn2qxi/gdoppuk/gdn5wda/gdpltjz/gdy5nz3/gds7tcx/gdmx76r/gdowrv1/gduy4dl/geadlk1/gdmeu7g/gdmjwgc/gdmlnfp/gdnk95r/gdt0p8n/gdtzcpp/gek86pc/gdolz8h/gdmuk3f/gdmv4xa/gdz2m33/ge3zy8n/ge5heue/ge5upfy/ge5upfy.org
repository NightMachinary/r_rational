Hell yeah! Thanks!

Honestly I think I skimmed that one, the conversation with rosemallow doesn't flow as well as most of AWales stuff, i think it got kinda confusing with juniper dipping into rosemallows memories and riffling around, even now i had to reread the first half of the chapter twice to make sure i knew who was saying what and talking to who.
