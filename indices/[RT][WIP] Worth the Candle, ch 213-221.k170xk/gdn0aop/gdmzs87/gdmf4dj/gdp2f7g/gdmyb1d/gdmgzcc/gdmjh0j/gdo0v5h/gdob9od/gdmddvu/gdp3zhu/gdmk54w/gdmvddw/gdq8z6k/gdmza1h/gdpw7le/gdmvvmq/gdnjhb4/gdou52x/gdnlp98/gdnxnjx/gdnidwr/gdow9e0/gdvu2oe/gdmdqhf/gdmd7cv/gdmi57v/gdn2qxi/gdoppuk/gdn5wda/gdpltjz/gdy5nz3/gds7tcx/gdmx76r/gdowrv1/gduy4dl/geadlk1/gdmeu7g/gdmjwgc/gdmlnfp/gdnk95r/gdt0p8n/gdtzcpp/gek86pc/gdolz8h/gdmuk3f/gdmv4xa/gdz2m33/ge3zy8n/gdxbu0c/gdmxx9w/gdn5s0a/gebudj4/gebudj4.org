I only check the sub around 3 times every 2 weeks. I'm stepping up my coding game primarily so that I can find a way to notify myself whenever cuthulurayjepsen posts a Worth the Candle update.

I'm happy whenever there is an update, but I'm less happy with this particular update. It feels like our author is very conscious that everyone else is conscious of the endgame of WTC. To bke honest though, I think that's just a part of me being a part of the ride, of this serial novel. I don't think I would be complaining if I were reading this as a complete work.

Whether Homer, or Dostoyevsky, or our dear author-- I think that whatever we were waiting for (as an audience) is going to be both more and less than were expecting.

Personally, I trust the author who has brought us up to this point.
