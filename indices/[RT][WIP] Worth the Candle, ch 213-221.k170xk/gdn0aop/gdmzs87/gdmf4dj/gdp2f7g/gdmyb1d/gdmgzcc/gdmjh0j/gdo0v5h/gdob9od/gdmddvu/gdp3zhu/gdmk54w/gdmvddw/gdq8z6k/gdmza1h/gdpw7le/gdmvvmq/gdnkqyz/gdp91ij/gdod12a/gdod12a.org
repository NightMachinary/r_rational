What's the lifetime of a gold mage? Like, average of 2 years before running out of new gold and losing power?

I think the real stinger will be either the goldbug's true motive, or what it's a metaphor for and how it relates to superman.

But for a sec, why does the goldbug want people to gather gold? It's ultimate aim is the gold plane, but what then? Plus, does it actually want the gold from the gold plane or is it e.g. physically located on the gold plane and wants out? What will it do once it has infinite gold from the gold plane?
