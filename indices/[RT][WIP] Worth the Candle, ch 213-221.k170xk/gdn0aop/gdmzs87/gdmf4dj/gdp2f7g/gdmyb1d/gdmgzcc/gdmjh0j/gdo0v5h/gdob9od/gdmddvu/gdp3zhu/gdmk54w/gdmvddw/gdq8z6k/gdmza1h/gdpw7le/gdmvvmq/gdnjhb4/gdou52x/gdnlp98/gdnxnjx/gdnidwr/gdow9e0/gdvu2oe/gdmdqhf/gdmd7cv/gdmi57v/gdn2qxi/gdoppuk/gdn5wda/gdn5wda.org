Maybe this is just where my head's at, but the call of the gold feels a lot like living in covid mitigation times. There's something measurable that you're getting out of it, you know you're only going to be doing it for a while longer, but you don't know for how long, but the things you have to do are boringly annoying. And once it's all done, basically all of that effort gained you nothing, it was just staying in place.

Loss of the gold doesn't quite match with getting covid, so it's not a perfect match, but that was the first thing that came to mind as I was reading it.
