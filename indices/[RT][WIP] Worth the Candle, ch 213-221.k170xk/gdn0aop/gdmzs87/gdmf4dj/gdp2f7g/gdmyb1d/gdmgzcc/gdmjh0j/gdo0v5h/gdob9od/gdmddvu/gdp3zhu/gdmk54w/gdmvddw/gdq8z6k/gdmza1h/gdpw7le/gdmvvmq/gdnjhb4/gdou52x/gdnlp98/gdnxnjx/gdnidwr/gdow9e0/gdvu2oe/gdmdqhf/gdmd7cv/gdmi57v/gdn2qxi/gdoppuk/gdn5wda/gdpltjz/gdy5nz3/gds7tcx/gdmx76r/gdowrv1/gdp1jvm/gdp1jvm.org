As long as the end result of the upgrades doesn't actively use or leave any trace of the excluded magic it's effects can leave the zone.

For example, the portal smith guy can use his portals to launch projectiles outside his zone and even if the portals themselves can't leave. Or rat rot persisting outside of the necrotic field effect exclusion zone.
