Full spoilers ahead:

After wrapping up Anglecynn, which involved going through a marriage inspection and getting their hands on a boatload of entads, they went back to Poran (though Mary left a bunch of clones behind to handle politics).

Next they decided to tackle the dragon imposed quest of killing Captain Blue in The Bottle. Turns out he wasn't so easy to find in his Zone, so they had to detour to the Doris Finch exclusion to negotiate for her tracking abilities (the DFEZ is one of my favorite parts of the story so far, by the way).

Side quest done, they went back to Blue, where it turns out defeating him is trivial, but dealing with the fallout is going to be a clusterfuck. They trap him in a ward for the time being and before they have time for anything more, the dragon shows up asking if it's done. Juniper says it's not so simple, they might need more time before killing him, and being a very reasonable dragon she tries to roast them. So after a handful of dragon fighting, Essentialism is excluded, Juniper is a Gold Mage and the two dragons are dead.

Then we come to the current batch where not a lot happens in terms of plot, it was mostly dealing with the mess of Blue in the Bottle and the demands of Gold Magic, which included one-shoting a couple of exclusions.
