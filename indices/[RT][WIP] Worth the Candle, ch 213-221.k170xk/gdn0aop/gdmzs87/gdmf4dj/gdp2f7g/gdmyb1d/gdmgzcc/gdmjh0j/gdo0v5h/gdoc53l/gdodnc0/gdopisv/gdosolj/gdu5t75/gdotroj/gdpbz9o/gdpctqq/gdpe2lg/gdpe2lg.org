Joon can only fly because he has Gold Magic. Is that really worth the trade-offs involved?

And yes, you could do magic. Which school would you pick? Pick one, and only one, and hope it doesn't get excluded. If you're fantastically wealthy and talented (you aren't; by your own scenario, you're "a peasant in anglecynn"), you might be able to pick up a second school.

Also, you're not a PC; you're an "average Aerbian," so your physical skills won't have magical virtues, no matter how high you train them.

Still worth it?
