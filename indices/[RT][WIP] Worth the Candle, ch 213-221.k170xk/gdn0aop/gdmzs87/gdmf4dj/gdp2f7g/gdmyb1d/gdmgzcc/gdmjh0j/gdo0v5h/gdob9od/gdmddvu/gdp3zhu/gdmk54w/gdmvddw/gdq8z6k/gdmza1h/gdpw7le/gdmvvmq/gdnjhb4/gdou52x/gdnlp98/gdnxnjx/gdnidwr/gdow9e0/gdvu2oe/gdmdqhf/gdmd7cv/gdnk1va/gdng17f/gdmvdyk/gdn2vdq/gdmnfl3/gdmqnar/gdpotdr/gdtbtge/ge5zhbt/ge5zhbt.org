Chapter 216 Bureaucratic Melees:

- “Two things,” said Amaryllis. “First, you can still have a month, if you'd like. *Elias* Blue is under our thumb.” - /Elisha/
- Not quite a typo, just something I found a bit confusing, maybe it was a mistake on your part or maybe I misunderstood. First we have this:

“Two seconds later, with a zwrish, six people stepped into being not far from the manor.”

The six people are Alcida, a vitric, Figaro, a gnome, Elias, the satyr, Ragusa, an orc, and finally Tangli Ferst and Foster Bragg who “were both sharp-beaked likoni”.

A little later in the conversation however someone of another species interjects: ‘ “And illegal,” said another voice from among them, a tall lodona woman who was chewing something idly. ‘ Now, maybe I misunderstood and there were actually more people than just the six that were initially introduced, but I get the impression you mixed up the species of the two extras there.
