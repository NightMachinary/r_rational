I think it set the mood well. To use a cliche, this is the calm before the final storm. In another story I would be disappointed if nothing happened for 50k words, but I'm anticipating AW is going to throw some fucked up shit at us, so I enjoyed it.

It's a sad and exciting thought that we're so close to the conclusion. What do you think 1, maybe 2 more batches for the story to end? Maybe with an epilogue or an errata after that.
