No, just kinda weird. Surname means family name, which in English comes last, but in some languages and cultures, such as Japanese or, apparently, Terrence's, the family name comes first and the given name last.

So his family name, surname, is Phylac, but in his culture it comes before his given name, Terrence. Making his name Phylac Terrence. Phylac is his surname, and comes first.
