This is a great theory. The other thing I was thinking for Corn Squabble is corn being a play on "Ma(i)ze" which is basically what long stairs is.

Either as a straight up jokey squadron name (Maze Fight becomes the dumbest synonyms for each word) OR it is a Craig/Joon reference to some specific maze based argument they had in the group about long stairs, since squabble is defined as

#+begin_quote
  a noisy quarrel about something trivial.
#+end_quote

Which seems pretty on brand for the dnd group and Arthur in particular.
