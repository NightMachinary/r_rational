Well, folks have been speculating about the meaning of Joon appearing to actually believe he is from a town named Bumfuck, Kansas. I think most landed on Joon having his memory modified, but now it seems more likely that he is simply from an equally simulated Earth, which has a town with that actual name. Which certainly fits the DM's claims about Arthur in Aerb being the actual Arthur from Earth much better. And it allows the gang to potentially visit the “real” Earth with Joon, which could be a lot of fun.
