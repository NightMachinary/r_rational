this batch was WtC at its funniest, and despite consisting of so many different threads there were very strong thematic throughlines tying things together. In fact, this batch benefitted hugely from the batch model, because if I'd been reading these chapters over the course of the last few months I'd've missed a ton of connections, nevermind the fact that AW might not have been able to weave them in so neatly

the call of the gold is proving to be a hugely unexpected highlight, especially in the context of all the discussion of postmodernism - it's like an audience member fixated on one aspect of a story, skimming over the world as Joon sees it so that it can get to the gold faster. The entire batch has a great motif about resolving things, and the compromises you have to make if you want to do so quickly. Yeah, I'd love a whole chapter in Perisev's library, but... whatever, sell it all, let's keep things moving. Bethel's rehabilitation, the thievery flashback, the EZs, the Locus' recovery, the Tuung... plus a ton more micro-level examples, they all tie together into a really compelling picture. And this is all without getting into the /Matrix/-centric throughline about layers of reality...

anyway, possible spoiler for an upcoming twist, so read the rest of this post at your peril, but one of my friends sent me down a rabbit hole of speculation by reminding me that Craig wanted to join the army

  One of the patches had a cob of corn, and on either side, what I assumed was a team or division name, “Corn Squabble”.

and if you consider how Joon's described his hometown on a couple of occasions...

#+begin_quote
  I tapped at the window once, idly. I thought that I had seen something, down by the road, but closer inspection revealed only cropland, stalks of something that was close enough to corn that it felt like home.

that's from 74, and from 114:

#+begin_quote
  We lived in a small town whose focus was mostly agriculture, corn, wheat, and soybeans. None of that is terribly important.
#+end_quote

obviously corn is ubiquitous throughout the midwest, and there are logistical issues with this theory, but from a Doylist point of view I'm struggling to see why AW would pick corn specifically for the patch if not to draw a link to Joon's home. Maybe it's a red herring, or maybe it's no deeper than "look, an Earth thing!", or maybe it belongs to someone other than Craig. I'd note that Craig and Tom are the only players who haven't had an Aerb analogue appear in some form or another yet. And of course, if Arthur and Joon can both have their turn with the game system, in "stories" that reflect them as individuals...
