What, in your view, makes Aerb superior enough to Earth to justify that risk?

The only thing that Joon can offer to justify staying, if he were "the average Aerbian, or some version of [himself] that had a parallel to what [he] would have been on Earth," is this:

#+begin_quote
  Aerb had big towers that no one had an explanation for. It had rivers that sometimes ran backwards, fish that exploded if the light of a full moon touched them, metals that turned soft like putty when you sang to them, billions of tiny little things to seek out and understand, to soak in and enjoy. Earth had that too, it did, but the scale on Aerb was so much different, so much larger.
#+end_quote

In short, Aerb has a lot more magic and mystery than Earth does.

Is that enough for you? Or is there something more to Aerb that would justify the risk of eternal torment?
