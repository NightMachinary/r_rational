Thank you very much! I appreciate you taking the time to summarize things for me. I might check out the Doris exclusion part at some point, but the rest didn't quite revive my interest. The whole Amaryllis clone stuff was the final straw that got me to stop reading, now that I think about it. Glad to find out Juniper has been nerfed a bit with Essentialism, at least.
