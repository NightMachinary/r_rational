Au contraire, the gold on the moon is now /only/ available to gold mages. Only rich ones, but at the end of the day goldbug /wants/ the richest gold mages to be even richer.

If Joon already had enough gold to the gold plane, then goldbug would have pushed him to go there already, so we can assume that Joon isn't able to do so with his current amount of gold.

So, suppose Joon retires and an equally-powerful gold mage replaces him: first thing goldbug says is "go to moon, mark gold" (easy power boost) and second thing it says is "bring your existing gold and stash it here".

If this keeps happening then eventually, there's enough gold on the moon to get to the gold plane.

If you're worried about gold on Aerb becoming more scarce and hurting novice gold mages: keep in mind, more gold is still being mined and put into the system (plus, gold being more valuable incentivises mining more of it).

Thinking about it more though, I think goldbug represents stockholders (not capitalism in general) and becoming a gold mage is like IPOing or something.
