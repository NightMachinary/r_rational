  To use a cliche, this is the calm before the final storm.

Maybe. I feel like there's still a lot to be resolved, and this is accelerating too fast too suddenly to actually be the climax of the story? We haven't actually had any down time. This chapter is 'the calm' in the sense that nothing specific happened to move things definitively forward, but it was really tense for an actual downbeat period to be followed by rising action. I kind of feel that our heroes can only end being beat down by their attempt going forward. At the very least, it's hard to see how gold magic is just the fix to thei problems. It's not really thematically on point. We'll see, I guess.
