Jesus. Just read the revelation of Blues Phylactery and had to go back in the text re Spirit "Quest Accepted: As the Spirit Moves You - There are no spirit mages left alive. The art has been dead for some five hundred years, and Uther was the one to kill it." - worded in such a way that of course someone undead could be a practitioner, lol.
