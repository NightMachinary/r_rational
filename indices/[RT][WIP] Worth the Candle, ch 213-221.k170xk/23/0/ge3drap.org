Yeah, I was a big proponent of that. Joon and his friends obviously had to be simulants all along, Bumfuck was just sneaky foreshadowing. It's a little silly that he's not saying it out loud already while mentioning how could it be possible for Arthur to get transmigrated if his brain was destroyed. But like how he picked up the idiot ball and completed a quest in the infinite library and leveled up, it's to set up a scene to talk about a thing.

As a simulant living in a simulation of the slow boring stupid collapse of capitalism and the ensuing apocalypse that follows... I'm a bit jealous. All I have to look forward to is eating trees for a week and then getting devoured by a turtle.

I, uh, can see why making the MC an expy of an idealistic teenage version of ourselves is way better.
