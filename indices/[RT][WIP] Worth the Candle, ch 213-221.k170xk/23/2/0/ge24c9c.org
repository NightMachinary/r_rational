That is a possible interpretation, and you do you, but I don't buy it. My read on the times Joon has called the town Bumfuck is that he genuinely thinks it is called that---and not once has he suggested the name is funny or meaningful beyond any other name. It could absolutely be that Alexander Wales has decided to give Joon this odd sliver of cultural blindness just to allow Wales to communicate something directly to us, as you say. But lacking any other examples of that I can think of, my feeling is that there is an in-story explanation for this bit of oddness. Guess I will keep reading and see.
