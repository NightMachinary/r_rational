In Joon's shoes? Sure; I doubt he loves the Council of Arches any less than he loved his roleplay group, and he's in a position of power in Aerb. The scale would have to be weighted heavily in Earth's favour for it to even resemble a compelling choice.

But for the average Aerbian, I think "Hell doesn't exist" would, itself, be a hundred times more compelling than any hypothetical reason would need to be in order for me to switch from there to here.
