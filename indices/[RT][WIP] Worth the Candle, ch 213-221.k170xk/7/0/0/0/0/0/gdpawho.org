Given that the common understanding of Hell based off of an Italian satirist's interpretation of a millennium's worth of people theorizing about maybe a half-dozen references to what oral tradition claims that a preacher said a century before any of it was ever committed to text, none of which bears much relation to the underlying Jewish tradition that the preacher was supposedly the fulfillment of?

Yes, I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist as described.

I'm more agnostic about the existence of some form of afterlife, and I imagine that I would be more willing to entertain the concept if there were evidence, as Joon has, than magic exists and interacts with our world. But Hell as a place where people's souls are tortured by demons and devils (i.e. a Hell in the same sense as an Aerbian one)? That seems to have been made up out of whole cloth by early Christian writers.

And, even if it weren't, a Hell that could be avoided by following a few hundred simple rules like "don't murder people," "don't eat seafood," and "don't do any work on Saturdays" (or the even easier Christian rules of "Love God" and "Love your neighbour"), rather than one where if you die and can't be spiked, then sorry, you're damned... I still think I'd make that trade in a heartbeat.

Hell, even if the choices were between Aerb, with afterlife being "oblivion if you're spiked and Hell if you're not," or Earth, with afterlife being one of (you don't know which) "oblivion, no matter what," or "a utopian afterlife if you deserve it, or Aerb-style Hell if you don't," I still think the choice to move to Earth is a clear one.

Unless you're Joon, of course. [[https://i.stack.imgur.com/UF3xT.jpg][Always be yourself. Unless you can ascend to godhood: then, always ascend to godhood.]]
