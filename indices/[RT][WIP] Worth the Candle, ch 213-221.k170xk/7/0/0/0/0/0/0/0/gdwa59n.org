Not to quibble, but Judaism != Christianity.

There's this thing where the god sends its self-son down to sacrifice itself to undo original sin as a "second covenant" with humans, which overturns the original covenant with Abraham covered in what's generally compiled as the old Testament.

It's a little goofy and relies on some historical context, but the takeaway is that Christians aren't accountable to or for what came before Christ.
