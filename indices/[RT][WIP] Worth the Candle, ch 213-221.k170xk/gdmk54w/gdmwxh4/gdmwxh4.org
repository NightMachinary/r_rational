Reflection of how the system/DM viewed them? We haven't seen titles anywhere else.

Perisev was constantly reading, watching and waiting for shit to go down.

Tommul was the dragon going "fuck yea i'm a dragon".

Perisev was wretched for trying to understand, Tommul was wise and mighty for being a generic dragon.
