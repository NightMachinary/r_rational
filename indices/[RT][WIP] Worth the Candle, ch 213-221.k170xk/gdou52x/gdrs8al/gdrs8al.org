I dunno about him/them dying, but I have a lot of trouble imagining that he won't have to reckon with Manifest and the 2E comparison before the end.

Like, hrrm, the story goes *hard* on the parallels, to the point that it calls itself out on it. Now we've got the BitB/Tuung parallel, the Locus dealy, and it's just about explicit at this point.

It's just hard to imagine that we don't see a resolution there. Juniper ' â€œTo be clear, we're all against slavery? ', Smith has an indoctrinated army of child soldiers, and he's ordering up a second batch. If they save the world it's like...the sin of the 2E was that they were bad at it? Their 'only we can fix it' ideology was just...ahead of its time?

There is a lot of narrative weight behind a confrontation between Juniper and these accusations, is what I'm trying to gesture at. It would surprise me if Juniper doesn't have to reckon with the final legacy of the 2E, and in the process draw a bright line between him and them, get his moral high ground back.
