This is an interesting comment but I would be surprised to learn this is an author-intended explicit theme, and not just something implicit in all of the "rational" community's writings. I mean - its right there in the name, "rational" - a belief that people of great intellect are special enough that their attempts at consequentialist moral reasoning won't fail in the typical way. That's why theses stories are niche - and lose normal folks over their run - the protagonist's consequentialism comes off as a deep moral failing and there is an expectation of an eventual comeuppance that never arrives. I agree the author is very unlikely to be holding an ace up his sleeve making all this a deconstruction of the HPMOR-style protagonist, as such a deconstruction would leave the story no longer "rational."
