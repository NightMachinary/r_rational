I said it in a previous set of chapters and I'll say it again: The Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle and the necrolaborum exclusion zone are meant as a dark mirror of how Amaryllis purpose raised an entire Tuung population.

The clearing up of old quests did a decent job of balancing summarizing the important points while not dragging out trivial quests. They could have been a little longer because Alexanderwales' world building is always fun to read, but it wouldn't have advanced the plot or character development.

It looks like we are moving towards the end, with the way things wrapped up... but I recall the Gods were excluded from the worldbuilding side document to avoid spoiling them, so there is probably a significant arc for the God Botherer quest left.
