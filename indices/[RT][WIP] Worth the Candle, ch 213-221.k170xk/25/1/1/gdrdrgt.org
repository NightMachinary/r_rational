It's a well discussed bit of near-overlap, given (as [[/u/sicutumbo]] points out) both species have been known for some time. As far as we can tell it's an intentional aspect of Aerb's style that it's so chock full of stuff that there are sometimes confusing collisions - see for example the several unrelated "smoke magic"s mentioned in chapter 206.

  Smoke magic was primarily concerned with the alteration of perception, with the higher levels being able to push that perception into becoming reality. It had no connection with the he'lesh smoke magic, which was a completely different take on smoke-as-magic (that was just how Aerb was sometimes).
