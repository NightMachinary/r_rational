Ch 213: "I've only read about a dozen books in Groglir, and only a few of them were fiction"

A chapter or two ago Juniper said he'd read three fiction books total since coming to Aerb, so "a few" seems odd.

Ch 213: "I don't know if that argument is germane. It's definitely in line with what I know about the Second Empire's [*], but yeah"

Word missing? Unless the possessive is meant to refer back to the word "argument", but I don't understand what that would mean in context.

Ch 214: "and I don't know [*] that's right either, but"

#+begin_quote
  "if" / "whether" / "that" ?
#+end_quote

Ch 214: "It was virtually certain that the glass magic exclusion zone had taken that memory as the germ of inspiration."

#+begin_quote
  "I was"?
#+end_quote

Ch 216: "away from the people that were standing down below"

#+begin_quote
  "away from the people who were standing down below"
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  "away from the people standing down below"
#+end_quote

Ch 217: "“The mass dracicide?” I asked."

#+begin_quote
  "she asked" (Vella is speaking; Juniper replies)
#+end_quote

Ch 218: "Slavery hadn't been booming business back in Uther's day"

#+begin_quote
  "been a booming business"
#+end_quote

Ch 220: "the kind of pissed off the fades quickly"

#+begin_quote
  "that fades quickly"
#+end_quote

Ch 221: "when you were too high of level above them."

Not sure about this one, I've seen people use it from time to time but I would consider it ungrammatical
