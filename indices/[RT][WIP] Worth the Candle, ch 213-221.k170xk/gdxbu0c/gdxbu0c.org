It might be because the chapters are always so tightly paced, but I wonder when this is a book if some editing might be in order to not have stuff so tightly on the nose

Like talking about Earth being real, literally next chapter having the same conversation about the matrix. Then again maybe I'm missing a ton of interchapterblock themes which does do that

But as is a theme of the book so much meta talk requires you to then consider the text itself, like all the postmodern talk and you see the ways where this book isn't very postmodern at least in the sense that almost everything has some meaning, and all the dialogue follows so tightly both for the reader and within the narrative yet are all pretty closely linked, how lucky. [perhaps there's a word I'm looking for that isn't postmodern but I'm not educated enough to know the jargon] Like the Lucky Stairs stuff, but of course we know that from Juniper's perspective it's not that weird because he's the protag but from our perspective it's weirder, at least he had a 4 hour gap between conversations (though perhaps that makes them even more obviously linked). I'm still waiting for a really postmodernist take where a void gun hits him or there's a chapter about something completely unrelated, but I think and maybe I'm willing to bet that no one would write this much and end it like that. Most postmodernist stories (like the Willy Wonka one or Slime God thing) are quite obvious from the get go (and rather short), and the annoyance by dissatisfying most readers mean it'll also be a minority.

If this story ends in failure it will be fantastic, but I might take up a bet that it will not, lampshading it probably isn't meaningful (even statistically, stories that talk about the chance of failure at the end are probably no more or less likely to wrap up neatly). Probably bittersweet if I had to guess. Certainly not godhood and the eventual succumbing that would be to turning the universe into densely packed bliss bacteria

Great stuff anyway, so nice for the text to do some thinking.

What system could not have this unless Juniper wants to kill those with congenial defects or just outside some STD

What outcome is he hoping for exactly? Do more people work menial jobs that they don't enjoy when given the choice or when not? Also it's a bit rich for the protag to say that.

Why did she say that?
