Well on a meta level, it's really obviously meant as a critique of capitalism and working as a corporation. So that's why it's so shortsighted, on a meta level.

As for why on a literal level: maybe that's just it's personality. Or /alternatively/:

Gold mages are likely ephemeral - once you have a certain amount of gold you can retire as a gold mage and still live a life of luxury. So investing past that point is useless. So /more broadly/, without relying on one particular gold mage, what does it need for someone to break into the plane of gold?

Well, you need a fuckton of gold all in one spot.

So, if you have a ton of gold mages all gradually concentrating gold in their possession (and it really needs to be /all in one spot/ and /securely/ in their possession, to avoid them being lied to - which nicely matches up to observed requirements for gold mages), then it makes the job of /future/ gold mages easier. Retired gold mages can trade their gold to other gold mages in exchange for non-gold wealth, so retirees are now just a worn out tool rather than any sort of catastrophe for the long-term plan.

Sooner or later, all you'll need is one single uber-powerful (due to being uber-rich) gold mage who can get to the plane of gold and unleash the goldbug. Like Joon. Oops.
