Oh I think it unlikely, it's just the omission of it being on screen and the consistent discussion of it otherwise in the same drop of the DM being bored, and unreliable narators being discussed has me a little suspicious. They couldn't miss that unless it was railroaded or the DM got petty because he was bored, but we just saw Joon be something that could be seen as petty when he was bored in the flashback. Probably an epileptic trees guess on my part but it's odd.
