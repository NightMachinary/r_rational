If you think that is even remotely likely in WtC, we both have gotten very different ideas of Marys and Graks and also Joons competence, the groups fear of a united Hell and in general the strong taboo or better Gaes that goes with Soul Bottling.

EDIT: more to the point, yes thats a type of thing a DM can do. Most of the time it just results in the group always narrating all their contingencies which I personally find to be boring playstyle. "I go out for a stroll on the market. Of course I cast all my 3 protection cantrips and I carry my rope and healers kit and my purse is not on my belt but in my armpit-belt".
