  The gold hadn't ended up staying in Darili Irid, though Juniper had made plenty of offers to let it stay there, either because he thought he needed to, or because he believed that the gold was, ultimately, immaterial. Juniper had said, repeatedly, that in his games the “loot” didn't matter much, that he would adjust the challenges to the party as they gained abilities and could spend more money. It was hard to tell with Juniper how much of what he said was hollow words, how much was simply motivated by the game, and how much he really meant. In this case, he was saying that it was no true hardship, because money would come to them all the same. ‘Gold sinks', he kept saying. It was slightly uncomfortable, to hear that the money didn't matter either way. Grak had deferred to Amaryllis; the money wouldn't bring anyone back. It wouldn't actually provide absolution. He had always known that.
