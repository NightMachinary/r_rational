I feel bad the ending is wrapping up so zoomily like this, but, I suppose I wouldn't have been happy with any ending.

By the gods, if Woodworking doesn't save the day, I hope the next work you do is Worth the Candle Alternative. An alternative version of events where Joon pours all of his time singularly into woodworking from day one right off the plane like any sane person would. And everything becomes much simpler and fluffier through the power of sensible terminal values and character planning.

Are you not already on board with the Fenn+Mary Jealousy arc, where many antics ensue from Joon deciding he'll make himself the perfect girlfriend, /out of wood/??
