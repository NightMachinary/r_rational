Would anyone be willing to write a brief summary of recent events in this story? I stopped reading around the point when Shia the Cannibal attacked the empire capital and I'm really on the fence whether to give the story another shot or not, so knowing which direction it took since then would be really helpful. I don't mind spoilers.
