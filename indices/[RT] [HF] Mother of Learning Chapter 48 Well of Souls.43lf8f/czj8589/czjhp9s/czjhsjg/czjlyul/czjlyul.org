It could be that the looping mechanism only needs a power boost at the point where it resets. And, handily, every time it resets it's after the invasion has killed a large number of people with an open gate nearby. When one of the loopers dies early they don't immediately reset the loop, the marker just keeps their soul around until the loop resets after the invasion.

I'm not saying it's likely, just that that's one way it could work.
