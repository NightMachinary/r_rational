Zorian's obviously benefited from the exercises and brought various amateurs into the loop as well as experts, but he kept ignoring one of the most obvious people out of sheer dislike.

But he overcame his personal feelings for other things while he was trying to learn about soul magic, so it didn't make sense for him to keep ignoring Xvim, so I was really glad to see this confrontation/revelation finally happen. I suppose that's part of why the story is so rewarding -- I've known it had to happen and kept anticipating it; even now, I've only gotten half the reward (the reveal) and am on the edge of my seat waiting for the next chapter (Xvim's reaction and help, hopefully).
