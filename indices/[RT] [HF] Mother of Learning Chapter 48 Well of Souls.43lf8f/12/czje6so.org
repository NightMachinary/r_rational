I absolutely love this chapter! It's my favorite one in a long time, with all of the revelations! I am, however, waiting for a big confrontation at some point with a mage battle.

I can't help but feel that Zorian's in for a big humbling once he exits the time loop and can't plan for every single event any more, haha.
