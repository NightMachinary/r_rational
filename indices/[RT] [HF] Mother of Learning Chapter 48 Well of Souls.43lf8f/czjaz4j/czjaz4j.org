[[#s][Spoilers for Fullmetal Alchemist.]]

--------------

Typos, mistakes, nitpicking:

- All he had to do install → All he had to do *was* install;
- the fact he → the fact *that* he;
- that was the major reasons → that was the major reason+*s*+;
- Six golems - two → Six golems *--* two;
- Not only should keep → Not only should *it* keep;
- It allows you extend → It allows you *to* extend / It allows you extend*ing*;
- a lot expertise → a lot *of* expertise;
- They specialized in making illusions -- both ones made out of real sound and light, as well as simple tricks of the mind. --- “both” and “as well as” don't work well together here, imo;
- but Zorian would also have to actually interpret the information inside the package once he opens it → but Zorian *would* also have to actually interpret the information inside the package once he open*ed* it (v.s. “.. will .. have .. to interpret .. once he opens ..”);
- And yet, Xvim did not triumphantly stop once he'd found something that Zorian was capable of and then told him to practice that until he got it right. --- *in*capable, maybe?
