I just wrote one then for the hell of it. It checks for a new chapter once a second indefinitely and stops when it comes out. It's simple right now but there's no need for complexity when there is a known schedule. I'll turn it on the night before the next chapter comes out.

It was surprisingly easy in the end. 16 lines long, 11 if I remove the variables and set them in the functions, 8 if I get rid of statements reporting when it did and did not post, 7 if I combine some functions.
