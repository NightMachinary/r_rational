I don't think so. Perhaps Zorians soul was trapped up until the time loop restarted and then returned to its "host-body".

Red robe didn't trap souls, he destroyed them (I would think). Big difference. Even if he did trap them he, the container, doesn't reset with the loop whereas this 'battery' certainly would I think.

Simply put, the battery has a state at the start of a loop, with x number of souls trapped in it. Say y souls are in there at the end of the loop. Z= y- x. Z are the people who die during the loop, their souls all are no longer in the battery rather they return to their bodies (really they never left those bodies to begin with).
