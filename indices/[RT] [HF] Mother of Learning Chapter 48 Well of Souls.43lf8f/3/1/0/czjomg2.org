That's the thing, this is another piece of data to how souls interact with timey wimey stuff. This one, however seems to contradict the running theory.

Zorian's current understanding (and I haven't seen good alternative hypotheses) is that at the end of the loop spell reverts all souls and the world one month back in time, except for souls with special markers.

Zorian and Zach have such marker, it instructs the spell to not revert their souls. Aranea could have been tagged by another type of marker that says "EJECT THIS IMMEDIATELY". This would explain how Z's keep their memory and magic skills, how everyone else don't and how aranea got killed.

Another effect would be that non-looper souls are protected from all sorts of damage. When you consider, a month is a not insignificant amount of time, during this time there are bound to be unfortunate people that get their souls in trouble. If they are not protected from this damage, this will affect future restarts. It makes sens that they are. They don't accumulate shaping skills, but they are relieved of any lingering damage.

This does run into a problem when Zorian and Zach have died multiple times during invasion. Their souls then go into the well, and then somehow they are still reverted to unharmed state, while other damage (caused by lich) is not reverted.

Maybe soul well takes significant time to capture a soul and by that time time loop ends. Then it is in question what's the timer. Maybe capture speed is a function of range.
