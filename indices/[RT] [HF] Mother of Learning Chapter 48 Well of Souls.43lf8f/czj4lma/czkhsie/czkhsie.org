To be fair, a lot of people besides me came to the same conclusion about using souls to power it. I was still wrong though, because I expected it might tie into the Iron Beaks. We still don't know how he's manipulating them.

It is interesting to theorize how the soul well interacts with the time loop though. Presumably Zorian's soul has been captured plenty of times, unless there's another function on the soul marker that directly prevents that.

I can't help but think that something is wrong with Zorian's current theories about how the time loop is functioning as well. Turning back time for everyone in the world seems highly inefficient, when the spell only really cares about the three (known) people in the loop. That Red Robe can forcibly exclude certain people from the loop, making them automatically die at the very beginning of it, should be a hint, but it's not quite enough for me to go on. That it was possible for Zorian to be added to the loop is significant support for his idea of how it works.
