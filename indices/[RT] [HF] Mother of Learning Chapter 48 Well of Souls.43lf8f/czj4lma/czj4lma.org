So Cheese_Ninja [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/40dv1f/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_47_politics/cyth4rg][was right]] about souls powering ward scheme.

Also this chapter puts to rest all this silly Sudomir Time Traveler nonsense. Which is nice.

The million soul well could act as a power source of some sort, if souls continue to generate mana. Maybe Sudomir wants to harness this giant battery and become godlike?

Which gives me an idea that the time loop itself could be powered by something similar. Would a billion souls be able to power such a spell? Who knows, but it seems possible.

edit: +On the downside: dying near soul well will kill Zorian forever.+ wait, it can't be true. Zorian died multiple times in Cyoria, which is near soul well. How does this entrapment work with time loop?
