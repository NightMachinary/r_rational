Axe-vim without the initial a?

In practice, that's how it goes with languages that have lots of consecutive consonants. If there's a preceding vowel, you just sort of glom it onto the Xvim to make it pronounceable. Consider:

- "So," Xvim said eventually. (A line from this chapter.)
- Soaks vim said eventually. (A bunch of words that you can probably pronounce, individually.)

Once you've gotten the hang of that, you need to start being able to say "Xvim" at the beginning of a sentence. Just breathe in a bit first, and then say "Xvim" as you're breathing out. (Pretend you're saying "Axe-vim", but that the "A" is very very quiet.)
