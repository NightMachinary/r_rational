It could need significantly less. If it was, say, ten thousand souls, that would be common enough in a magewar filled alternate medieval setting (anytime a decent sized town fell or a battle was fought) that it wouldn't be possible to tell which one fueled an enlichment.

The excess power could be used for other things. That this is what is fuelling the time loop doesn't work in my mind - it's in the loop, and it can't duplicate the souls, so everytime the loop resets, the souls of all those killed in Cyroria go back to the people who have them.

All it has then are those who died near Iasku Manor.

What it could be is the power source needed to summon/awaken the Primordial. THAT seems like a thing that could benefit from massive soul sacrifice.
