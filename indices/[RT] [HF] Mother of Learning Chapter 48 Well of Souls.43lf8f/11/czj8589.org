Why do I feel like Sudomir is creating a Lich's Phylactery or something similar? Qutatch-Ichl was a lich general in a war - he'd have had opportunity to gather that many souls as well.

Is Sudomir his apprentice?

A sacrifical ritual that needs a million souls... sounds about right. Having a million times the normal level of mana respiration also sounds really good. There are so many potential uses for that much power I can't even imagine it.
