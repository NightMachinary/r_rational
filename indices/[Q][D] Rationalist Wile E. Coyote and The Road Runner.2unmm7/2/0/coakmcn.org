I liked it apart from one line: "I have been sent to a world which obeys no scientific laws." While this may just be coyote speaking and not qntm, it does reinforce the idea that scientific laws are mathematical laws.

I strongly disagree. Scientists try to discover how the world works, our world seems to be very very well described by maths. Loony Toons could much more simply be described by humour. The rest of the piece seems to describe this very well (the whole, am a scientist not was, and the very last paragraph) so that one line made me strangely angry.

Again the rest was quite good, I enjoyed it.
