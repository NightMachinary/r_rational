thinking about this a bit more it might be possible to eat the "actual" road runner and let a fake\different one live.

there are 2 ways that i can see that hapenning depending on a condition. am i on camera all of the time?

if yes then all i need to do is get someone else to get another roadrunner for after i "lose" so the "other" roadrunner will live while the real one will be eaten by me(using something similar to what is described in the previous post)

if no then i need to get into an alternate universe, thus i will lose the camera forever(it will follow the clone i switched with in that alternate universe during the mayhem) and i will get to eat the roadrunner. it will just never be shown on screen.

which is what is the actual law of that world, not that the roadrunner cannot be killed, but that on camera it must always appear as though the roadrunner won in a funny way
