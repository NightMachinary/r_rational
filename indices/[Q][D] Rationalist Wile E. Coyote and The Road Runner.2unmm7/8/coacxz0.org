catching or actually eating the road runner, and by eating the question is it ok for the roadrunner to respawn in the end after i "win" or not. if the requirement is for an absolute zero-sum win then i would have to say it is impossible as its essentially a physics rule of that universe.

if the requirement is merely for me to catch it then all i would need to do is look sorry\sad etc and then "catch" the roadrunner in a friendly manner. that kind of thing is plausible.

if i need to specifically eat him but it doesn't "really" need to be him i would engineer some kind of situation where multiple roadrunners will exist(hire a few from a company, where i am expected to return them or other wise suffer a fine\pain), where most are not the real road runner and make some kind of an elaborate plan which is supposed to get me to eat him. which will backfire and cause me to eat one of my own roadrunners , thus for example needing to pay lots of money to the organization i rented it from. which would be funny. and would for a split second allow me to eat the roadrunner, before reality changed to me actually eating something else and the roadrunner being intact.
