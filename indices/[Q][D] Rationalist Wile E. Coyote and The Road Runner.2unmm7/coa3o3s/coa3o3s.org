Under ordinary circumstances Roadrunner WILL win because loony tunes appeals to an audience that wants to see you fail. The best idea I have is to get rid of the audience, draw vulgarities on EVERYTHING, make it so that no one could ever watch this episode, then go with a very simple plan with one point of failure and take out the the road runner.
