  set up a situation in which the Road Runner escaping simply cannot be as funny as the Road Runner being caught.
#+end_quote

Make a trap ringed with elaborate failsafe mechanisms that, when it inevitably fails, leads directly into a trap with bigger and more elaborate failsafe mechanisms, with another even more complicated trap with bigger failsafes after that, which leads into yet another trap - a stick propping up a cardboard box that's clearly labeled "roadrunner trap" with no failsafe mechanisms at all. Commit to looking dejected when THAT's the one that works.
