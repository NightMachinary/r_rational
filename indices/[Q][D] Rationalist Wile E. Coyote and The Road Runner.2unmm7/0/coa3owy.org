/Why/ are you trying to catch the Road Runner? Can you go to the supermarket and buy a roast chicken instead?

If you tell me that my utility function is just to catch the Road Runner, I think I'll start by taking some of my amazing inventions and selling them to Acme, then hiring mercenaries. I will also try to place the Road Runner in morally compromising situations - maybe trolley problems - so as to try to strip It of Its plot immunity. And I shall employ all my wits and perhaps professional comedy writers to set up a situation in which the Road Runner escaping simply cannot be as funny as the Road Runner being caught.
