Depends how smart the God is. Jehovah is telepathic and dislikes any hint of defiance, but It has a very limited focus of attention and probably isn't bothering to read your mind at any given time, and Its architecture is clearly humanlike in other ways. It might be possible to subtly set up a clicker-training-like scenario in which Jehovah was reinforced into behaving in useful ways, pending its outright takeover by a constructed superintelligence.
