[[https://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre the e-book manager]] has a [[https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=259221][fanfic plugin]]. The downloaded books automatically get put into a calibre archive which supports e.g. rating with stars and user-enterable tags (while also auto-populating the tags from the websites it scrapes them from). It also supports checking for updates for fanfic, and works with most common fanfic websites (including Xenforo threads for e.g. spacebattles or sufficientvelocity).

Downloading fics and updating a larger calibre archive with fanficfare is a little slow; I understand it's purposely that way to avoid hammering shoddy fanfic servers too hard.
