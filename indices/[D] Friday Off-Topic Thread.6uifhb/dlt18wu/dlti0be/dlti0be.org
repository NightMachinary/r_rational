Oh, preach it man. I thought the pilot of SAO Abridged as spectacular, but as time went on it became a legitimately great story. Every character gets improved, I actually give a shit about Kirito, people in general are no longer suicidally stupid, and the big reveal is set up across the whole story.

For those who have finished it, some definitely recommended viewing material from Explanation Point -> *[[https://youtu.be/46jzSn9SLlg][Fixing What's Broken]]* and *[[https://youtu.be/flcX6OXh37s][Kirito and Asuna's Beautiful Dysfunction]]*. Some really great stuff.
