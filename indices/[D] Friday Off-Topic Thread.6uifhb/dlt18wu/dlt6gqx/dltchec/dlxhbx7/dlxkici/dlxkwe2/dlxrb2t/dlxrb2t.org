I'd love if they did, but it's really common in abridged series to turn the characters into a flanderization of themselves. SAO Abridged went the extra mile by giving the characters development and consistent personalities in their own right, but much of the comedy was still based people acting dumb, insane, or sadistic. I enjoy that style of comedy and have come to expect it from most web series, I'm just worried I won't find it as funny with HeroAca as SAO.
