For your specific situation, have you ever visited [[/r/exmormon]]? It's the Reddit community for people who escaped the cult, and it is AWESOME! I have no connection to Mormonism and I hang out there sometimes because it's an entire community of loving, supportive, mostly-atheists who have all escaped from their own personal hells. They will listen to your rants about how awful things are in LDS.inc and support them because they all know exactly what's going through your head.

Perhaps most importantly, they can point you in the direction of counselors in your area who can help your specific problems, AND they can arrange public meetups so you can do your "whining" with people who really do understand. Some kind of social network re-established, I know leaving the cult often results in total isolation.

Whatever you do, know that what you feel right now, all of the betrayal by parents and trusted authority figures, all the fucked up things they told you about sex, all the pain and confusion and suffering...all of it is completely normal for people who have gone through what you have and there are tens of thousands of people who know exactly how you feel. And most of those people? They know from experience that things do get much, much better.

Be well.
