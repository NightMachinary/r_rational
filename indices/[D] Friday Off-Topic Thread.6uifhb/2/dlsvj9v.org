/This isn't really an issue at the moment, but I'm posting it here in case it becomes a problem for me in the future and in case there's someone else on the subreddit who might benefit in the meantime./

When I was suicidal, I had an unexpected issue:

Someone else, upon becoming aware of suicidal thoughts, might go, "I should talk to someone, and ask why suicide shouldn't be on the table."

On the other hand, when *I* would recognize that I was considering suicide, I would have that same follow-up thought--but follow /that/ up in turn by pointing out to myself that I very obviously have at least one reason to not kill myself or I wouldn't be talking, I'd be doing; and so either I'm looking for excuses because I don't think those reasons are good enough or I'm just searching for the opportunity to whine at somebody, and fuck /both/ of those possibilities, either one of them is enough to increase my self-contempt past its present point.

So, hilariously, during the period that I was suicidal I was probably more likely to kill myself than if I had been less self-aware.

Anyone have suggestions about dealing with this? The first thing that occurs to me is that, maybe, I need to believe that it's okay to need to vent about stuff that literally makes me want to kill myself, even if I have reasons to not kill myself and even if I know that it's just e.g. a chemical imbalance that's making these things look so bad. I'm really hoping, though, that somebody has a Third Way that doesn't involve what I can't help but mentally label as "whining," however inaccurate that term might actually be in this context.
