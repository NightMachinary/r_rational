  but how useful is [[/r/relationships]]? I've never really checked it out.

I mentioned it because I often lurk and sometimes post there. It's useful because it lets you see other people's problems and how they deal with them, and that gives you perspective on your own.

For me, it's mostly useful as a reality check. I often read fiction and articles about philosophy and stuff, but those are all kind of disconnected from reality; this subreddit lets me see what people actually /do/ in real life.
