  and so either I'm looking for excuses because I don't think those reasons are good enough or I'm just searching for the opportunity to whine at somebody, and fuck both of those possibilities

/Meta level answer:/ If your long complicated trains of thought ("... and therefore I shouldn't seek help") conflict with your basic observations ('Okay, but I really feel like I need help"), you should probably assume that the long complicated reasoning is broken, and you shouldn't suppress the basic observations.

/Meta level minus one answer:/ If you're having suicidal thoughts and high self-contempt, it probably means your brain really shouldn't be trusted. When that happens, the Accepted Rational Procedure is to talk about your feelings (if only as a rubber duck method), seek second opinions and not jump to conclusions.

/Object level answer:/ Killing yourself is really really */extremely-mega-super/* bad. Annoying people by whining at them is (at worse) moderately bad. And if you don't want to bother your friends, there are therapists whose job is more or less "getting whined at", and who would love to accept your money.
