Thoughts on the recent events in Charlotesville anyone? I've been discussing it with people all week and I'm still not tired of talking about it since, you know, it's kind of important.

You guys are some of the smartest people I interact with on a semi-consistent basis so I'd love for us to have some sort of discussion about the situation. Not for any real purpose or goal, just for the sake of intelligent, open discussion. I'll compose my own comment and add it to to this one as a reply soon.
