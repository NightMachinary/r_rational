yep thats why a statement from him denoucing them and calling it out would be cool but he would lose his voters :/

personally i would like it if he had some balls and went with it. I dont think he can get elected a second time and if he will then the democrats are doing something wrong...so why not just go out with a bang and if it will suceed he can actually get some additional support from people.

Edit: also fuck 2 party systems i think they are kinda stupid and promote the "we vs them" mentality that can break a country into a civil war.
