2 party systems are really, really annoying. Something as all encompassing and complex as governments of entire countries shouldn't be reduced to such a binary system. Unfortunately, I think that's just the way political systems naturally lean when they're democratic, assuming there's not any hard rules against such a thing. People kinda naturally are of an "Us vs them" mentality. It's like people that voted for Hillary, not because they're pro-Hillary but because they're anti-Trump. So it's just about which party manages to get most of that sentiment around themselves at any given time. And then it snowballs into what we have now. Like you could put a cardboard cut out and he could still be a decent candidate because so many people are so pigheadedly diehard on how they vote.
