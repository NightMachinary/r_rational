Well, the statements he made were very non committal at first. He only denounced those groups by name after he'd already made two statements where he didn't and got /HUGE/ backlash. Like ridiculously high levels of it. You don't get points for being that late in the game on something that's so clearly wrong and hated nationwide.

As far as people constantly complaining? I mean, dude, I get it's probably annoying to hear all the time but this is their president. This is the guy that controls the fate of the nation (or at least has a big part in controlling it). And he makes bad move after bad move. People are constantly whining because Trump is constantly fucking up. And that's not something you want in your president.

I won't go far as to say that neo-Nazis would never rally if Trump wasn't in office but I will say that Trump has gotten the most endorsements from white surpremacist groups than any president has had in quite a while. And that's very telling.
