ofcourse the nazis here are the main villains for organizing this thing and all but my point is more on the people getting triggered with trumps statement than trully which group was worse. Personally for all i care they both can go fuck themselves for the things they do. Its thanks to nazis that people there were killed and they started it but the shouldnt the man who stole the candies face some accusations aswell although i think the metaphor doesnt hold up that much because its a huge exaggeration.

My main point here is people will do everything to hate trump or his policies. He is a jerk but as i said he is no hitler. Personally i would hope to have a statement from him that clearly disaproves and calls out the alt right and other groupes although it can hard because those still are his voters...
