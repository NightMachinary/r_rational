Similiar situation happens here in Poland as well. Even tho we have multi party system there are only 2 main parties that got the most of votes. The PO and PiS and its annoying how they destroy the country by division of the population. Also when one party gains majority of the voters in hte parliament its a shit show because it tries to delete all the reforms of the previous party...

an example for now is PiS, they gained control of the parliament and cancelled all initiatives that PO made the good and bad alike without any consideration. They also changed the education system for some unknown reason that pissed me off the most (as i am a student). They changed the education system to resemble the previous system used in the times of PRL which admitedly worked well but it was changed by another party after getting out of the paws of the USSR. The thing is i am not mad they are changing it, it needs changing and it wasnt ideal but they are changing such an insignificant thing that i might puke. Its confusing for every parent and child and the system although flawed was already working good. Changing it yet again to it previous version is just a waste of moeny especially so that the change is so fucking stupid but you not only need new program of education of it but teachers may lose jobs and its a general upheaval for no reason.

about the change.

like some 20 or so years ago it was like this

8 years of elementary school

4 years of highschool

and then you can go for uni

then it was changed to 6 years of elementary school

3 years of middle school

3 years of highschool

and then uni

and now its reversed like it was 20 years ago(disclaimer i think its even more than 20 years ago but its just to get the general details)

personally i think its done to smugle money for the relevant people because "when you dont know whats it about, its about money"

also atleast in the multiparty system there are still members of the other parties in parliament that vote for the relevant groups of citizens like the workers party, the agroculture party etc etc

edit: although now a new party is raising in power as the old ones die so its not a clear cut situation. Some laws would need fixing and spreading the general awarness for politics in people but i generally thing that a multiparty system is the way to go
