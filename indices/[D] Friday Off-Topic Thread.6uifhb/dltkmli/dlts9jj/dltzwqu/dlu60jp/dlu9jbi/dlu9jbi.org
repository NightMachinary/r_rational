So. There was one specific, small group of counter protestors that came armed with guns. I don't have exact figures but that small group couldn't have made up more than 5-8% of the counter protestors. And that's a stretch. Whereas, almost everyone within the core groups of the neo nazis brought guns, riot shields, batons, tear gas, etc. The vast majority of the counter protestors started out peacefully; they came to protest what they saw as injustice and malicious racism. The neo nazis claim to have come to simply protest but, again, when you come armed so well and with manuevers that indicate you practiced for a militant confrontation of some sort, it doesn't paint you in the best light. Even if we ignore the fact that one of the nazi supporters ran a car into people.

Also not all of the counter protestors were part of antifa. A lot of them were simply church groups and regular people. Whereas everyone on the other side was a neo-nazi or supported their ideology.

I'm not going to pretend that antifa are saints. But, again, their crimes here aren't on the same level as the nazis. Most of the footage displays nazis inciting violence first, nazis saying they'll "fucking kill these people if we have to" and other, horrendous things. The other side, while pushed to violence in their own right, simply /wasn't as bad/. By a large margin. It's clear to see.

Again, it feels like you're saying something like "Well yea, this guy robbed the cashier at gunpoint. But THIS guy used the opportunity to steal a couple of candy bars. They should both be vilified." Even though you're not using the words equal, you're implying it.
