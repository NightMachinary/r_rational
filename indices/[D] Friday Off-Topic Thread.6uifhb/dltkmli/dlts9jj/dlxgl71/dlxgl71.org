The USA is stuck between being a set of anywhere between 11 and 50 different actual countries bound together by a (largely) common civic religion, and an actual nation-state. This government (actually, its dominant party) offends people because it basically takes /some/ of those 11 nations (two or three of them) and tries to treat /them/ as defining an American /nation-state/, to the exclusion of both the other nations within the country (who get culturally offended) /and/ the civic religion.

You can't be an empire driven a civic religion /and/ an ordinary European-style nation-state.
