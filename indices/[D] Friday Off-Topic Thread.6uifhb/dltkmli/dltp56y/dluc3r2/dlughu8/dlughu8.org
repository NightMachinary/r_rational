Confused about your "disagreement" here. One of the things EY says is "maybe it's time for us to ask: should we take down all the statues? Are they doing us any good?". That isn't "privileging the hypothesis that the statues do no harm" . Maybe there's a reading of your comment that makes sense wrt this but I haven't found it. Maybe you should say in your own words what EY is saying that you disagree with.
