"All the statues" there is referring to, literally, all statues commemorating everyone, I believe, hence the "statues of the future" joke. Which while amusing, confuses the point: people are not supporting Lee's removal because he's not perfect, MLK cheated on his wife and no one is calling for his statues to be removed. Equating them even as a joke is failing to acknowledge the difference. Lee specifically led a war to defend the institution of slavery. It goes beyond "not extraordinarily moral for his time."

My interpretation of his latest position on this is influenced by reading his other posts and comments on Facebook about it: maybe he has since changed his mind.
