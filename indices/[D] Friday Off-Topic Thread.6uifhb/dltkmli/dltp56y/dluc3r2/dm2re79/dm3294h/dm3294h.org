Ahhh. Yes, this makes more sense if society is more or less all on the same page: when we live in such a divisive one and the culture that raised the monument is still successfully pushing its narrative to their children, I think the social effect of the statues reinforces that narrative too strongly to ignore: particularly since we can't actually decorate it with warnings without essentially having the same cultural battle.

Also the lesson is still being taught, and history isn't being ignored: this just removes the opposition's ability to normalize their narrative, /and/ removes the constant psychological harm to African Americans, who are predominantly on the same page about what the statue represents: a reminder that they live in a county/town/state that venerates someone who fought to keep them in chains.

On top of that, it takes up valuable statue real estate which we can otherwise use to venerate better people, like, say, Andrew Wiggin. As long as we're wishing :P
