It's not that I think the statues do no harm, but that I think rather differently about subjects like these, and I tend to see a lot of humor in the 'normal' way of thinking. If there was a statue of Hitler on a street full of Eliezer Yudkowskys, they'd leave up the statue and decorate it with appropriate warnings, not try to tear down the statue. They'd point it out to their children and talk about how easy it was to get people to put up statues of things, and so they should be cautious about being influenced by what other people venerate. Why remove the lesson? Why pretend that the history of people putting up statues was other than it was? If people can't think through the lesson clearly and are so easily swayed by statues, maybe tear them all down to be sure.
