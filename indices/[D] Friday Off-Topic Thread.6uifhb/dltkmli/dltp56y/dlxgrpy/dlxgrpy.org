If there's one thing I really appreciate about [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]], it's that he literally has so many weirdness points to spend he can say exactly what he says and get away with it.

And btw, Eliezer, if you check FBI bias-crime stats, far-right (KKK, neo-Nazi, etc) hate violence is the most common kind. The datasets I've seen include even things like the Earth Liberation Front, but it turns out that left-wing political violence was repressed to all hell in the '80s and hasn't regressed to a higher mean yet.
