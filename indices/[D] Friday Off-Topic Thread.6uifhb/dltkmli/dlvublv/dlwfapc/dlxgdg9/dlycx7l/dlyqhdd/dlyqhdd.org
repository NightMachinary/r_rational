  Suppose further that Trump is the lesser of two evils. The whole 'tax cut' business doesn't sound terribly morally involved, so let's imagine that one is a libertarian who is outraged at the far-reaching power of the executive office. Both candidates will probably try to increase government strength... but Clinton will be significantly more successful at it. Therefore, one votes for Trump. Already the other organs of the federal government have severely restricted the power wielded by the Oval Office, so by this reasoning voting for him was the right option. Does this satisfy you?

It doesn't satisfy me because we all lived through the Bush years, in which taxes were cut, but the size and reach of the state /grew/. If Paul Ryan was running, this reasoning would have made some sense. With anyone but him running, we can firmly expect that the Republicans will run a large surveillance and policing state on deficit spending. They won't cut government, they'll cut /pro-social/ government.
