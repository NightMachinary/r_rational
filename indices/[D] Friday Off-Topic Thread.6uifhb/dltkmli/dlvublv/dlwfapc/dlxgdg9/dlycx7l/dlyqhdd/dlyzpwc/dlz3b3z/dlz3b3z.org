  This isn't about tax cuts, its about the authority of the government.

As much as I really like seeing Congress take back its rightful powers from the imperial Presidency, I don't think [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act][for a second]] that [[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article167065952.html][this political dispute]] [[http://www.npr.org/2017/07/18/537901833/as-cities-raise-minimum-wages-many-states-are-rolling-them-back][is fundamentally /about/]] [[http://kentuckytoday.com/stories/american-civil-liberties-union-standing-against-civil-libertieshow-the-american-civil-liberties,7399][civil liberties or limited government]].

The plural of anecdote is not data, but I seriously do not see any record of Republicans, from their primary and general-election voting base to the elected officials themselves, limiting the authority of government. I see them expanding it in places they want to wield it, while trying to limit it in places where Democrats would wield it. Any of these ideas could /separately/ be taken as having some policy rationale, but /put together/ they show a clear pattern: enforce Republican values, and expand or contract government powers as necessary to do so.
