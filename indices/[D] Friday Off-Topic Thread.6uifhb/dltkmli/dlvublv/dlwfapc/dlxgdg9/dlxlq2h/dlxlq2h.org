On one level, I can agree with his sort of thinking. He has a laser focused set of things he wants from the government and vote towards that. He cuts through all of the bullshit. In theory, that's fine. Like if everyone was that way, the resultant government would be something that accurately addresses people's needs on a macro scale.

In practice however....that won't ever happen and it's dangerous to be so blindly one track minded. Would you vote in Hitler just because he promised to "cut your taxes" or "lowered real estate prices"?
