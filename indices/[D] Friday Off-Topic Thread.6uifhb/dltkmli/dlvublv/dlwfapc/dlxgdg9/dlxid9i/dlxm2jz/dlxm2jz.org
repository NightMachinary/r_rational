  I'm a med student, and it's just so frustrating seeing patients on rotations not able to afford medications they need because of this failure of a country we live in.

One of the reasons I never contemplated working in medicine is that if I had to deal with that shit every day, BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD would ensue in extremely short order, in the middle of the workplace. So much of the suffering people go through seems to me like a needless waste of energy for nothing in return. Entropy is running, we live in a society, an injury to one is usually an injury to all. We have finite energy to spend on /sabotaging ourselves/.

And this guy I know? It's not like he's rich. He works in low-level IT, and spent some time unemployed a few years back. He's also pretty thoroughly into vulgar pulp fantasy-type stuff, and fully admits he likes following leaders who project a strong, charismatic presence.

If I learned to project charisma, pulled a few other Dark Arts tricks, and said the right keywords, I could get this guy to do not quite /anything/ I want, but a whole lot.

A self-interested person with little empathy or caring is /almost/ fine if they're mature and rational about it. Like, Quirrelmort I can /work/ with: just set up the incentives in favor of a functioning society (which they /usually are/), and he'll buy into your social contract. This git almost literally just wants other people to use the Dark Arts on him, and other than that he refuses to work for /his own/ interests if that involves supporting other people's well-being.

  America's problems wouldn't be that hard to fix if enough people actually cared.

I'm constantly amazed at people like Richard Spencer or some [[/r/SlateStarCodex]] users, who claim to want to carry the white race to the stars, but in fact will gladly defund NASA (and by extension, SpaceX) just to make liberals mad and spend the money imprisoning black people. They'd rather have their stupid little zero-sum social fights than increase humanity's command over the cosmos around us.
