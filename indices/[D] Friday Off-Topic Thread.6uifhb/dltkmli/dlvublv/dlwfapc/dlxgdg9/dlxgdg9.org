Nah, once I got a refreshingly honest response. He said he just wanted his tax cuts. That was it. He literally said that he prefers to avoid caring about other people beyond his immediate family and community in any political sort of way. He actually /chooses/ near-total selfishness.

As far as I know the guy, he's not a /sociopath/, he just doesn't give half a damn about others except insofar as they bring about his own happiness.

Just wants his fucking tax cuts.

Well, I hope he's fucking happy now, because I was kinda hoping to actually /not/ live through a world war or an ethnic cleansing, and maybe get the career I've always wanted, but which partly relies on public funding, instead.
