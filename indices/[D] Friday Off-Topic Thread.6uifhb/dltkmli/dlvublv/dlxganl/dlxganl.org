  As a non-white person, it feels like there aren't that many people willing to just condemn racism and racists outright, without false equivalences. Being a minority in any country means that you're never going to be 100% secure and safe, but just a few years ago it seemed like most people in the U.S. would have our backs.

/I KNOW, RIGHT!?/ I would have figured literal Sieg Heiling neo-Nazis would be enough for people to draw some moral lines in the goddamn sand.

But it appears that for many people the core principle of liberal democracy isn't that we draw big red lines around human rights, to be protected at high cost, but instead that we /avoid drawing any red lines/, that we allow literally anything to be re-litigated should the litigant "sound reasonable" or use big words to express their ideas.

  It's not Trump or the GOP or even the neo-Nazis that are the problem in this country, it's the average American citizen.

I swear to fuck it's the goddamn suburbs. No, seriously. I went all the way out to the Burbs this past weekend to attend a friend's LAN party. Three things surprised me: how homogeneously "white" everything was, even compared to white people in cities who have distinct neighborhoods and cultures, how much of a fucking bubble it actually is (their /sub shop/ was a carbon copy of all other suburban sub shops in human history... I don't know how someone accomplished this), and how /ridiculously high/ their standard of living is.

Like, my friend pays less on his condo mortgage than I do in rent, and he gets three floors and a basement with really nice carpeting everywhere, perfect insulation, clean everything, no mold or rotten wood at all, central heating and air. The only downsides are maybe not getting the ISP you want, having to drive everywhere (God that /sucked/), and living in a homogenized bubble that makes your whole life feel utterly interchangeable with all other lives.

Nobody gives this a name of its own. I think average (white?) people basically just think the vast majority of everyone lives like that, and then wonders why anyone's complaining when everything is so nice and easy. I partly don't like actually living the way my friend does, but I also seriously wonder how anyone can feel comfortable isolating oneself so thoroughly from, well, the rest of reality.
