I finished reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister][Red Sister]] and I really enjoyed it. The setting was possibly the best part for me. It's set in a ice world which was colonized by four different "races" of humanity, each with their own magical/physical ability. With the aid of a solar mirror their ancestors were able to create a corridor of suitably temperate weather around the equator. The rest of the world is basically just glaciers that are constantly encroaching on this shrinking corridor. The knowledge that the mirror has been slowly falling out of its orbit and that the death of everyone on the planet is inevitable is widespread.

I've tried the authors other stuff and didn't really like it, but this is on another level. If you're looking for some good fantasy to read, give it a try.
