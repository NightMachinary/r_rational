I felt like a l33t haxx0r when I finally [[http://i.imgur.com/7kuNd86.png][figured out]] how to upscale and concatenate the videos in [[https://www.ffmpeg.org/about.html][ffmpeg]]. (/TIE Fighter/ runs at 640×480 resolution in combat but 320×240 out of combat.)

Most /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/details.html][GURPS]]/ books (including DRM-free PDFs) [[http://www.sjgames.com/ill/archive/August_16_2017/Sales_Special_Offers_On_Warehouse_23_During_Gen_Con][will be available at a 23% discount until Monday]]! You /know/ a roleplaying system is good when its books have [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/biblios.html][extensive bibliographies]]...

The books are very interesting to read, even if you never play a single campaign with them.

If you want some non-[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28589297][memetastic]] kabbalistic magic, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15819028][/The/ *Golem* /and the Jinni/]] is a pretty fun story. I'd give it 4.5 stars (in comparison to /Unsong/'s 2.5).

Speaking of star-based ratings for stories...\\
- 5 stars: Awesome! I probably will read this several times more.\\
- 4 stars: Cool. I may read this again.\\
- 3 stars: Okay. I guess it was better than nothing.\\
- 2 stars: Lackluster. I read a large portion of it, but found it too uninteresting to merit completion---or, alternatively, I read the whole thing but regret wasting my time in doing so.\\
- 1 star: Bad. I couldn't bear to read more than a small portion of this.

- +0.5 stars: This story's disappointing execution or presentation betrayed its interesting ideas, which could have pulled it up to the next tier.
