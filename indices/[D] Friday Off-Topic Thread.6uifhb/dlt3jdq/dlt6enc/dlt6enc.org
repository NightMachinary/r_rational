A combination of factors. One, the Tobias chapter is /really hard to write,/ because ... WTF do you /do/? Two, my work (which is always insane) got a little insaner around 7/5, 7/10, and then they kind of peer pressured me into a forced vacation because they all thought I was going to burn out and I didn't do any writing during that. Three, I have a (non-life-threatening) medical situation I'm dealing with.

I have high hopes of getting an interlude based on the [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]] thread within the next four days, and reasonable hopes of getting Tobias out within the next ten.

BTW it looks like the order for the near future is Tobias, Ax, Marco, Rachel.

*Edit: Also, I might post the formal rationality whitepaper I've been working on, either in next week's off-topic or general rationality or whatever. That, too, has contributed to the hiatus.
