The key thing to remember is that crypto experiences rapid boom/bust cycles. If you are going to do well actively trading, you need to be able to handle both. Everything is rosy in the bull market, but panic will quickly set in when the crash happens.

That's why it is important to really understand the tech behind everything you buy and have the ability to avoid falling into unfounded hype or panic. For many, a passive buy/hold strategy based on the bigger cryptos may be a better option than trying to find the next pumped altcoin.

PS:

If you ever put any substantial sum in crypto, follow good security practices. Minimize funds on exchange at any given time, 2FA for everything, hardware wallets/cold storage, etc.
