Ok, I get what you mean. How do you personally judge when a project is overvalued? I know it's speculative, so I'm not asking for hard data or anything but what sort of markers do you use to make that sort of decision?

Bittrex, at least for smaller amounts within like the 10k range or lower, only charges you commission on trades you do. They take 0.25% of any trade but that's it. Again, at least for accounts with smaller amounts.

So then you don't play coins that have large percentage jumps in the day, as they're inherently more risky. You're playing the long game. I would honestly do the exact same if I was dealing with like 3-4 thousand dollars instead of 200, lol. Like I generally try and sell out if a coin rises to 115-120% or drops to 90% of what I paid for it. It's sensible but slow.
