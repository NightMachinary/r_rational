Wow, that's awesome! You're really doing good there :)

I'm generally just trading willy nilly and following graphs, trying to buy low and sell high. I may invest more down the line but I just don't have the spare capital right now, unfortunately. Currently have my meager investment split between CVC and GEO. Now for some noob questions from me, if you don't mind :)

Have you been using your profit for anything spending wise? Or are you just re-investing it consistently?

  do not ever trade crypto on margin

What exactly does this mean? I know Bittrex takes a 0.25% cut, is that it?

Also what exactly is a core project?
