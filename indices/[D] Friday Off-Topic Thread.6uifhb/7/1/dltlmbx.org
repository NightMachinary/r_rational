I've been active in crypto for about 6 months now, following the field since like 2012 (Back when I was a high-school student without any money). I've got substantially more money than you in there, ~40k at the moment, which is probably about 30% contributions, 70% gains. I use GDAX for ease of use, and Kraken/Etherdelta/Shapeshift for currencies that GDAX doesn't support. Currently very heavy on Ethereum, with an eye to transition more into Monero after Metropolis rolls out in September. My main tip would be to stick with the established projects unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. Plenty of ERC20 tokens and coins without a clear use case (Or, without a reason to be highly valued, I'm looking at you Ripple), have burned people in the past. NEO/GNT/XRP/OMG all got hugely overvalued for a while. More will bubble and burst, but the core projects, with an actual use case, are almost inevitably going to rise. Bitcoin used to be a solid investment, but I'm not so sure anymore. At the end of the day, use your best judgement, invest what you can afford to lose (Completely, to zero. Crypto is better than it was, but still insanely volatile), and for the love of all that is holy, do not ever trade crypto on margin. The fees remain obscene and the swings can easily wipe out even a relatively well capitalized position.
