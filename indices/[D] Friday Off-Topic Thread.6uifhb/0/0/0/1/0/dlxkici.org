It seems so. I only just discovered these guys so it's the first I've heard about it, but they've proven they can be very funny and surprisingly dramatic so I'm looking forward to what they come up with. My only worry is that one of the reasons SAO Abridged worked was by fulfilling the missed opportunities of the original show and gave them a lot of goofy material to parody. The internet had given them a gold mine of material to draw from.

HeroAca, however, is a good show. Even its shortcomings come across as intentional choices on the writer's part to tell the story they wanted to and the characters already have fairly compelling personalities and development. It's not that I'd hate seeing them get reimagined as crazy stupid jerks, I just worry it wouldn't be as funny as the treatment they gave SAO. How much comedy can they squeeze out of parodying a good story?
