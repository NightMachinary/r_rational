Yesterday, I watched the entirety of [[http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU][Sword Art Online Abridged]] (about 2.5 hours covering the first arc of SAO) and I can recommend it as not just a parody of the original show (and MMORPGs in general) or a hilarious dark comedy that stands on its own, but also as a unique and compelling story in its own right where the characters have a surprising amount of depth and development.

I haven't watched the original SAO, nor do I plan to, but I had a really good time with Abridged and my only regret is that there isn't more of it. It starts off as a fairly typical, though very funny, abridged series where the main characters are crazy and everyone else is an idiot, but as it goes on the characters go through some genuinely interesting development and legitimately emotional moments that are subtly foreshadowed.

I'm not entirely sure how I got invested in the snarky asshole Kirito and closet psychopath Asuna, but the fact that I did is a testament to the show's quality. Their developing relationship is somehow both horrifically dysfunctional, unironically charming, and leads to them both growing as people. It's not /amazing/ development, but it happened to unlikable character archetypes I've never seen before in a way that's actually kind of believable.

Even if you don't get invested in the characters, though, it's still a good show. The comedy consistently got a laugh out of me, their editing of the original animation is excellent, the music is awesome, and they filled in the most infamous plot holes of SAO. I think the quality of the reimagining of the characters brings it up to the level of /great/ beyond just /good/, at least by the standards of abridged series, but the comedy is enough by itself.
