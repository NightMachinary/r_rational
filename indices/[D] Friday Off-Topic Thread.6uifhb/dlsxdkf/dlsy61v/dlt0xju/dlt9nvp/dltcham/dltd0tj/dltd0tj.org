Meh. I like alexander wale's definition, "Fiction that encourages you to think about it". I don't really ask for more.

I mean, HP:MoR did annoy me, for the same reason a cop show where the scientist goes "ahah, I've traced the chemicals from the killer's boot to that one factory with 100 certainty" annoy real cops. Not because I want to learn anything, but I kind of feel like I'm being lied to my face.

I don't think fiction can realistically work as a problem-solving tutorial (or at least, I haven't seen it yet). You can learn something from fiction, because it gives you perspective or helps you empathize with people you'd been detached about before (Wildbow's stories do both really well), but I think most of HP:MoR's wisdom is untransmissible.
