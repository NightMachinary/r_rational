  Meh. I like alexander wale's definition, "Fiction that encourages you to think about it". I don't really ask for more.

I guess I want a bit more real-worldiness from "rational" fiction, because I've read a whole lot of fiction that encouraged you to think about pseudo-ideas and pseudo-concepts using pseudo-methods. You get stuff that seems really deep when you're reading it, and then completely fucking fails to hold up under Fridge Logic.

I want to call something "rational" because if I try to think about it in a practical, real-life-y sort of way, it still holds up. I think you can also have rational fiction about stuff the /author/ doesn't even fully understand or deliberately leaves ambiguous, but which is nonetheless rational and real-worldy enough to /have something there/, in which case the Fridge Logic actually ends up being productive thinking about an open question.

/Should/ Superman surrender to Lex Luthor because humanity's world shouldn't be ruled by an alien? Is /Three Worlds Collide/ correct to model a diplomatic negotiation between three species as a contract negotiation between economic actors with three different utility functions -- or would alien minds consider our notion of economic rationality to be [[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world][just another human ideology]]?

(That's usually done with open or ambiguous moral questions in fiction, when it's done well.)
