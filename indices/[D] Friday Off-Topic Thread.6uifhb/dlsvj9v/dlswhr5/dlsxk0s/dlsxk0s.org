  there are therapists whose job is more or less "getting whined at", and who would love to accept your money.

Yeah, this is what I'll be settling on, I guess. It still feels like whining and that still heightens the self-contempt but whatchagonnado? At least the self-contempt isn't suicidally high, so it's easier to take that step (which I figure I ought to do, even though I feel okay right now, because there's a difference between "your problems are solved" and "your problems have temporarily abated" and this is probably not a judgment that I'm capable of making from the inside).

It's so weird to think that "Talk to a therapist" is even an /option/ now, let alone an option that I'm willing to take. For the past few years, trapped in a small mostly-Mormon town as I was, literally every therapist was either part of LDS Family Services (a church-run thing) or endorsed crystal healing and gay conversion therapy.

And the LDS Family Services folks, I've discovered over the past ten years or so, are incompetent and untrustworthy, so I could never feel at ease around them. The closest I've gotten to having any sort of legitimate therapist experience in my entire life, come to think of it, has probably been through Scott Alexander's Ask Box. Being able to sit down with a competent therapist is going to be a pleasantly novel experience.
