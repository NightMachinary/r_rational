  It's about being someone that I can respect? Which just happens to entail living up to higher standards than I expect others to live up to.

Yeah, but there's pride that keeps you from doing bad things and there's pride that keeps you from admitting you need to fix yourself. "Pride, of an odd sort that drove someone down instead of raising them up" to quote Wildbow.

(sorry to kick you while you're down)

I'm discovering this too, so I haven't really figured it out. But the way I see it, part of growing up as a rational guy is to realize that your don't need to win everything the hard way for your victories to be worth something. Like, choosing to do things in the way that puts the most weight on your shoulders just for the sake of pride... I think I've done it, and I was setting myself up to fail. Suck up your pride, and do what works. The big shiny pile of utility doesn't care how hard you worked to get it.
