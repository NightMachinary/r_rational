Thank you.

To clarify, while the Morg has definitely fucked with my head in ways that I'm going to need to take time to untangle, my most fundamental brain weasels have to do with bipolar-II (or something adjacent to it).

I'll shoot a line down on [[/r/exmormon]] just in case, but probably what I'm going to do is at least start with the services provided by my graduate school (since they're free and not run by wackadoos) and go from there. It'll be nice to be able to get a baseline from that, if nothing else, before I begin to look elsewhere.

Thank you, again.
