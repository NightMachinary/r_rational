You should get some redundancy. How much do you value your life? How unchanging are your preferences/reasons? If your answers are anything other than "No value, and completely unchanging" then you should play it safe and develop things so that you will survive one reason changing.

Of course, this doesn't touch the main issue of being suicidal which is that you don't value your life very much. This can help prevent/slow a descent into that mindset, but can't pull you out of it on its own.
