So... I may not be in america

And my observations can be not acurate since i havent researched the subject to a heavy degree but if you want to know my opinion on this...then here you go.

The whole situation conjured out of a stupid argument about a statue. For me its kinda important to remember and admit the history od the country whether it was good or bad. On the other hand is it worth it? The statue obviously needs to be taken care of once in a while snd its just a huge hunk of metal anyways.

Sure the actions of the neo nazis were obviously bad but i am perplexed by how much of a hate boner for trump people can have. He said that violence was comitted on both sides which is true since both antifa and the neo nazis came there to seek a fight even tho only the nazis run over someone with a car the contempt should still be given to both parties for inciting violence. People jumped to conclusions how trump wont call out the racist groups which he later did anyways calling out KKK and the likes.

I would just like to note that i am not a trump supporter nor i am in america so my opinion is of an outsider juat looking at the situation. I generally think that trump is a jerk and kinda unfitbof a president but hailing him the next hitler like some ppl do is a little bit extreme.

Herw you go...just sone opinion from a stranger

And sorry for any mistakes cuz i was writing on mobile.
