You have some decent points. Trump's most certainly not Hitler 2.0. He's not as competent, for one. But, in all seriousness, I don't think he's as intentionally malicious as Hitler was. Unless his persona is a masterful deception on Quirrelmort levels, anyway.

As far as your other points, you're doing two major things here that's misrepresenting things. You're minimizing the issue of the statue and its importance by writing it off as "a stupid argument about a statue". Historical monuments are important to a good majority of people. National pride (which is where the neo-Nazis seem to be pulling their passion from or at least some twisted version of it anyway) is important. Like really important. And the statue being taken down was a symbol of their pride being taken down by people they already felt were "the enemy". Hence their initial protest. On the other side, most non-Nazis were of the opinion that the statue should go down and they were also of the opinion that *being a nazi is bad.* Hence their counter protest. The nazis didn't really make things better when they had a pre-rally march chanting Nazi slogans and carrying torches, a la KKK, the night before. Thus, when the rally time approached, things were already heated and violence was practically assured. Especially considering that the nazis arrived as a militia of sorts, with shields, guns, tear gas and other assorted things. There's obviously more to this than that brief synopsis but I'll leave it there for now.

Secondly, you're drawing a false equivalency. What you're saying is a lot like when people say "Well, yea, it sucks that she was raped. But she shouldn't have been walking down that dark alley in a short skirt at 1 AM!" in response. They're not condoning the rape, not explicitly, but they're shifting the blame onto the victim. And, yes, her decision was obviously unsafe. But by bringing it up in the discussion in that manner, you're almost saying her bad decision to walk down that alley was equivalent to his bad decision to rape her. Which is not the case. The nazis were by and far most responsible. They organized the rally, which is their right. Even if you're saying hateful shit, you have that right as an American. But when you show up in the streets armed to the teeth, when your people exhibit military-esque maneuvers that indicate hours spent practicing (which somewhat proves intent), you've gone too far. I'm not going to pretend that every counter protestor was a saint. Some had guns, some had chemicals, and some probably came looking for a fight. But it's undeniable fact that the core groups of the rally /all/ came armed and ready whereas the vast majority of the counter protestors came armed with nothing more than words.

So when you say both should be denounced, you're making it seem as if their crime is equal. Even if that's not what you /mean/, that's what it seems like when you don't go out of your way to make it clear. And if that is what you mean, that their crime is equal, then I suppose we can't really proceed in their discussion because there's a clear discrepancy here. :P

Overall, I get what you're trying to say. But it's important that you don't oversimplify things, lest you do exactly what Trump wants you to do and equate racist neo-nazis with the people that fight against them.
