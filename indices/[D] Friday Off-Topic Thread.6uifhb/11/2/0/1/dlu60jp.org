I get national pride and i myself am a patriot but it is neither the land nor the money of the state that makes a country but people so my view is obviously biased. Also as i am saying i am looking at it from an outsiders perspecitve and to me the statue doesnt mean much and maybe thats why i am undervalueing its importance.

I kinda dont get your second point about false equivalency.

In terms of comparing the crimes of antifa and the neo nazis that were there. Only one side run over someone with a car but both parties came there (with weapons!) obviously looking for a fight and inciting violence and both should be put in contempt for it. And can we assign the crime of a one person to the whole group ? In some way yes since they were promoting it but i think the person in question should be judged as a unit in a court room.(unless he had some order from the leader of the rally of which i dont know about)

The whole fight and conflict between those 2 parties is a just a game of ping pong. One pushes to other to more extreme things. Both, antifa and the neo nazis are violent groups and both should be put in contempt
