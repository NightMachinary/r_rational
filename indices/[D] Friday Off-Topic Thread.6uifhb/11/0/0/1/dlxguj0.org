  It's not about feels and it's not about virtue signalling. For many it's about a claim on reality: that the continued presence of the statues contributes to continued veneration of what they were built to represent (hint: it wasn't "history"), which contributes to entrenching a culture of bitterness, bigotry, and false history. Not to mention feelings of continued hostility against the black community.

In all politeness, that is exactly what "feels" and "virtue-signaling" mean. Whenever someone says things like "feels and virtue-signaling" to you, what they really mean 90% of the time is, "I am a nihilist about your morality; I believe yours is false and may in fact believe all morality is arbitrary; I refuse to be moved by moral appeals from within your system, or even from you personally."

A great portion of the arguments these days amount to people saying, "I'm blue, you're orange. We have different utility functions, moral realism is false, and therefore moral 'discussion' is only attempted mental subversion."
