Disagree with EY on this one. I feel like a lot of rationalists are privileging the hypothesis that the statues do no harm, and thus do not spend enough (any?) time investigating whether people for taking the statues down (notably including the people of the town/county who elect leaders who vote democratically to do so) might actually have a reason to do so.

It's not about feels and it's not about virtue signalling. For many it's about a claim on reality: that the continued presence of the statues contributes to continued veneration of what they were /built to represent/ (hint: it wasn't "history"), which contributes to entrenching a culture of bitterness, bigotry, and /false/ history. Not to mention feelings of continued hostility against the black community.

Like... Southern states are literally rewriting school history books to whitewash America's past mistakes and misrepresent the ideals and reasons for the Confederacy's secession.

Meanwhile liberals are supporting decisions to remove icons of a divisive and oppressive culture... But /they're/ the ones being accused of trying to erase or rewrite history.

It's nonsense. No one would be having this argument about Germans choosing to remove Nazi iconography from their culture, but we privilege Confederate veneration because somehow a proto-country that fought for slavery is considered not as bad as a regime that fought for genocide and world domination.

I don't mind if people think Hitler was worse than Robert E Lee. I mind if they think the gap between them is so large that Lee somehow gets a pass.

And sure, rename Columbus day too while we're at it. Consistency is not an issue here.
