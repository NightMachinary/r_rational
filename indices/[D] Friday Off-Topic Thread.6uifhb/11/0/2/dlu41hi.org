The "doesn't want to do what he's pressured to do" part seems dead on to me.

The whole incident created a strong "the right did something wrong this time, the right needs to apologize" narrative, with caveats and people remarking that not all on the right are like that (but not too loud or it might be confused with siding with /them/), basically the same "Muslims need to apologize" narrative we have with every Islamist terrorist attack.

Trump, being Trump, is having none of that, and is being the equivalent of the guy who says "But Christians do hate crimes too" after 9/11.
