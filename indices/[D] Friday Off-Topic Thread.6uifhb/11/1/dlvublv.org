Not that I agree with their methods, but it's kind of annoying seeing so many people equating the anti-fascists with the fascists, when the fascists' primary goal is ethnic cleansing and antifa's primary goal is preventing that.

As a non-white person, it feels like there aren't that many people willing to just condemn racism and racists outright, without false equivalences. Being a minority in any country means that you're never going to be 100% secure and safe, but just a few years ago it seemed like most people in the U.S. would have our backs. I genuinely thought a very large percentage Republicans would vote against Trump because his racism was unacceptable, but it turns out that it just wasn't important to them. I'm not black, but it disgusts me that Confederate generals, traitors to this country who fought for slavery, are venerated in public spaces. Those statues could be moved to a museum, but even if they were just destroyed that would be fine. I see a lot of Republicans and Independents taking neutral positions on this and many other issues brought up by this presidency, and I'm frustrated that people are tacitly supporting white supremacy. The idea that the neo-Nazis are a fringe group to be disregarded itself shows that the problem is very real, in that the majority of people in this country aren't willing to recognize the difficulties minorities and the oppressed face in this country. For every one neo-Nazi in this country there are a thousand who are willing to overlook it. Everywhere I see people downplaying issues related to intergenerational poverty, hiring discrimination, police violence, incarceration rates, laws designed specifically to target the poor and homeless, etc. etc. And so many people want to pretend racism doesn't exist anymore, and that BLM is equivalent to the alt-right. It's not Trump or the GOP or even the neo-Nazis that are the problem in this country, it's the average American citizen. I'm reminded of this MLK quote.

  "First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a "more convenient season."

  Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."
