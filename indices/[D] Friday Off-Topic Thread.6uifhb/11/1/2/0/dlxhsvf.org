What a bunch of crap. Antifa are anarchists, not communists. They don't want to replace white people, most of them are white. The fascists do indeed want government control. They want government intervention to protect white people's jobs from the free market and to harass minorities. Wanting people of other races deported is ethnic cleansing. Richard Spencer claims it will be "peaceful" ethnic cleansing. I'm sure they said the same to Native Americans before the Trail of Tears. I'm not saying Republicans are racist or alt-right. I'm saying they're the problem because they tacitly support those things by not giving a single shit about opposing them, oftentimes existing in willful denial that racism exists in the first place, because doing something about it doesn't benefit them. It's not about punishing white people for things that happened in the past. It's about eliminating the racism that occurs right now, today. Many people like you will deny that any racism exists, as if my last name won't keep me from getting job interviews or my skin color won't cause border security agencies to mistreat me despite being a natural citizen. I'm okay with replacing affirmative action with a poverty-based solution, and of course all Democrats support helping poor people of all races, including whites, which both Bernie and Hillary's policies would have done.
