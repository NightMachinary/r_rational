  the fascists' primary goal is ethnic cleansing and antifa's primary goal is preventing that.

I don't think this is true. Antifa's primary goal seems to be ousting Trump, with instituting communism and ethnic cleansing of white people as side goals.

Secondly, the alt-right (I cannot in good conscience call them fascists because they oppose large government and authoritative control) doesn't seem to actually want people of other races "cleansed" so much as put in their place and/or deported.

Thirdly, the vast majority of republicans, including Trump, are not alt-right or racist. The primary cause of contention is affirmative action. Republicans say "Treat everyone the same. Don't have hiring quotas, don't increase college admissions based on race, don't give extra welfare based on race, don't blame people for things other people did even if they're the same race, etc." Democrats say "White people did a bunch of things in the past that have significantly harmed black people and other minorities and it's their responsibility to do whatever needs to be done in order to undo it."

I think a rational person could end up agreeing with either one, but in my opinion, the former is less racist and also more socially optimal. I never kept slaves, I never killed or discriminated against or refused to hire people of other races. Neither did my parents, neither did my grandparents. Maybe one of my ancestors did, I dunno, but I shouldn't be held responsible for the sins of someone who died a hundred years ago against someone else who died a hundred years ago.

Yeah, poverty is an issue, and it has intergenerational effects, but these apply equally to poor people of all races. But are poor black people more deserving of help than poor white people? Making policies to help people in need is a good thing, but all of the laws and policies should ignore race and target the real issues. That's how you achieve equality, not by convincing all of the minorities that all of their problems are white people's fault and pissing off both groups. That's how you get Charlottesville.
