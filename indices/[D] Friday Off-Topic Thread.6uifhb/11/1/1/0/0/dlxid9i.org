Unfortunately, that's not sociopathy, just human nature. A lot of people are very tribalistic. Most of the Republicans I know care about their own family and friends and nothing beyond that. America's individualistic culture makes everything worse. The focus is entirely on personal freedom, yet we live in a society. God forbid people treat each other right and help each other. I'm a med student, and it's just so frustrating seeing patients on rotations not able to afford medications they need because of this failure of a country we live in. America's problems wouldn't be that hard to fix if enough people actually cared.
