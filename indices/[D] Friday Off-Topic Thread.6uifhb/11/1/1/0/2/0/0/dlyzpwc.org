This isn't about tax cuts, its about the authority of the government. Just as an example that's already happened, [[http://bipartisanreport.com/2017/07/25/breaking-congress-stuns-america-votes-to-limit-trump-presidential-powers-details/][congress voted to restrict the president's powers re: lifting sanctions on Russia]]. For a certain kind of person, this is the desired outcome. Trump is too incompetent to flex his muscle without everyone else noticing, and these laws will curtail every White House after this one.
