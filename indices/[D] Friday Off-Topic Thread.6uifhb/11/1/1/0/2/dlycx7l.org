Consider:

Some people think that the two candidates in the election were both fairly sub-optimal, and one of the arguments put forward by the Democrats was that Clinton was the 'lesser of two evils.' This would be a valid reason to vote for her even if you didn't like her.

Suppose further that /Trump/ is the lesser of two evils. The whole 'tax cut' business doesn't sound terribly morally involved, so let's imagine that one is a libertarian who is outraged at the far-reaching power of the executive office. Both candidates will probably try to increase government strength... but Clinton will be significantly more successful at it. Therefore, one votes for Trump. Already the other organs of the federal government have severely restricted the power wielded by the Oval Office, so by this reasoning voting for him was the right option. Does this satisfy you?

So far as mere tax law goes, suppose that your acquaintance wants a job that currently doesn't exist due to burdensome corporate tax laws, or that he cannot afford to start his own business for the same reason.
