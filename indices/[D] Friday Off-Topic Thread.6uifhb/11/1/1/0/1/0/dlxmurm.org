  Like if everyone was that way, the resultant government would be something that accurately addresses people's needs on a macro scale.

Well, it would be something that accurately addresses people's /beliefs about their needs/, which as it turns out are deeply, deeply ideological. In another country, say Germany, the same person (same kind of person, even) would probably be voting for a Christian Democrat who maintains strong liberal institutions, manages the economy well (for Germans), and overall keeps everything running stably and decently.
