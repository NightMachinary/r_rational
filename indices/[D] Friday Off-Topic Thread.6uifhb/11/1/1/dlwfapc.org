This was a powerful comment.

I agree with your sentiment completely. It's infuriating to have people just stick their heads in the sand on certain issues. If you talk to any Trump supporters about any of the bad shit Trump did/does, you'll get a response like this one. A wishy washy response that makes it clear that the person isn't just being blind but actually refusing to get their eyes fixed.
