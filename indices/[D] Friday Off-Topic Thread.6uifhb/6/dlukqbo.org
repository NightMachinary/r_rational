I'm guessing the answer is "no", but while we're asking for recommendations, anyone know a good Gate fanfic where the Empire is... well, remotely smart or threatening?

Not necessarily rational fiction, mind you, just level 1 characters with basic "Maybe we shouldn't charge the enemies who slaughtered 30'000 of us with no losses?" self preservation.
