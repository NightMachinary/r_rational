Paraphrasing EY, "the Dao that can be spoken is not the true Dao" (and yes, everyone knows that's originally actually Daoist, oy). To truly be rational, you have to have some use for the rationality that isn't just /feeling intellectual/. That need can always be satisfied more cheaply by sophisticated bullshit than by simple (but precise and therefore difficult) truths.

Paraphrasing Wittgenstein, who was rather more true to his own saying: "Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent".
