  I think part of the problem is HP:MoR (and probably other fics it inspired) had its main character use these techniques effectively. Its a standard pattern in fiction: first you introduce a problem the audience can understand, then you explain the technique/method/lesson of the day, then you show a character use the technique to solve the problem.

  It's neat and all, but it's super unrealistic and it gives the audience the expectation that, if they too apply these methods, then they can solve their problems too! Kind of like reading a Sherlock Holmes novel and thinking you can become a detective by looking at details too.

Well I think you had an important point about rational fiction. If it's truly rational fiction, the reader should be able to solve the story's problems as well as the characters can, and the problem-solving techniques ought to be ones that really work IRL.

If IRL problems are just innately less tractable than fun little book-puzzles, sure, but the methods ought to be things that really work, in the small if not in the large.
