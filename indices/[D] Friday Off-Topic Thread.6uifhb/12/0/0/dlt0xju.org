  So to sort-of-quote Eliezer Yudkowsky, your strength as a rationalist is your ability to acquire a big shiny pile of utility often and consistently.

I mean, yes, obviously so.

  I feel that (like quite a few articles from the sequences, now that I think about it) this advice is the epistemology equivalent of a pickup artist column. Yes, it comes from experience, yes, it probably helps some people, yes, if you were already doing it it's gratifying to see it explained... but these advice should always be taken as very, very soft rules, not to be taken literally, and not to be cultivated as literal habits.

Ok, but that's not what I said. I said, "to apply ordinary epistemology to extraordinary propositions". Maybe you don't have extraordinary sleuthing skills. Maybe you're not the best-informed person in the room. Maybe you're just not so smart.

But the thing that makes the distinction here - between knowledge, smarts, and rationality - is that very smart, knowledgeable people can get caught-up in trying to treat certain sorts of propositions as /special/, or as somehow /beyond/ mere truth-values. That's when rationality as such becomes important: applying all your mere ordinary know-what and know-how where other people try to pretend you can't or shouldn't.
