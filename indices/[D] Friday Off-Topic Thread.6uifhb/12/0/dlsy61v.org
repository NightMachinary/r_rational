I know I've mentioned it already, but screw the "Your strength as a rationalist ... reality from fiction" thing.

I feel that (like quite a few articles from the sequences, now that I think about it) this advice is the epistemology equivalent of a pickup artist column. Yes, it comes from experience, yes, it probably helps some people, yes, if you were already doing it it's gratifying to see it explained... but these advice should always be taken as very, very soft rules, not to be taken literally, and not to be cultivated as literal habits.

I think part of the problem is HP:MoR (and probably other fics it inspired) had its main character use these techniques effectively. Its a standard pattern in fiction: first you introduce a problem the audience can understand, then you explain the technique/method/lesson of the day, then you show a character use the technique to solve the problem.

It's neat and all, but it's super unrealistic and it gives the audience the expectation that, if they too apply these methods, then they can solve their problems too! Kind of like reading a Sherlock Holmes novel and thinking you can become a detective by looking at details too.

So to sort-of-quote Eliezer Yudkowsky, your strength as a rationalist is your ability to acquire a big shiny pile of utility often and consistently.
