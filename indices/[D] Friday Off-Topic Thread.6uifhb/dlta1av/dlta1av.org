Weekly update on the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=sharing][hopefully rational]] roguelike [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk][immersive sim]] Pokemon Renegade, as well as the associated engine and tools.

--------------

I didn't get the chance to start work this week as I was hoping. The move went smoothly, but internet wasn't installed until Wednesday, and in the meantime there were boxes to unpack.

I did, however, get a chance to try out Prism at the recommendation of [[/u/Tandemmirror]].  I'm only an hour or two into the game, but already so many of the more annoying parts of the game have been sanded down to smoothness.  Some of the tricks and solutions were taken from later games, but not all have been, and while playing I was struck with the distinct feeling that this is what I remember gen 2 being like, even though it's nothing of the sort.

We'll see how I feel about it once I have more than one badge under my belt, but until then I think I can recommend it to any fans of the canon games.  That said, it /is/ really just an iteration of canon's design (so far).  It doesn't deviate too much from the core formula, values are tweaked but not overhauled, and the primary concern seems to have been preserving the feel of the original games.  With a half exception of the last point, this project shares none of these goals.  Still, it's neat to see other designer's approach to the problem of canon.

--------------

Playing Prism did give me a bit of an insight.  [[/u/InfernoVulpix]] is also checking out the game at the same time I am, and he had a great moment during the second rival fight where his team had been swept, all except for a lone Cyndaquil who was itself on its last legs, who used a move learned earlier that fight and evolved as soon as the battle was done.  Vulpix observed that “I could spin this into a dramatic anime episode if I wanted to.”  

We had both just prior discussed the merits of keeping Cyndaquil on our teams (it's not your starter, minor spoilers, sorry), but after this fight Vulpix couldn't possibly throw it out.  It was very much the sort of thing that happens in the anime, the sort of human-monster bond that the canon games claim to emulate but at their core don't encourage.  

I feel like in canon these moments are far too few and far between.  Usually what goes in your team is based entirely off of what you feel like getting--which means in my case that I am almost always defaulting to my hero team of old (Houndoom, Ampharos, Alakazam, Feraligatr, Machamp, Skarmory) instead of trying out new things.  There's no /bond/, no actual simulation of being brothers-in-arms.  Hell, I feel closer to my faceless soldiers in XCOM than I do in Pokemon, and that's not accidental.

I think by having a more unforgiving environment, more lethal situations, and an overall higher difficulty, these sorts of ‘anime moments' are going to be encouraged, not reduced.  In fact, the popularity of the Nuzlocke challenge helps confirm this, I think.  I don't think that people are attracted to a harder difficulty, they're attracted to the stories that emerge from overcoming obstacles and the camaraderie that they feel with their little virtual pets.  This isn't possible to cultivate when you stomp the game with your overleveled starter, restarting at the pokemon center if you somehow impossibly overreach.

Anyway.  Even if the game goes downhill from here, I think I'll have counted the time spent on Prism as well-spent.
