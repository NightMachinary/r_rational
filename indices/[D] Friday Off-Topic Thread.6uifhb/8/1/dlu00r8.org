Have to admit that reveal pissed me off. No way in the nine circles of hell is a ballista going to hit a dragon - yet Chekhov's gun has been placed on the mantelpiece and it's going to go off sooner or later.

Actually stopped watching partly because of that. Has the season stopped doing stupid shit?
