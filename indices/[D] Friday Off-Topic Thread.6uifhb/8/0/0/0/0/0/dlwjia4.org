I think that's what's interesting about it. Dresden never really gets to go all-out building things in the Files. Between books he remakes whatever of his tools were inevitably shredded, maybe comes up with a few neat tricks to pull with things, but he never really gets to create unrestricted. The island? His work with the Colossus? Even his trolling future generations with fake artifacts? These are things you can tell Dresden would love to do in the Files, but can't because his allies and obligations tie him down. The complete lack of arcane threats in the beginning meant he had to do very little to protect Braavos, and he got to spend that time for himself instead.

Interesting character development, interesting dropping of technological knowledge into a world that maybe isn't quite ready for it, and definitely interesting creation of what is definitely going to be an epic legacy remembered for thousands and thousands of years. With some of your usual Dresden antics. All really neat.
