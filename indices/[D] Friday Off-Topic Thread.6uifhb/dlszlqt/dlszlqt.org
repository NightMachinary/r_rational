So I've recently started trading on the cryptocurrency market earlier this week. I use Bittrex, which has a very low barrier of entry, and I've done alright. I invested $200 initially and I'm now at $260.

Does anyone have any advice/ideas on how to most successfully invest? Obviously $200 is a very modest investment but still! If I can turn this into $1000 by the end of September, I'd be very happy :)

I'm accepting any and all tips/suggestions. I'll also answer any questions you guys have about that sort of stuff, though I must emphasize I've only recently gotten into it.
