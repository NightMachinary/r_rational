I generally try not to put too much weight on graphs or patterns, I buy projects I believe in when they drop, and sell them if I think the amount they've risen recently outstrips the value they're currently worth. Something that actually has a working prototype, not just a forked repo and a white paper. I hadn't even heard of GEO, and after reading a little about it, am kinda dubious on it. The geosnapping thing is a cool gimmick, but there's zero reason for anyone to actually use the coin or secure the network, and I suspect it will become worthless over the long (10+ year) term. CVC is a cool project, but I think it's currently overvalued for what they've achieved. If they get some actual B2B partners or drop a bit, I might consider buying some. I keep my profits reinvested, I make enough at my day job and spend so little that I don't have anything to spend it on. My goal is to accumulate enough capital that when I go to grad school, it'll appreciate significantly over that time and give me more options re: not having a full time job while I work on other things.

As for the margin point, it's not uncommon for coins to swing more than 20% in a day, which can easily cause a margin call at 3-5x leverage. Getting called can wipe out your entire investment if the swing is bad enough. Additionally, while I'm not familiar with Bittrex's fee structure, that fee is usually per day, which adds up incredibly quickly. You're almost always better off avoiding leverage in the current crypto markets.

Finally, a core project is something like Bitcoin, Ether, Monero, Litecoin, or IOTA. Large market cap, established dev team with some sort of roadmap, working project that's been around for years, and actual use of some sort. Coins like CVC and GEO are more speculative, and comparatively dangerous investments. If you're lucky, they'll make far more, but the majority of them will probably be worthless in a few years.
