Oh man, TIE Fighter. That's like, my dream job: remaking both X-Wing and TIE Fighter for modern machines, VR, multiplayer play, multiplayer campaigns, and everything else that this game just begs to have. I want to be able to have a procedurally generated battle of X capital ships on one side and Y capital ships on the other, while Rebel and Imperial pilots just stream out at each other in stupid large numbers.

It's nice to dream.
