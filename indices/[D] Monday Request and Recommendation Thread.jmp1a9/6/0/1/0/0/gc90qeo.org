Interesting, I like the idea of an anti-memetic game where you have to figure out the cards and where big plays can be draining. My thoughts went the opposite direction more-or-less.

(For example, if Duel Monsters was mega-popular, it would reason that set releases would be far more frequent, and because of that, there'd probably be a lot more legacy support for older archetypes, and the meta would change too often for people to pick up the "best decks". I'd also reason power creep could be stifled due to overwhelming popularity not necessitating incentives for people to pick up more recent sets.)

Goof in Chapter 3, Syrus sets a face-down, targets it with Megaroid City, then chains it (an MST); when a Quick-Play Spell is set, it can't be activated for the rest of the turn (like a Trap). Unless this is an anime rules thing.
