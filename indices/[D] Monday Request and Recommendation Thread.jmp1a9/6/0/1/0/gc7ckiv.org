This was intended to be more of a classically rational, "reconstruct yugioh" plot actually, along the lines of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25209853][my other yugioh project]]. Where the main character with their outside-context knowledge has a massive advantage, but there are still fundamental reasons for why the Yugioh world is structured why it is, outside of just "people are bad at card games." I was planning to start at a given banlist and then move forward with new cards from there, with real life cards and rules but anime lifepoints/summoning in faceup defense to trim down duel length. I actually have two other chapters written including a duel where she shows off her Gravekeeper deck against an Armed Dragon deck that establishes the time period.

Good comment on the potential to make this an "uplift" fic though; I wasn't really considering that as an option, but now I can see how it could fit into a character arc.
