I'm looking for stories (specifically things I can read online for free but other media is fine too) where the protagonist is (or protagonists are) from a modern day setting and then get isekai-style randomly transported into the past. How far into the past isn't particularly important but definitely preindustrial so maybe between 10000 BC and 1600 AD. Magic is \*okay\* but if it's included, it should be rather soft (no gamer-esque 'system' or cyoa-esque stuff please). Specifically, I'm looking for stories...

- ...that portray the historical era and culture realistically (research backed or strong worldbuilding)
- ...where the protagonist's primary tool is their intelligence, not magic or whatever
- ...that portrays the problems the protagonist faces realistically (eg. learning a whole new language and interacting with an almost alien culture)
