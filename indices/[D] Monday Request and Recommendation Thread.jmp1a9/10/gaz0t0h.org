Any recommendations for a story that's actually good, and focuses on a character using some form of comparative advantage to become uniquely powerful? Examples of such an advantage may include but are not limited to: future knowledge, genre savvinness, first mover advantage, a special/unique/lucky insight that snowballs, etcetera etcetera.
