I apparently read the first book, but don't remember any of this worldbuilding you spoke of. Is it something that gets elaborated on in the second and third books ?

I remember the birth control, the fallen empire being hinted at, and the MC being a big OP black dude with green eyes and suffering some racism of the sort that gets you killed for being obviously better than average when your kind is supposed to be inferior (which case in point almost happens several times in book 1).
