In the world of the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192725-masters-mages][Masters and Mages]] trilogy the popularization of simple magic--allowing one to clean water, start a fire, and birth control for women--greatly changed the course of society in a byzantine empire analogue, and inevitably spread throughout the world. The story is set 1000 years after this seminal and celebrated event, which features prominently in the plot.

In [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime]] every person holds a morsel of 'tael' in their brains. Gathering enough tael would allow one to 'level up' their magic, whether it be alchemy, martial skills, or wizardry. The magic system follows a kind modified DnD 1.5e rules, which allows you to see the 'moral alignment' of every person and also for clerics(exclusively people in the highest alignment) to resurrect people from the dead. These things all feature prominently in the plot.

The [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/291662-lightbringer][Lightbringer Series]] features a world where magic practitioners have a limited amount of magic they can do, and then they must be put down or risk insanity.
