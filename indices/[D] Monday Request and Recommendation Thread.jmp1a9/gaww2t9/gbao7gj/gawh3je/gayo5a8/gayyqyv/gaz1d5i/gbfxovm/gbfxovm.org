[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Unreason][The Age of Unreason]] is a series of alternate history novels which diverge from our world from the premise that when Isaac Newton started studying alchemy and such he was still 100% on the money about how the world works. So you have an 18th century history involving among others Louis XIV and a young Benjamin Franklin which becomes heavily shaped by the ability to summon spirits and weaponizing alchemical affinities and such. I found them a lot of fun.
