Meh, happens. If you do an edit at any point, it doesn't change anything. Syrus Giant Trunades after, which clears the backrow anyway (...silly he'd not just Giant Trunade straightaway, in that case, since that'd avoid Megaroid City getting popped by ST). You could have Nick comment on it being risky taking a -1 and getting rid of ST removal when opponents have backrow rather than it being a 2-2.

There's also a writing goof when Syrus explains Mixerroid "allowing me to tribute summon a" rather than "allowing me to tribute a".

Looking forward to seeing more! I like the way you've explained the setting, works to give a problem for the main character to struggle through rather than blindly toasting any players that come his way. I'd like to see more rationale on why they stick with Blackwings despite Synchro Summoning being damaging, since surely they could switch to a no Extra Deck/Fusion-only archetype?
