Call me a dumbass, but the search functionality on QQ isn't very obvious to me.

When browsing a specific forum, I can sort by views or replies. When doing a search, I can specify a word minimum. I don't see anything related to likes.

I've read the rules and FAQ but don't see obvious help related to searching.
