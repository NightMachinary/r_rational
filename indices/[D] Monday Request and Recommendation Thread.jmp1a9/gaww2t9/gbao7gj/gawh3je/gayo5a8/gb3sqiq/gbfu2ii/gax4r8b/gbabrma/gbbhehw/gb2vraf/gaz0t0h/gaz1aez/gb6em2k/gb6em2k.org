Pretty much every xianxia story with a reborn MC has this, or some other reason for the MC to go from weakest to strongest relatively quickly. They still need to cultivate and train but most xianxia with weak to strong plot has this. But as usual they tend to be really OP, if you like that it's fine otherwise it gets annoying.

Go to novel updates find a story with Weak to Strong tag, pick the best ones that fit your taste and have some fun. 40th millennium of cultivation for instance, has the generic ancestor mentor comparative advantage but with a twist and done well.
