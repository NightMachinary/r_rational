I also loved Dungeon Engineer. It had decent world-building, and marvelously clever physics at play. The author bowed out because it took too much effort. I can understand why - the mechanics really must have taken a lot of effort to write in a way that was comprehensible and fun to read.

Unfortunately, I haven't come across a good replacement, yet.
