That story is actually complete (killed off the MC), though I'm still considering stories in that vein. As for your mechanics questions, I later made up rules for a quest in the vein of this story that explain why [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K4gvVdo9ZRwxIdWQj1brawup91h7OrvE2G92C3lRUV4/edit?usp=sharing][here]]. Synchros aren't significantly more taxing to summon than fusions; the main character is just kind of week. (Though to be perfectly honest, despite what justifications I might give to the contrary, the MC playing /Blackwings/ specifically is just out of sheer author appeal.)
