Finished reading Mother of Learning and now craving for more. Looking for something that has MoL's strengths while preferably is free of its weaknesses.

What I *liked* about MoL: magic system, MC gradually getting better, world building, gripping plot, interesting mysteries which get explained.

What I *disliked* about MoL: most characters feel like NPCs, which can be described in a single short line (which is kind of understandable given that almost all of them get reset every few weeks, but I still think it could have been done better); battles, in my opinion, have a very detached feel to them -- they are described in such a way that I never felt like I was participating in them, more like reading historic accounts after the fact.

Other than that I have a couple of requirements: no slash for MC and preferably a single main pov with other characters getting interludes here and there.
