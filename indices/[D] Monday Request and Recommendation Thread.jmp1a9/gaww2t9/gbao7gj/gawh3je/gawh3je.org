I don't think I've ever recommended a movie before, but I'd give /[[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/][The Man from Earth]]/ a watch if you have the time. it's very slow, and almost entirely dialog, but a very interesting movie.

A better synopsis (from wiki, a mild spoiler)

The plot focuses on "John Oldman", a departing university professor, who claims to be a Cro-Magnon (or Magdalenian caveman) who has secretly survived for more than 14,000 years. The entire film is set in and around Oldman's house during his farewell party and is composed almost entirely of dialogue. The plot advances through intellectual arguments between Oldman and his fellow faculty members.
