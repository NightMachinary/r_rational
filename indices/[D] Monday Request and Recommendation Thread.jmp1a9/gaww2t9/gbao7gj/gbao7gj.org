Any SI/OC munchkin fics? I'm on a binge for stories where someone actually takes practical advantage of their universe/abilities.

With this ring - he cleaned up the oceans then got weirdly possessive of superboy kinda dropped it then felt a little creepy.

12 steps to godhood - was fun at first now its basically a TV show style crisis of the week

Anything by dogbertcarrol - he tends to do the munchkin really well and his rational character based commentary is fantastic. Too bad he can keep a story for more than 20k words.

Perspective is Ki - SI saiyan in the DC vs. Quick access to gravity training. Not sure where its going hopefully somewhere neat?

Tales of blood and steel - illuvar SI. I love illuvar as an author and no one writes fight scenes/ large scale battles better than this guy. However, his plot progression is glacial.

Misc genre savy inserts/cyoa into worm. My general problem with worm verse is that everybody and I mean inserts/OCs/cannon full grabs the idiot ball like its the last life jacket on the titanic. So many promising tinker stories where the mc will jump right into heroing. Just fucking why? Sure you have a conflict driver, but still a few months to quietly build up a tinker base? Prepping for leviathan? All of this. Celestial forge is both enjoyable and infuriating. Mc knows endbringers are a thing and is very aware of the threat simuragh poses. Does he start working on a counter to them? No. No he doesn't.

A few naruto SIs that are enjoyable, but they always start strong and get stuck in the academy for 100k words or get dropped during the wave mission. Why people get hung up on that story ill never know.

Edit: Harry Potter SIs are 99% you were reborn as lord Alexander Dantes black illegitimate child of Bellatrix and lord Dantes. Your family is dead, but your rich and in the same year as Harry squee. Or some variation of Lady Rebecca Shamthana Black and only I can heal Harry's wounds. Just no. Whole loosely defined world and everybody rides the HP train to hogwarts. I've found a few where the MC will travel the world and actually explore tombs, different magical cities/countries, etc.

Anyway I'm starting to rant any suggestion would be great thank you!
