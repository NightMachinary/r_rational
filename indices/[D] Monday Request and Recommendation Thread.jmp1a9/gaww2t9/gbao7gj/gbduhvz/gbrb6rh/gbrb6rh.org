Have to give this one a mild counter rec. It has it's great moments, and all the point above are correct and done nicely, but to the end of the first arc there is ENORMOUS drop in quality, like I was legitimately afraid that author suffered a stroke or something. Resolution to the conflict was dumb, and then characters started to behave like level 0 intelligence ragdolls.
