Haha, this made me think of the Yozakura Family from the eponymous Jump manga. Not the most rational of stories (far from it, in fact, it mostly runs on Rule of Cool/Funny), but the protagonist family is one of the most ridiculously overcompetent ones I can think of in fiction. They're all also pretty loving and caring towards the MC... with /one/ notable exception.
