I think Toby is comparable, rationality-wise, to Verity.

My greater enjoyment of InCryptid is in at least some part due to the fact that I am an absolute sucker for families being kickass /as a family/, which the Prices absolutely are. Toby's family-of-choice is amazing, of course, but her mom is just the absolute worst.

(Not that I would want the Prices as my family. Perish the thought. I do not want pit traps involved in my Hide & Seek.)
