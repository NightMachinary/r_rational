Looking for something with a magic system similar to the sort in Mother of Learning. Something that includes several magic types such as scripting, teleportation, trans-dimensionalism, cloning, mind-magic (if possible).

Not looking for a time loop story +at all+ per se. I primary want something with as diverse a magic system while still maintaining that healthy dose of a traditional high fantasy setting.

Goes without saying, but rational MCs who shun the idiot ball as often as they can manage. I'll accept Munchkinery with open arms so long as it doesn't require everyone else but the exploiter to be stupid or unobservant. I can do without it all together though.

TL;DR

A sturdy, well crafted magic system with a healthy array of magics, and MCs who are adept at several of them or are learning to be adept.

Main focus: Magic system similar to MOL's. Emphasis on the magic system.

Oh and I love Worth the Candle by AW.
