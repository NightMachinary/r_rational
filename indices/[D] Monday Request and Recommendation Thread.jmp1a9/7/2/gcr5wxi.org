Have you tried [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo][/1632/]] by Eric Flint? The premise is that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_space_bats][alien space bats]] transport a mining town from 2000 West Virginia to Germany in the middle of the Thirty Years' War. There is no magic, there is a language barrier, downtimer values are believably alien, and everything is backed up by historical and technological research. It was so realistic that defense analyst Stuart Slade (of /The Salvation War/ fame) [[http://web.archive.org/web/20031120165443/http://homepage.mac.com/msb/163x/faqs/nuclear_warfare_103.html][wrote]]:

  I originally bought 1632 precisely because I was interested in how Eric's thoughts would fit with the studies that I knew had been done. The parallelism was very close indeed. 1632 quickly identified the crucial problem - the need to get population levels up so that there is enough of a workforce to do everything that needs to be done... In many ways, the situation described in 1632 is a lot closer to a post-nuclear attack scenario than the novels that purport to describe such situations directly... 1632 has another lesson for the post-nuclear environment; the critical importance of getting a working society up and running and getting trade links established. The normal run of post-holocaust novels forget that yet it was the thing most people studying the situation spent most time looking at. Mike Stearns got the point straight away - if he presented himself at a think-tank we'd hire him on the spot. I suspect he'd fit in quite well.
