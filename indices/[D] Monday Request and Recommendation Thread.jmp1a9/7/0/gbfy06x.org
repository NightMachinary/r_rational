There's a bit of all this in the anime/manga/LN "Ascendance of a Bookworm", but IMO it isn't /quite/ satisfying, while decently detailed. It's about a modern woman who's reborn as a child peasant in a medieval-like fantasy setting, and her love of literacy drives her to try and create cheap paper and books in an age before printing.
