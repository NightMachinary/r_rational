I wrote an answer to [[/u/GaBeRockKing][u/GaBeRockKing]]'s [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jig6bi/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/#ga8yekd][request]] for dark, realistic ponyfics, but I took so long that the thread has been replaced, so I'm posting it here for more visibility.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/2354/equestria-total-war][/Equestira: Total War/]]

#+begin_quote
  War comes to Equestria: with despair, with starvation, with suffering and with sacrifice. And the ponies must learn how to keep true to their values while surviving not just the rigors of battle, but the desolation of total war.
#+end_quote

This fic is worth reading for three reasons:

1. The first is the way the author seamlessly combines the MLP:FiM setting with Napoleonic weapons and tactics; the battles /make sense/, and you can easily understand how Dash controls the skies by destroying one griffon formation with her lancers and pinning two others in place with the threat of the same, or how Twilight uses her artillery as a means of area denial to prevent the lions from getting reinforcements at a critical moment.

2. The second is the amount of attention paid to supplies and logistics. In lesser works of military fiction, all the focus is on the fighting. In better works, there is some consideration to the strategy that leads to those battles taking place to begin with. But only in the truly best works is there a focus on the food and cloth and munitions and all the other stuff that actually lets an army stay alive, let alone move, let alone fight. And /Equestira: Total War/ is definitely in the latter category. Rarity's full-time job is logistics, and you get to see everything from the importance of a simple blanket in keeping ponies from freezing to death to the ugly realities of foraging.

3. The third is the level of introspection it brings to the whole enterprise of war and what it means to be a solder and an officer. Ponies die because of their leaders' decisions, officers get court-martialed for their actions, disagreements over the proper scope of the war, or if there should even /be/ a war, take place. I would say that it rivals /Starship Troopers/ and /Ender's Game/ as a classic of thoughtful military fiction.

Sadly, the work was never finished. But, fortunately, the author left a series of speeches in [[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/261081468/2223725867][a comment]] on DeviantArt before starting the novel, as something of a teaser. While three of those speeches had already been incorporated into the story by the time it stopped updating, the fourth, which was almost certainly meant to be in the epilogue, wasn't. Although this last speech does not explain everything and leaves many, many open threads, it gives us more or less an idea of ​​how the story was supposed to end and provides us with some closure.

/Vision/

Book 1: [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/87120/siren-song][/Siren Song/]]

#+begin_quote
  Bioshock meets MLP in this psychological thriller, where Celestia's new faithful student, Siren Song, must discover the truth behind the city beneath the waves.

  Beautiful, gifted, and faithful student of the Princess of the Sun, Siren Song has very nearly everything a pony could want. Sometimes though, in the twilight hours, Siren can see the sadness in her mentor's eyes. Once, ponies whisper, the Princess had another student named Twilight Sparkle, but she left Equestria, never to return. The pony who has a perfect life just needs one more thing---to convince Twilight Sparkle to come home so the Princess will smile again. But when Siren arrives in pursuit of Twilight, she soon finds herself trapped in a city of horrors, with only its monstrous denizens for help.
#+end_quote

Book 2: [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/175220/daring-do][/Daring Do/]]

#+begin_quote
  Since arriving in Vision, Siren has done things she never thought she was capable of---all in the name of survival. But now she abandons safety to gallop back into the darkness. Determined to do the right thing in a city gone mad, Siren must face the horrors she once fled from. But all is not as it seems in the vast and dark ocean, and Siren's greatest foe may yet lie within herself.
#+end_quote

A /Bioshock/ crossover, /Vision/ stars the sociopathic and manipulative, but charming and talented Siren Song as the personal student of Princess Celestia. Wanting to find out what happened to her predecessor, Twilight Sparkle, Siren Song follows her trail to a lighthouse in the middle of the ocean, but gets more than she bargained for when her ship is attacked and sunk by mutants the likes of which she has never seen before. Waking up in a deserted harbor, which mysteriously appears to be underwater, Siren Song must now tread very carefully if she intends to escape back to the surface with her life.

Unlike the video game, where the city of Rapture is almost deserted except for the Splicers, Big Daddies, Little Sisters, and a handful of intelligent survivors, Vision is a fully populated and mostly functional city, albeit one that has clearly seen better days. The Elements rule with an iron hoof, "parasites" get hanged, the infrastructure is falling apart, money can buy anything, and, most importantly of all, large sections of the population are addicted to a combination of Poison Joke and Heart's Desire called mantles which give them extra cutie marks on demand. Problem is, they slowly build tolerance to the mantles and require ever larger doses, until eventually they can't get enough and end up as the crazy mutants that sank Siren's ship.

The fic gets a lot of mileage of of exploring the lives and philosophies of the characters in Vision and contrasting them to those of Equestria. Siren's first ally, Green Apple, is a fervent believer in the ideals of Vision even as she is trapped in a cycle of living in poverty and doing dirty jobs for Trixie in exchange for the money she needs to pay for her mantles. Another one, Echo the soldier, is an alcoholic and a whoremonger who patronizes underage prostitutes, but he is good at his job and has his own code of honor, abstains from mantles altogether, and is an invaluable asset to the party. And then there is Siren herself, who after a lifetime of privilege and looking out for number one has to come terms with who she is and whether she is really willing to throw her allies under the bus for the sake of her own interests.

Sadly, this fic is also unfinished; GaPJaxie [[https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/509830/a-major-announcement][decided]] that he would rather write [[https://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml][earthfic]] that lots of people would read than ponyfic which is inherently limited to a niche audience. But he had the decency to post an outline for how the plot was supposed to end, as well as several scenes and fragments that he had already written, so at least we know how the story ends.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/77470/the-lunar-rebellion][/The Lunar Rebellion/]]

#+begin_quote
  It has been more than one hundred years since Celestia banished Nightmare Moon. While Equestria has enjoyed a century of relative peace and prosperity, there are still lingering tensions between the three pony tribes.

  Shadow Kicker, a proud warrior of Pegasopolis, must navigate the treacherous noble court of Canterlot and address the concerns and wounded pride of her own tribe in a desperate effort to prevent matters from coming to open warfare.
#+end_quote

This is part of the Winningverse, a setting focused on a random background pony named Cloud Kicker. In this verse, Cloudy is one of Rainbow Dash's best friends, a member of a military family called the Kicker clan, a deserter who went AWOL from the Royal Guard after graduating from West Hoof (the verse's equivalent of West Point; her dad, who is a high-ranking officer in the Guard, had to pull strings to keep her out of prison), a disappointment to her mother, and a fun-loving nymphomaniac who is always looking for ponies to "bang". The setting is deliberately constructed to be compatible with the show's canon; everything that happens is something that /could/ have happened just offscreen, and events are carefully choreographed around actual scenes from the show.

/The Lunar Rebellion/ is a prequel to the main work of the Winnningverse, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/28239/the-life-and-times-of-a-winning-pony][/The Life and Times of a Winning Pony/]]. Although the Winningverse as a whole is darker than the show, the present era is limited by the need to be consistent with the show. The past era, which is free of such constrains, is even darker and bloodier; /The Lunar Rebellion/ reads like a fairly realistic, low fantasy military fiction novel (think /Game of Thrones/) that just happens to have ponies in it. It deals with Cloud Kicker's legendary ancestor, Shadow Kicker, who led the armies of Equestria during the civil war against the rebel clans of Pegasopolis.

It might be best if you have some familiarity with the verse before reading it, though. Ignoring branching AUs the early stories of the Winningverse are, in order of publication, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/25698/the-incredibly-dense-mind-of-rainbow-dash]["The Incredibly Dense Mind of Rainbow Dash"]], /The Life and Times of a Winning Pony/ (direct sequel to "Dense Mind"), [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/59373/the-incredibly-troubled-mind-of-rainbow-dash]["The Incredibly Troubled Mind of Rainbow Dash"]] (set after chapter 10 of /Winning Pony/), [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/73631/the-incredibly-apologetic-letters-of-rainbow-dash]["The Incredibly Apologetic Letters of Rainbow Dash"]] (prequel to /Winning Pony/), and then /The Lunar Rebellion/ (distant prequel to /Winning Pony/).
