This is a valid point, but I see it as an intentional part of the MC's maturity/mental growth development. He starts off a naive boy without a clue. It's really hard to mentally commit that the next 5 years are going to be erased; the hope of success (and not resetting at exactly the 5 year mark) is a huge driving factor. I expect we'll see more disillusionment and the MC recognizing that he's going to need to commit to 5 years of harsh training without the hope of not resetting.
