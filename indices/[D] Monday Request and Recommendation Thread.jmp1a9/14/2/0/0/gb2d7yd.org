Without anything more specific, I'm going to take a high level view and give you recommendations on what I do to find content.

Find a group that shares your fetishes, and lurk for content. [[/r/transformation][r/transformation]] tags written works, and if you sort by upvotes you'll filter out the trash, for example.

Questionable Questing is a great website to dig through. If you sort by +first post likes+ number of replies, you'll be spared the trash, and if you filter out threads with less than 20k words, you can reasonably expect to find a thread with both plot and lewds.

It's not worth digging through webfiction sites like AO3 or [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], unless you're looking for a particularly niche paring, or lewds based off of a niche fandom.

This is probably the wrong place to ask, imo. Good erotica really focuses on the emotional connection between the characters, and most of what's recommended here doesn't tend to do that. The only lewd stuff I've seen recommended here explore the ramifications of a porn setting, like the Erogamer.
