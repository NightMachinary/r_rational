I'd read more of this. The protagonist has potential for some interesting character reflection and I have a weakness for uplift fics. I could see the protagonist's negativity towards the game be further spurred on by why real life players get sick of the game (poor formats, ratio of good:bad cards in sets).

Interesting choice with Necrovalley. I'm guessing anti-Chaos? Perhaps budget limitations on part of the protagonist, since Gatekeepers were cheap at the time and reasonably decent. Time period would put it around Chaos/Goat era, broaching on post-Goat, though that depends on the ban list.

I'm guessing it'll be rational!SI in an irrational setting? (Given the tone of what's written so far.) Will you be using rules/rulings/cards from the time period, from now, from the anime...?
