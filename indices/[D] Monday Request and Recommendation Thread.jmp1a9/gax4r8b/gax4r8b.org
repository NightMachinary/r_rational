I'm fundamentally unhappy and normally I cope with that by writing HPMOR fanfiction but "HPMOR but every time it's rational it gets faster" turned into an insane clusterfuck in the first three paragraphs and so then I made it "HPMOR but every time it's rational it turns into Bee Movie" and that didn't help actually so now I'm spiraling into rage and fear and don't know what to do with my face, eyes, or nose so anyway send me the embarrassing draft of your first chapter of your fanfiction and i'll give you feedback. :(
