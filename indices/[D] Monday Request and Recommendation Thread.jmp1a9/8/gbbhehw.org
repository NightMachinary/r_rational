Anyone have a good Crafting/Merchant, rags to riches recommendation that just stuck with you?

I recently read CivCeo and while the premise was interesting, the plot just didn't do it for me. It had a neat spin on town management as a sort of Civ based system and tiles producing resources on a map and a similar upgrade schematic. The problem was that it was largely skipped over or used as a plot crutch.
