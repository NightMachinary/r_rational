Yeah, comparing Toby and Verity works, but Verity has the backing of a much more organized and preppy family - Aeslin Mice, interdimensional Grandma, ghostly Aunts etc. That allows for more error tolerance, whereas Toby's (chosen) family is more of the "lets find her and stop the bleeding" reactive variety, which works because Toby is so enormously resilient, but it makes for a less rational tinge in a few ways, I think.
