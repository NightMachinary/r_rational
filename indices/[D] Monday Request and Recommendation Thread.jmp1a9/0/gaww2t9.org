I finished reading my way through Seanan McGuire's InCryptid series and I've gotta say it's definitely the first time I've gotten heroic action-scientist protagonists in urban fantasy. Recommended! Every time they solved a problem with things like "communication skills" and "basic empathy" I un-died a little inside.

Also worth noting that in general, the villains / antagonists of each book have consistent, reasonable plans and coherent implied internal narratives.
