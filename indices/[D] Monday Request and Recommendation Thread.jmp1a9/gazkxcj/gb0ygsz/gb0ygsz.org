These are rational-ish, if not rationalist.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984][To The Stars]], please read the summary on the linked page. Technically a Madoka fanfic, but you can definitely just read a plot synopsis if you don't like anime. If you do like anime, Madoka is great. Not gay under the strictest definition, but LGBTQ+ protagonist.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9233966/chapters/20941043][Programmer at Large]], also read the summary on the page. This story is LGBTQ+, but I can't be more specific without spoilers.

[[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] technically has a major character who is ace, but they're cast into the "ideologically pure" ace mold which I don't love. Not the best representation, or the most rational work.
