A Song for Two Voices, a Valdemar fic where the MC is gay. Rational, but it takes a bit to get there. Not complete, but unlike a lot of fics I know about there is actually an end in sight. Canon knowledge not required, I never read the original. Excellent grammar and spelling, prose is solid. Overall very good.
