Theatrum Alchemicm is pretty good.

Pretty much everything Chibi-Reaper puts out is worth a look, though they have trouble keeping to one idea.

If you liked Devourer of Worlds, by X50413, they've posted Just as Planed, which is a waifu catalog SI. X50413 excels at writing inhuman characters, and continues to do so in Just as Planed, because the first waifu is the Simurgh from Worm.

Stuff by Klassekatze is pretty great, I recommend checking out Transient.

Sauce Quest is a fun take on Naruto from the POV of Sasuke, who's gone a little insane from having everyone he knew murdered by his sibling.

Rounding things off, My life as a Castle Core, is a fun exploration of what a conflict between a lewd games units and a strategy games units would look like.
