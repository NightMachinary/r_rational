I know what you mean, the concept of this genre has a lot of potential, but all the dungeon core stories either suck ass or are incomplete and really early. I get a real thirst for some trap and design munchkinning. I want some real clever designs that just obliterate dungeon delvers in brilliant and efficient ways, but whenever I do find a rare dungeon core story, half the time it turns out they're pacifistic, which really ruins the premise of the genre for me.

In other genres the novels are stuffed with murderhobo MCs, is it wrong to have a single good dungeon core rational murderhobo MC? I'm always on the lookout for more good dungeon core novels too.

I'm a bit divided on this, but one of the better ones I read was the JP WN/LN Lazy Dungeon Master. It's admittedly not rational at all, but it does have an occasional interesting moment. Ignoring it having a lot of really trashy JP themes like slaves and perverts, the story has some really clever moments. There's quite a few dungeon v. dungeon battles, where the masters make their own competition dungeons and try to defeat the opponent's dungeons with a certain amount of points. It has some interesting ideas, like using a bunch of rats, which are really cheap, to rush through the traps, and then defeating the bosses by literally suffocating their throats with the rats. There's some other cool moments that utilizes certain rooms, terrain, traps, and decor in these dungeon competitions.

Again, it's a pretty trashy dungeon core novel, and it's also one of the city-building/pacifist dungeon novels I really despise, but there's occasionally a flash of brilliance. Most likely not worth reading, but I found it to occasionally do something really clever.
