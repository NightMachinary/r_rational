Watched this last night. Liked it but did not love it. For a movie that is all "Sit around talking and exploring ideas" I did not think the ideas were terribly interesting (some were telegraphed way too clumsily and easy to guess). But I suspect a general audience might and an audience 50 years ago would consider it controversial.

A cautious co-rec.
