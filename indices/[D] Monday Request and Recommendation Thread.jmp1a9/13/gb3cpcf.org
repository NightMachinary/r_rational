People here might like [[https://www.mywuxiaworld.com/book/The_Oracle_Paths/][The Oracle Paths]]. It's a sci-fi deconstruction of System Apocalypse LitRPGs set in Earth's early 22nd century. The "system" in this one works through these alien-tech armband devices whose main ability is to show you the steps to take in order to achieve some goal you specify, if it's possible (similar to Path to Victory from Worm).

Unlike in Worm though you can't get free information, just the physical actions you'd need to take to find it out, you don't know all the steps from the start, and you don't automatically perform the steps, instead being guided by a "shadow" performing the actions a little before you. This and the fact that everyone has the same thing limits the havoc this causes quite a bit. I think it's more intended to mimic "Skill" guidance that these stories often have, and there's another component which is like a quest system. (The rewards don't come out of nowhere though, it just tells you what you actually get in real life from doing the "quest.")

The "apocalypse" part is the monsters that start continually spawning as Earth is demolished and reconstructed as part of a much larger world. Standard stuff for this genre.

The main thing I like is that the author has a decent grasp of the biomechanics behind "improving stats," and spends some effort on realism. By which I mean, some thought has been put into "what would actually happen," and things that would realistically be problems aren't just ignored, such as the MC not instantly turning into a grinding machine as soon as he gets the armband. (By "realism" I don't mean "(grim)dark and gritty.")

The writing is kind of weird in that the vocabulary is much better than your Royal Road popcorn but the grammar and style is closer to a translated novel (which is not a good thing; it doesn't seem intentional). Thankfully it's much better quality than most translations though.

Overall, would recommend giving it a try.
