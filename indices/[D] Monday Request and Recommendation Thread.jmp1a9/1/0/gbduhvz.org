It's not a munchkin SI, but I've been finding Somebody That I Used Tahno enjoyable. It's a Legend of Korra SI into Tahno, except the SI has a real character that isn't just being sarcastic and self deprecating with a heart of gold. It starts with some of the more annoying tropes but slowly turns into a genuinely good story later on.

Some things it does well:

- Republic City really feels like a 1920s shithole with incompetent/malicious politicians and a thriving criminal underground.

- The SI's an unreliable narrator, but it's actually done decently? The story starts off with the SI telling his autobiography to Toph, and slowly he starts saying the truth instead of omitting the details. There's a nice development with it too.

- Dialogue is done pretty well for a fanfiction, but not amazing. The author does do a good job of capturing the personalities of the various characters.

- There's a good amount of original plot. Tahno's actions put a big wrench into the original plot, and the new plotline actually feels coherent.
