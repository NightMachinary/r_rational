Zombie Knight Saga. Has some really unique combat. It's basically like hunter x hunter in text form (in terms of power interactions). MC gets unique advantages over the normal power user but everyone else around him is so much more powerful than him that he usually doesn't get his way like he wants to.

Magik Online. The power system is kinda like DnD, with higher level magic being exponentially more powerful. There are some twists which were nice imo, and some that weren't. Recommend checking it out. Story does somewhat lose its way later on, but at least it ends on a definite (if unfinished) note.
