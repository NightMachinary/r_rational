Strongly Seconding Accelerando, and blind buying Neptune's children despite the reservation's it's summaries have given me, because of how strongly I am thirding anything by Sanderson (I have all of it except Rithmasti, evil librarians and the comic books and might re-visit the librarians the first was clever but its a bit young)

To re-iterate Accelerando is the exciting parts of Age of EM tied together with the narrative of one family, and some lobsters.

*Edit: Stross's Laundry files are amazingly fun despite being Mythos stories.
