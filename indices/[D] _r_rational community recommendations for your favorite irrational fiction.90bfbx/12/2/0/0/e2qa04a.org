One of my favourite Xianxia is "upgrade specialist in another world" I like it specifically because the MC is a decent human being who makes decent friends who aren't in it just for renown or gain. The world Isn't packed full with blood thirsty cultivators and tyrannical sects, the MC joins a sect and they /value his talent/, it's shockingly refreshing to see characters with common sense in these stories some times.
