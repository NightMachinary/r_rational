It's far better than any other xianxia I've tried.

That said, now I'm disappointed in all other fics, because I really want a Xianxia/Cultivation fic where the protagonist progresses because of relevations about how magic works, instead of just popping pills or deus ex machinas in the form of macguffins.

Cradle is actually really good because in comparison to those other Xianxia fics, it deconstructs the genre, and is definitely more satisfying.

However, Cradle does not go far enough for me in the whole revelations about magic thing. It is far better than any other xianxia fic I've found, though.
