Some of my favorites are:

Short Stories

--------------

- /Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius/ by JL Borges
- /Division by Zero/ by Ted Chiang
- /Fragments of a Hologram Rose/ by William Gibson

Longer Things, in order of somewhat increasing seriousness

[I went with my fairly irrational tastes]

--------------

- /The Phantom Tollbooth/ by Norton Juster
- /Guards!, Guards!/ by Terry Pratchett
- /Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency/ by Douglas Adams
- The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson
- /Cat's Cradle/ by Kurt Vonnegut
- /Solaris/ by Stanislaw Lem

/Focault's Pendulum/ by Eco which was brought up here as one of the monthly books a while back was also a lot of fun.

Feel free to ask questions about any of these! Also does anyone here have any good horror recommendations? I've really enjoyed most things by Lovecraft (sans the racism and terrible dialog) and /House of Leaves/
