For free, there's also the book version of /White Sands/ and /Aether of Night/ available through the mailing list and The Coppermind Forums respectively!

Also Warbreaker is a good (free) entry point but I think his writing has improved significantly in some of his later books. I don't think I would have liked it as much if I wasn't already fully invested in the Cosmere by the time I got to it. /Mistborn: The Final Empire/, /The Emperor's Soul/, or even diving right into /The Way of Kings/ might be the best hooks to start.
