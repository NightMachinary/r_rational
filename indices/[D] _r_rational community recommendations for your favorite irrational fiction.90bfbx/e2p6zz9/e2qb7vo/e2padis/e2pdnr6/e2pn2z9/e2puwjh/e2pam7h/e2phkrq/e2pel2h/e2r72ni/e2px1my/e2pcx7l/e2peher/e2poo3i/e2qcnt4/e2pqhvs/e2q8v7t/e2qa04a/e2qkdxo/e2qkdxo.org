If you don't mind quest-style works (works that are written with the main character acting as voted on by the readers - kind of a realtime choose-your-own-adventure/roleplay kind of thing), there's [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny]], on Sufficient Velocity. The pacing is kind of weird because of the format, and the main character's time in the sect is very drawn out. It makes it have kind of a "magical boarding school" feel to it, made even stronger by the fact that the main character is very focused on the friendships she makes with her peers and the ways internalizing techniques affects her personality.

I don't have very much to compare it to since I haven't read other Xianxia, but according to people commenting on it in the thread, it stands up very well compared to other stories in the genre. From what I understand, the main character is in some ways very much like a traditional Xianxia protagonist (shes a highly talented commoner who attracts the attention of the powers that be and has very good luck as far as finding loot), but in others very much unlike a traditional protagonist (she makes friends fairly easily and is very dedicated to them; she's next to useless in a straight melee or fistfight; she focuses heavily on intrigue, politics, and often infiltration). So - to the degree I am familiar with either genre - I think the best way to describe it is Xianxia meets boarding school fantasy, both structurally and thematically.
