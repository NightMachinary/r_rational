As a recommendation to both you and anyone reading this, IMO there are much better reincarnation translated novels. some of them are:

Kumo desuga, nanika? (Yeah im a spider, you got a problem?)

Moon lead journey - tsuki ga michibiku

Lazy Dungeon Master

my death flags show no sign of ending

Some similar quality as mushoku:

kyuketski hime

Death March

And tones more but the rest I either forgot or don't recommend.
