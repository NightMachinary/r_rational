I'm not sure how to qualify this, but Jos√© Saramago's "The Gospel according to Jesus Christ" is one of my favourite books ever. It's extremely well written and extremely deep, and a savage tearing down of Christianity's fundamental myth. In a way, however, it might not qualify, because you could as well describe it as a rational rewriting of the gospels. Just one with prose and craft so fucking good it won the author a Nobel Prize.

Another favourite of mine is Umberto Eco's "Baudolino". Though that one too has some "rational" elements - like a certain murder mystery that is solved through applying limited Medieval knowledge - it mostly is a story told by an unreliable narrator containing fantastical elements, so I think it's irrational enough for the purposes of this thread!
