  If you enjoy Jane Austin I think you should give Mansfield Park a shot. In contrast to Persuasion, it's more overt with its criticisms of society and the tension is a lot more palpable.

Well, I really didn't want to keep linking the same author, so I stuck to one book each. On reflection, perhaps I really ought to have listed /A Christmas Carol/ for Dickens...

Regardless, these are sorts of books that make me despise /rational/ fiction. Not because it's bad, just... less developed and refined in comparison. Maybe we'll get there, eventually. The other day I was reading /The Mosquito Coast/ and I was blown away by how dense it was (as in more ideas and clever lines per page than I've come to expect.) In my head I was going "Dear rational fiction writers: please be more like this."
