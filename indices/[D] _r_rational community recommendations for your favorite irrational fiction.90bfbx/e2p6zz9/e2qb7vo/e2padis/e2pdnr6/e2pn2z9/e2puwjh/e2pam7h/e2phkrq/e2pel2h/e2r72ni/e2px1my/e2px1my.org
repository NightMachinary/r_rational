I've been reading through the powder mage series, it's pretty decent throughout, and sometimes quite good.

The setting is medieval fantasy DND, with wizards as the ruling class and backers of the monarchy, but the power imbalance is changing rapidly because of the invention of gunpowder and how it makes it possible for regular people to do stuff like assassinate their settings version of Gandalf , and set off a fantasy French Revolution on the wizards and nobility,
