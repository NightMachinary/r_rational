I'm ~40 chapters in. Everyone is awful in a very particular way: nobody in the story is attempting to model anyone else's thoughts or desires. Nobody has any Emotional Intelligence. If the cast of this story were a couple in a relationship, a couples' counsellor would be telling them that they have communication problems. (And, despite the protagonist being "full of questions", they just completely ignore these particular questions. I've counted exactly one instance so far where the protagonist asked "why" a person they're talking to made a particular decision.)

Does this aspect of the story get better? I'm on the verge of giving up on it otherwise.
