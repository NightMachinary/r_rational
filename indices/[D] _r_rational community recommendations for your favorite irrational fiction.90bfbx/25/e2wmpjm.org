I really love [[https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force][Legacy of the Force]], in spite of presumably having a lion's share of idiot balls. Two caveats, though: i) it's not so comprehensible without knowing at least the broad strokes of 1990s/2000s Star Wars Expanded Universe (although it has been to some degree promoted as a potential jumping-on point) and ii) it is widely hated by fans of the old EU (primarily for characterization which is incosistent with previous series, and, of course, for the idiot balls).

Why do I like it? Well, it's very much how a sequel to Star Wars would look if written by fans of the prequels (and I consider myself to be one), compared to the current movies which are clearly OT nostalgia. Expect a lot of politics, decision making, and a lack of a clear focus on the protagonist (a significant number of minor characters really shine during their brief POV moments). It may not be to the taste of everyone here, but I end by mentioning that last time I read it, I enjoyed it kinda in the same way I enjoyed HPMOR.
