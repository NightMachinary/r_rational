Just recently finished the initial Prince of Nothing trilogy. I feel very weird about it. I feel like if you asked me if I liked them? I'd say "No. The wording was a bit too dense and pretentiously abstract for me. It also suffered from showing too much while telling too little. Very easy to get confused and turned around; especially because the author created this rich, realistic world and setting but very rarely are there expositions or conversations explaining the world. We all know that too much exposition is a bad thing but too little is also bad, especially when you have a rich, diverse world with a huge amount of back story."

And on the other hand, I'm very curious about the continuation and possibly getting the second apocalypse continuations soon so clearly some parts of me got invested enough to enjoy it enough to finish three decent length books and want to read more.
