I loved the first trilogy. I never got into the second because it took him forever to finish it, and, now that it finally was released, from what I understand, the last book is incredibly bad and disappointing, and it just ends without a real resolution. Or maybe the bad guys win. I don't know, I didn't read it, but the reviews were enough to put me off the whole second series.
