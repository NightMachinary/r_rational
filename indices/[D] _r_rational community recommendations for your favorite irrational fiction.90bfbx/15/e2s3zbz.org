The Magicians trilogy by Lev Grossman? Maybe?

I hadn't ever read them, but I've been aware of their existence for a few years, so I recognized the second book when I saw it at a thrift store, and it was only three bucks, so I bought it. Then I went on Amazon and found the first book, used, for less than two bucks (plus shipping, of course). It only just came in the mail a few days ago, and I've only done one reading session with it so I'm only about 70 pages in, and I'm hesitant to recommend something I haven't fully read, but from what I've seen so far it seems to be at least skirting the line of being "rational adjacent;" it's very clearly a deconstruction-type-thing on Harry Potter and Narnia. From the limited amount I've read so far, it seems fun and enjoyable and stuff, and I'm quite sure it'd be my favorite thing if it had existed when I was like 15ish.

And I'm surprised I haven't seen the His Dark Materials trilogy recommended in this thread. Those might literally be my favorite books, if I were forced to rank all of the books I like.
