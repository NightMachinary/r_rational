right now i'm really obsessed with the ongoing webcomic /Gunnerkrigg Court/. The story is about a young girl, Annie, who goes to a school at Gunnerkrigg Court which is a massive science-industrial complex where they sometimes study the supernatural. Across the river from the Court is a giant forest full of mythical creatures. The forest and the Court have a strange, uneasy relationship that Annie gets involved in.

Not rational fic, it mostly has themes about love and friendship and stuff, but it's whimsical and funny, and the plot is engaging and the characters are a lot of fun.
