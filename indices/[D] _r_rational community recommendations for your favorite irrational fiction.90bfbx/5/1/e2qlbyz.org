I just finished Persuasion a couple of days ago and it was surprisingly enjoyable! It's not really my jam most of the time but the prose was really captivating once you get the hang of the page-long sentences.

If you enjoy Jane Austin I think you should give Mansfield Park a shot. In contrast to Persuasion, it's more overt with its criticisms of society and the tension is a lot more palpable.
