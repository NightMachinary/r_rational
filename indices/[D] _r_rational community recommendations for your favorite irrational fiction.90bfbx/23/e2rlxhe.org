Oh man, I've read so many good fantasy books this year.

Red Sister (3/5 stars) and its much better sequel Grey Sister (5/5) by Mark Lawrence. Grey Sister actually starts with a recap, so you could probably skip the first book, although it's still enjoyable on its own.

Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik (4.5/5)

Under Heaven by Guy Gavriel Kay (4.5/5)

Guns of the Dawn (5/5) and Children of time (4.5/5) by Adrian Tchaikovsky. Unrelated but both great works.
