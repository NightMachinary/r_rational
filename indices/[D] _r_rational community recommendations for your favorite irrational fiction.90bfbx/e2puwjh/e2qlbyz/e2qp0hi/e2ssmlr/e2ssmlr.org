You also should consider that here you're comparing absolute literary giants against mostly amateur fan writers. That's a bit of a high bar :). HPMOR might be one of the best fanfics out there, but it's still a fanfic written by a scientist who entertained himself with writing - not a professional master of the pen.

Elsewhere in this thread I mentioned Umberto Eco. As an incredibly erudite connoisseur of the letters, he may not have been as good a writer as some of the names mentioned above, but he was /very/ good, and his novels show off all of his knowledge and smarts. "The name of the rose" is probably his best known in the English speaking world - and yet possibly his lesser work. Perhaps his most "rational" work is "Foucault's Pendulum", an incredibly elaborate (and ponderous! Most people don't have an easy time finishing it) takedown of conspiracy theory mentality, the story of three friends who craft out of thin historical evidence a fictional theory about Templar knights, Freemasons and who knows what else trying to take over the world - and the theory is so good, it gets them in trouble by convincing the crazies a little too much. It's incredibly rife with historical detail, and the amount of consistency and referencing the three protagonists put into their fictional world-building (as they craft their alternative history of the world) is stunning.
