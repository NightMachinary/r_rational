I don't doubt that some of these are of greater quality than Mushoku Tensei, but my love for the series doesn't real come from it's quality, it isn't rational, I love Mushoku for it's message, as long as you strive you can overcome any challenge, and for the time I found it in. I'll give those a shot though, some sound interesting.
