My favourite Irrational fiction likely goes to Mushoku Tensei, a Japanese web novel, it follow the main character, Rudeus Greyrat, as he is reincarnated from a NEET in his 30s to a babe in a fantasy world.

His death was less than peaceful and his life in our world a tad despicable, so he vows that he will live life to the full in this world, putting in the effort where he lazed away in ours.

The story is part fantasy adventure and part slice of life, it has action in it but it is never the point of the story, the main theme of the series is basically that of coming of age as Rudeus grows and gains experience we (as he does) realise that he was never really and adult in our world, and that he still needs to grow in order to be one.

It is a story that holds a special place for me as it got me through some very hard times in highschool, it has remained one of my favourites despite parts of it being machine translated, and it's questionable sexualization of minors.
