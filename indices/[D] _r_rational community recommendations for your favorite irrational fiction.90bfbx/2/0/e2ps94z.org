Man, I have such mixed feelings about the Prince of Nothing series.

I've only read it once several years ago but I remember having real trouble getting through it. The constant namedropping of all the fantasy terms felt clunky and the characters - while somewhat realistically portrayed - weren't likable, at all. It got tiring reading about ruthless scheming all the time.

At the same time, the sheer amount of philosophy in the text was staggering. It was intertwined with the story and the metaphysics so well that you couldn't help asking questions. It had the best magical system of any fiction I've read.

I didn't know there was a followup. Does it have similar problems?
