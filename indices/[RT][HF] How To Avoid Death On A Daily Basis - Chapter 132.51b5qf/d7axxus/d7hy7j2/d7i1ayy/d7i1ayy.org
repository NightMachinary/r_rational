I've been accused of this quite a lot, and I can see why, but just because the character exhibits those things doesn't mean the story condones them or considers them good (although I've been accused of that too).

The protag is a 19 year old modern male full of self-loathing and social issues. If you think he's going to be a enlightened and liberal individual you're certainly reading the wrong story (or not, in your case).

I consider the kinds of stories where only the villains exhibit horrible personal traits to be far more extreme examples of wish-fulfilment. These are all issues the story disseminates on many levels, but to do so those elements have to exist in the world and in a way I consider realistic. Yes, good, likeable people have some dodgy facets to them.

I'll give you an example of what I mean. Early on, Jenny tries to join their group and Colin rejects her. He says that the last thing they need when fighting monsters is another girl in the group.

This raised some accusations and caused some discussion (some in this sub) as it was meant to.

In a later scene, Colin gets the boys in the group to do push ups and none can do more than three.

This scene was cited as an example of my own misogyny. Aha, I'd undermined my own point. Stupidly proved the wrongness of my own argument. As though elves had broken into my PC and snuck in some irony without me knowing.

I wrote it that way deliberately. Girls might die in a fight in 5 seconds, but so would your typical video game obsessed boy. I set it up that way because I find it amusing. That's the joke. Nobody is of help when it comes to fighting trolls and ogres. Your only option: avoid fighting.

This story has had three significant black characters (in a fantasy story and without resorting to tribe of natives nonsense) and easily passes the Bechdel test (and that's in a story told through first person POV of a male).

It's not just the villains who are prejudiced and bigoted, and even those who are often get away unpunished for it. Which isn't very rational, but then it isn't very rational when it happens in our world either.

I don't mind people saying they don't like reading about those issues (rape and anal sex and homosexuality are all brought up) but implying that the story is some misogynistic, racist wish-fulfilment on my part is misleading, I feel.

BTW you may just be saying the main character's outlook is too unpleasant regardless of other aspects, which is fair enough, but that's not how your short statement reads so I wanted to clarify on that specific point.
