I personally did not like this story much. I found it really similar to wuxia.

Sure, it's a deconstruction of many common fantasy tropes. The humour is okay sometimes. But protagonist has severe psychological issues (I'd even call him literally insane), the world at least partially runs on narrativium, and characters use an ability to detect if somebody is telling the truth (you know, not what the speaker believes to be truth, but /truth/ truth) as a lie detector instead of an Oracle it is.
