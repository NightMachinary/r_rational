"encounters something that to him looks kinda like Grand Cosmic Power That Would Let Him Win Everything Everywhere Forever"

This is an example of you assuming how it works. That's how you see it, not how Colin sees it. He has always looked at things in a way different to other people. I understand the frustration if you personally wouldn't do it that way, or think something is so obvious as to be undeniable, but it's always been written as the reader seeing things from Colin's somewhat odd perspective, not Colin doing what most people would do.

"It doesn't matter if world domination is just a side effect, it's still world domination."

Here's an example of creating a 'fact' and then using it as an argument against me. I didn't say his side-effect was world domination. You decided truth telling=world domination when I already stated it doesn't work like that. I get a lot of this kind of straw man argument.

By the way, I'm no trying to have a go at you, I like conversing with my readers (not as rare as you might think, I tend to answer most queries on Reddit and other forums) but I get a lot of people coming at me with very stridently held beliefs about what Colin should or shouldn't do. I mean really strident.

One reviewer on WFG insisted the people arriving in this world would have created electricity and gunpowder (not could have, definitely would have) and gave the story 2/5 stars because of this obvious and massive error. They offered to amend this score once I fixed things. Do they expect me to turn my story from fantasy to steampunk just to please one person? (Answer: Yes).

As for leaving me your review, I'm not sure why you feel the need to tell me that directly. Wouldn't it be better to just stop reading? After 133 chapters I doubt I will suddenly change my writing style.
