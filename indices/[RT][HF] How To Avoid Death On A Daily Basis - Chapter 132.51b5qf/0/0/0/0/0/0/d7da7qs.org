  I had a lot of people assuming how it worked, convincing themselves their assumptions were facts, and then throwing these 'facts' at me as proof of whatever theory they had come up with.

  I intentionally made it confusing (and also left myself enough wiggle room with areas not explained) exactly because it wasn't to be used as an all knowing oracle. If none of the readers understand how it works, how do you expect Colin to? Especially when his first experience of it is breaking it.

You completely misinterpreted my objection. The issue I have with the God (and the zone-of-truth later) is not that I "assumed how it worked". No, the issue is: When protagonist with head full of concepts from modern society, while in new and unusual land of wonders, encounters something that to him looks kinda like Grand Cosmic Power That Would Let Him Win Everything Everywhere Forever, he should not ignore it. He should do at least cursory check, because if it is in fact Grand Cosmic Power, he will win right now. Again, look how it was done in [[#s][HPMOR ch. 17 spoiler]].

This just makes it worse. I treat such "wiggle room" as sloppiness. Also, Colin, unlike the readers, really could at least /try/ to find out more about the truth-finding methods. He didn't even try, that's what bothered me.

  It's also mentioned that the truth telling part isn't what God uses his powers for, it's just a side-effect.

It doesn't matter if world domination is just a side effect, it's still world domination.

Also, I'd like to use this rare possibility to converse with an actual author to leave my review: I personally didn't like the work. The main character, with his insanity, Irresponsible-Captain-Tailor-grade luck and inconsistent stupidity was really unlikable. He is well written, but I really didn't like reading about him. About the only three things I enjoyed out of 131 chapters were unusual rabbits, tsundere princess and ninja Ayanami Rei. It might be that I'm just not an intended audience for your work, but I can't honestly recommend it. Sorry.
