I think a lot of people misunderstood how God (the truth teller) worked. Mainly by rushing to interpret it in the way they found most convenient.

They seemed to assume if you just made any statement he would be able to verify it for you.

As though if I said, the man who killed JFK's name begins with A. B? C? and by a process of elimination work out the identity. It doesn't work like that.

In addition, God doesn't have to answer any question he doesn't feel like.

I had a lot of people assuming how it worked, convincing themselves their assumptions were facts, and then throwing these 'facts' at me as proof of whatever theory they had come up with.

I intentionally made it confusing (and also left myself enough wiggle room with areas not explained) exactly because it wasn't to be used as an all knowing oracle. If none of the readers understand how it works, how do you expect Colin to? Especially when his first experience of it is breaking it.

It's also mentioned that the truth telling part isn't what God uses his powers for, it's just a side-effect.

Anyway, those were my thoughts when writing it. It's not that I'm unaware of the power of an oracle, it's that I tend to only use OP things in a way that isn't helpful or makes things worse.
