  “Your ability, it allows you to tell when someone's lying.”

  “Yes.”

  “Even if they believe what they're saying, you can still tell when their belief is incorrect.”

  “Yes.”

Here character clearly tells that he is able to detect if someone is telling the truth. Yes, the Oracle might be slightly awkward and inconvenient to use, but it is still a fully functioning Oracle, and with an Oracle you can win everything everywhere forever if you manage to ask a correct question. And you can even ask an Oracle to /tell/ you the correct question.

EDIT (clarification): I don't say that I am necessarily correct and this definitely is an Oracle. I am just saying that when you encounter something that looks like an Oracle at first glance, you really should drop everything and /check if what looks like an Oracle is indeed an Oracle/ because if it is, you just won everything everywhere forever. My issue here is that nobody as much as raised a brow when they encountered a potential Oracle. Compare with [[#s][HPMOR chapter 17 spoiler]] Colin, on the other hand, just ignores the truth-telling thing altogether.
