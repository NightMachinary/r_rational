The story is entertaining. It is not, IMO, particularly rational (though Colin is less driven by tropes and stereotypes than most fantasy protagonists), but there are a fair number of creative solutions he comes up with to solve problems.

I have some issues with the characters themselves and have mentioned them before in previous threads here. But in the end I found the story more entertaining than abrasive. I'd recommend it, with the caveat that the humor isn't for everyone, and that it is more a deconstruction of fantasy tropes than an actual rational work.

To the author: I just caught up with the last several chapters. Really enjoyed the end of book 4 and am intrigued by the beginning of book five. Thank you and keep up the good work!
