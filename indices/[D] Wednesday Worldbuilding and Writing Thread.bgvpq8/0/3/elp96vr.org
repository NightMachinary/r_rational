**** Portals
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: portals
     :END:
IMO these are going to have the most cultural impact. There's going to be local-area Farmer's Almanac-equivalents with listings of local known portals, where they go, and when they open. There's probably going to be caravans that wander certain favorable portal-chains, trading in various towns along their path but sticking to a relatively tight schedule. There's going to be /all sorts/ of fairy tales, mostly warning kids not to go into strange portals. When a portal to a large town opens up, there's going to be a bit of a party in local rural communities.

Assuming there's no simple "portus detectus" spell, portal hunting is going to be an incredibly popular sport with everyone from children roaming in the woods to seasoned military professionals in the middle of a war. After all, if you're the only one who knows about a portal you've potentially got a massive economic (or military) advantage over everyone else.

Portals also mean that isolated ecological niches... aren't. The ecology of the world is going to be a lot more uniform, because the most competitive species are inevitably going to wander their way through a portal and spread out into new areas. If portal hunting is hard, this is probably going to be the most common way of finding a portal - I expect the area around a jungle portal in the middle of an evergreen forest would stand out quite a bit.

And all that is ignoring the fact that if portals are uniformly distributed over the surface of the planet, most of them are gonna open up over water.

**** Warp nodes
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: warp-nodes
     :END:
Make the spell cost (or refund) the potential energy difference between where you are and where you're going. Otherwise you're gonna be patching out perpetual motion machines foreeever.

Simplest example: Dig a 100 foot well down from a node. Enchant a metal slug with the effect "after falling 90 feet, warp". Drop the slug down a tube wrapped in fine wire. You've now got all the electricity you could ever want. Use the electricity to pump all the air out of the tube. You've now got a RKKV, assuming you can aim it somewhere besides your own feet.

Anyway, city nodes are going to be super heavily guarded - especially if someone figures out how to take the RKKV from the previous paragraph and bind it to another warp node. I imagine that the vast majority of cities will have a 100 foot diameter plug that they shove in to place when they're not expecting anyone (simplest method would be a massive wicker structure, I think - it just needs to fill space).

I think the ecological impacts of this method would be really interesting, too - if the spell is simple enough that any human can learn it, and it costs zero mana, then you can bet your ass that almost every natural creature will have that spell in their back pocket for emergencies (always remember that [[https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/security_is_a_t.html][there is considerable overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists]]).

This will make the local warp node something like a watering hole. In a natural environment, all sorts of creatures will be passing through it. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if warp nodes out in the unexplored wilderness tend to be home to the biggest badass creature around - all the food it could want, if it's hungry.
