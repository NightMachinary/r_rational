  I imagine that the vast majority of cities will have a 100 foot diameter plug that they shove in to place when they're not expecting anyone (simplest method would be a massive wicker structure, I think - it just needs to fill space).

This is potentially risky if your plug can get set on fire by a saboteur. However, suppose the defenders mound up dirt around the warp node to create a circular hill around a valley. You could then put a bunch of ceramic obstacles on rollers and let them roll into position in an emergency.
