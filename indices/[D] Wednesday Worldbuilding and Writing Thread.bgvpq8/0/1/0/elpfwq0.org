1. The big thing that I'm thinking about is babies, because if you can't transport them (or sufficiently small children) then you have all sorts of problems, and warp nodes become things for adults only. That's not terrible, I guess, but warp nodes are meant to be the short/safe/easy/limited option. So the standard is probably that you can pull along a living creature so long as they're under the weight limit, and so long as there's no non-consent (e.g. you don't have to be willing, but you can stop yourself from being brought along if you're actively fighting it).
2. Direct contact is kind of a fuzzy concept. A shirt is in direct contact, but a backpack is usually only in direct contact with the shirt, so what are the limits on the chain? I think physical connection and a tight range limit, e.g. you couldn't warp a ball that was in mid-air in front of you when the spell completed, and you couldn't warp something that was more than two feet away. Plus whole objects only (no breaking stone by only taking part of it), and no objects which extend past two feet from your body (no using ropes to extend range or something).
3. You just can't warp from within a ley line.
4. If portals, warp nodes, and ley lines are randomly distributed, or at least distributed according to their own internal logic, and are all small/rare enough that they /shouldn't/ naturally overlap. That said, unless they're all secretly part of the same phenomena, they shouldn't really interact. I suppose in the rare case that a ley line goes through a portal ... not sure what would happen, if the answer isn't "nothing".
