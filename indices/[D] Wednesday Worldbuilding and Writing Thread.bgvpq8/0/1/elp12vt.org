Love this! A couple of questions from my inner munchkin:

1. Can living things be taken along by a Warp caster? If so, do they need to be willing to be warped?
2. Does a Warp caster need to be in direct-ish contact with the objects being warped, or can they designate things nearby but out of reach?
3. Can Warp be cast successfully from within a Ley Line? If so, is "nearest distance" measured in the ordinary three-dimensional way, or does the directed path network influence that measurement? (Would a warp node 1 mile "behind" me and slightly "inland" from the ley line be closer than a warp node 2 miles "downstream" and slightly "inland"?)
4. Is there any spatial overlap between warp nodes, potential portal sites, and ley lines?
