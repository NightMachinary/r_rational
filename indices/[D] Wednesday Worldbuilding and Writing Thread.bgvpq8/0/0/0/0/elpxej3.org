For warp distance, let's look at a few different case examples:

- ~10 ft. spacing: Warp nodes have little impact on the setting. You could use them to get around obstacles sometimes. Their only impact in architecture might be to build kind of curvy houses and city walls that specifically exclude or obstruct warp nodes to create meaningful obstacles. Might have one-way travel arrangements, so you could warp out of a house but not in.

- ~100 ft. spacing: Similar to the above, but now on a large building scale. Might use for power generation with 'elevators' to go down, or for setting up a workshop where you can quickly come back to a large stockpile of tools and supplies. Need to obstruct a handful of warp nodes that might let people warp past your city walls.

- ~1,000 ft. spacing: A three-minute walk. Might be handy for a farm. Also feasible for power generation. Multiple warp points within even a small city, so you'll need to obstruct points near your walls.

- ~10,000 ft. spacing: A 30-minute walk. Might want to start getting selective about where you set up a settlement and then build defenses around the warp node without obstructing it.

- ~100,000 ft. spacing: A five-hour walk. Warp nodes are now a big deal and likely represent provincial capitals. You can spend your entire day hunting and foraging near the city and then just warp back. The settlement is likely to be large enough to be able to provide decent medical care. The warp node will need to be defended and will require fortifications to safely hold it. People will likely use warp nodes both to travel to home or to travel to other settlements on a daily basis.

- ~1,000,000 ft. spacing: One week on foot. Warp nodes likely represent national capitals. People probably do not use them much, as you'd be heavily screened coming out of the node and might need to wait in line for an hour or so. The main usage would likely be to receive emergency medical care or to escape imminent death, although it might also see usage in bringing soldiers back to the capital for redeployment on another front.

- ~10,000,000 ft. spacing: 2.5 months on foot. Almost 2,000 miles. As above, but even less usage is likely. Now you can warp from the wild frontier back to the safety of the imperial capital and then die of dysentery before you ever make it home.

- ~100,000,000 ft. spacing: Basically, there's exactly one node in the world. It's now loosely-tied to the feudal societal structure, but the fringes of the world largely consist of people who may not bother learning the warp spell (or don't even know of it) because it would trap them in a place where nobody speaks their language and nobody accepts their currency. Risk of being enslaved or robbed is too high for it to be worthwhile.

Personally, I'd vote for the ~100,000-foot spacing. That sounds like the most interesting setting to live in.
