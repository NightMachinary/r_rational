  Depending on how quick the warp spell is to cast, this could also have a major effect on combat. If it only takes a second, it seems like the only way to defeat someone in combat would be with a surprise attack, fighting in a hex where the warp node is obstructed, or fighting in the node itself.

Good point. I imagine that even 'field' battles might take place in the vicinity of a small town/village built up around a local warp node (economically, they're among the best places to settle since you can go out to gather materials and come back instantly). Of course, if you're an attacker, warping would put you right into the line of fire of the defenders and leave you trapped. With warp nodes, defenders can retreat easily but attackers cannot. This would offer a significant defensive advantage and probably lead to extensive fortification of warp points around the world.

  In fact, perhaps that could lead to hexes where the warp node is naturally obstructed being the equivalent of PVP zones?

That and perhaps fairly lawless. I imagine that locating the node by triangulating it would be fairly easy. Once it has been found, I imagine that a nearby noble would want to seize control of it and expand their empire. Local groups consisting of bandits, anarchists, libertarians, and various outlaws might try to prevent outsiders from unblocking the node since it would allow for consolidation of power. Once nearby nobles are powerful enough, they'd likely overrun the bandits and unblock the node, but until that point the node would probably be a somewhat lawless PVP zone.

  This would also reduce travel times by up to half. If you're travelling between adjacent nodes, you only need to cross the border at which point you're closer to your destination and can warp to it directly.

Good point. This also creates /a lot/ of value for warp nodes on elevated terrain. For example, you could set up a basic powered sawmill with two carts/wagons and a downhill slope from a warp node. Attach two ropes to a pair of carts, coil one rope on a shaft while leaving the other uncoiled but attached to the shaft (with its cart at the bottom of the slope). Connect your saw to the shaft axle. Climb in the cart at the top of the slope, use your weight to bring it down and spin the saw, then warp back up and hop in the other cart to spin the saw some more.

If you don't have naturally elevated terrain, you could always dig pits and use them as 'elevator' shafts with passengers going down to provide power.

Another point to consider is that there will probably be very clear signs to mark the edge between one warp node and the next, at least if you're traveling along roads or paths. After a few years of trial and error, people would quickly lock down exactly where the transition point occurs.

  The warp network seems like it would naturally lead to an entrenched feudal system of fortified warp sites serving as the seat of the local lord, with the hex being a natural set of borders.

Agreed.
