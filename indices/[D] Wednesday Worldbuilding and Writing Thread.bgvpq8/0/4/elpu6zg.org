Warp sites are like airports, except they have existed since forever and air traffic control is irrelevant.

Airports have tarmac, terminals, gates, runways, hangars, customs, security checkpoints, pickups and dropoffs, baggage claims, parking for long term, parking for short term.

What will warp points have? Receiving areas, customs, security? Walls surrounding them to prevent invasion? Perhaps mechanisms to control how many people can use them at a time? Will there be a special word for the hospital at the warp site, or the fee paid when you use one? (Think 'fare' for flights vs 'toll' for drives). A word for the floor you step on when you warp?

I'd use airports to guide my worldbuilding around warp, and highways to guide my worldbuilding around ley-lines.
