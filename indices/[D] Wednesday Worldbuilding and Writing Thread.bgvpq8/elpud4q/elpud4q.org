Writing, not world building:

Can someone please say the words "adequate and published is better than meets-your-high-standards and never sees the light of day" to me? I really need to hear it right now.

(Background: I'm going to start publishing vampire flower language again, three chapters this year I PROMISE, but they will not be the same level of quality as the first three chapters (in my eyes, maybe they'll be same/better to the readers? idk), but I'm super anxious about releasing something that doesn't meet my own high standards and the people I depend on to bring it to my high standards are unavailable)
