There are three primary forms of quickly moving around the world, each with their own costs and benefits. Portals connect two places. Warp allows fast travel to select nodes. Ley lines are like magical rivers. (This is provisionally part of a diegetic MMO world that takes a bunch of MMO tropes and then constructs a world with them, without any actual game interface involved, but it might get repurposed for some other work.)

** Portals
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: portals
   :END:
Once per month, portals open up.

- Each portal is a set of two connecting two static locations.
- Portals stay open for one day.
- Portal opening are unsynced from each other, meaning any given portal has a 1/30 chance of being open on a given day. Because openings are regular, they can be mapped.
- Portals are naturally occurring, and small sites are often built around them.
- Portals are not limited in how much material can go through them, making them handy for caravans or bulk transfer of goods.

** Warp Nodes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: warp-nodes
   :END:
At regular intervals around the world, in a hexagonal and/or circle packing pattern, there are nodes, which are natural teleportation receiving sites.

- Anyone can learn the spell to warp and it costs nothing to cast. Warp will always go to the nearest warp site.
- A person will always warp in safely so long as there's room at the warp site.
- Warp site is approximately 100 feet diameter circle.
- A full warp site will cause the spell to fail.
- Cities are often built around warp sites, if possible. Warp can take up to 100 lbs of extra mass, including clothes, weapons, armor, etc.
- Warp conserves momentum.

** Ley Lines
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ley-lines
   :END:
The world is criss-crossed in ley lines, which can be traveled along with special ley craft.

- Ley craft can enter ley lines, and from there, can travel along the ley lines.
- Each ley line has a directionality to it.
- Ley line connections are such that no ley line is ever a dead end, and every ley line can be reached from any point on the network, though some routes are exceedingly long.
- Ley lines are 100 yards wide in diameter. For a ley craft to enter a ley line, it must be entirely within the diameter of a line.
- Ley lines can split and merge, and a craft can take either branch of a split.
- Because of the directionality, it sometimes takes much longer to go from A to B than B to A.
- Ley craft must be careful when exiting the ley line, as they may not come out on solid ground.
- Ley lines are visible/tangible only with special instrumentation. When ensconced inside a ley line via a ley craft, the real world is only dimly visible.
- Ley craft may collide with one another while in the ley lines.
- In designated, civilized areas, there will usually be landing strips for ley craft, places where they can come out of the ley line and then quickly divert off of it, or roll into place and then quickly enter.

Just like real-world cities are built around resources and transportation, and both historical and modern warfare are heavily dependent upon logistics, these three systems of travel are one of the deciders of geography, commerce, and war. A city which is next to a river, a ley line, a portal, and a warp node will naturally be a place where a city is built, and it will naturally be important because there are a lot of ways of getting to it. Still working out the kinks a little bit, but I think this is a good start.
