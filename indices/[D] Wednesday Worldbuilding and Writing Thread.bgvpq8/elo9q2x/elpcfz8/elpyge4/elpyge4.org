  The attack surface of the warp node is the entire perimeter of the zone. A suicidal individual with a large bomb could destroy the region around the node with ease.

Note that he says it's a 100 ft. diameter circle and you can only carry 100 lb. A 100 lb. gunpowder bomb might be able to blow a hole in a wall which is less than 20 ft. thick, but heavily defended warp nodes with immensely thick walls might still resist that kind of blast. And that's even assuming you can make it to the wall. It's entirely possible that they build the wall in a 300 ft. perimeter from the warp node so that they can have plenty of time to shoot potential attackers. There may also be uneven ground or an internal moat to slow you down further.
