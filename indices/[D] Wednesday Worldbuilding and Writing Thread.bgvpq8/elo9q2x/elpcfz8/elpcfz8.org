Interesting idea

- if ley craft move quickly, and are light enough to be carried by a single human, then you can use ley craft to quickly move between hexes, teleporting out of the ley line (and hopefully to somewhere near the next line)
- warp nodes are going to be crucial to war, especially if warping is fast and easy

  - The boundaries between warp zones will be crucial: if you are on "your" side, you can retreat easily. The nodes will become obvious command points, except...
  - They will be easily ambushed. The attack surface of the warp node is the entire perimeter of the zone. A suicidal individual with a large bomb could destroy the region around the node with ease.
  - In some sense, this interaction would mean that many "high-security" warp nodes will have structures built around them such that they are permanently blocked unless an unlocking signal is sent. An enemy could have a large number of people teleport constantly, accepting failures for the hope that they might get lucky and surprise their enemy at an inopportune time
  - In response to this kind of attack, armed guards would exhibit some presence at warp nodes. Their may be some kind of jail cell erected around the warp node, with cubes small enough to contain any individual who warps in, but only one such individual. You would have to provide identification to be allowed out of the cell. The geometry and specifics of the warp node would determine the geometry of those cells.
  - If the warp nodes are on the surface of the sphere, then they extend up into the air. This has implications for humans warping in from the air, performing orbital strikes if they put themselves in freefall above a warp node, etc.\\
  - It can likewise be used for safety: anyone in a failing aircraft simply needs to get their ground-speed (and vertical speed) low enough and then warp in. Warp-nodes in non-combat situations would likely be padded for this application. A civilian warp-node would likely have a few "modes" it could be placed in, for commerce versus safety. It would not be hard to move a network of fishing line into place in, say, a second - in order to block key regions quickly, selecting for the "extinguish fires" region of the warp node, which has a pool of water situated directly under it
  - The same ideas would apply (to some extent) to ley lines: securing entry/exit points and the such
