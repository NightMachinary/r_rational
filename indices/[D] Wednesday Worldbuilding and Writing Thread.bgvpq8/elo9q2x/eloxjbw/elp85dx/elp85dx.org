The big variables for warp seem to be time to cast, distance between nodes, and cost. I'm still fiddling with those things, but will eventually have to pick some values and be done with it. Distance is especially important, because at a certain point, traveling to another warp hex becomes so onerous that the average person is unlikely to do it. Distance also defines what the natural monopolies on warp nodes will be like, whether they're going to be metropolises or small towns. Warp nodes are /also/ natural points for hospitals (since the spell can act as an ambulance) and natural points for taxation, because you can tax anyone leaving the node.

But yeah, there's a lot to consider.
