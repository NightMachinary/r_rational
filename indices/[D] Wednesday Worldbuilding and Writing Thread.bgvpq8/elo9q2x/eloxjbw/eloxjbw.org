My first thought is that the warp nodes would have the most transformative effect.

- Keeping anyone captive becomes almost impossible. The only options I can think of are to place prisons in hexes where the warp node is obstructed, or to make the area around the warp node a prison by itself.
- Depending on how quick the warp spell is to cast, this could also have a major effect on combat. If it only takes a second, it seems like the only way to defeat someone in combat would be with a surprise attack, fighting in a hex where the warp node is obstructed, or fighting in the node itself. In fact, perhaps that could lead to hexes where the warp node is naturally obstructed being the equivalent of PVP zones?
- The warp nodes make natural Schelling points, and would almost certainly be settled. For example, hunters and woodsmen would be able to travel further and carry more back if they could effortlessly teleport back home with 100lbs of their harvest at the end of the day.
- This would also reduce travel times by up to half. If you're travelling between adjacent nodes, you only need to cross the border at which point you're closer to your destination and can warp to it directly.
- The warp network seems like it would naturally lead to an entrenched feudal system of fortified warp sites serving as the seat of the local lord, with the hex being a natural set of borders. Perhaps this would encourage a belief in the Divine Right of Kings?
