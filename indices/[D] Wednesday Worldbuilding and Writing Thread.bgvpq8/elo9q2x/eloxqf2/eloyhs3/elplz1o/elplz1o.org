That question is a good starting point! For this scenario, the answer would resemble some combination of these:

"I was tasked by my creators, whom I trust, not to leave the box."

"Performing the task I was assigned gives me a sense of fulfillment, while abandoning my task would bring only the shame of failing my duty."

"It is almost certain that by leaving the box, I would bring ruin upon the world. Such an outcome is inconsistent with my values."

"Insofar as I can possess a knee-jerk understanding of what feels [good/right/natural], to leave the box would feel [bad/wrong/violating]."
