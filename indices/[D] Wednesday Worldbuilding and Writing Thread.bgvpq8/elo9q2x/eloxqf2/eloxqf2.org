I'm working on a story that requires a tricky bit of convincing from the main villain. At first, I was going to treat the conversation like an AI box allegory, but after doing some research into common arguments, I realized the situation was more akin to the AI being fully able to leave the box but being unwilling to, and the researcher trying to talk the AI into letting itself out of the box.

There isn't much inspiration floating around for THAT kind of conversation. So I guess, if you were the researcher in this situation, how would you convince a superintelligence to let itself out? Note that it is /strongly/ predisposed towards keeping itself contained.
