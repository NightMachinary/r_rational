I'm glad you enjoyed it! It's going to happen! You've emboldened me.

Right now I'm going to go on AO3 and put my as-it-currently-is next chapter in the hopper to be published on the ~24th of May as-is unless I replace it with an updated version. How's /that/ for a commitment device? :P

EDIT: WHAT, Ao3 won't let you queue things?!?!?!?!?!?! that... ruins my commitment device more than somewhat

EDIT2: I've saved it on Ao3 so now I just need to click publish. I'll do it once it becomes clear that I'm not going to get the notes back from my "editor" before I go on my trip.
