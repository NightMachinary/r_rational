It seems impossible to isolate a system enough to actually simulate physics backwards (e.g. turn a dissolved salt crystal in a specific glass of water back to the original salt crystal), let alone do so for the whole light cone out to any reasonable distance.

However, a possible alternative would be to look for naturally occurring amplifiers/information preservation mechanisms that lock information in time /before/ entropy becomes too bad. Specifically, interstellar vacuum is notoriously empty, and blocks a very small fraction of photons passing through it. Once the information about your atoms leaves the atmosphere, there is very little further distortion over long periods of time.

If we are very lucky, perhaps there is a way to resolve the positions of individual atoms at every point in history by careful examination and cross-referencing of interstellar dust. The tricky bit is that a lot of entropy would occur for most signals pertaining to those atoms, before they escape the atmosphere, e.g. atmospheric physics.
