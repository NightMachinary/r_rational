Fiction ideas:

1. People become immortal when they leave the atmosphere, thanks to the reduction of thermal noise. Astronauts who go on spacewalks can be resurrected, but nobody else.
2. People only become immortal when they venture sufficiently far into deep space away from solar noise. Only some astronauts (who make trips to the far side of the moon, or further) qualify.
3. Gamma ray bursts from nearby supernovae cause everyone at specific moments in history to be resurrectable. Depends whether they are in the correct region to intercept the beam.
4. Beyond some specific number of decades, the necessary math becomes uncomputable, even with galaxies worth of computing power. So there's a time limit for trying to save loved ones, and protagonist has to orchestrate the construction of a huge dyson sphere scale computer / sensor array within that time.
5. The mechanism needed for resurrection carries huge privacy risks. People with dark secrets they don't want to answer for, financial interests dependent on unbroken cryptography, etc. are constantly trying to thwart the project.
