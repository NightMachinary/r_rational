From a normative perspective, all of this is fairly standard stuff, most of which I agree with. From a practical perspective, however, it's often quite difficult to successfully obey the guidelines presented, and attempting to do something halfway can sometimes be worse than doing nothing at all. In particular, I find the first sub-heading ("Recognize and eliminate inconsistencies") to be cause for concern. Quite often, internal inconsistencies are a sign of a deeper disagreement between different parts of /yourself/, and as such investigating them more carefully can lead to valuable self-insights. Much like the Straw Vulcan pitfall of ignoring one's emotions in favor of cold, hard "rationality" (which, I should note, I'm very happy to see this document caution against, even if said warning amounts to little more than a footnote), there's also a stigma against holding inconsistent positions, despite the fact that, as humans, both the former and the latter are virtually unavoidable. Yes, of course you should aspire to be as internally consistent as possible--but when you /aren't/, there's often a reason for it that's worth meditating on. Unless you've already performed such a meditation, I'd caution against following the linked document's advice on eliminating all inconsistencies as quickly as possible. Don't be so eager to [[http://mindingourway.com/youre-allowed-to-be-inconsistent/][bludgeon part of yourself into submission]].
