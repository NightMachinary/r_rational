I rather enjoyed it, it was a pleasant offshoot from the usual, gotta say. I predict the mirror will cause a calamity once Harry's simulation achieves FTL travel. If the mirror doesn't prevent this somehow (It seems like it could easily alter its simulated world's own physics enough to prevent this) then Friendly will have to render out stars as the people of Harry's simulation discovers them. I can only assume that rendering out a star to the point that it's consistent with the real world science HJPEV has brought with him is going to cost a star. So the more stars they discover, the more we lose, until it chains into our universe being left a barren void, with Friendly floating at its center. At which time, further attempts at exploration will trigger a decline in Friendly's powers. What this wil do, I can't say. Considering the Atlanteans designed him so that he pulls from the very /stars/ I doubt they've put in any low-power failsafes inside of it. Although I suppose you never know, that "be friendly" directive may come in handy for that. It's not very friendly to have your inner world suffer through entropy (presumably)
