No Interdict of Merlin in Dumbledore's sort-of-canon CEV means pretty much all bets are off when it comes to the Mirror hewing to reality.

But for what it's worth, I imagined the Mirror as working like a video game's engine, i.e. only rendering things to the level the player can see. Stars can be points of light, or great balls of fire, or gigantic nuclear furnaces, depending on how closely Harry or Hermione is looking at them.
