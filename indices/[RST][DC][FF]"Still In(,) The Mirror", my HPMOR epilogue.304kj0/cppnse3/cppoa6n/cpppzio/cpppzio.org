At first I thought about that, but think about this. As Harry (I assume) gets more involved in science and magic, he's going to be doing things that rely on the stars acting exactly as he believes they will, i.e the massive balls of white hot plasma we know they are. Whether that's physically exploring other galaxies, or merely observing readings from a variety of scientific experiments. And Harry and Hermione are definitely smart enough (especially considering they have immortality) to get to that level. Hence why I feel that's what will happen. Although I suppose the mirror could mind-nudge them away from that path, but considering how core things like colonizing the stars are to Harry, it seems like it would be violating its program to do so.
