It just has to show Harry what he expects to see. In theory, there are ways to make this unfeasible. For example, there are cryptographically secure proof-of-work systems that Harry could use to ensure that vast amounts of calculations are actually being done. The problem is that Harry has to check them by calculating a cryptographic hash in his head. If he programs a computer to check it for him, the Mirror will just make the computer say that it worked.
