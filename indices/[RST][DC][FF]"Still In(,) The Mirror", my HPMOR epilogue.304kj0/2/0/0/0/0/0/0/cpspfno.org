I see what you're saying, but I feel like that doesn't really address my core issue. My issue is that, I feel, Harry, and by proxy anyone he's working with, is going to, eventually, figure out FTL travel (if it's possible at all, which it MAY be, since the mirror can alter its own physics, and Harry REALLY wants it to be possible) When that happens, actual observance of stars at much closer ranges is going to be theoretically possible. And if colonizing galaxies, as an immortal society, you will eventually reach multiple stars. And yes, no one is going to dive into a star, or have probes that can dive into stars, so the mirror won't necessarily need to simulate the star itself. But things like the heat it gives off, and the gravity it gives off, and their interactions on the planets needs to be simulated. So, in essence, you still need at least a majority of the energy within a star, to do this. I know what I'm saying wasn't explained properly (I don't have a big science background, beyond basic college chemistry and physics) but I hope I've clarified what I mean. And I DO suppose it's irrelevant if the mirror can alter every other human's minds at will.
