V? Who's V? If you mean Voldemort, I think it was because Harry mindwiped him to the point where whatever ideologies he hung onto were consistent enough with Harry's, that the Mirror chose to just use Harry's ideals to shape its world. This is helped along by the fact that the Mirror recognizes them as the same person. Plus it's clearly a Machine, so once Voldie was wiped, I think HJPEV was close enough to being Voldie by the Riddle's standards.
