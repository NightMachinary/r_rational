I want to say, I like the humorous, light-hearted tone this is written with that contrasts with the dark subject matter. In particular the Mirror AI - I know it's unrealistic to expect anthropomorphism in an AI, but it was entertaining to read. That said, I don't quite understand what happened in it - I know both HPJV and Quirrelmort got stuck in there and Dumbledore escaped, but not how or why V was allowed to die instead of getting his own shard.
