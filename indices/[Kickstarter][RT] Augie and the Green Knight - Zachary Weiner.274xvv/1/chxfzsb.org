Sounds neat - I'm a huge fan of Mr. Weiner (who writes the wonderful [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/][SMBC]] which you should read if you haven't since it has comics like [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3371#comic][this]] and [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305][this]] which I think would appeal to the people who visit this subreddit - also, if you're going on an archive binge, the red button shows an extra panel).
