  why don't they coordinate their attacks, to have a bunch of psychic, dark and ghost pokemon throwing an imperial fuckton of mental attacks at it all at once, while rhyperiors use their rock blast thing to shoot it out of the sky?

This is actually exactly what they try to do. As for why it doesn't always work, well... you'll see ;)

  The legendary birds aren't exactly endbringers. They're /birds./
#+end_quote

This is kind of like saying blastoise is a turtle :P Remember, birds in the pokemon world can carry people on their backs and summon hurricane-force winds. If you go up against Zapdos expecting it to have fragile bones and ligament-thin muscles, you're in for a bad time.

  The only problem with beating them seems to be the logistics of raising and training an army capable of overwhelming them.

And then get that army up in the air, of course. Also keep in mind that these birds summon and maintain natural disasters around them, so have fun flying through a thunderstorm or blizzard or around [[http://www.glennbeck.com/publish/uploads/2012/11/firenado.jpeg][firenadoes]] :)
