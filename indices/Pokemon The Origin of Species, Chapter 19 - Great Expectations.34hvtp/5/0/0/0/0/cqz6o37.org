And now the million dollar question: Why don't they just shoot it?

Why don't they just get a bunch of snipers and pump zapdos full of lead?

Or if guns don't exist in pokemon, why don't they coordinate their attacks, to have a bunch of psychic, dark and ghost pokemon throwing an imperial fuckton of mental attacks at it all at once, while rhyperiors use their rock blast thing to shoot it out of the sky? Why don't they have a bunch of koffing float up to it and- actually I'm gonna stop right there, that would wipe out whatever city it was attacking, but you get the point.

The legendary birds aren't exactly endbringers. They're /birds/. They don't have physically impossible durability or bullshit immunity to 99% of powers. The only problem with beating them seems to be the logistics of raising and training an army capable of overwhelming them.
