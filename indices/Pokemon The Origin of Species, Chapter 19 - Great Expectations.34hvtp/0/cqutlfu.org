Hey all! Super rough draft out for super late chapter! Life's been crazy lately. Good, but crazy. I'll do a major edit wave tomorrow. Enjoy, and all feedback welcome, as usual!

Also, apparently FF doesn't allow less than or greater than symbols in text, so just pretend there's a less than symbol in front of the "333" when you see them. You'll get it.
