Sweet chapter. Showed the aftermath of the fire, how everyone was coping and a bit of worldbuilding about how pokemon are healed. I particularly liked the suspicious nurse asking after the limb-less Shiftry, as that /would/ be a very suspicious event. And still kinda is, even with the explanation from Blue.
