I'm changing a number of moves to create a sliding scale of power that's more realistic.

So if say a dewgong uses "blizzard," its range and affect is very localized: some cold wind and shards of ice flung around in a limited area. Compared to, say, Articuno's blizzard, which can affect a whole city.

Same goes for the more traditional "weather abilities" like Sunny Day. Those used by "regular" pokemon are pale imitations of the originals, which are pretty much restricted to the few extremely rare pokemon that have weather effects tied to their abilities: Kyogre and Groudon and Rayquaza being the main three, and then say one in a million Ninetails or Politoad or Tyranitar or Abomisnow (even though those latter two have it as regular abilities rather than "hidden" ones).

Does that makes sense?
