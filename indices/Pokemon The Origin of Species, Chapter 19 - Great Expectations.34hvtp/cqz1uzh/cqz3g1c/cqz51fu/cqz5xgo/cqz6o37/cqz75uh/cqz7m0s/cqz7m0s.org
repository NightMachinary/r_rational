  This is kind of like saying blastoise is a turtle :P Remember, birds in the pokemon world can carry people on their backs and summon hurricane-force winds. If you go up against Zapdos expecting it to have fragile bones and ligament-thin muscles, you're in for a bad time.

But I would still expect it to be made of flesh rather than endbringer-core.

I would still expect physics to actually /work/ on it.

If I took a chainsaw to it, I would expect the feathers to break before the chainsaw did.

It's that sort of thing, you know?

In pokemon, I expect even the legendaries to be made of cells, not space-whale shards.

And cells are pretty easy to break, in comparison.

A good solid hit with a ranged attack should at least cause some minor injury rather than "lolnope Zapdos is Behemoth, only +Scion+ Arceus can touch him".
