While, ideally, eventually having the book published is Erraticerrata's end goal, it's still a web series. A web series that's currently on its fourth book, so a lot of story-related names and terms (that were referenced before multiple times) are to be expected.

Partially the infodump is caused by the introduction of a new PoV, and partially it's the writing style leaning heavily on its medium, but I'd say that the end result has enough story told through interactions. Besides, the heroes assuming a lot of stuff without checking is kind of the point of this chapter, it makes sence that most of the dramatic buildup would be mainly in the central character's head.

  If I picked this up in a bookstore, I would have stopped reading by the third line of the first paragraph.

I see from your comments on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] that you, indeed, picked up the story likely without reading the three previous books. While your other comments suggest you don't come to discussions like that to enjoy the read, did you consider starting with the beginning, to see if the more down-to-earth perspective would make the narration easier for you?

EDIT: Sorry, I thought you /did/ know that this is the latest chapter, and made some seriously uncharitable assumptions about you. Upvoted.
