... while I have seen a series where an interlude or a prologue to a middle book makes sense when flying in blind, I cannot name more than a handful. That's a really high standard.

I'm having trouble guessing why you would apply that standard to this? This isn't a bookstore or even a standalone book.

More to the point, please point me to the web-fiction that meets your standard. I'd like to read it.
