Wow, this is really bad.

- Opening with a meaningless quote, attributed to a fictional character I neither know nor care about.
- Starting with a giant infodump, about characters and places I don't know or care about yet.
- Constantly Telling instead of Showing.
- Bombarding the reader with so many Dumb Fantasy Proper Nouns that the narrative is impossible to follow.

If I picked this up in a bookstore, I would have stopped reading by the third line of the first paragraph. People think this is good storytelling?

EDIT: I am an idiot.

From other comments in this thread, and the lack of clear labelling in the text itself, I assumed that this was the prologue to the first book in the series, re-posted for posterity. I judged the story from that perspective. I realise now that this was a mistake. I have not read any of the previous books - I intend to rectify that soon.

Mea culpa.
