Regarding the edit, after your comment I reread that prologue while "forgetting" what I know about it.

Yeah, it would be really really bad that way.

But most of the stuff that's "told" is something the reader is supposed to know already and the point of it is to show (and not tell ;) ) how the events we know of are perceived by others.
