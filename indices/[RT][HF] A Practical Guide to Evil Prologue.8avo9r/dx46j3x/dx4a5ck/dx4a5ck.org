Reposting from earlier in this thread:

Remember the one time Cat tried to get an Aspect too early? Well, an epiphany triggered early has a cost to it, and angelic intervention seemingly follows similar rules, which allowed Cat to follow Iason in his empowering dream sequence, just like the demon of Corruption followed Cat into hers. How much of this is due to Akua' lingering influence or Catherine being her fairy opposite is up to debate.
