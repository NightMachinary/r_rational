"Bring a massive fuck off army along with them to burn down the country around Cats ears" is exactly the kind of thing she tries to prevent. Besides, a hero resorting to shit like this is what you no doubt would call villain wank.

Seriously ,what's so smug about the protagonist trying to both avoid perpetuating the war "for the greater Good" and to prevent crazies from getting power?
