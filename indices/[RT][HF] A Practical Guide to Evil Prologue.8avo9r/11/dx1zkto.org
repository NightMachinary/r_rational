Oh, Gods below. /It's back./

--------------

Thoughts:

- Still kind of confused why she even bothered with this rigamarole in the first place. Why /not/ have them corpses at the bottom of the Hwarte before they even noticed? She won (granted, it wasn't an easy fight nor was it won by the skin of her teeth - but Cat won) but why risk it at all? I understand that she doesn't want to be like Black, but she seemed certain that their intent was to kill her from Day 1. The extent of the prep she took here means that she was fully expecting a fight. Does she think that she'll eventually get through to a band of heroes if she keeps plugging at it? That, to me, seems /kind/ of far-fetched.
- Good to see Larat as her left-hand man. Good interplay between him and Cat. I very much enjoy how she acknowledges him as her 'treacherous lieutenant,' and I wonder how she plans on dealing with him when the time comes.

- What fresh hell is this? A glamour? Winter magic fuckery? Name power nonsense?

- /Twice/ the Stalwart Paladin recieves an eleventh-hour superpower, threatening to deus ex machina his way into a victory, and /twice/ Cat clamps down on that shit. She's getting good at hero-killing, and it is simply glorious to behold.

- Stal-Pal's induction into the choir of Endurance reminds me of Black's legendary Motive Rant in Book 2, Chapter 36.

- I am confused, however, at how she managed to gatecrash the Stalwart Paladin's shonen power-up. Good on her for breaking a potential Pattern, but again, what fresh hell was that? Masego memes? And who is the "beautiful, dark-skinned woman?" I'm half inclined to believe that might be Archer, but I'm not sure how she'd be able to help Cat and co. break into a heaven. Could it be Diabolist?
