  Why not have them corpses at the bottom of the Hwarte before they even noticed?

Because to have power over them (to either have them join her or to turn them into Winter zombies) she needs to actually make the offer and/or them to be in Callow.

  What fresh hell is this? A glamour? Winter magic fuckery? Name power nonsense?

Probably Winter pushing through, likely at the cost of Cat's agency (notice how her descriptions channge).

Remember the one time /Cat/ tried to get an eleventh hour superpower? Well, an epiphany triggered early has a cost to it, and angelic intervention seemingly follows similar rules, which allowed Cat to follow Iason in his empowering dream sequence, just like the demon of Corruption followed Cat into hers.
