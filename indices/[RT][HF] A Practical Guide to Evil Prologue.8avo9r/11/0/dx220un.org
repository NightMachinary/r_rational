  I understand that she doesn't want to be like Black, but she seemed certain that their intent was to kill her from Day 1. The extent of the prep she took here means that she was fully expecting a fight. Does she think that she'll eventually get through to a band of heroes if she keeps plugging at it? That, to me, seems kind of far-fetched.
