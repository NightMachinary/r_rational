  Alternatively, she can stay closer to our version of the mythes of the Wild Hunt, and have those heroes as her entourage.

This seems to me to just be begging for a Hero to show up with an aspect that would free the undead from their shackles mid-fight.

At which point Cat is surrounded by 4+ full adventuring parties of heroes with a high motivation to kill her, in poetic turnaround. Maybe she can cry out "Impossible!" when it happens. Redemption and vengeance for a full score of Heroes all at once in a single move is too tasty for the narrative-fairies to leave alone forever.

No, much safer to have them raised and sent to do good elsewhere on Cat's terms.
