Raising dead is a big deal in the Guideverse. The only time we've seen it happen or mentioned is when Cat tricks a bunch of angels into declaring her a queen by going through one of the most recognizable patterns for gaining power. Yes, it's still known well enough that Cat can reasonably guess that winning the race for the sword would mean she has to be resurrected, but Black doesn't mention anything like resurrection at will in his "heroes are OP, plz nerf" rant. His interludes don't show any concerns about killed heroes returning to haunt him, while angelic intervention - something that already happened one and a half times in the series already - is mentioned as an element in the stories he heard, so we can safely assume for now that mass resurrection sin't in the cards.
