  Oh, shit -- Catherine can raise the dead and retain their power. Does she have five parties of Heroes raised and held in thrall to her?

We already know Cat could raise intelligent undead well before she was to transition into Black Queen, and there's no reason to believe she's lost that power since. Her line about 'this one's already claimed' fits the theory, too.

Glad this series is back, and eagerly awaiting Wednesday.
