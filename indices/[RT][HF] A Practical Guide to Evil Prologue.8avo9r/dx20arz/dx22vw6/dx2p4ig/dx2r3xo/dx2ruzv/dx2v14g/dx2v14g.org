I think that the one remaining was Fall, given that she said it to have grown far beyond what an Aspect should be. I'm still of the opinion that the transition happened at the coronation, and that her nwe Aspects will be based on her duties as the Queen of the Hunt, similar to those of Queen of Summer (to destroy her enemies, to protect her lands, to see the natural phenomenon metaphysically linked to her victorious).

Edit: Hakram also used his Stand to survive Smite, and likely took wounds knowing that he could Rampage-heal them iif necessary.
