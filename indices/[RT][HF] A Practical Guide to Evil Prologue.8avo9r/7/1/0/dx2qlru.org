I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/89jvm9/is_catherine_going_to_be_worshipped/][a big post]] about Catherine being close enough to a god in terms of power to be worshipped, and mentioned milk and bread as potential offerings to her, since those are most common fae offerings in our folkore. Looks like it's just a superstition in the Guideverse, though.

The second bit comes from [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/01/03/chapter-56-recess/][chapter 56 of book three]], where Catherine makes a drunk joke about naming Robber the first and only member of the Lesser Lesser Footrest Tribe. I referred to the fact that Cat's promises are magiically binding now, so a tribe created "by my authority as Vicefuckingqueen of Callow" may just have been enough to count.
