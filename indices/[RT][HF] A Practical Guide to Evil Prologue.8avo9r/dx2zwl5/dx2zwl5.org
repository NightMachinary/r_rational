Reposting from the other thread since I just realized what made me feel that mild disgust:

May I take a moment to bitch about how the heroes treat the locals like bloody NPCs? Seriously, I get that Iason is a former lay brother, and Lergo is a highborn, and more likely to be antisocial as a mage, but them being annoyed at the innkeepers was more offputting to me than their lack of any solid plan. Cat may have cut them off early when they started explaining their reasoning, but what she would have never done is resorting to using the verbal equivalent of "skip dialogue" button on the elderly couple, and not just because they're Callowan.
