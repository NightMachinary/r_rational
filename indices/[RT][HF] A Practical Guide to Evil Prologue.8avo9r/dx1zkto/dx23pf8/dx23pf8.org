  Still kind of confused why she even bothered with this rigamarole in the first place.

Practice, I think, is the most likely explanation. Both in directly fighting heroes in a relatively low risk setting, and also for trying to find a way to actually convince them. Butchering hero's works well enough in the short term, but eventually her goal has always been to rise above the petty good/evil squabbles and /actually help people/. If she is to accomplish this, however, it will eventually require some accomodation with the nominally good side. Presumably, she has been varying her approach with each group, and hopes to find some way that actually does get through to them.
