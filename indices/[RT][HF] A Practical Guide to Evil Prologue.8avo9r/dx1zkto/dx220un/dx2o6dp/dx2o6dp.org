same here, maybe she can even have 2 factions the woe and the joy or something like that, 2 teams that she can use for different encounters depending of the enemy or the mission, we have to deal with demons and shit ? lets take massego, is there a enemy villain that the empress send, lets take white and co and show then a brand new world (of pain), letting cat almost always have the weight of the story on her side, or making the enemies step up their game.
