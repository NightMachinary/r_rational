Yeah, I think she might have been more successful if she'd lead more into the "temptation" thing.

Like, maybe tell them "Oh, so your purpose is to study the Faery battlefield! Neat! Tell you what, I'll totally allow it, as long as you swear not try to hurt me or my people for the duration of your stay".
