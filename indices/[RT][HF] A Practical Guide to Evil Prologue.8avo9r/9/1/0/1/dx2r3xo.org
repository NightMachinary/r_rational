Aspects are at least partially decided by the publically known part of the story (though not entirely, as this chapter shows). I wonder whether Cat has enough Aspects now to feel safe drawing on them, and whether she's trying to set up a story for a new one, say, to make it manifest when a hero finally accepts the deal.
