Cat's aspects mostly broke when she embraced Winter (there was a shell of *Take* left iirc) but Hakram didn't use a single aspect either.

Cat might be able to get new aspects when she transitions, but it isn't clear that she has, and I highly doubt such a transition would occur off-screen. Black broke that transition in Liesse and I suspect she'll end up with a different name - possibly Dread Empress, given that she heard The Girl Who Climbed the Tower, but then again Cat is all about breaking stories.
