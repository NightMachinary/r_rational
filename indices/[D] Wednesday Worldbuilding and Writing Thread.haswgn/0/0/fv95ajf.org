*Superintelligent Cat* - This sounds like a great premise for a short comedy, but I don't think it'd work well for a longer or more serious work, since the protagonist is actively opposed to what makes the premise fun. Eventually they'll run out of problems caused by being a cat.

*Harder speculative fiction 40k* - This sounds super interesting and fun as a setting, but I think it'd run into the same problems I have with 40k: I'm more interested in reading about it as a setting than in reading stories set there, because it's full of people who suck that I don't want to read stories about. But obviously there are people who still enjoy that, I guess.

For any land-war focused space setting, I'd recommend avoiding interplanetary-capable starships entirely and instead using a Stargate style transportation method. It solves a ton of problems.

*Evangelizing to starfish aliens* - Speaker For The Dead does this, and I think there might be more if it later in the Ender's Game series, but I lost interest in it shortly into the next book.

*Being evangelized by starfish aliens* - This sounds like it has a lot of potential, especially if it's somewhat working.
