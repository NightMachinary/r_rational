Here are some ideas I've been kicking around lately without much development other than contemplating them and writing down extremely rough drafts. If there are existing stories with similar premises I'd love to read them.

- Prehistoric societies dealing with cosmic horrors through eminently prehistoric intuition, cooperation, reverence and cunning rather than the modern sophistication, manipulation, disgust, and analysis which is more typical of the cosmic horror genre. It'd follow them step-by-step and detailing how the relationship progresses over the course of individual lives as well as generations.

- A superintelligent entity is reincarnated as a stray cat in Manhattan 1991, retaining a great deal of their cognitive abilities and some of their memories. The story of how they attempted to conquer the universe or pursue whatever grand goal they set their mind to.

- An alternate history where an early Proto-Germanic culture gained their equivalent of a Genghis Khan or Alexander the Great and as successful as the both of them combined. Essentially a world whose philosophy and politics are largely influenced by this culture instead of Greco-Romans.

- The atmosphere of Warhammer 40k but much harder speculative fiction built from the ground up. There'll be some level of handwaveium for certain aspects, the majority of the hardness will come from the anthropological aspects. The scale of the universe will be much more consistent and the weaponry will be dealt with much more realistically. No more, "impressive" shots from soldiers that are relatively amateur marksmanship. No more, "massive" wars that are eclipsed by the Eastern front in World War II. Even more traditionalist, romantic, and hawkish in its ethos.

- Hard speculative biology, religious missionaries in the far future trying to evangelize to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens][starfish aliens.]] Roughly as alien in almost every way as sac fungi are to mammals, except both are technically sapient beings with some notion of spirituality.

- Similar starfish aliens trying to evangelize their religion to humanity.

- A hard fiction story about a vigilante who is a kinesthetic genius. Going beyond just an extremely good tactile learner, being able to learn physical arts multitudes faster than most people.

Feel free to give your thoughts and/or to steal them for yourself. Any one of these would probably demand a lot of research and creativity to truly execute well.
