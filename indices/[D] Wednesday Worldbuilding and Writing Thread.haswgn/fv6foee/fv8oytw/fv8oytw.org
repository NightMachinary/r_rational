It seems like your trying to create a utopia. I can see some ways that it wont be perfect (I feel like a lot of the aspects would be rife with corruption). But the biggest issue I have with it is that I cant see how the heck the country would form. Maybe it just because I just skimmed it but that's my feedback.

EDIT: I read a bit more deeply and feel the need to expand upon my point. I just don't understand how such a system would come to be. So lets start with the biggest problem I see, the military. All it is your story is a social welfare program that also teachs people to shoot guns. If this was iceland it would make sense because they don't have unstable neighbors. Venezuela is an oil rich country surrounded by places that have had military dictatorship semi-frequently. I bet that they would of at least have needed strong military in the past. That would probably would of extended into the modern-day.
