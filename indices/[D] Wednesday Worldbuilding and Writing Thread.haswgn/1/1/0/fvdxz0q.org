I would assume it does apply to hair colour, honestly. Just a blanket ban on "don't describe humans as looking like food". Hair is not independent of race, and in fact they often go together. That said, we do say "strawberry blonde" as a common term (the article I linked also says that "olive" is the only food that's acceptable to use to describe skin tone for much the same reason), and something like "honey blonde" also seems fine. But the article (or one of the deep FAQs) also says that if you want to describe a white character as having creamy skin or mayonnaise arms then go nuts, but that doesn't mean you can describe their black BFF as oreo-coloured. So there's probably a general "the dominant racial/cultural group in the context you're writing can be described with food". And why bother with saying "honey blonde" when you can say "safflower" or "golden" or "amber" and not touch it?

So yeah... that's what I really struggled with. I was like, "my food comparison is fine! it describes my colour accurately! why should I change it?" and then I realised that the difference between me using that food comparison to describe the colour and me using just normal adjectives was 0 in the story and some non-zero amount to the sort of people who get offended by colour comparisons.

Sidebar on wokeness: the biggest thing that article told me was not to write white as the default, which is something I was guilty of (just describing a white character as having black hair and brown eyes and expecting the reader to infer they're white) but plan to avoid in future.

Sidebar on hair: I wasn't aware but I have found out over the past ~5 years that hair is important racially/culturally, especially in the Black community. There's big cultural debates about straightening hair, how to wear it, etc. You read about white families who adopt black children needing to learn how to style "black hair" and find barbers that know this too. There's stories of black teenagers being given dress code violations for wearing their hair naturally (as in, no product at all in it, just brushed) because it looks too poofy. There's all the controversy about whether it's culturally appropriative for white people to have dreadlocks (because white hair just doesn't naturally form dreads the same way that black hair does).

So yeah... it's quite a deep rabbit hole, in the Black community at least. I'm sure other groups don't have quite as much hair focus (or, hell, maybe even more because I'm ignorant and haven't exactly looked at the importance of hair in Khmer culture)
