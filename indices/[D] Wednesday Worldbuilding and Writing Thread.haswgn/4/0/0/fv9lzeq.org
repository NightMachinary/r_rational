The assumption in the doc is that you need a really popular, competent and benevolent dictator to come into power in order to set this government up which is why I specified that. That requires a significant amount of luck, especially given all the competing greedy would be dictators who want that oil money.

The military is supposed to have gradually devolved in significance because of both reliance on foreign allies and this Venezuela dwarfing its neighbors in population/economic size. Nations having an underfunded military because of reliance on foreign allies is already pretty common, so this was just a different idea for how that could happen.\\
Soldiers do still get combat training and are required to stay in fighting condition to the extent they are able to. So on paper the military would probably be the worlds largest, even if say its air force wasn't larger than its less populous neighbors (but made up of US planes).
