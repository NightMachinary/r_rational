I assume you're talking about the food descriptions of skin colour? Or something else? And yeah, I think everything depends on everyone, know your audience and all that. But if there's a broad group of people who find something offensive, it doesn't matter that the feeling isn't universal. Especially when it's something as easy to avoid and unnecessary as certain type of descriptions.
