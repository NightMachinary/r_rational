*tl;dr how can I be more woke as a writer*

Writing question:

Current events have made me want to be a bit more diverse in my writing in all manner of ways. As a cishet white person, I'm kind of at a disadvantage in terms of that: like, I have 0 of the experience necessary to write a believable Sri Lankan diaspora character, and I know that writing narratives about Blackness or Gayness or Transness or whatever are basically not what I should be focusing on. I should be focusing on including "diverse characters" and using them as "normal" characters, and let people from those communities write their experiences in their own works. This is great for me as I don't have any particular interest in Sri Lankan customs, so wouldn't want to write a story that featured them heavily. But I could just have a character who "happened to be Sri Lankan", learn some basic stuff so I don't accidentally have her celebrate the wrong thing, and off to the races.

Does anyone have any sources (articles, etc) that they recommend for how to be more diverse, or "do activism", in your writing as a cishet white person? What should be avoided? What are good ideas? What are types of diversity I haven't even thought of that I probably should?

In that vein I'd like to leave this great resource I found for writing skin colour (which is also like the second result on google so easy to find again): [[https://writingwithcolor.tumblr.com/post/96830966357/writing-with-color-description-guide-words-for]]

I recall [[/u/tk17studios]] describing Marco's skin as "penny-dark" in the recent A:tR update and that sort of thing can be really evocative and poetic. I know I struggled when I learned that using food terms (tea or coffee coloured etc) to describe peoples' skin is considered offensive by many, but this article helped me settle on new terms that performed the same description while offending nobody. I especially loved how this series really helped outline some of the beauty in skin colour: I think they say you can describe dark skin as "purple-black" and that's /beautiful/ and not weirdly loaded or sexist like "dark chocolate" is.
