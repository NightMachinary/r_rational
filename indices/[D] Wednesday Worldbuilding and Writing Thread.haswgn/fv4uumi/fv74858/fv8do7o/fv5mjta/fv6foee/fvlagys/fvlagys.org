*Just finished a first draft of a novel... any advice on what to do next?*

At the end of last month, I started a mid-year NaNoWriMo thing, to start regaining some decent writing habits by writing a terrible novel. (The point being to get a novel written; if it's not quite as bad as all that, so much the better.) It's relatively hard SF, with relatively intelligent (if not necessarily completely rational) characters; if anyone wants to help with beta-reading, I can PM you a link to the GDoc.

I find myself in a novel (ahem) situation, now. I just finished up the first draft; there's still plenty of fixes, tweaks, and general touching-up I'll want to do before making it public. But as far back as I can recall, my previous attempts at writing have generally taken the approach of shoving the first draft out the door as soon as I finished typing it out; so I'm a bit inexperienced about what I should do next. Anyone have any advice? For example, would you recommend a thorough re-read to fix every last detail I notice needs improvement, or starting some other project, or just throwing the barn doors open for anyone to read and comment, or posting to RoyalRoad / FictionPress / FurAffinity / etc, or something else entirely...?
