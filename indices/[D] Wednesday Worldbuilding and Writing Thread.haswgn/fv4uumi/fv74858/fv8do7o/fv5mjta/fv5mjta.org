I'm writing a short story about first contact and linguistics on [[/r/HFY]]. Everything's by the seat of my pants, so if anyone has any advice or suggestions to offer I'll be glad to take them. [[https://amp.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gxt82z/xenolinguists/][link]]

I have two chapters done and expect to finish with between 4 and 8 total (inclusive.)
