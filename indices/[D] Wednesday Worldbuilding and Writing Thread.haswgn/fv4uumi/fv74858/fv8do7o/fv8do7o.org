In case anyone's curious; as of this morning, my mid-year NaNoWriMo is up to 47,235 words of a first-draft. I started just three weeks ago, on the 28th, so I'd say I've got the words-per-day part of my writing habits firmly in place. :)

I'm reaching a point in the draft that I have little experience with, and is really giving my poor skills a stretch: trying to write a satisfying climax. But since my goal is just to write a complete novel, even if it's a terrible one, if I can't think of some good text to write... then I'll just write the best I can come up with, finish this, and then start trying to write the next thing, which will hopefully be slightly less terrible.

If you'd like to help beta-read the first draft before I declare it complete, this is probably your last chance to offer constructive criticism; I'll be happy to PM the link to the GDoc to anyone who asks.
