I got the impression that it's based on some unclear "code of ethics", not legality. So killing someone you think the world is better off without might count as "execution", killing some random innocent counts as "murder", killing someone you're actually helping by killing them counts as "euthanasia" etc.

No word on how much this is based on belief vs. reality, though.
