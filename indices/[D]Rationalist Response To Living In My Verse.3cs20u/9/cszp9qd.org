  Attempts to make magic common knowledge are met with immediate death from the source of magic
#+end_quote

... before they can be completed, presumably, or the internet would be full of details on magic by now. Which makes it explicit that the Source of Magic can read my mind. Concerning, if it's smart enough to just kill me for daring to try and oppose it.

#+begin_quote
  The source of magic is an omniscient (not quite omnipotent) but subhuman intelligence whose utility function is "undermine human civilization by enacting Faustian deals". The vast majority of those Faustian deals take the form of standardized rituals.
#+end_quote

But not /all/ of them, then? Can I propose new rituals to the Source of Magic?

#+begin_quote
  An afterlife exists and all minds go there on death. Unfortunately, a vast majority of its inhabitants are in eternal unbearable pain
#+end_quote

But no /all/ of them are? Is there a spell that exempts me, personally, from Hell? Because psychopaths are gonna be all over that.

Also, I'm inclined to argue that level of pain makes them no longer meaningfully the same person, and possibly not even human. Depends on whether you can take them /out/ of hell and recover anything, I guess...

#+begin_quote
  There's a ritual for resurrecting people (and erasing all effects of the afterlife)
#+end_quote

Ah. That ... that alone seems to suggest a Good Ending, since we can acquire mindstate copies of everyone at the moment of their death. My first thought is to copy people in some other, possibly nonmagical way, and then murder some of the copies to bring other people back ... but the Source of Magic may not count that, and if it does then that's kind of a bad sign. Still, the fact that it's possible /in principle/ is all that matters.

#+begin_quote
  One of the most common rituals involves murdering someone and binding their mind to an object to grant that object power.
#+end_quote

Are they then immune to the resurrection ritual?

#+begin_quote
  The object may be used to communicate with the mind, to apply physical force, and to teleport to other places the object has been, all without using any additional magic past what was used to create it. The object may not be destroyed, but may be sent away to an empty void.
#+end_quote

"Teleport to places the object has been", eh? Can only the /object/ teleport, or only the /user/? Is it under the control of the bound spirit, or what? What happens if I teleport a bullet into your heart?
