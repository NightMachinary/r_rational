Based off that, magic is actively malevolent and not a net good to society. Eternal torture is the result of death.

So, we need some form of immortality, we need some form of way of competing with the AI, and we need some way of suppressing other mages.

Seek to subvert scientists into our scheme with social prowess and whatever rituals we can do to get them on our side. Increase the presence of cameras and recorders in society, but make no special effort to detect mages. This should passively weaken other mages.

Do radical, inhuman experiments to create some sort of scientific immortality that isn't dependent on magic.

Convert the vast majority of humans into something inhuman that the AI doesn't care about. Leave a small population of humans for it to influence.

Victory.
