Immediately perform the resurrection ritual dozens of times, carefully 'screwing up' each time, producing dozens of existential threats - this almost guarantees the destruction of humanity. Given the inevitable torturous afterlife of nearly every human to be born, stopping any more from being born is the priority.

Murdering everyone into items to reduce their infinite pain's degree is a secondary concern - start that campaign /after/ ensuring the end of humanity.

Note: this response assumes perfect knowledge and belief - a real rational response would almost certainly be to disbelieve some aspect of the system that makes less sense (like the 'afterlife of pain' part), and begin attempting to disprove it.
