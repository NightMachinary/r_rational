Such a judge would require at least human-level intelligence. Otherwise, you could successfully trick said judge repeatedly. But since the OP says that the AI is "of subhuman intelligence", there is every reason to believe that you can trick that judge.

There are some people who do an act intending to exploit a loophole. There are other people who do that very same act without intending to exploit anything. It takes intelligence to distinguish these two. After all, there is a continuum between these two states so it is not clear cut to easy to distinguish.

The ultimate goal should be modifying the utility function of the AI. Ultimately though, that requires greater knowledge and greater scientific ability (or perhaps magical ability).
