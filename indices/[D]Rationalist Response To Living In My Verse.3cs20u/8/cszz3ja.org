Step 1: Identify what the Source considers to be immoral enough to grant power. What are the limits, where are the lines.

Step 2: Identify whether such limits are regional or universal. If a thing is illegal in one country and not another, does that have an effect? It can be worked with either way.

Step 3: Identify a thing that the Source considers immoral that I/humanity does not.

Step 4: Dependent on step 2, either go to a country where that thing is legal and abuse the crap out of it, or go to a country where a thing that you think is perfectly fine is illegal and abuse it that way.

Step 5: Power overwhelming.

In short a good way to keep systems like this secure is to make them actively antagonistic to clever people who try to exploit loopholes. A judge with the power to laugh at your attempt and throw you back sans an arm is an effective deterrent to people trying to be clever.
