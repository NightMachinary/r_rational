Some people believe that abortion is murder. Furthermore, a lot of people believe abortion is murder but don't [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alief_%28mental_state%29][alieve]] it. Furthermore, abortion is something that is done without the king or a seal. This makes abortion a useful test case on exactly what counts as murder, whether actual illegality is required, or whether it works based on belief that something is murder, and depending on the answer, it can be a cheap safe source of magic.

Of course, it's also possible that abortion actually is murder in a strong sense in this world, since it has immortal souls.

And there's a fine line between accidental killing and murder. If you kill someone driving and have an extremely high blood alcohol content, that's murder. But your chance to cause an accident gradually goes down as your blood alcohol level goes down; any cutoff point for the difference between accident and murder is going to be arbitrary.

I suspect the intended interpretation is "it counts as murder if the Source thinks it's the type of act which corrupts people", in which case you can only munchkin it if the Source thinks something corrupts people and it really doesn't, which depends on exactly how good at ethics the Source is. What if the Source thinks that deaths in sweatshops are callous forms of capitalist indifference to life, so the Source counts them as murder, and someone else thinks those deaths are acceptable because they voluntarily took the sweatshop job and much of life involves tradeoffs that increase the chance of death? If the second person is actually /right/, you can get magic by milking the Source's poor ethical thinking. Perhaps the source just uses the ethics of an average person and considers murder anything this person would consider murder; the average person isn't too good at thinking about ethics and would never even think of the sweatshop argument (regardless of whether it's correct).

Also, for "it counts as murder if the Source thinks it corrupts people", the Source can anticipate that people will use "does this result in magic" as a guide to morality and will grant or deny magic for a few random acts just to mess people up. Perhaps abortion isn't murder, but the Source makes it produce magic anyway because the Source anticipates that doing so will result in outlawing abortions. Perhaps the Source decides not to make killing of "inferior races" produce magic so as to encourage Nazis to think they are doing good things. (Of course, this also allows you tio gain magic from ethical acts if you are able to outthink the Source enough to figure this out.)
