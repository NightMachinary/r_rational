I think this requires a very precise definition of "legal". My first hypothesis would be that the old "royalty is sacred" belief should be taken literally: the Source flags a certain person ("king") as a bearer of the property "makes decisions Legal". Alternatively, it can work with an object ("Royal Seal"). I can't instantly think of any experiments though: we'd need to issue an execution that would be technically legal, but avoid involving the "king" or the "seal", which might be tricky.
