What constitutes an attempt to make magic common knowledge? Could you distribute to the internet an encrypted encyclopedia of "secret information" whose existence is common knowledge, which can be decrypted given a password that you can spread to a subset of all people?

What about if it's a simple password, or the kind that can be brute-forced, or the kind that future mathematical advances may be able to work around, or the answer to a public riddle?

(A fun example kind of password would be "magic", since only people who are aware of magic would ever try that, heh.)

This all could be tested by having someone other than me try to do it. Who needs rituals to kill people as a means to an end? (Although I hope that having someone try to do it does not constitute an attempt... one could just post to the internet /this exact comment/; someone will try it, and this may be less likely to be seen as an attempt if properly worded.)
