  The source of magic is an omniscient (not quite omnipotent) but subhuman intelligence whose utility function is "undermine human civilization by enacting Faustian deals".

  An afterlife exists and all minds go there on death. Unfortunately, a vast majority of its inhabitants are in eternal unbearable pain, making them psychologically unrecognizable after an instant. This is known, but not widely known, among magic users, because it's useful in magical theory but not in practice.

  Attempts to make magic common knowledge are met with immediate death from the source of magic; this is particularly dangerous in the information age, where putting magical information on the internet can invoke this effect. There's nothing wrong with letting an individual or group know magic exists,

What about sharing a packet of information which you don't even know contains information about magic? If someone uploads scans from a rot13 diary containing magical information to reddit and they don't know the rot13 encryption, do they still die?
