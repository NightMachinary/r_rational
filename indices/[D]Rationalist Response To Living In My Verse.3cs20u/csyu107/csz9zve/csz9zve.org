Dumber, yes, but omniscient and with a Death Note level sympathetic range kill spell.

The real question is where self preservation falls in its list of priorities. If it wants to directly oppose 'person who has a decent chance of destroying me or changing my utility function', it could do so years in advance or just prevent their birth.

An omniscient idiot is still very dangerous. If this is actual omniscience, I'm not sure exactly what level of 'subhuman' OP is talking about, as it would be able to deterministically predict all of the future and optimize for the negative outcomes desired in it's utility function perfectly.

With a Death Note.
