Babies which would then undergo everlasting torment?

There are positive outcomes that remain, depending on the definitions being used. It's possible that uploading doesn't qualify as dying, or that the definition of 'civilization' allows permanent nomadism to satisfy the entities utility function. Are we willing to allow a few /billion/ extra perma-tortured entities to exist to test those ideas?
