  Dumbledore had a huge agency: he made the decision, losing against Voldemort, to perform a forbidden action and willingly condemn himself to spending life as a blind servant of prophecy, because he recognized his inferiority and cared enough about his goal to humble himself that way.

Well, he had agency in making that decision. But after that ... it basically becomes impossible to know what Dumbledore was doing for prophecy and what he wasn't, and every action he makes has to be judged as being a possible step towards saving the entire world.

- Did Dumbledore make Snape the Potions Master because he wanted to weaken Slytherin, or because prophecy said so?
- Did he send Narcissa off to Australia with her memories stolen because he didn't want to kill her but needed her to be out of the way, or because prophecy told him to?
- Did Dumbledore drive Lily and Snape apart as part of some scheme he was running, or because prophecy told him to?

All those questions just evaporate in the face of prophecy. You're left with two big questions:

- Was Dumbledore right in opening the Hall of Prophecy?
- Was Dumbledore right in doing whatever it took to get around prophecy?

To my mind, these are much less interesting character questions than the earlier ones. Using Snape to tear down Slytherin from the inside is a complicated moral question! But using Snape to tear down Slytherin because you think it's going to prevent the end of the world is far, far less complicated. All of Dumbledore's actions prior to this revelation are complex ones, but prophecy just puts its thumb straight on the scale, in part because of the sheer size the prophecy's magnitude. I mean, it becomes morally defensible to murder every single child in House Slytherin in order to prevent all sentient life from being extinguished. That's a no-brainer. And for that reason, I think that it's taking an interesting character and destroying his complexity.

So with that said, there are a ton of cool possibilities that "prophecy" in all its forms allows for. I don't at all deny that. I just think that all too often, they're used for the wrong reason.

I have mentioned here a few times that I'm editing up /The Timewise Tales/, which is a story about time, and people that travel through it (willingly or otherwise) and it hits a bunch of the prophecy tropes. I actually think it hits every time travel trope available to the static timeline model. The thing is, you have to be really aware of what's motivating your characters, and make sure that things aren't just happening Because Prophecy. If you want to throw two characters into conflict, it can't be because there's a prophecy that they will fight - that's not an honest conflict, because it's not really character driven. If two characters are fighting Because Prophecy, then there's a good chance that they got handed the Conflict Ball, and the author thought it would be interesting to see a clash of time swords. And if the hero wins Because Prophecy then that has a real tendency to cheapen his victory - like it wasn't his personal attributes, or the fact that he overcame his flaws, but simply the fact that it was destined to happen.

My rule for myself was that while people were allowed to act on future information, this wasn't allowed to be the primary driver of conflict between the characters, nor was it allowed to /resolve/ conflict between characters, which is just as bad if not worse. Seeing the future can exacerbate problems, but it can't invent them.

You /can/ make that stuff good - there's very little that you can't get away with if you're a good enough writer - but it's difficult, and that means that you see it flubbed in a lot of places by people who thought that they were good enough writers and, sadly, weren't.
