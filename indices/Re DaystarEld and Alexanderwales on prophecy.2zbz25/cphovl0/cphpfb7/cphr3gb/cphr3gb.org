I just noticed that my comment contains SPOILERS FOR ALL HPMOR

I actually think the end of the world prophecy is a bit of a pain as well because it's less exploitable. The canon prophecy is nice, in that while it tells us that Harry and Voldemort must fight, it doesn't actually indicate the outcome. There's nothing in the prophecy that says Harry must win (although the powers he knows not gives him an edge, certainly). But look at Voldemort attempting to stop Harry from destroying the world by killing him. How can he possibly think this will work in his favour? He actually effectively dooms himself by making it certain that the only way Harry can fufill that prophecy is

a)by his death fulfilling it

b)by Harry escaping, and probably rather violently, given the circumstances.

Honestly, given how powerful prophecy seems to be in hpmor, Voldemort's actions seem akin to someone who see's a clearly time turned individual then decides that they are going to try to kill that individual before they can travel back in time.
