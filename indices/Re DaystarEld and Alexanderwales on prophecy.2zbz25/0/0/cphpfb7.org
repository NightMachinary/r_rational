One other thing I wanted to add:

I had really thought that HPMOR was setting up for Quirrell to shepherd Harry into the role of ruler of magical Britain. He said as much, and though it was obvious to me that he was [[#s][]], I thought that was going to be the nature of their conflict - that he was evil, but not really cartoonishly evil for its own sake, deceptive and manipulative, but in a way that was by-and-large beneficial to the protagonist. It's an interesting question, what happens when a young boy with aspirations of goodness gets put on the throne by a much more powerful sociopath. There's a rich, complex tension there.

And then Prophecy became the primary driver of the plot, and generated less interesting conflicts that wiped away the conflicts that I was invested in. Just like that, the questions of moral complexity were destroyed.
