Something that confused me about the Dumbledore chapter was, it suggested prophecies were micromanaging his actions in ways I can't think how they would, since the prophecies we hear are vague prompters to interpretation. How could Albus derive such specific actions without justifying them? Even if the prophecies /were/ explicit, he's doing the work of picking and choosing them, cultivating the future to his wishes.

It's a rationalization of his established character as someone with volumes of eccentric plans and actions, but does seem a needless one---why can't Dumbledore's style just be to seed lots of low-level plans, farm out serendipity? His role as Gardener of Prophecy actually tells us almost nothing about him in any situation, because we have no idea what the prophecy is he was working with and what thinking was involved on his part. So why have it at all?

The concept might work better were you to just (rewrite the scene and) recast it from "Dumbledore, who the prophecies told what to do," which doesn't make much sense given what we know of prophecies, to "Dumbledore, who did the difficult work of trying to make the worst prophecies not happen."

Second part, I agree and would phrase this as "information is what makes the plot move forward, if information comes out of nowhere so has the plot".

Also, "if it comes from nowhere, at least make it expensive."
