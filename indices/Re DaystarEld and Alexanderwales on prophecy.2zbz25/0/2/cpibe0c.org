Ironically, one of my favorite time travel fight scenes is in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Each move is set up by whoever wins the fight (and thus gains control of the time machine); every thing that happens is countered by the other player describing why they set things up in that way, and then describing what they set up next.
