The qbits thing seems pretty logical. 2^{64} is 1.84e19 bits, which is comparable to the estimated capacity of a human brain. That's consistent with the rest of the setting. And as for why the Facilitator didn't just reach for nanotechnology - it wasn't capable of self-improvement and is much less intelligent than a human. It can learn rapidly and think rapidly but can't rewrite its own source code. So it just didn't think of hiding and gathering enough knowledge to solve the protein folding problem or take control of the nuclear codes or whatever.
