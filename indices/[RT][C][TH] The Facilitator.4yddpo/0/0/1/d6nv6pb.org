With the technobabble it's easily forgivable, I'm just the weird sort of person who's going to be distracted by talking about people worrying about their quantum computer having more than 64 qubits. There's probably no easy way to change this.

As for the AI - well, there /is/ an easy way to make that more technically accurate. Just have it stay under the radar a couple of weeks, and then one morning everyone wakes up dead. But this is less good of a story.
