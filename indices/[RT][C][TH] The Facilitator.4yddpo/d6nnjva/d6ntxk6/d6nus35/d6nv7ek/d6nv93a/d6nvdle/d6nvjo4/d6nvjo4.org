  How exactly I don't know, but I suspect the neuroscience of 83 years hence could find a way.

Sounds like a god-of-the-gaps type situation to me.

There are a couple of technologies that could lead up to that sort of thing, mostly nanites that physically rearrange things.

A mask-thing implies a bunch of stuff about how the technology works, better to keep it vague.

Any intelligent enhancement is /hard/. Look up "Algernons law". Any simple adaptation that vastly increases any aspect of intelligence would probably already be in the general population, presuming it provided a significant advantage.

So I'm a lot more inclined to be critical of intelligence enhancing technology at the tech-level shown in your story. Well, technology that's implemented on top of meat anyway. And that isn't along the lines of wikipedia or prediction markets, or something else that feels a lot like a tool.

And the mask-thing isn't a /big/ problem. I can imagine ways it makes sense. Maybe nanites that are powered via induction. Although I'd be surprised if any re-wiring to that scale wasn't permanent.

There are ways it makes sense, it just seems like a less-probable way for technology to develop.
