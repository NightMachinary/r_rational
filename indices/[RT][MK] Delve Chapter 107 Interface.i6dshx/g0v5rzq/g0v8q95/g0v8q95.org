Really interesting chapter, kind of dissapointed that Rain modifying his subconscious to run commands was skipped over. I feel like having that capacity would be a major advantage in many ways, both for true multitasking and having preset responses to certain dangers.

I enjoyed seeing him "ls" as his first entry.
