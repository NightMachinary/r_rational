Back when this chapter came out on Patreon, we spent a good while analyzing it. So I claim minimal credit beyond transcribing it to here. Really most of the credit should go to a guy named Zhade on the Discord. Don't read any further if you want to try interpreting the messages yourself, or haven't read the chapter yet.

Going through the interface messages step by step:

#+begin_quote
  Alert: Comprehension threshold reached

  Hybrid Interface Boot

  Please Wait...

  Hybrid Interface Boot Complete

  Hybrid Interface Mode: Terminal [User-Defined]
#+end_quote

Pretty basic, it's the artifact reaching it's comprehension threshold aka figuring out how to talk to Rain, and creating the interface. It calls the interface a "terminal", but the name is coming from Rain, as it's user defined.

#+begin_quote
  Debug Monitoring: Enabled

  Retrying Direct Link

  Link Established [Warning: Protocol]
#+end_quote

Here, the artifact retries its direct link that it was doing before; the thing that caused massive pain in Rain. This pretty much confirms that the artifact isn't sapient in any way, as its first step after creating the terminal is to retry the old method of interfacing. The protocol warning may mean that it's required to do so. Debug monitoring is interesting though, and it explains what happens next.

#+begin_quote
  Scanning...

  Header Scan Complete

  New User Detected

  User Name: Richmond (Rain) Stroudwater [Error: Format]

  Coerced User Name: rain

  Creating User Profile

  Scanning...

  User Primary Language: [Error: Unknown]

  User Origin: [Error: Unknown]

  User System Compatibility: 64% [Warning: Threshold]

  Compatibility below threshold
#+end_quote

Next, the artifact tries to scan Rain. It first does a header scan, which is successful. Headers are the supplementary data prefixed to a larger block of data. In this case, Rain's header is his name, which the artifact copies, modifies to fit it's own format, and then creates a user profile. The header possibly contains other, esoteric bits of information that Rain couldn't see.

After that, it continues it's scan, but messes up because the user's language and origin cannot be retrieved. It's not that the artifact doesn't know what English or Earth are. It can grab terms from Rain's head to substitute, like how it defined "terminal". No, something else's wrong, so it checks Rain's compatibility, which is below threshold.

Now, threshold is obviously the limit to interface with the artifact successfully. Rain is below threshold, and he shouldn't normally be able to interface with the artifact, but his workaround managed to get through. So the artifact adapts.

#+begin_quote
  Attempting conformance...

  Conformance Failed [Error: Unknown]

  Attempting System Recovery...

  Recovery Failed [Error: Unknown]

  Scanning...

  Paling Integrity: 74% [Warning: Threshold]

  Soul Fragmentation: 99% [Warning: Threshold]

  Core Rank: 18 [Error: Threshold]

  Core threshold not met

  Scanning attributes...

  Focus Adaptation: [Error: Callback]

  [System Instability Detected]

  [Critical Scan Error] Aborting...

  Scan Aborted
#+end_quote

The artifact tries to make Rain's compatibility increase. There is no mention of how it would have done this, or if it is even possible with the current state of the Majistraal artifacts. Irregardless, this fails and it's recovery also fails, so it backs out and continues scanning for the cause. It notes down that Rain's paling integrity and soul fragmentation (also note how it uses the paling term, which was unlikely to be in the Majistraal lexicon as it was mentioned by the Watch who existed after the Majistraal's fall).

Looking at both now, it seems that the Warning: Threshold is a notification that something in the scan has tripped a warning flag.

Rain's compatibility, paling integrity, and soul fragmentation all tripped warning flags.

On the other hand, Rain's Core Rank just tripped an Error: Threshold flag. Which probably meant a much more benign error than Error: Unknown.

So the artifact currently knows something is fucked up with Rain, but it still wants to figure out how to communicate properly.

It tries to figure out a way through Rain's attributes, but things get real bad here. We get a callback error, which means some asynchronous timing error happened that fucked things up. Rain probably almost died here, given how loud his screams got, and the artifact realized this and backed out.

#+begin_quote
  Contact Administrator [Error: Not Found]

  [Error: Unknown] Retry

  [Error: Unknown] Retry

  [Error: Unknown] Retry

  [Error: Unknown] Retry

  Retry Failed

  Direct Link Failed

  Reverting to Fallback

  Hybrid Interface Set as Primary

  Administrator List [] [Error: Failsafe]

  User Privilege Level Elevated
#+end_quote

So, the artifact currently has a weak user plugged in, who almost died as a result of the artifact trying to interface better with them. What does it do? It calls for an administrator. Who, of course, isn't there. It retries, don't know if it tries the exact same contact protocol or different different procedures each time, but eventually it finally gives up and uses Rain's interface method.

And with no admins currently available, this trips a fail safe flag and Rain is elevated

The rest is pretty self explanatory, so no need for further analysis.

The fail safe flag is most likely referring to this passage from chapter 73.

#+begin_quote
  The obelisk helped him, guiding his understanding. He marveled once more at the mastery of the ancient order of mages as he modified the list of residents for the city, scrolling past the names of thousands of long-dead Majistraal and adding his own to the end, as well as one other. He was only allowed to do this because of the failsafe the Majistraal added to all their technology. If there were no living users, anyone could gain control, provided that their mind could handle the strain. His could.
#+end_quote

So it's probably not just that no admins are available, it's also that there are no other living users registered

TL;DR: The artifact figured out what Rain wanted it to do, started a user scan as a matter of protocol in order to create a better interface, the scan really fucked with Rain, the artifact realized this and aborted, attempted to contact admin, gave up and used Rain's crappy interface method in the end.
