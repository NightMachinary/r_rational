  We get a callback error, which means some asynchronous timing error happened that fucked things up

Callbacks don't necessarily have to do with asynchronous calls or waiting for a response. I take this to mean that the operation/function it's trying to call doesn't exist. So it thinks it's able to do something to "adapt his focus", but whatever library/hardware isn't available/connected/set up.
