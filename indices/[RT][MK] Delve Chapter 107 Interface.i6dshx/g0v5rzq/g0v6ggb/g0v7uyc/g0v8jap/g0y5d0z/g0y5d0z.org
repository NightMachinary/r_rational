I'm assuming that the "focus" is the individual's ability to see their own statistics (their blue screens, runes, books, etc). In this case it might be that Rain has modified his own so extensively that it either doesn't conform to anything the artifact can interface with or that the focus has enough XP pumped into it that the artifact doesn't have enough strength to force a modification.
