This was addressed a chapter of two back. She doesn't want to swap her build around because it takes too long -- 8 hours per point, I think? Her fire damage is reduced against fire creatures but she does so much that it doesn't matter.

Additionally, she doesn't get to swap randomly, only to things she's unlocked. None of the non-fire skills we've seen her use in the past are damage-dealing.

Finally, I'm not sure how much mana Message takes but I doubt it's very much, and she's got Rain using Essence Well on her. She can afford to waste a handful of points.
