Yeah, so she would need to change fireball and meteor. She could keep chanting and triplicate and airwalk and brace, and literally everything else we've seen. If she's a jack of all trades who hasn't unlocked ANY other damage type besides fire, then she's even dumber than I thought. Just change the damage spells.

Good thing the aberrants they ran into in the fire biome weren't fire type aberrants, huh? What a lucky break. Because they didn't want to take the time to do the vastly more intelligent option of switching to a better damage type.

I'm sure it would have been great comfort to the person she's supposed to be protecting down there that they saved 1 day of delving time as he roasted to death against a level 24 blue fire elemental that Amelia can't even damage.
