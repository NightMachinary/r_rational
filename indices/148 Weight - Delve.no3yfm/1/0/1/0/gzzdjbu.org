You might have skipped the part where she's loaded with a bunch of fire boosting skills (Fire affinity, Heat Mastery, etc, etc). Just switching Fireball with, let's say, Rockbomb, would be a waste without the various metamagics she has to boost that type of magic. And for higher leveled spells like Meteor it's even worse, since she also needs to worry about the prerequisites. I do think she should've taken the time to switch to something else, but they decided time was of the essence and since the Rank of the area was just 15, it shouldn't be a problem for her to just overpower everything with with the Force aspect of her fire spells. It's been a recurring thing in the story that areas keeps turning out more dangerous than they should, at some point they should start taking that into consideration.
