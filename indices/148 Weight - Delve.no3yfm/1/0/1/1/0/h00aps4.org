Do we have numbers on how long a change would take? Why do you think it would take a week? Do you think it takes an entire week every time Amelia change spec?

And they wouldn't need to do it every time they changed biomes. Just whenever the biome is literally counter to their main damage dealer. And sure, it took only an hour to kill this one. But that's because the author decided to make the fight take an hour. And DIDN'T make the fire biome boss be a fire monster. And DIDN'T make their characters suffer for poorly planned choices.
