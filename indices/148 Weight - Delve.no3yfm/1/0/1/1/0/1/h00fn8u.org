That's how long it took to change from geomancer to pyromancer. But if you want math, she's over level 30 and it takes 8 hours per skill point.

8*30/24 isn't hard. that's 10 days.

As for why she should change in every biome? Don't ask me that's your argument. Without knowing beforehand what's in each biome it's either all, nothing, or some half-ass bs that is as good as flipping a coin. She killed every fire type there without even having to stop flirting.
