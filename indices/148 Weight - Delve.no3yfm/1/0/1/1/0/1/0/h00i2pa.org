I didn't ask why they would change every biome. I said they would only need to do it if the biome literally countered their damage, like this one did. Luckily for the characters, the author didn't make a fire biome boss be a fire biome monster. Because rain would have died.

*30 is a fucking dumb thing to say about changing specs. I've already specified she wouldn't need to change any of the utility spells. Only the damage spells and boosters.

Does 8 hours mean nonstop concentration? Does she get eating and sleeping breaks? How many actual skills would need to change to go from fire to something else?
