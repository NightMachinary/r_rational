You were saying she needs a day. (24hours/day)/(8 hours) gives her up to 3 skills in total.

(31-10)*8/24 gets us back to the 7 day figure I previously quoted. And this doesn't even cover the recovery time from not sleeping for a week or the prep time of building a fort that Rain can defend solo while Tallheart is busy getting food or watering the pebbles.

I also didn't address your first paragraph up there so let's fix that - Aneliah had no trouble against anything in this biome, except things that weren't supposed to be there. The claim that she was countered by everything in the biome is just flat out wrong. She literally one shot everything they found and had expected to find.
