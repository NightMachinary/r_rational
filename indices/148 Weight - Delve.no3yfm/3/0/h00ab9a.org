Isekai is just the japanese name for Portal fantasy, which has existed since the 80s iirc. BTW since when is RR and webfiction are synonyms with quality ? Really bro ? You want good stuff you read highly rated, award winning books, not RR or webfiction.

Nothing wrong with RR or webfiction they are a wonderful source of popcorn, fun fictions. But they aren't necessarily where you go to when you want high quality writing, although there's some of it there also.
