Objectively speaking, isekai fantasy is worst than the rest. In fact, isekai is a an actual way to justified anacronism and the use of pop culture to attrack younger audience. How many of the top 5 fiction in RR are isekai? How many in top web fiction? I know you can take any other japanese oriented website and make a counter argument.
