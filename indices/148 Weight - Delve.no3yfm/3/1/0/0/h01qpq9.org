  Objectively speaking, isekai fantasy is worst than the rest. In fact, isekai is a an actual way to justified anacronism and the use of pop culture to attrack younger audience.

Wait what? I'd be really interested in a clarification of this opinion; How can anachronism be used to "attack" younger audiences? And your first argument is wrong both as an argument and as fact: 2 stories in the top 6 of RR are Isekai's and 5 are Isekai's out of the top 20. That's 25%, for a subgenre of a genre that is ridiculously good? According to this metric Objectively speaking Isekai's are one of the best forms of fantasy lol?

But its a moot point, because correlation != causation, Isekai is a genre, its irrelevant how many bad ones exist, that has no baring on the quality of the good ones nor their quantity.

But WTH are you talking about with the anachronisms? How can pop culture be used to attack young people?

Edit:

If you meant "attract" instead of "attack" then that makes more sense, and sure, maybe that is one attribute of Isekai's which appeal to people, doesn't change what I personally find attractive about them: that we get to skip all the build-up of character and knowlage I've read thousands of times in each story I read which I am now bored by and get to skip immediately to the my favorite parts of fiction: the MC using that knowledge and intelligence to do cool things.
