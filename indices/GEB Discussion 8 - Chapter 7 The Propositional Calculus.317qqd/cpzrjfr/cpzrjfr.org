[[/u/xamueljones]] the rules for joining and separation are wrong, it should say:

#+begin_quote
  RULE OF JOINING: If x and y are theorems of the system, then so is the string <x⋀y>.

  RULE OF SEPARATION: If <x⋀y> is a theorem, then both x and y are theorems.
#+end_quote

And it should be FANTASY RULE not FANTAS*T*Y RULE (twice in the definition and in the text) :)
