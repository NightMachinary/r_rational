About the Crab Canon:

1) What about the

at the start and end? The obvious part is one is the flip of the other but maybe there's more to it? Almost looks like a spinner when joined.

2) There is this interesting part on p.200 before "(Suddenly, the Crab...)":

#+begin_quote
  /Achilles/: Fiddle. It makes a big difference, you know.

  /Tortoise/: Oh, well it's all the same to me
#+end_quote

Because on p. 62 at the top it is *implied* (this is the dialog before figure and ground) that the *tortoise* said:

#+begin_quote
  /Tortoise/: Fiddle. It makes a big difference, you know.
#+end_quote

and actuall written:

#+begin_quote
  /Achilles/: Oh, well it's all the same to me
#+end_quote

So it's the same discussion but with flipped roles.

Questions:

1) Indeed, why does he?

2) I'd say *no* because =P∧~P= was only an example from Prudence, in general the view is that we have to prove all theorems

3) ??? (not sure what I'm supposed to do here)

4) I don't think it technically *has* to remain out of the system, if I get what DRH wants to say is that it is better to keep your *core* as limited as possible and we can derive the second rule from the first one:

#+begin_example
  (1) [               push
  (2)   <~x∨~y>       premise      
  (3)   ~~<~x∨~y>     double tilde
  (4)   ~<~~x∧~~y>    de morgan's rule
  (5)   ~<x∧y>        double tilde
  (6) ]               fantasy rule
  (7) <~x∨~y>⊃~<x∧y>
#+end_example

and the other way around we also get =~<x∧y>⊃<~x∨~y>=, but to actually *prove* it we would have to define what /interchangeable/ means, however we could extend the Propositional Calculus with ↔ with the intended meaning "interchangeable" and add the rule:

EQUIVALENCE: If =<x⊃y>= is a theorem and =<y⊃x>= is a theorem then =<x ↔ y>= is a theorem. x and y are said to be interchangeable and you can replace x with y in a theorem if =<x ↔ y>=.

5) For =<P⊃<Qv~Q>>=:

*Koan*: If you say a word then I will cut off your heads or I will not cut off your heads

*Derivation*:

#+begin_example
  (1) [            push
  (2)   P          premise
  (3)   [          push
  (4)     ~Q       premise
  (5)   ]          pop
  (6)   <~Q⊃~Q>    fantasy
  (7)   <Qv~Q>     switcheroo
  (8) ]            pop
  (9) <P⊃<Qv~Q>>
#+end_example

6) It is both complete and consistent, for more ask your proof-source of trust ;)
