I haven't read GEB so excuse me if I'm way off base here; one of these questions was just interesting to me.

#+begin_quote
  If the presence of a contradiction is enough to completely ruin a system, then why when we think of a contradiction do we not immediately collapse in despair?
#+end_quote

We're thinking about logical contradictions, not running propositional logic natively inside our heads. Even if we were actually running on propositional logic, it's not necessary to execute something to comprehend it. A compiler does not hang if you ask it to compile an infinite loop, and you can even write a computer program that watches another live program and detects if it starts running an infinite loop (for certain classes of infinite loops).

  In addition, we frequently run into biases in our thinking, do certain biases count as contradictions?
#+end_quote

Does the conjunction fallacy work here?
