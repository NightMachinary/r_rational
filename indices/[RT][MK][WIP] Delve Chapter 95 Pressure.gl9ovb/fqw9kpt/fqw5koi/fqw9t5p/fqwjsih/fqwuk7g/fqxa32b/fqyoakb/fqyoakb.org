Max durability with the rune active is just under 20000. He's at 11,879 currently, so only about 8000 left to go.

So at 0.8 mp per durability and 1% charge efficiency, that's about 640,000 mp left to go. (Assuming the armor takes no durability hits that need repairing).

I can't remember whether he's bottlenecked on regen or charge skill. Either way, it's going to be a bit before he can even start to fill up the charge. On the plus side, the other runes don't cost a ton, so once durability is capped it can keep going for a long time without too much issue.
