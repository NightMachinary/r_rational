He can charge the armor with or without light. What's going on is that the armor takes 1% of the incoming mana (due to the terrible import efficiency) and sends it into a holding space (aka the Capacitance Rune). The mana either stays there while there's light, or it gets used up to 'build' up the Durability Rune when it's dark. It looks like he's losing the mana, but in reality, every time he turns on the Durability Rune, the armor is stronger than before.
