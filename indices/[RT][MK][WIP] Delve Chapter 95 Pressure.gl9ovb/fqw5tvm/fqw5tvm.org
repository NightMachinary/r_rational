So we now get an inkling of how the build is going to be overpowered. But still not really how it can be abused. I doubt having an overpowered soul means his damage or resistances increase. Obviously having people respect him more because they can feel him being powerful is at least a bit useful.

The only thing I can think of is that he'll be able to jump up really fast if he manages to kill a higher level blue.

Though I bet it will help with the shield artifact thing somehow.
