What do you think about low gravity in a fantasy setting? The only piece of media that I can think of that used it was the Barsoom series, and besides not really exploring the idea very well, it's pretty inaccurate given what we know today.

I think the idea has a lot of untapped potential, and it's an interesting way to shake things up, but not too much so that it detracts from the actual story.

Some thoughts, assuming gravity is around half that of earth:

- It would be almost trivial to use airships to lift massive amounts of cargo, and airplanes would also need a lot less initial complexity to work. It's possible a lot of those [[https://www.google.com/search?q=ridiculous+flying+contraptions&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgvvuRtufaAhWU0YMKHZG0CckQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=1109/][ridiculous flying contraptions]] could have actually worked. Human powered heavier than air flight in the renaissance is an awesome image.

- Even if powered flight is not a thing, gliders would definitely be way more effective and safe. They would be smaller, and go farther. Climb mountains or build high towers and glide everywhere!

- Speaking of which, building taller buildings would be easier too. Architecture in general would be very different. Skyscrapers in a medieval setting?

- Delta-v to get to low orbit would be way lower. Possibly low enough to fling up some magic satellites or have magical sub-orbital flights?

- Assuming a similar atmospheric pressure, it's plausible to imagine a massive airbourne ecosystem, extending all the way up into the upper atmosphere. Floating plants, and jellyfish like creatures that collect hydrogen to float like balloons, in addition to birds with massive wings that never have to land. Maybe creatures that live off of or inside clouds? Massive floating whales?

- Humans born and bred in low g would likely be very tall and skinny. They would also be physically weaker, with brittle bones and weaker muscles. Even with strength training they would likely be unable to switch to higher gravities for long.

- Humans from normal gravity coming into a lower gravity would have a massive advantage in strength, but only for a short time before experiencing heart and bone deconditioning. You lied us Edgar Rice Burroughs!

- Would life expectancy increase or decrease? And interesting question that I could not find a clear answer on, as all our limited knowledge is about microgravity, not low-G. There would be less strain on our hearts, but they might also decondition like in microgravity. Telomere lengthening has also been observed in microgravity. Would that hold true for .5G?
