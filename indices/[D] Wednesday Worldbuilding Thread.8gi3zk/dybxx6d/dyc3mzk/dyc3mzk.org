I'm pretty interested in any implications of this that are brought up.

I have a setting with magic that manipulates gravity, mostly used to create low-G fields to aid in construction and to enable the use of ridiculous flying machines.

The fact that they're only creating a field of low G (usually .3G, .2G if they're using the sophisticated stuff) diminishes the results, as the air and what have you above the field is fully affected, pushing down into the field.

The reverse is also possible in setting.

The only applications I've been allowing to work so far as far as heightening Gravity goes are:

Creating bombs to slow down and generally encumber dangerous creatures and combatants, making them vulnerable by using the earth's mass.

Testing structural integrity.

Terrorism against shoddy structures.

The combined use of density manipulation and gravity heightening.

That last one I'm not sure about. The reason I brought up the reverse is that I'm not sure how quickly conditioning would occur. I haven't been worrying about it so far. If it is a concern for low gravity, it could be an advantage to high gravity. Training under exposure to high G to improve strength and health during work and combat at regular or lower G.
