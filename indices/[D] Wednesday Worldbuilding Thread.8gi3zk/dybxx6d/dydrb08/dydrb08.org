- As for life expectancy, fucking with life conditions we were evolved to live in would reduce life expectancy. Sure Earth gravity makes our hearts work too much and our bones and tendons continuously damage themselves but unless given time to evolve or being reengineered I would say a drastic chance will fuck up too many things at once.

- What if instead of 70% N2 the atmosphere contained 70% of some much heavier gas? Xenon? This would make breathing slightly more difficult but increase the ability of things to float and fly.
