Decent question. Re the flight elements, there is an excellent XKCD on this. [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/30/]] - TLDR, go flying on Titan, it has low gravity AND a dense atmosphere, though a little chilly....

Mega fauna would be more mega. I think limits on animal scaling generally come from cube square scaling laws so stuff would be huge.
