  Humans born and bred in low g would likely be very tall and skinny. They would also be physically weaker, with brittle bones and weaker muscles

If humans evolved in low gravity, wouldn't the bone toughness and muscle strength be shaped by both the requirement to handle body weight but also to hunt or fight other animals? I can imagine brittle bones being a survival weakness and I can see the evolutionary benefit of powerful jumping (trees etc are taller, terrain navigation becomes easier, etc.).

If humans were "imported" then I'd expect all the effects you mention.
