Interesting!

I would expect humans to never evolve there but instead appearing in that world through a magical portal or something.

- You can finally have all those giant monsters that are satisfying to kill but due to low gravity they are not super strong, hence feasible to kill.

- I would like to explore a more fantasy setting, since consistent implication of a modern setting would be too difficult.

- You can finally have your justification for elves being high, slender and fragile.

- Massive floating whales are always cool. I prefer them sailing in cosmic void and bathing in the Sun photosphere, but this works too.

- The low gravity same pressure means the Pressure vary slower with change of altitude. Not sure about the temperature. More chance of mountain peaks being colonized.

- Add some helium source for exploration.

- Trees will be higher. Cities on giant pines? Like the Ewok villages?

- Maybe elves, dwarves and humans are the same species just completing last steps of evolution on 3 planets with different G?

- Would lower g mean more tunnels and caverns in the planet?
