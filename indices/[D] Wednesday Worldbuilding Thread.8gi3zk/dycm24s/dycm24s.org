Here's one idea that I'm playing with for a story, suggestions? I'm also wondering if I should add in a hard magic system to create more opportunities & interesting cultural implications or if that would complicate the setting too much.

#+begin_example
  * People live within tunnels (the bronchioles of a large aquatic mammal)
        * it usually floats around near the surface of the water (no predators)
        * The world has a high oxygen content & it is very warm
        * this helps the creature to function at such a large size

  * Survive off blood from capillaries in alveoli & any food they can get from the ecosystem on the surface/outside of animal

  * Must control population in order to prevent overexploitation of mammal
        * powerful people control the population in order to maintain sustainability - 
                *getting rid of people/communities when necessary (not common knowledge)
        * Those who control the limited resources (blood) have a lot of social power
        *  large wealth gap - people are desensitized to death of the lower class

  * people travel through the lungs using a glider of some sort -> breathing creates strong air currents

  * One can easily get accidentally swept up in a breath & brought outside
         * Going outside is dangerous & explorers from outside are well respected

Side note: I'm planning on creating it in the form of a comic. I'm an amateur artist but writing dialogue isn't my strong suit so if anyone wants to partner with me to create this, I'd be really happy. I have quite a few ideas but no concrete plans for plot at the moment so you'd have an equal part in creating the story. Anyway PM me if interested/want more info.
