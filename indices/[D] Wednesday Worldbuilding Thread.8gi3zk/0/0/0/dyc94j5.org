Huh.

If you volumetrically reduce gravity, that likely manifests in a couple of ways: - Reduced downward acceleration of things. (weight reduction) - Reduced fluid pressure

I /think/ think means that the air functionally is a low-pressure zone, which does interesting things to fluid flow. I'd naively expect air to flow in from above and the sides, into the zone, until pressure equalizes - so you'd end up with more air (by mass) in the affected volume, and the same pressure; and a brief air flow while pressure equalizes.

This may then make pushing against the air more effective: you effectively have more reaction mass.

Now - once the zone starts moving, hmm - Let's consider upwards motion. You have air at the top now subject to less gravity, resulting in it being less pressurized. You have air at the bottom leaving the affected volume, so now it's heavier (and there's more of it packed into the same volume), so now you have greater pressure. But.... that greater pressure is less able to move the air above it (more mass) compared to the sides...?

So, then consider putting airships of some kind into the picture: What if the ship is greatly contained by the changed gravity volume? What if, say, the zeppelin envelope completely contains the changed gravity volume?

There's also temperature considerations, if my conclusions about pressure are correct.

(So then also consider what happens if you cycle between high/normal/low/normal/high gravity.)
