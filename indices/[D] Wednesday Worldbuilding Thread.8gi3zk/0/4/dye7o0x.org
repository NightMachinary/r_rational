Uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but why do you expect airships to be easier?

If you keep the composition, pressure and temperature the same, then the density rho of air is the same. Now, an object as a whole experiences g* (mass - volume* rho) force. Whether this is positive (fall down), zero (float), or negative (ballon goes up) is unaffected by your local gravity g.
