The commoners do know that they live in a creature of some sort but they see it as a god rather than an animal. They don't see it as something that can be harmed by their own insignificant actions.

My original idea boils down to a commoner person discovering an unguarded blood stream, using it to gain power, and causing a revolution (redistribution of access to blood vessels). They ignore warnings about the giants health due to their religion/optimism bias and end up pushing it towards death.

No I haven't watched Gurren Lagan but I'll check it out if I have time & make sure to give the humans some chance at surviving. Of course there'll have to be other parasites, maybe I'll design an entire ecosystem :)

As for magic, I'm not quite familiar with psionics but I'll look into it. A system that relies on alchemy or something that has limited resources might be interesting however in order to add an extra effect on the society.
