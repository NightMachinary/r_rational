Do common people inside know they live in a giant animal?

- It can be a story of revolutionary rebelling old customs and then bringing an apocalypse on the community.

- Hav you watched Gurren Lagann? It is an anime where people live in caves underground and are hunted if they go to surface. Protagonist rebels and destroys the Surface king.... And then we discover WHY the king was keeping humans underground.

- I tried to read a Russian novel about meatpunk (people obtain most resources/materials from giant sea creatures) and despite good recensions I disliked it. Without magic I felt to sorry for this people having to survive in such conditions.

- As a form of magic you can use psionic the way Dark Sun did it.

- also fights with other parasites living in the giants flesh.
