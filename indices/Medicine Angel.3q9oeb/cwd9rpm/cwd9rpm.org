NURSE STABBED IN DUMMY AFFAIR

NJ. A nurse at Morris Folger Memorial Hospital was found stabbed to death this morning. Local Surgeon Dr. Peng has been arrested and has confessed to the crime. Peng was apparently overcome with rage when he encountered the nurse, J.O., in mid-coitus with the hospital's training dummy when he came in for an emergency. Security footage was made available to us showing him stabbing the nurse thirty-seven times with a surgical scalpel. Peng, who was almost incoherent, claimed that the dummy had been "his"; apparently he had been listening to its genitals for medical advice. At this moment it is unknown what drugs, if any, the well-respected surgeon was on at the time. Hospital officials have voiced disbelief and bewilderment at the grisly crime, though a staff member who asked to not be named told us she "saw it coming miles away".
