For the record, hilariously enough, those parts of the joke were unintentional.

I am not a native speaker. I just read this and went "Oh wow, that cannot possibly end well."

Unrelatedly: does anyone feel like we're getting the other half of an absurdist story here? I mean, if you read something where a surgeon consults the dick of a practice dummy for advice, would you go "clearly a teleworking medical analyst has hacked that dummy" - no, you'd assume they were hallucinating or it was a demon or something.
