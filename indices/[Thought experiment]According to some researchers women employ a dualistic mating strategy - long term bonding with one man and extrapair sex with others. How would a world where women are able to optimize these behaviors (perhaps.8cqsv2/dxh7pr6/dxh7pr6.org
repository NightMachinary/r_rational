How much effort are these powers?

That would probably be a world where men are simple laborers, whereas women just mind control them into doing what they want. If a man is getting an education, he is probably getting it in a mens only school, to stop them from being mind controlled. At a certain point it would stop seeming like "Men" and "Women" as men become worker drones to literal queen bees.
