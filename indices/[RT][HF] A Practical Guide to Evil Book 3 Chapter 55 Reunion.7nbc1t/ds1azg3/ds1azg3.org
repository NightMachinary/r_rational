Despite Black's calm and composed attitude I can't help but think Malicia was right.

He's just got dealt a serious blow and his immediate reaction is to turn the Empire into a war machine. It feels too much like a desperate move to obtain as much power as he can so that he's not beaten by an opponent he now overestimates.

Consider this - the Empire can play a lot of hands that Procer can't. It has more Named, it has greater sorcery, at least several "magical super-weapons" and it's united as a single entity rather than a collection of separate states.

It feels like even after the current civil war Praes and Callow could still match evenly with Procer, admittedly with some difficulty.
