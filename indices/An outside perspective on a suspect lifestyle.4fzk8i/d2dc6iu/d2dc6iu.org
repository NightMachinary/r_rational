Even ignoring the question of whether other things than the laptop are important, money brings flexibility, and having more money makes things cheaper (for instance, you could live in an apartment with a one year lease that amounts to less per week than your current arrangements). You also probably don't have very good medical benefits. I don't know what your college degree is in or how many marketable skills you have, but you at least need to realize that a low end fast food job is bad rather than being satisfied with it, and treat it as a problem.

Also, this is off-topic here, since the subreddit is for rational fiction.
