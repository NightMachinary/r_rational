Wow, this is really good! The most insightful post I've gotten on from this post (and all crossposts). Thanks!

In particular I really enjoyed your style, I was laughing out loud like a dozen times while reading this piece. All those references to zombie whale blood etc :)

And thanks for taking the time to think of how these magic systems could work together, it really shows that you put in a great deal of effort to do this. I hope you found it an enjoyable mental exercise as well!

  you might be able to make a death cycle of infinite sin
#+end_quote

Yep, that's expressly why I chose to have both good and evil acts empower tapestry mages. Makes for a good villain :)

  Wouldn't whaling realistically be a

For the same reason human sacrifice is done instead of elephant sacrifice, I guess.

  aside from being genderfluid and flipping every 12 hours, which also neatly avoids the psychoactive effects
#+end_quote

Lol yes that would be broken!

#+begin_quote
  Become soul mage --> find another, weaker soul mage (or one who's sleeping or something) --> consume soul, gaining better soul powers --> repeat.
#+end_quote

Yep definitely, had this in mind when creating the magic system.

#+begin_quote
  Soulist put a jumping spider soul (or something) into a human body, then steal reaction time.
#+end_quote

Now that's creative :)

#+begin_quote
  Then do so deep underground \s.
#+end_quote

Oh boy! What an exploit! You'd have thought all those xianxia authors would have thought of this point (at least, all the ones that just have heavenly tribulations and not earthly calamities)...

#+begin_quote
  What do runestones do?
#+end_quote

The ones on the summits initiate the tribulations (storms) and the small ones that get charged through the tribulations a la Stormlight are expended in spellcasting, with different arcane symbols within each rune that's associated with their effect (a la Runescape).

#+begin_quote
  So trying to exploit this is like inventing a cheap diamond-making process in D&D to provide material components for spells. The spell requires a certain stable price's worth of diamonds and the physical mass needed grows. Unless you can metagame and work out the specific way that danger is calculated...
#+end_quote

Not sure I follow this one.

#+begin_quote
  have the now-recalled heaven one summon back the expensive heavenly objects.
#+end_quote

Oh wow now that sounds right up the alley of every high fantasy rogue protagonist ever :)

#+begin_quote
  Or if Bloodism doesn't work that way, use natural gas instead.
#+end_quote

Or use thaumetic sulphite a la Path of Exile :)

#+begin_quote
  ANOTHER ludicrously powerful entity dedicated to slapping down munchkins?!?
#+end_quote

Let's see, we have the storms in the north, the sandstorms in the desert, the tribulations from heaven's will, gaia's vengeance, clearly it's not enough

#+begin_quote
  are all forms of mana and qi interchangeable?
#+end_quote

Nope. Neither is earth blood exchangeable with oil (from the real world dominion) or manalight with electricity.
