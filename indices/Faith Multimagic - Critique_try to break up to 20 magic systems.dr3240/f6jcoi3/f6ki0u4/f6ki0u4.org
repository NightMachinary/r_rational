  Are the people aware how it works?

Most people wouldn't, however all the people "at the top" are "in the know" (and it is their being at the top, i.e. ascended, that allows their belief about how the faith system works, to "realize" the faith system itself).

All the faiths are (to varying degrees) aggressive about attracting and keeping followers, defending against other faiths, attacking weaker faiths, inoculating followers from converting to other faiths, monitoring and enforcing the faith of their followers, and hunting down heretics and those who would try to convert others. (Any faith that didn't do this would go extinct.)

There's a kind of "power limit" tradeoff in each system. If a dominion had both the idea that everyone could become powerful and the idea that powerful meant nigh-omnipotent, only one of these would be realized, this is enforced by the overarching faith system. Then either the dominion changes to be one where people believe the former, or it becomes one where people believe the latter.

At any location, the dominion that wins out is the one that the locals believe (subject to things like certain individuals' faiths being overweighted). The closer the believers of a domain are to a location, the more "dominion pressure" they can exert on that location, to influence its faith.
