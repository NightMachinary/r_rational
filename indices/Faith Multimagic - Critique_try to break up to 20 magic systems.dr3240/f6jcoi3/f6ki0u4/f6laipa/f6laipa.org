So, it'd be possible to have a functioning system where everyone has trivial, easy access to it, but a relatively low power level? And would this power level scale with the population of believers, or remain fairly constant?

I feel like a system where most people have some magic would spread a lot more than one where only a few will get any and they'll get a lot, in part because the former means you'll see magic on a daily basis and you're more likely to want to continue to believe if you can do it yourself. Also, it's more conducive to armies. Although, depending on the upper limit of power, small numbers of royalty/mages could be just as effective as an army in a more concentrated system.
