The descriptions are vague and need quantification to make this easier. That said:

*Tapestrism:* Depending on how karma works, you might be able to make a death cycle of infinite sin, like in the end of The Study of Anglophysics. E.g. go to an orphanage, collapse a floor with your telekinetic powers, get karma for the dead orphans, repeat, move on to next building, repeat until leveling cities...

*Bloodism:* Wouldn't whaling realistically be a higher-volume, cheaper, easier, and less-likely-to-lethally-backfire source of blood than international kidnapping?

*Dreamism:* Vague as heck, but lucid dreams are probably the easiest way to hack this regardless of the specifics.

*Yin-Yang (typo???) -ism:* Again, way too vague. Provide a spell list or something and it might be possible to find exploits (aside from being genderfluid and flipping every 12 hours, which also neatly avoids the psychoactive effects).

*Blasphemism:* Again, demonic reality warping is too vague. Tapestrism synergy?

*Evocationism:*

#+begin_quote
  Evocation can also be used for affinity with people in order to manipulate them, sense their thoughts and emotions etc,
#+end_quote

Blasphemism synergy.

#+begin_quote
  People can use spirit stones to try to accelerate the rate at which they absorb qi. However this is forcefully over charging a person's natural capacity and is thus very unnatural, and can hamper a person's ability to attune with nature.
#+end_quote

So find a way to transfer qi from person to person, maybe? Or would that run into the same problem?

*Namism:* I hereby name Namism! Jokes aside, obvious Blasphemism synergy. The description is pretty vague, but it sounds like a straightforward way to power e.g. a factory or ship.

#+begin_quote
  The true name sounds to everyone to be simply the common name of the thing, one can never hear the true name being spoken or written, this makes it impossible to know a true name without proper attainment.
#+end_quote

Break with Dreamism or Evocationism?

*Soulism:* Gender reassignment, selling youth/beauty, have a minion possess a whale and keep it in one location so you can periodically drain some of its blood for sale to the Bloodists. Put the whale soul in the minion's body when it isn't in use.

#+begin_quote
  the soul mage can consume their soul, adding their paths to the soul mage's own.
#+end_quote

Become soul mage --> find another, weaker soul mage (or one who's sleeping or something) --> consume soul, gaining better soul powers --> repeat.

*Attributism:* Have a Soulist put a jumping spider soul (or something) into a human body, then steal reaction time. Same thing for sperm whales and total mental computation rate, octopus and focus, etc. Become a superhuman intelligence.

#+begin_quote
  pull information right out of their subjects' minds,
#+end_quote

NAMISM SYNERGY!!!!!!!

#+begin_quote
  Mages may even be able to draw out and steal an enemy mage's magical power and mana in this manner.
#+end_quote

First Soulism, now this...

*Sandism:* Mage powers too vague.

#+begin_quote
  Adventurers who happen upon the uncovered ruins explore the uncovered desert ruins within this narrow span of time, oftentimes having to fight against the mummified or desiccated, skeletal remains of the living dead within these ruins,
#+end_quote

Obvious immortality route for power-stealing disciplines.

*Faeralism:* Okay, but in terms of /specific/ powers? At any rate, soul-swapping faera with something easy to feed might be useful.

*Elementalism:* Again, not really sure what this /does/.

#+begin_quote
  This excess provokes heavenly tribulation from heaven's will,
#+end_quote

Then do so deep underground \s.

*Nobleism:* Does the Spirit of the World object to Powergaming? At any rate, more houses' powers would be useful.

#+begin_quote
  Related imperial powers include seduction, mental influence via whispering, and *awaking the dead.*
#+end_quote

Steampunk industrial necromany! Skeletal horses turning wheels as power sources! Undead whales producing more economically important whale blood without needing to be fed!

*Runism:* What do runestones do?

#+begin_quote
  The northern side of the Spire is permanently enveloped in the Mist Wall and the Spire is believed to hold up the Roof of the World.
#+end_quote

Cool! Let's have our Bloodists burn twenty kilotons of zombie whale cruour and blow up the base in order to cause Doomsday!

#+begin_quote
  Those caught in such a storm can be left trapped and frozen in blocks of pure ice for all time.
#+end_quote

Cryonics!

#+begin_quote
  the more dangerous the climb, and the more powerful the runes granted
#+end_quote

So trying to exploit this is like inventing a cheap diamond-making process in D&D to provide material components for spells. The spell requires a certain stable price's worth of diamonds and the physical mass needed grows. Unless you can metagame and work out the specific way that danger is calculated...

*Prayerism:* Kinda antitheist. Anyways, get Tapestrists to connect themselves with those who will probably go to hell in order to summon them back. Better yet, pray a Tapestrist connected to another Tapestrist into heaven, have the heaven Tapestrist entangle with various expensive heavenly objects, have the ground Tapestrist recall the heaven one, and have the now-recalled heaven one summon back the expensive heavenly objects.

*Manacitism:*

#+begin_quote
  Over time and as they are used, the gems lose their light, which limits how long and how deep an expedition can delve. Expeditions have to keep this in mind as if they use up all their light sources while still delving, they're doomed.
#+end_quote

A lot of the other magical traditions have ways of generating lots of light. If I was the Sentai lord, then I'd establish a pipeline of zombie whale blood running from the surface to the deepest depths of the underground, allowing Bloodism-illuminated fortified outposts where lighting supplies are exchanged. Or if Bloodism doesn't work that way, use natural gas instead.

*Channelism:*

#+begin_quote
  The presence of qi in various places influences the kind and quantity of wildlife present there, and makes certain kinds of magic more powerful and others less powerful.
#+end_quote

Channelstan: where the whales are numerous and engorged with blood and the Bloodists function at high efficiency. The effect can get arbitrarily high if any of various immortality methods are employed. Probably also synergistic with Faeralism.

*Traceism:* Nothing stands out, too vague.

*Sigilism:* Way too vague.

*Spiritism:*

#+begin_quote
  Their elven ears allow them to understand the language of beasts and critters
#+end_quote

SNAKES ARE SENTIENT?!? (c.f. HPMOR when Harry learns of Parseltongue)

#+begin_quote
  Some elves are able to cause creatures to morph into other forms (eg. Tougher and more dangerous forms), or to animate plants, cause roots to burst forth from the ground, etc.
#+end_quote

The zombie whale blood thickens. Same industrial power from plant manipulation as with necromancy. Expedited construction?

#+begin_quote
  The elves believe themselves to be the children of Gaia, Mother Nature, and that the spirits have minds of their own, and that sufficient disruption of nature will cause the wrath of the spirits, causing roiling elemental storms and Awakening earth.
#+end_quote

ANOTHER ludicrously powerful entity dedicated to slapping down munchkins?!? I wonder how many Imperials one would need to control the mind of the Earth herself...

Oh, and are all forms of mana and qi interchangeable? Because if so, things get easier to manipulate.
