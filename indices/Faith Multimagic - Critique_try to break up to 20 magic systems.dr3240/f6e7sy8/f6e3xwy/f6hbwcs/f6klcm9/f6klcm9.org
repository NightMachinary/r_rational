  You should end up seeing central power groups propogating new versions of a belief to change the way their magic works

One of the things I didn't go into much detail in this post is that one can't intentionally go about changing one's beliefs to try to manipulate reality. Their knowledge that they're making it up would counteract it.

  You might see more gradual gradients between systems akin to something like the romance languages? Your 20 totally different systems doesn't seem like a very likely outcome?

I do want to have geographically close dominions have similar philosophies. Hence the 4 orientalist dominions are close to each other, as they share ideas like qi, Faeralism being close to Sigilism being close to Traceism, Dreamism being on its own, etc. I don't want there to be too many dominions since when writing a story in this setting I want each dominion to feel distinct, and having too many can get too difficult for readers to follow ("which sect of which dominion are we in again?").

  How did these systems first arise?
#+end_quote

These arose spontaneously through people having certain beliefs due to random chance (praying to a storm god and there happening to be peaceful skies that day causing them to strengthen their belief in a storm god) and then the beliefs getting more complicated as more sub-beliefs get tacked on. I call it "fortufaction". There's also "manufaction" where someone consciously creates a new faith (but for this new belief to have actual magical power, that can only happen once the founder has died). Manufaction requires careful setup and some luck because if you as the founder claim that act X causes magic Y and your followers try it before you're dead, it'll fail and they will cease to belief that claim.
