  Does seeing a magician from a rival sect perform magic make someone switch their allegiance?
#+end_quote

Where? Would a visiting magician's magic even work in your dominion? If you're visiting their dominion, you'd see everyone doing it, so you might believe in it, while also believing in your home style of magic, thus weakening that dominion.

A viable tactic would be just sending a significant fraction of your population to another dominion to dilute the belief there.
