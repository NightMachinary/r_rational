  You might see more gradual gradients between systems akin to something like the romance languages? Your 20 totally different systems doesn't seem like a very likely outcome?

If the meta-mechanics of faith tended towards discrete states, the distinct border might make since. Still, I like your idea, and I imagine even if the faith magic doesn't quite work right at borders, discrete border are a modern construct, so there has to be a few edge cases were the magic has blended over just a little. Working against this, I imagine the ruling powers find the irregular combinations of magic at borders to be politically unreliable, and thus go out of their way to suppress them or invent tales and legends that work against them. Going through the map and looking at a few the borders:

Blasphemism/Soulism: Demons near the border have sought to capture the souls of their thralls so that they may serve as tools even in death. The Tyrian Barrows are very fortunate that border magic is so much weaker... it takes Blasphemies to make the Soul magic gain any real measure of power, and demons of sufficient rank are rare near the border. Conversely, Soul mages have experimented with using their power on minor demons, but the results are unstable compared to conventional usage of disembodied souls. The most twisted soul mages, spoken of in hushed whispers, are rumored to have succeeded in consuming demon souls and adding blasphemy magic to their arsenal. A few heretical Souls mages have made a study of how oaths can bind souls.

Noblism/Blasphemism: There are several barren island between Avalon and Tyria. It is rumored that in this place there was once a noble house that could command even major demons through their specialty. The stories differ on how they met their end. Some claim they abused their power, causing them to lose it at the most essential moment and set lose horrible demons. Others claim that the Emperor used his power to destroy them for the threat they posed. Some foreign scholars believe these tales are mutually agreeable propaganda. The emperor's command may grow weaker at these isles, inclining emperors not to allow nobles to settle them, and the oath and vows of Tyria grow unreliable on these isles, motivating Tyrians to avoid them. It is speculated by some in Tyria that the Emperor of Avalon has a secret enclave of demon summoners working to put greater demons under his command, but given that not even minor demons can be summoned in central Avalon, these stories are dismissed as rumors.

Prayerism/Noblism. A few Nobles along the border have occasionally tried to convince their servants and tenants to engage in prayer to them. However, the boost from the prayer is barely noticeable, even at the border itself. Conversely, Dominei has propagated stories that the power of nobility to the north is the result of misplaced faith resulting in weaker, impurer, power. These stories have worked to a minor extent: In wars between these two realms, Dominei has occasionally allowed the acclaim of the conquered/occupied peasantry to work as a temporary hybrid of prayerism and noblism, but in the long term they favor fully suppressing the old system.
