This setting would lend itself to motivated belief and schisms within each belief. You should end up seeing central power groups propogating new versions of a belief to change the way their magic works and you should see magic systems changing and working differently within a single dominion. You might see more gradual gradients between systems akin to something like the romance languages? Your 20 totally different systems doesn't seem like a very likely outcome?

How did these systems first arise? Was there originally no magic and these were the original religious beliefs of each country then yeah something like this could happen. Does seeing a magician from a rival sect perform magic make someone switch their allegiance? Obviously they would "believe" in what they just saw with their own eyes
