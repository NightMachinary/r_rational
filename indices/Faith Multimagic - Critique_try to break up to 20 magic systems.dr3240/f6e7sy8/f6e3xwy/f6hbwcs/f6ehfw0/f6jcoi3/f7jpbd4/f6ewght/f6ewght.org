I was thinking about something similar recently (magic being created by beliefs and bound to areas where those beliefs are held in mass) and I encountered a weird potential problem. Basically, can a dominion's magic only be accessed within the specific dominion? What if two dominions are waring, does the one on offense basically lose their ability to use magic once they get into the other dominion? This seems to me like it would have a huge impact on how war is conducted and probably result in a focus on non-magical weaponry and/or isolationist policies.
