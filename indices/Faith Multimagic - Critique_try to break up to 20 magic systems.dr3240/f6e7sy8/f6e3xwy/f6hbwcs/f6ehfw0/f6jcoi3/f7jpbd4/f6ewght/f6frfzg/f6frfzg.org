Not OP, but how viable is the line of reasoning that enemy combatant's belief in the magic sustains its effect? What's the population density threshold for making magic work? Because I think there's cool stuff you could do with that.

As an army starts dying, the magic starts weakening as there are fewer and fewer soldiers to sustain it? Ooh, or a side that weaponizes non-believers. People raised in isolation, with no idea other non-regional magic exists, and buffing out the army with them to dilute the enemy's power.
