  Most people wouldn't, however all the people "at the top" are "in the know"

This feels inconsistent. As your comment [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dr3240/faith_multimagic_critiquetry_to_break_up_to_20/f6ksaor/][here]] implies, anyone with a knowledge of inter-faith warfare would be well aware that the power of a magic system is largely dependent on the number of similarly-talented mages present, rather than intrinsically tied to location. Assuming that at least some people who engage in such warfare survive and interact with civilians afterward, this should be fairly common knowledge.

  All the faiths are (to varying degrees) aggressive about attracting and keeping followers, defending against other faiths, attacking weaker faiths, inoculating followers from converting to other faiths, monitoring and enforcing the faith of their followers, and hunting down heretics and those who would try to convert others. (Any faith that didn't do this would go extinct.)

The paradox contained in this worldbuilding is that if reality changes to conform to faith, then once reality has conformed, /it no longer requires faith by definition./

What does it mean to "convert" to a "faith" that believes exactly what reality presents? Any mage of any system can prove to a non-mage that their "faith" is real and correct, as long as they're in their dominion, so the farthest anyone could reasonably go toward "disbelief" is thinking that a system's strength is linked to the location of the user (which is still at least partially correct).

The kind of militant policing you describe would be pointless, because everyone would already "believe" in every magic system they'd witnessed, and non-mages would simply not believe themselves capable of performing magic themselves.
