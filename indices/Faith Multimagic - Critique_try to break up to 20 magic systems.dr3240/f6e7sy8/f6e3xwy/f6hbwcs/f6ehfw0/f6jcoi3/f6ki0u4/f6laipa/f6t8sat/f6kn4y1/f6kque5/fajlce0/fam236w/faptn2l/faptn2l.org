"His disbelief derogates the beliefs of all the followers because he knows that their beliefs are all based on delusion (since he made it up)."

Doesn't that mean that you can shut down an opposing magic system by convincing someone that the opposing domain is just faking it? Your dupe will 'know' that the opposing system is based on delusion too after all. What makes the beliefs of the founder more important than the random dupe? Is it because the belief of everyone else is resting on the founder? I.e. the followers belief in magic is tied up with their beliefs about the founder, which makes the effects of the founders belief much more powerful?
