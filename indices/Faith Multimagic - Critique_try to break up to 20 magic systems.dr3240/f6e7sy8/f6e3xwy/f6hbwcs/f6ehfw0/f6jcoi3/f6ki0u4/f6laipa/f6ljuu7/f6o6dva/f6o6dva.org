  So, it'd be possible to have a functioning system where everyone has trivial, easy access to it, but a relatively low power level?
#+end_quote

Yes, but such a dominion would get wiped out because of the lack of concentration of power. The idea is, in a contest between 1 mage with power 1000 and 1000 mages with power 1, the 1000 mages would have little choice but to surrender due their lack of ability to fully bring their power to bear at the right location and their lack of coordination.

  And would this power level scale with the population of believers, or remain fairly constant?
#+end_quote

Average power level per person wouldn't scale with the number of followers of the dominion (for balance purposes).

  you're more likely to want to continue to believe if you can do it yourself

It doesn't have to do with how much you want to believe it but whether you believe it.
