  why does the one guy outweigh the million? Does the universe keep track of who started the idea?

His disbelief derogates the beliefs of all the followers because he knows that their beliefs are all based on delusion (since he made it up).

  but surely he still believes that it can do what he says it will (as long as he has enough followers). If he did not believe that, why go to the trouble of creating the new system/religion?
#+end_quote

To create a legacy. It could be that only his children will know about the magic system he creates, that would give them an advantage. Also it could be for benefits other than the magic system (like cult leaders in the real world, who can claim to have magical powers and benefit from making that claim even though the magic never manifests).

The workaround you posit is basically how most of the founders get it to work, in my system, so kudos for having gotten that one :)
