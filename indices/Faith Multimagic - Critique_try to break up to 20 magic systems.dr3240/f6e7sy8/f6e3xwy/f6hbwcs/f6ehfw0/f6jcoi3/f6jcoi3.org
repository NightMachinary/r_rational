Are the people aware how it works?

If so - religions/mages would bribe people to become followers, and the system that gives the most benefits to most people would monopolize the continent.

"Have you heard of omnipotentism? Everybody is omnipotent. Just sign here and enjoy! *small restrictions may apply"

Also - what is the cutoff point? I know you wrote about flexible borders, but you need a cutoff for how many people-beliefs create a domain and how many doesn't. If there's no cutoff and you only have linear combination of people and their belief - the whole world should be 1 big domain, or everybody should be their separate domain, anything in between needs some kind of granulization in the system (cut off or special kind of sampling).
