  So what makes someone a Xian? Is it a rare phenotype or can you train to become a Xian?
#+end_quote

Xian / ascended is about having had such a major accomplishment /relative to your power/ that it's as if you are above the masses. It is in a sense, a sense of self power and self assertion that is founded in one's achievements, by justifies being "full of oneself" so much that one's faith becomes able to break the rules. Repeated outsized accomplishments of this nature result in further extent of ascension allowing for breaking the rules to a greater and greater extent, and allows for one's out-of-dominion magic to become more potent and for the reach of one's out-of-dominion magic to become extended.

  I don't think you should just assume what they would or wouldn't want to do.

Hmm, very good point!

  If there are 500 Xian and only 40 territories,
#+end_quote

I was thinking some of the dominions may have a number of governments, and there would only be a few dozen ascended throughout the setting (and only a few who can use magic out-of-dominion to any substantive extent), and will generally be in charge of the larger governments, meaning most territories wouldn't have any xian at all.

  Very cool. So what do you plan to do with this world?
#+end_quote

Thanks :) I am in the process of brainstorming plot threads for a story I want to tell using this setting.
