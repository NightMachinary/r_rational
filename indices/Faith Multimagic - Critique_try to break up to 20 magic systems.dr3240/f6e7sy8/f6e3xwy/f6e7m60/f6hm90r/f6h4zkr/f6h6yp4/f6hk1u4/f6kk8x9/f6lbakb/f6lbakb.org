Interesting. In real life, the most powerful tend to centralize authority among themselves, forming an elite that rules over the weaker around them. It sounds like the Xian would be able to dominate all non-Xian and thus would subjugate them, but this depends on their tiering levels and power scaling which you may not have fully created.

Either way, I look forward to what comes of your work :)
