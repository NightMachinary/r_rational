  How long in a system like this would it take for the Xian to just prove to everyone that all forms of magic are possible

They already know it's possible to do other dominions' magic... for either xian to do it, or people to do it in their own dominions. Xian doing out-of-dominion magic doesn't mean everyone else can then do out-of-dominion magic. The xian are the only ones able to use out-of-dominion magic.

  at least congregate in one land performing all kinds of magic and ruling over the natives who perform fewer kinds of magic?

Hmm very good point! I'm thinking it stands to reason that they would rather prefer to each take over a territory for themselves (since these are all people of great ability to pull off great accomplishments, even with their magic aside). They probably wouldn't need to work together, but totally could if they wanted to.

  Do you have a base description for how magic actually works throughout the entire land that accounts for the behaviors of each of the magic systems?

Did you mean like how the faith system works in general? If so, [[https://conworld.fandom.com/wiki/Faith][link here]].
