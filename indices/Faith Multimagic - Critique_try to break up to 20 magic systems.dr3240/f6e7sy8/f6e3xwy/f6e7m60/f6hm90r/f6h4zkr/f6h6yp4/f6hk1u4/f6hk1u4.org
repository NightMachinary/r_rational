  They already know it's possible to do other dominions' magic... for either xian to do it, or people to do it in their own dominions. Xian doing out-of-dominion magic doesn't mean everyone else can then do out-of-dominion magic. The xian are the only ones able to use out-of-dominion magic.

So what makes someone a Xian? Is it a rare phenotype or can you train to become a Xian?

  Hmm very good point! I'm thinking it stands to reason that they would rather prefer to each take over a territory for themselves (since these are all people of great ability to pull off great accomplishments, even with their magic aside). They probably wouldn't need to work together, but totally could if they wanted to.

I don't think you should just assume what they would or wouldn't want to do. They may be Xian but they each have their own desires and power levels. If there are 500 Xian and only 40 territories, they will need to compete with each other for territories which implies working together or building armies.

  Did you mean like how the faith system works in general? If so, [[https://conworld.fandom.com/wiki/Faith][link here]].

Very cool. So what do you plan to do with this world?
