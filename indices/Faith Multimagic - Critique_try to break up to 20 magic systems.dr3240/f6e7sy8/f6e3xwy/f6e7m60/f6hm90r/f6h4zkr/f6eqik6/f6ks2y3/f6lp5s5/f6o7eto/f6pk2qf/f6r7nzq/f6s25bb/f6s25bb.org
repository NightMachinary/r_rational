  Are you just sticking to two categories of magic then (there's only structural and invocation)?
#+end_quote

I worded myself poorly. Those two are what one would come up with if you somehow decided to categorize all magic under only two definitions. It's basically a scholarly concept, not something a mage would actually be familiar with (maybe on a subconscious level). There's a ridiculous amount of variation between them. One of the main themes of the "Indent" (the known world sits in the eye socket of a long dead god floating through space. Mana is dense enough here that a variety of life formed) is just... magnitude. I wanted it be so large that it wandered into "bad idea" territory.

So I looked through my wordbuilding doc for a few magics that go under structural, nad picked the first three.

Battery magic - structural - 2 primary steps. The first step is shaping and enchanting the chosen material, usually mana dense gems. Certain shapes leak mana faster, giving the battery a far lower shelf time. Once it's been properly shaped through either alteration, transfiguration, or with physical tools, one can "seal" it with en enchantment. Usually, you reserve a part of the gem, approximately 10.-15% (known as Matthews cut) to seal itself.

The next step is bridging. You need a channel in order to efficiently charge and retrieve the energy. If time is not an important facter (e.g. not combat oriented), this part of the process needs only focus on % return (making sure as little mana is lost in transition as possible). Otherwise; return%, speed, nature (having foreign mana pumped into you can be painful. Mana that is outside of your body slowly loses your "nature". A part of you, be it an image or a perception, needs to be embedded into the bridge (or better, the actual gem) in order for the mana not to hurt and harm you when received). The bridge can be written into the gem, but more commonly onto whatever is holding the game, like a bracelet or necklace. The gem needs to be in contact with the skin (unless you somehow have convinced yourself it doesn't. In that case, it doesn't. This is perception. A personal image that shapes your thoughts, and by extension, the world around. Extremely hard to do.

This is an example of a magic that is largely structural (the more I use this word the more I feels like it limits me, but w/e), but also has minor invocative elements. Namely the sealing enchantment and embedded image. Perceptions are more structural, but I don't have time to go into that.

Tome magic - structural - amount of steps vary.

Tome magic is transferring a spell to some other portable medium. There's a lot of ways to do this (with varying efficiency). You have to pay the spell cost twice, once when making and once when releasing, but it can make semi-complicated rituals usable on the fly, and allow unexperience mages the ability to wield some serious firepower as long as they have enough of a reservoir to activate the spell. Some other small restrictions apply.

Think of it like writing the spell "code" down on parchment. Word-based magic (inscription, tattoo magic, engraving, language magic) are a prime example of structural magic. Every spell is like a puzzle of the right inputs. Extremely flexible, but hard to learn and often requires either a strong image or powerful personal perception.

If you want two examples of Invocative magic

1. Loaning. Become increasingly adept at something temporarily, at the cost of other skills decreasing temporarily when it's over. Can be temporary.

Invocation magic doesn't require a God, just an image or perception. In loanings case, it's not something you can learn unless you were raised with the knowledge that it's both possible and learnable. It's such a weird abstract skill that most people would subconsciously disregard it. It has no structural merit, basically. In this case, you're basically giving your mana to the overarching image .

1. Kindling. The ritual burning of materials for either mana or effects.

Straightforward. Hard to learn, since no item has a guaranteed effect. The item only changed rules certain effects out, and alters the likelyhood of the remaining ones. Kindling is term for all types of item-based sacrifice, but it's different depending on image. The Hossian priests have different kindling rituals and effects than f.ex. the Nuhru shamans.

Sorry if this is all a bit unorganized. I just copy pasted most of it from my docx.
