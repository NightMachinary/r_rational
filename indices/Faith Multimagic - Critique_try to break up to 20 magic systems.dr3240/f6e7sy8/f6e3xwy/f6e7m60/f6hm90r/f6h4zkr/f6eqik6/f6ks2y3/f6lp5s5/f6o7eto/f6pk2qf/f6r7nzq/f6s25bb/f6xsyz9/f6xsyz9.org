Ah, that's really good! So there's actually a wide variety of magics - really like how I have it in my system! And you've been writing down the specific magic systems, nice! The battery one seems very developed - are all your other magic systems similarly well-developed? Curious how many you've come up with thus far and what kinds of issues you've had to contend with, e.g. magic systems not fitting / being to similar to each other or whatnot.
