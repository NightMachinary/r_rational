  They probably wouldn't need to work together, but totally could if they wanted to.

Be wary of creating inherent races to the bottom. If there are solid reasons for them to work together (mostly, to beat smaller groups) and the reasons not to amount to "meh rather not", over time the larger groups will win out.

In a similar situation as you at one point I posited the reason large groups didn't form was that violent internal conflicts caused by psychological instability took too harsh a toll on numbers beyond N=7-10 or so.
