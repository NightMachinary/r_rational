Sure, boiled down it's about the image or associations tied to certain geographical locations. As nations culture, heritage and norms progress, it will naturally sharpen into a sort of "background" for that location. F.ex, if a country is set around an active volcano, and that volcano appears in their rituals or beliefs, maybe in the form of fire, that country will have a sort link to their "image" (being associations, mostly) of fire. People who travel to that country will find that images that resonate with that underlying image will progress faster. A fire mage might travel to a country with a powerful image of fire in order to more quickly progress his skills. Likewise, images that stand in direct opposition will be weakened. Water being the most obvious, but also elements that stand in opposition to the associations of fire. Fire is wild, passionate, uncontrollable. A script mage might find his purely analytical approach to mysticality weakened.

It all ties into a bigger picture of actions being limited by belief and thought. A person with an extremely potent personal image is capable of overriding any underlying associations. "True" belief, be it either that you are capable of something, or that someone else is incapable of something, has a real physical effect on the world.

It's hard to put into words, since this part of the universe has always been a bit... flexible? Hope I was able to express myself correctly.
