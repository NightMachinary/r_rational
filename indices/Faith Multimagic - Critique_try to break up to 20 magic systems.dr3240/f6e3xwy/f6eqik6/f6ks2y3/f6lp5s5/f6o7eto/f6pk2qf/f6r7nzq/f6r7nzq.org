Cool! Are you just sticking to two categories of magic then (there's only structural and invocation)? Why those two - it seems there's a lot of design space you're forgoing.

Does all the structural magic work essentially the same way (ie. one magic system) or is there a great variety? If the latter, can you give like 2-3 examples of different versions of structural magic?
