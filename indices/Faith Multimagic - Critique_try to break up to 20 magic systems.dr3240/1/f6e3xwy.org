Hello fellow rationalists!

Faith system is a setting I've been working on for several years now. The basic idea is that reality in a given location is dictated by pervasive beliefs of sentient minds in that location, so you end up with a world where people in different regions hold different beliefs, and thus their region - called a dominion - and their region's magic system, politics, ethnicity, and culture all reflect that. Here I present twenty magic systems, each in their own region, each subordinate to the overall faith system, and a detailed description of what the magic system is like in each dominion.

I'm looking for ways each of the dominions' magic systems can best be exploited / made to be broken by some mage in the setting that knows what they're doing and can think rationally about their situation; or if you have any critiques in general. Thanks!
