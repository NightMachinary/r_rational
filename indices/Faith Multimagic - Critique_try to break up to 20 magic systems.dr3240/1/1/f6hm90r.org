I understand your meaning, but I'm going to put a nickel in the pedant jar and suggest that /sapient/ is the word you want, not /sentient/, unless the wildlife has an impact on the local magic somehow. See [[https://grammarist.com/usage/sentience-vs-sapience/]] for a reliable-looking Google result explaining the difference.
