  various kingdoms / regions having distinctive combinations of images and thus each kingdom / region gets to use certain kinds of magic

I thought about this as well. Border cities often have some unique or weird combinations of images, as well as travel hubs, like large port cities or capitals with a competent travel network.

Depending on the obscurity or complexity of the magic, you might absolutely need to travel. Certain plane magic needs to be done in a place where the borders to that specific plane are thin, ergo in a location with deep ties to that plane.

  So a guy with a potent personal image of the nature of fire could conjure up holy bluish-white fire (or holy golden fire or holy silver fire) instead of the regular orange-yellow fire? And his fire might burn hotter, or only hurt enemies, etc?

All of this is possible, but it's not that restrictive. There are two "main" categories of magic, which are structural and invocation (a lot of magic doesn't fit either of thise, or straddle the line, but when you have a world with hundreds of billions of people and nigh infinite varieties of magic you can never perfectly categorize). Structural would almost be like coding. You're making the spell yourself. It requires a grounded approach. It involves a lot of steps and requires a lot of practice, but the building blocks are similar for a lot of magic. Like engineering. Invocation would be a sort of prayer. You're communing with someone or something, in this case, most likely a native god of fire. You offer something, usually mana, in exchange for it creating a fireball for you.

So in your examples, the alterations to the fire would be far easier to achieve with invocation. Making fire not hurt allies, or change it's properties to something holy is... vague. Now temperature, that's easier to achieve with structural magic. Structural magic almost has adjustable levers for things like size, speed, temperature and the like (the price steepens, naturally, as you increase them).

What I'm trying to say basically is

1. Certain magics are more heavily affected by latent images than others, and

2. Yes, a mage with f.ex. ties to the church could absolutely still produce holy flames in our aforementioned volcanic area. He probably wouldn't even be restricted, as holy fire is close enough to general fire for it not to be a problem. It would be restricted however, if this volcanic region has a specific god of fire. The priests prayers would have to "travel" further, and go through the native god. If that makes sense.
