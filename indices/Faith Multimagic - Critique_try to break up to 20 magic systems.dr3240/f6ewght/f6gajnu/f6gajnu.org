Interesting to hear how you chose to resolve this question in your setting!

I want my setting to have several things, which inform how I chose to resolve this question: 1) select (POV) individuals being able to use the magic they'd mastered in one dominion, in the next dominion they visit, giving continuity to their powers and showing clear progression as well as the ability to synergize multiple kinds of magic, plus being able to awe / surprise everyone else in the dominion who had come to expect only their own kind of magic; and 2) inter-dominion mass battles featuring different magic from each side (think Illwinter's Dominions or Total War Warhammer II); and 3) mages going too deep into enemy dominion finding their magic (without sufficient faith support) no longer works, and potentially getting routed.
