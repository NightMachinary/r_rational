Ah interesting, I hadn't really had lucid dreams before and didn't think about this aspect. Well in the dominion I had set forth, basically very, very few people can do any of 1) choose which dreams to go into, 2) influence a dream other than their avatar, 3) push other people into dreams or pull them out, 4) complete a dream's "quest" and thus gain magical powers from the dream.
