  anyone with a knowledge of inter-faith warfare would be well aware that the power of a magic system is largely dependent on the number of similarly-talented mages present, rather than intrinsically tied to location.

Ah, very good point! Seems that everyone would be aware of how the belief system works.

  once reality has conformed, it no longer requires faith by definition.
#+end_quote

However, it requires that the peoples' faith doesn't change again, if it did then the reality shifts. People can be misled in their beliefs and if it hits critical mass, or some very powerful people (the ascended) start believing something different, then things change. This is in a sense like having a kingdom - once the kingdom is established, it doesn't need active supporters because it can force people to act like they support it, but if despite that, enough people revolt against it, the kingdom can be overthrown.

A lot of what you mention here are problems I've had to contend with for a while now, without any really good solutions. What would you suggest would be a good fix?

Thanks for the insight!
