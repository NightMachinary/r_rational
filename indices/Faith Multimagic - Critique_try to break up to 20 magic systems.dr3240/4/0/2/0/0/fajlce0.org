Why does the founder have to die? If you have one guy who knows it is all made up, and a million people that 'know' it is real, why does the one guy outweigh the million? Does the universe keep track of who started the idea?

Also, the founder may know it is an invented system, but surely he still believes that it can do what he says it will (as long as he has enough followers). If he did not believe that, why go to the trouble of creating the new system/religion?

In any case, it seems like there is a possible workaround for a founder that wishes to give himself time to gather followers without risking that someone will attempt to use the new magic before it will actually work and disprove it before it can start. Rather than saying that the founder has discovered a new magic, the founder 'prophesies' that on a particular day a new magic will enter the world. When the day arrives, as long as there are enough believers, the magic will spring into existence. Ideally, the appearance of the new magic would be accompanied by a big sign everyone can see. If you can predict a comet or eclipse or something beforehand, that would ideal, but is probably uneccessary, since the belief that the sign will occur should be enough to cause it to occur. In fact, if it really is necessary that the founder be dead for the magic to start, the founder could prophesy his own resurrection as a way to get around that.
