No concrete evidence. Just a feeling from the way the younger Silverlake reacted. If I had to in my past fight a copy of myself that I created, and I had won, then that's not such a scary prospect. I would be more careful about it next time, but I wouldn't exclude the possibility that I might need to do it again.

But if I were a copy that was created by someone, and I had to fight them for my survival, then I would never make another copy of myself again. Because that's an existential threat. They will come after me and they may very well succeed.
