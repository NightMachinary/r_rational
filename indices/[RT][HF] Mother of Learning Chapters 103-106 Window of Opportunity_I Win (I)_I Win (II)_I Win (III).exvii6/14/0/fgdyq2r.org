I've read it as the cloned Silverlake actually succeeded at killing the original. If you had to fight a clone of yourself before and won then that's not very scary. You'd be prepared for it next time. But if you're a clone of someone and had to kill them to survive, then yeah, you'd never clone yourself for fear of it happening to you next.
