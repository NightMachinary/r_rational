The latest MoLU post plus the last few chapters leave me thinking that soul magic is hands down the highest peak of magic that isn't divine (and that might also be soul magic v2, from mentions in story). And angels/demons use it every second of their lives, apparently, and are skilled in a way humans can't be because of that, way beyond even the aranae mind magic/human telepath difference. Even QI wants nothing to do with that class of critter if he hasn't performed absurd amounts of prepwork beforehand.

The angel mangled something that nearly accidentallied Zorian because he looked at it while still fighting everything else. I'd guess that it could probably do to Oganj what the demon nearly did to Zorian if it wasn't so brutalised, and just as casually.
