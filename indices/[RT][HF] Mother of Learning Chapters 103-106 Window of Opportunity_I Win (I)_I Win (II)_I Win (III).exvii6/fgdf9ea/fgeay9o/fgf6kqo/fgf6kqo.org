I'd say they only care about the letter of the law, since they let zach live when he only BELIEVED nobody alive knew about the time loop.

Also, was literally nobody on the enemy side told about it? That would seem like a great time bomb for red robe to leave behind. Inform a bunch of innocents/ co conspirators Scott th time loop and let zach know about it so he can't get out of the contract.
