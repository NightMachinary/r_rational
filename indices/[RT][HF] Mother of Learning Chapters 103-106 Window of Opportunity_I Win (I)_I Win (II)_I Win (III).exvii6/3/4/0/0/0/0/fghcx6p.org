If he refused to give any details of those claimed people, it might not count for the purposes of Zach's contract.

Consider: the contract gives him strong impulses to fulfil it, such as when it compelled him to do self-checks and try to detect any mental control. If he knew of specific people who were claimed to have time loop knowledge, then it could drive him to check on them. But without any such details, there's nothing to compel. And if there's nothing that the contract is compelling him to do, I'd expect that it's not in a failure mode either. Unspecified and unproven claims by a hostile party are probably not enough to make the contract kill him.
