I'd say that in that case they cared about the spirit of the law, since Zach didn't exactly tell Red Robe and co about the time loop outside of it.

Red Robe could just tell everyone possible about the time loop and paint a giant target on his back, but since he also came from the loop that would be sabotaging himself as well. He is planning for success as well rather than assuming defeat. He doesn't really want a collective of people thinking he's crazy.

Some quotes that support my take on angels:

“[Angels] care about the ideals they are supposed to embody and the duty they have to the angelic hierarchy on a deep, instinctual level that humans would find next to impossible to grasp. As far as the angels are concerned, humans and other material beings are severely lacking in dedication, thoughtfulness, and selflessness.”

“Angels definitely try to live up to their virtues. It's not just a matter of them being forced to behave as they do by divine restrictions.”

“...a ruthless and methodical angel would be far more concerned about not crossing certain invisible lines than a human, who would see laws and ethical restrictions that get in the way of their ‘utility maximization' as annoying and onerous, and try to weasel out of them in any way they can.”
