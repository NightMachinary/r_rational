If Silverlake was exposed to the same stress level as the other three loopers, then sure. But she's only lived a year in time loop. She's also all the time shielded from dangers, both from fellow loopers (due to her vital role) and from outside world (due to Zorian's Gift scheme). She won't be that different than she was.

And remembering she's the reckless type, I think she just forgot old Silverlake exist.
