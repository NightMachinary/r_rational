If it were so, we should have had at least one mention of her when we had Red Robe's perspective, though. He would have had to really go out of his way in the time loop to meet her, if she wasn't initially involved without his prompting and negotiations. It seems very underwhelming if this is the end of it.

Honestly, if there are no edits in "I Win II" to include her, or no mention of her in the epilogue, then I think it's possible that she might be removed entirely from the story when this whole webnovel is edited into a coherent book version.
