Great ending to an awesome story.

I love the things left open... for later...

- Organj with two define artifacts. Remember when Zach got to carry the crown because it would help him more than Zorian - it gives a bonus as a percentage of your current reserves... and without that boost the dragon is already at least somewhat comparable to a high level angel. Who's hyped for hypothetical-book-2 "Zorian and the Dragon Tyrant"?

- Grey hunter enhanced with Panaxeth primordial essence. Another already-unstoppable killing machine, now potentially enhanced to an unknown level.

- Quatach-Ichl. Beaten, battered, but not destroyed. Wiser from the experience. An ally against Organj perhaps? No doubt that would mean awarding him the crown, and how far could he ever be trusted?

- Political instability may lead to war. Jornak claimed Eldemar is horribly corrupt, maybe that is his twisted perspective, maybe not.

- What caused the weeping?
