but any time he spend on getting the artifacts are time not spent actually managing his realm, it's also expensive to get to the other side of the world especially for a island that is on shaky grounds with most others politically.

remember he can't do the trick that zorian used to locate the artifacts so he'd have search an entire continent of lizardfolk by hand to find the staff.

and collecting a force big enough to move a now crown empowered oganji would be a issue too, since i doubt he'd like to part with his new toys especially since now he does not have the crown so his own spell reserves are severely diminished.
