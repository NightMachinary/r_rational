I would expect him to use it for political purposes. Granted that we don't know what the national boundaries will look like in 400 years' time, but if there isn't Ibasan hegemony by then, expect it to happen shortly afterward. He has the resources to collect the full Key in advance, and the skill, experience and pragmatism to properly utilise the full power of the Gate, multiple lifetimes' worth of iterations. He'd return to the real world knowing everything there is to know about every other government in the world.

Also, it would be an unparalleled opportunity for necromantic experimentation, and he recognises very few ethical limitations.

Only thing is, I'm not sure whether the Guardian would refuse to accept him as the Controller. There might be specific rules against undead.
