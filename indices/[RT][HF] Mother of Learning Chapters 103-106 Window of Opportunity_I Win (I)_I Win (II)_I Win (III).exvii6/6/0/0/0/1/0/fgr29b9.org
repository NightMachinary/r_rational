Interesting idea. If the Gate exactly recreates the whole world, though, I would think it would recreate the spells that bind his soul to his avatar and to his phylactery, so he would be able to interact normally with them in the loop, and then he'd be bound to his real world avatar again with almost no lapsed time.

Or the Guardian would refuse to accept him.
