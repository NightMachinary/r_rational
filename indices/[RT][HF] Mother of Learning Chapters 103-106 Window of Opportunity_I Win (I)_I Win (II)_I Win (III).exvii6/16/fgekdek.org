So, this was a pretty decent outcome for QI, so long as he gets his crown back.

His original plan was to release the primordial and let the angels deal with it in some unspecified fashion. That didn't happen. But it turned out that the angels' plan was for Zach to prevent the release, which suggests that this was about the best outcome available to him. He wouldn't really have wanted a primordial running around the world indefinitely, and Cyoria/Eldemar would definitely feel the sting of the invasion for a while.
