I meant for Oganj it's not that much of a /direct/ power boost. There's probably some things he'd be able to do more like raze 5 cities in a row nonstop but if someone was directly capable of challenging him, the crown doesn't change anything. Tho I guess it's possible I'm underestimating how conservative Oganj needs to be himself with his spells

For QI I definitely agree it's significant and my comment with regards to him were in reference more so to him fighting Oganj to reclaim the crown. And I'd imagine QI wasn't going to expect to win nor attempt a challenge through sheer brute force that would last especially long. Tho maybe I'm overestimating his base.
