The problem with that idea is that I have really lost all enthusiasm for the Naruto fandom due to all the power creep and nonsense that the original story devolved into. I don't think it's a good idea to write a story for a fandom you no longer like, let alone do it by coming back to a fic you've abandoned 9 years ago.
