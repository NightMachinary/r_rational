Zorian setting the greyhound on Silverlake was absolutely hilarious, honestly my favorite part out of everything. Loved the interaction between old and young Silverlake. I'm not at all surprised that a copy of her has gone crazy before and tried to kill her other selves.

It's sad to see this story ended but the ending lived up my expectations. Really liked the part of him bypassing the mind blank. If anyone could do it, it's Zorian. Can't wait to see the epilogue, Zorian mindwiping everybody's memories of the last month is absolutely insane and I know the government is gonna be absolutely terrified.
