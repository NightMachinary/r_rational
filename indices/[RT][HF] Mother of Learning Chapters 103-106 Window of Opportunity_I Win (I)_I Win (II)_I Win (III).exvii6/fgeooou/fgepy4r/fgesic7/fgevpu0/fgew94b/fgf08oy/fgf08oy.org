I think it's feasible. QI probably wouldn't be all that mad at them provided he gets his crown back; they actually fulfilled his plan about as well as could be expected. It was just that the angels' scheme, which he was relying on, was to stop the release instead of fighting the primordial afterward. That's not their fault, and he wouldn't have wanted the primordial to rage freely, nor would he probably have liked the scorched earth countermeasures.

And he has a good track record for straight dealing.
