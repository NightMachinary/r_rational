I assume the first-year girl on the train who asked Zorian "Hey, can you show us some magic?"

She asked him again once Zorian came into the real world, and Zorian thought she was kind of familiar but didn't remember her. Some people seem to have thought she was a Chekov's Gunman. I personally thought it was just the author having a laugh because he's known for having so many Chekov's Guns in his story.
