Well, the 'Zorian works in a library' arc was meant to be longer originally, and Ibery was the main supporting character in that plot thread. However, I couldn't find a way to make it interesting (even to me), so some of her arc got cut. Nothing terribly important, really.

Neither of the two were entirely honest, but Ibery /did/ pursue Fortov rather aggressively and forced a kiss on him before getting pushed into magical poison ivy. What Fortov isn't saying is that that he accepted her help many, many times in the past, basically feeding into her crush. He never thought of her as anything other than a friend, though, it was all one-sided on her part.
