1) She didn't say that being gay was bad, just implied that throwing everything away for a love interest is bad. She was pretty clearly talking about Zach specifically.

2) That's not what "phobia" means. Silverlake was unusually scared of the grey hunter. She was scared of copies of herself. She wasn't scared of gay people.

3) What, you thought that Silverlake was a nice person? Seriously, we also read about Jornak torturing and killing masses of people For Science, and kidnapping babies to sell to witches so they could do more of the same. Yes, the villains do and say things that good people should not.

4) A few minutes after her comment, she was eaten by a giant spider, and was probably still alive and conscious throughout most of the process given her regeneration. What more karma could anyone want?
