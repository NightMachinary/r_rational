I read the whole thing over the past 20 days. The only part that stood out to me personally as needing significant editing is the latest 4 chapters released today, which understandably haven't had the years of feedback and grammar fixes the rest of the story has. The rest of it I thought was some pretty dang good editing. (Especially compared to /ahem/ another very long running web serial with extended battle sequences :D )
