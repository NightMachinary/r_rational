He finally beat them and the whole miniature world was satisfying. Dunno how the old silver lake is faring nor the grey Hunter.

This was a satisfying ending. Obviously they tried their best and made it through the month. They couldn't kill all the enemies but the two enemy time Loopers are dead. I wonder if silver lake ever had a Killswitch but honestly she is too distrustful to do anything like that.

Here's hoping for an epilogue especially with his friends.
