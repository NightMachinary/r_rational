There's a good chance that silverlake just took the spider for her potion. The difficulty in catching a grey hunter is its speed to avoid traps and magic sense. If she's got one already captured in a ward, she should have all the hard work done with no risk to her.

It doesn't have any particularly novel way of escaping capture, since it relies on raw physical ability and venom, instead of something esoteric like dimension hopping amphibians.
