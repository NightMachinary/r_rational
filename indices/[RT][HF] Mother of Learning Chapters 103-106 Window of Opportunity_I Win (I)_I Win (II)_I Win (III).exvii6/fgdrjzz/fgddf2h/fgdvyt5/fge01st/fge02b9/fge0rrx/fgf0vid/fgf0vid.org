Assuming, of course, that the primordial essence it just consumed was digested quickly enough for Panaxeth's contractual effect on Silverlake's body, making it rot and collapse on itself, not affect it. Up to [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]]. Not sure if he even planned on including it in the epilogue, anyhow.

The one I want to learn more about is vampire girl, though. A single scene of her gloating over QI's loss would be great, but I'd want to have an explanation of why she only participated in the invasion that one time. I assumed that the reason QI returned to Ibasan territory every restart was to deal with politics involving her family, but nothing ever came from it.
