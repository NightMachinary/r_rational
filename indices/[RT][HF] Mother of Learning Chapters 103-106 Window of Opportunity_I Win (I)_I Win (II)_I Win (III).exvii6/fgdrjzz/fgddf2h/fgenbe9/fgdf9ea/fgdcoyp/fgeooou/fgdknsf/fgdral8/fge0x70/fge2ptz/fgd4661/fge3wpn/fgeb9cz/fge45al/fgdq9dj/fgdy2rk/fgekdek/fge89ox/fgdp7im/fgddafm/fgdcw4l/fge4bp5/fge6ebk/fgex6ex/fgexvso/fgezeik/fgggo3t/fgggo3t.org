He would regenerate it quickly, but even Zach has less mana than a dragon. I think at its most useful, assuming Zach has half his reserves, it would quintuple (5x) Organj's mana reserves. If it's less than that, it gets proportionally smaller and smaller. But even double reserves is no good for a dragon who can regenerate it so quickly.

I wonder how QI's crown retrieval will go when he's somewhat equivalent to Zach and Zorian without it increasing his mana reserves. But he's very crafty, so I do think he has a chance of recovering it.
