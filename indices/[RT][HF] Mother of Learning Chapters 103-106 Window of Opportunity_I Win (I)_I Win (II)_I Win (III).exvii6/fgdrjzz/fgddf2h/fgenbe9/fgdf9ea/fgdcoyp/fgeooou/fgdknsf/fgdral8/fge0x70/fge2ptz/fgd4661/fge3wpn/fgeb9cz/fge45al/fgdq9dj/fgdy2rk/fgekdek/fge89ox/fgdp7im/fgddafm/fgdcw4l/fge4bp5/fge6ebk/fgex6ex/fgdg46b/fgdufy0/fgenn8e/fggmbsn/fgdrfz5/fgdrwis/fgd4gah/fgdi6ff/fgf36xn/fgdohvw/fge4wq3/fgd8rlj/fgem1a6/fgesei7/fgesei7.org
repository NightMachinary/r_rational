Oganj probably does not know anything about time loop. But anyway,

Contract is for Zach to not allow that info leaked before the end of the month. If Zach didn't know someone know, then it's fine. That's why, after he saw Zorian died along with his three enemies, he only checked his allies: Xvim, Alanic, Daimen, and the Arachnea. As far as he know, nobody else should know. Thus, he fulfilled that part of contract.

About random citizen that got their memories wiped, Zach will think it's an extra-paranoid move from Zorian part. It will also suggest to him that Zorian got everyone in his mass mind-wipe. Zach is safe.

What angel imply going after anyone knowing about time loop is for when Panaxeth released. It's not part of the contract, but a low key threat they threw to Zorian. Zorian, in turn, throw the same threat toward Quatach Ichl. Due to Pan remain sealed, there's no reason to carry the threat. The angels turn a blind eye as they promised.
