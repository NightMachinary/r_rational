does not matter if he's there for the next activation window unless he have the key to get in, so he would have to collect all the divine artifacts, sure he got a 100 years to do so, but still it's not really easy, also he don't really need the loop he already have a eternity to improve so it's less of a "must have" for him, useful of course because you can learn stuff and try things without repurcussions, but just getting the staff would be a hell since he have no way to locate it, the ring he would have no idea where it is and while the crown and orb are conveniently in the same place it's not a place he can easily travel to and just take them and the dagger is in the Zorian factions hands, so where it ends up is a complete crap shoot.
