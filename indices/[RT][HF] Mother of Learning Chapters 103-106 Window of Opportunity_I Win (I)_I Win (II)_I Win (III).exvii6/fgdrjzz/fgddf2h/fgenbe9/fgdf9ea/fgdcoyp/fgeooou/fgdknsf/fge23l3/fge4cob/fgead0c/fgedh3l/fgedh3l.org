Nah. There's a clear and obvious indicator that you're on the inside of the Gate: no spirit world. (The "when" is super easy). Now you just need to find the looper.... or have all/enough of the artifacts that they come looking for *you*. Then convince them to add a "temporary" marker, and also to accept just a little self-updating memory package that they'll be able to carry out, just like with Jornak....

Plus, you've got a known way to get the Gate activated: Release a primordial!

So now in four hundred years, QI "tries" to release Panax again. When the looper shows up, do some soul magic fucker to stick a similar thing as with RR, and make sure the looper forgets you ever did that. You on the outside gets the fragment, and doesn't bother with the rest. Well, or most of the rest, since you're still a Machiavellian bastard.
