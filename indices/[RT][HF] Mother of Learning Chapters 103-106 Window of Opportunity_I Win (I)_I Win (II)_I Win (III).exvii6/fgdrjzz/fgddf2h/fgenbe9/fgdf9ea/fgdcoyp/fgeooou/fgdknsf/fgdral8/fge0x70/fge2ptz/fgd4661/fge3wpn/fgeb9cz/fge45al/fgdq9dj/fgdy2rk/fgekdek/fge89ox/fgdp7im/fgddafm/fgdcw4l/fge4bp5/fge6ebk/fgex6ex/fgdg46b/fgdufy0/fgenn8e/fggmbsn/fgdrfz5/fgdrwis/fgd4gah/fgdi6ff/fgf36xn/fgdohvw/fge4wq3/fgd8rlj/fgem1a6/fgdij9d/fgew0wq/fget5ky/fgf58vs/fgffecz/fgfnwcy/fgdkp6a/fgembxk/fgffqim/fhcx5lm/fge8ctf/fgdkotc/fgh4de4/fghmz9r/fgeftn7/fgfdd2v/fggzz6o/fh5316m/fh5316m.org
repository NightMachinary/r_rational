Golems died in Cyoria tonight

Mrva's nowhere to be seen

All around me desolation

And a fair share is on me

The minds were howling while they died in my sight

Couldn't keep them out, angels know I've tried

Don't let them win, don't let them free

Panaxeth, how bad that would be

even with mind blank they'll never know

where they'll go

Let it go, let it go

There's no looping back anymore

Let it go, let it go

the Guardian shut the door

I don't care who I need to slay

Silverlake is gone

and death never bothered me anyway

Let it go, let it go

let the city burn to the floor

Let it go, let it go

and dismiss the rotting gore

here I stand, on a bright new day

yes the loop is gone

but with Zach there is still a chance of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay][Ho Yay]].
