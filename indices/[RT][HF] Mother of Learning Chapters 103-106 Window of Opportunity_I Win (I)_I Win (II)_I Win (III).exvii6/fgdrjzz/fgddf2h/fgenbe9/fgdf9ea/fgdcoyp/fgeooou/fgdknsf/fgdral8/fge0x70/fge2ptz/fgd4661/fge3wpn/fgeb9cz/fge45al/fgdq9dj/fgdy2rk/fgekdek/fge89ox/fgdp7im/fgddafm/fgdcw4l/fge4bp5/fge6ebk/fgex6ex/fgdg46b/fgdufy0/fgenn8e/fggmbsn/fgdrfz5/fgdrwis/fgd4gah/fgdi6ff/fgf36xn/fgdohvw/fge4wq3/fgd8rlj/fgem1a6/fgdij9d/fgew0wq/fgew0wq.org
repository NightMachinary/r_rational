I just realise that the time loop did change silverlake and becomes her downfall. She unconsciously believed that her doppelgänger will behave similarly with zach and zorian doppelgängers due to multiple exposures and the nature of time-loops. The time-loop had mellowed out her sense of caution towards a copy of her. She had dismissed the old silverlake as unimportant and not threatening.

Another reason to be added on will be that Silverlake is so self centered that shes unable to think from the perspective of the old her. Both of which let to her dead and downfall. Am i right [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]]
