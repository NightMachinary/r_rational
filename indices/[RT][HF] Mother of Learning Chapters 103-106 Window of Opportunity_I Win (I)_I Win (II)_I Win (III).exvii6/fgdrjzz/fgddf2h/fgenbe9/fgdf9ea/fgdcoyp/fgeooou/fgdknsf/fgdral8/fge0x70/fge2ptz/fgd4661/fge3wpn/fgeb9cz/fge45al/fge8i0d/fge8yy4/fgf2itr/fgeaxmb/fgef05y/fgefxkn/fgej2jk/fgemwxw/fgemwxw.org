Huh. You know, looking through the story again, I think you're right. It somehow didn't register to me that the party wasn't the actual start of the summer festival, just a celebration preluding to it.

And the language of Zach's contract mentioned in-story said the kill-switch activation happened at the "end of the month", which I'm pretty sure means twelve o'clock of the night of the party, so Zorian and Zach cut it really close attacking on the last day available.

But then Jornak's POV in chapt. 105 said he started the invasion a day before the actual due date? I wonder if that was meant not quite literally, as in "one calendar date before the due date" which would be less than 24 hours before the deadline, rather than "more than twenty-four hours beforehand" that I was thinking of, or if his kill-switch activation actually happened a bit later than Zach's...
