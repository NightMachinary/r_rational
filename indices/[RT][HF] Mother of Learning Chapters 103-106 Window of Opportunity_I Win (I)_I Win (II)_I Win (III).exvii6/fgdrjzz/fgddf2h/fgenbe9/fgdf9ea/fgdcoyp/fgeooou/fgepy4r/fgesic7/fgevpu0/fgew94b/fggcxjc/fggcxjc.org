It's still not negligible. QI said in chapter 81 that the crown gave him ten times the mana reserves, on top of his divine blessing, and he started at about magnitude 25 and has certainly maxed his growth.

So, firstly, QI will have to fight much more conservatively than usual.

Secondly, that actually is enough of a boost to matter to a dragon. Judging by QI's numbers, it can store mana equal to approximately magnitude 1000, and the author has indicated before that Zach at magnitude 200-ish (50 plus full growth) could potentially cast some lesser draconic spells, so 1000 is enough to make a difference.

Let's suppose that the draconic equivalent of magic missile costs 200, nearly all of Zach's reserves. Most mages would be pretty happy about carrying an item that can store enough personal mana to cast 5 extra magic missiles.
