to be fair, Oganj doesn't really get a power boost. QI is also frightenly powerful without it. for the most part, it's never mentioned that people considered draining and outlasting a dragon's mana as a strategy to beating one. and Zach had beaten the dragon solo before, even if nearly unreproducible even within the loop, so taking the crown back shouldn't be that different from beating him normally
