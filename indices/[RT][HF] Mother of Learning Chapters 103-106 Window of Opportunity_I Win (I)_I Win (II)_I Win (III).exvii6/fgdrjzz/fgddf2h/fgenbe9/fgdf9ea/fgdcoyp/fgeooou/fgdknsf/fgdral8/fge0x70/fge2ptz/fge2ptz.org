And so it ends. What a journey.

This story has accompanied me through some dark times these past years. Once a month, any day that a new chapter came out was a good day and reading this always put a smile on my face. I could say many other things but I think I will say just one more.

Tell me [[/u/nobody103]], now that the story is finished... was the mystery girl from the first loop ever supposed to be important or she was always a nobody?

Also thank you very much for brightening my days for such a long time. I await the publishing of these books so I can buy them and give something back where previously I couldn't.
