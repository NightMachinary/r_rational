And, while I'm sure there will be capital-C Consequences to giving Oganj that much of a power boost, in that moment it's a pretty good deal for Zorian as well. Of the five top-tier threats, Silverlake is neutralized, Cyclops Demon is dead, and QI is elsewhere, leaving only Oganj and RR, and Zach is engaged in what is pretty much a stalemate with the latter. It's pretty much an end to the battle and to the possibility of Panaxeth being released; it'd be cheap at twice the price.
