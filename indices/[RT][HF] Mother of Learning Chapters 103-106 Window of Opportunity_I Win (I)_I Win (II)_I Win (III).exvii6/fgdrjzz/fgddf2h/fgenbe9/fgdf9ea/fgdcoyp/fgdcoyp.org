  Happy Groundhog Day everybody! I bring you gifts of new chapters on this very special day!

  I have a confession to make. I did not really finish the entire story. The epilogue still isn't finished, so there is one more update I have to make after this.

  The reason I did this was because: a) The chapters I did write outright end the plot of the novel. Not having an epilogue is annoying, but shouldn't diminish people's enjoyment of the ending too much. b) My editor convinced me I should extend the epilogue a little and make it more fleshed out. After thinking about it somewhat, I agree it will probably be more satisfying for the reasons if I did that. Even if they don't really get their promised ending post as a result.

  I know that some of you have increased your donations in response to my promise of making this the final update. Be sure to return your pledges to their normal levels after today! Or just cancel them altogether if you want to - I won't mind. I don't know if I'll make the epilogue a charged post - it depends on how long the new version ends up being.
