I don't think so. Nobody103 has his patreon set up to pay out on chapter releases (ie. people pledge to pay a certain amount for each publicly released chapter they put out). There may be some content only available to patrons, but none of the story chapters (and a bunch of worldbuilding info is also free on a wordpress site).
