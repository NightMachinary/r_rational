That's what was a bit off about the fight

The angel is meant to be super mega OP to the point it can contend against the primordial???

fair enough vs the big Boi demon it struggled a little maybe? It may have been near primordial level

But this makes it seem like oganj could have gone toe to toe with panaxeth?
