Zach has been to a lot of places, and has the mana to travel across the continent quite quickly. Also, Red Robe wouldn't have gone that far; he was working furiously throughout the real month to get everything done, he didn't have time and mana to waste on handing out a secret he wanted to keep, on the other side of the world, as a contingency when he'd failed and died anyway, to solidify a revenge that he thought was already inevitable. Contingencies closer to home, sure.
