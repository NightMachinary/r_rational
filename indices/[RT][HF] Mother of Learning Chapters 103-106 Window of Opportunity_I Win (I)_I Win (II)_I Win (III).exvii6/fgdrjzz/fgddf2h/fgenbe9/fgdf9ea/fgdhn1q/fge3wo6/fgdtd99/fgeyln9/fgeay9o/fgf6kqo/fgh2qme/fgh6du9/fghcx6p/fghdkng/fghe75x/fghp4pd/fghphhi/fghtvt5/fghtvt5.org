It was shown that red robe spent an inordinate amount of time and effort on contingencies. A lot of which only really mattered if he lost and died.

This would require a few seconds making magically duplicated letters and post marking them around the continent.

Or he could have spent LITERALLY no effort on it and just told zach that he did while already taunting him in the maze. Just like with the mind tampering stuff, the mere suspicion that it could be possible would set off a compulsion to check the veracity.

It's far more possible that red robe sent some letters than the mind blank spell was defeated. Especially since it is explicitly stated that red robe DID send letters as a contingency. The ones exposing zach and Zorian. Set to be discovered weeks later. From red robes own admission, he spent time and energy setting THAT up, but not on something guaranteed to destroy zach.
