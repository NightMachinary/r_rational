He had a compulsion the second he thought there was even a remote possibility that his perception was being tampered with. So if red robe told him there were people who knew about it scattered around the continent, that seems at least as likely as someone getting around the mind blank spell that had been unbreakable for centuries.

A lot more likely, in my opinion. And red robe could have given specific names and places as well. He was already taunting him in the maze, so it wouldn't have been any more work. And he already went through enormous effort to fuck over everybody in case he lost.
