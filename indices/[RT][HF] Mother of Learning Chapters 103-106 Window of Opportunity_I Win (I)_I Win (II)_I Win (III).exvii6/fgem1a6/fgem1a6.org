Okay, question about Zach finale: what about Oganj? He still alive and still have knowledge of Time loop, does he not? And the innumerable allies on the RR side who are still alive after evac? Or those who weren't in the battle or in Ciora at all? Some of them quite probably have knowledge of Time loop, RR side didn't have strict req to keep that info sealed, and RR seemed to be kind of guy who surely would tell someone about Time loop for one of his contingency plans.
