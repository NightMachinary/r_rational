If Ichl knows about the Sovereign Gate, then he probably knows it's becoming unstable. His loop-copy absolutely refused to make any kind of pact with the Primordial, so his main self would probably see entering the Loop (as it stands now) could be the worst thing ever - Paxanath would have even fewer restrictions on interacting/messing with Loopers at that point.
