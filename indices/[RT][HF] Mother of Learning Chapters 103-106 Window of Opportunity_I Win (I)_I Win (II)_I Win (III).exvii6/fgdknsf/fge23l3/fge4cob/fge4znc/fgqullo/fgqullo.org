The problem is, it would also make a great trap to catch QI with, and destroy him entirely.

That is, I'm pretty sure that in order for QI to use the Sovereign Gate, he'll need show up /with his phylactery physically present/ to the Sovereign Gate. Otherwise, being in a different universe from it will probably sever the connection.

So, all you have to do destroy QI is wait, with overwhelming force, for him to show up to enter the Gate.
