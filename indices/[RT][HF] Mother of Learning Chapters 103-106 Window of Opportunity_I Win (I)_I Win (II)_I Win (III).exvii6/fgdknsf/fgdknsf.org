Justice Silverlake, Justice. What a poetic ending for her. The inconsistencies in each of their visions is something i am going to enjoy re-reading and dissecting. Lots of interesting bits there. Overall I am happy with the ending. It certainly lives up to the standards of the subreddit. Yes losses were minimized, but thats because of good planning. He still lost the crown and orb, Ichl is still kicking it in Ubasa and best pokemon is still hunting, now in a much more populous dense area. Will be happy to read the epilogue when it comes.
