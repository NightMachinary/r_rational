You are mistaken about the crown. It does not give a percent boost. For Zorian its something like a 100x boost. For Zach its a 10x. The reason Zach uses the crown is that the crown does not provide a boost to mana regen which is a percent of total reserves normally. So for Zorian recharging the crown takes around 10x the time it takes for Zach to do so. As a result its more practical for him and Zorian is already specialized in a low mana efficient style of combat anyway.
