I'm pretty sure that Oganj has more than double Zach's reserves. The author has suggested that Zach might be able to learn entry level draconic magic (although I doubt that that there's a dragon who would teach him). So, Zach's whole reserves are like a single draconic magic missile.

Still, if the crown can hold about ten times as much as QI's reserves (which are similar to Zach's), then that means it's about an extra ten magic missiles for Oganj. Nothing to sneeze at, and there's nothing else in the world like it.
