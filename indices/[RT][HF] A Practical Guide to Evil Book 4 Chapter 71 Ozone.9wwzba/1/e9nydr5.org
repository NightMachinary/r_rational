More death flags, talking about how wide the world is and how much of it is still left for them to see and experience. RIP Archer...

Part of me is wondering if Cat isn't setting Archer up, narratively, for some heroic sacrifice story in order to help her take down Sve Noc. Revenge for a fallen friend/lover who died to save her life has a lot of weight to it.

Cat might not even be aware that she's doing it, either, and it's just some unconscious instinct of hers kicking in. Now that would truly be a "guide to evil".
