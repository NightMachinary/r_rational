Honestly, part of me feels like Erraticerrata is just teasing us with them, saying "oh you though I was deathflagging Indrani? Well nope! I was distracting you from the way more subtle and unnoticed foreshadowing that you missed cause you were too focused on the death flags!" I'll be pretty sad if I'm wrong, cause I feel like this novel is better than such an obvious plot twist.
