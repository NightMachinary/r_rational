With the tale of the Two-headed ogre, the three knights, and Elizabeth Alban:

*What will Cat do?*

*Will she attempt to be Strong?* That was shown to be a dead end vs Mighty Urulan.

*Will she attempt to be Quick?* Unlikely, because the Drow and the Night are plentiful in the Everdark.

*Will she attempt to be Clever like the surviving Knight?* How clever? Sve Noc seems to be of two minds; "the rider and the horse"...the domain of night and the priestess herself wielding that power.

If drow culture is any reflection of the "madness" night inflicts upon those who wield its power, then the "rider", i.e. the rider may be quite mad.

Cat has attempted to resist the maddening influence of winter by using her domain carefully...

*Will she attempt to be Badass like Elizabeth Alban?*

While the end result of the conflict and the retelling will inevitably lead to this conclusion, the conflict itself and any plan she forges will not be as simple as "be badass"...
