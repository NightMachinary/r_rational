If you're a magic-wielding drow priestess who can invade dreams and crush minds, it's understandable you'd try to trick Cat into spilling her plans. But obviously said priestess was not prepared for Winter, whose mantle is always around Cat even when Cat herself is deep within the mantle of the Everdark.

But what doesn't make sense (to me, at least) is why you wouldn't work your mind mojo on Archer. Archer's strong, quick, and clever... and entirely unmagical and without any affiliation to Winter. Were I the pinnacle of the drow, a culture known for their cunning and power, I would definitely have worked some kind of craft on Archer. She's Cat's friend (and now lover), the second or third most powerful person in Cat's army, and is seemingly the only one in the upper echelon who could be attacked successfully in this manner. All the Mighty (and Ubua) are part of Winter and Cat's mantle. But Archer? She's been under the mantle of the Everdark ever since she first stepped foot inside, and she has no Winter mantle to protect her.

The question for me isn't "will Archer be killed" it's "why hasn't she been neutralized already?" Really, it would make sense for it to have already happened, no? And if she's become a Manchurian candidate, when did it happen and were there any signs of it until now?
