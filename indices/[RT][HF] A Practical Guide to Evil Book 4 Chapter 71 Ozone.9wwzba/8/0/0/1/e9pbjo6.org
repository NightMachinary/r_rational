Given how Ivah heard only laughter when he tried to ask Sve Noc for advice, it might be that actual presence of Night in the recipient of a vision either allows more control for godess half of her, or at least makes it aware of the contact. Cat might have been the priestess' only chance to pull sonething off behind her divine half's back (figuratively or literally, depending on how you look at it).

My take on it is that the Sve Catherine has just talked to is either an unfortunate vessel or more mortal and concerned for her people version of the two, while the one spreading the Night is a dominant personality. The failure of Everdark as a society and some inconsistent or weird details may be the result of the struggle between the two (for example, the Gloom may have been an early Night containment measure installed by the priestess back when she had more influence, one that the godess managed to only partially circumvent with the feathers).
