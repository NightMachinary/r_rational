  Remember, Cat's first glimpse of Sve Noc was through a blob of Night that Cat was manipulating with Winter. Now, Sve Noc invades Cat's dreams, after significant amounts of Night have been tied up with Winter through the oaths and little bits of Winter Cat has been binding the Drow with.

VERY good points, and I think you do a good job explaining why Archer wouldn't be touched.

But alternatively... wouldn't the Mighty (both Winter and not) be especially vulnerable to this kind of attack by Sve Noc, then? Cat was able to fight her/them off, but would a Mighty titled with a low nobility have the same ability to do so? They might not have any useful information, but they could still be Manchurian candidates. Even if all that's accomplished is that the Mighty are instantly killed by their oaths... that still wipes out Cat's entire host of Winter Mighty.
