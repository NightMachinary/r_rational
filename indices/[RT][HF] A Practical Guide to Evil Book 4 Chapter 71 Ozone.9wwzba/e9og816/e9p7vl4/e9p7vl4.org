  Archer's strong, quick, and clever... and entirely unmagical
#+end_quote

Um. Archer is Named. She can't throw around Light or shadows or fireballs, but she has power. She can defy enemies that would crush mortals and cut through sorcery.

She isn't flashy like Masego or Catherine, but her power is probably similar to Ranger and Saint of Swords back when they were younger. Like them her Name is does most of its work internally, strengthening her body and mind. We can see the pinnacle of that in the Saint, whose soul is literally a sword.
