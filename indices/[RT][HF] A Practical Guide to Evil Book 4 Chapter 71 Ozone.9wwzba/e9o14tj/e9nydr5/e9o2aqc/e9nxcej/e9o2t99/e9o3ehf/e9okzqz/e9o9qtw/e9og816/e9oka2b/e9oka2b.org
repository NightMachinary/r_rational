I think that Archer is probably untouchable to Sve Noc in this way.

Remember, Cat's first glimpse of Sve Noc was through a blob of Night that Cat was manipulating with Winter. Now, Sve Noc invades Cat's dreams, after significant amounts of Night have been tied up with Winter through the oaths and little bits of Winter Cat has been binding the Drow with.

Basically, I think there is some interaction happening between Winter and the Night that allowed Sve Noc to invade Cat's mind/dreams, and Archer's only tie to Winter is being Cat's ally, so Sve Noc can't pull the same trick with Archer.
