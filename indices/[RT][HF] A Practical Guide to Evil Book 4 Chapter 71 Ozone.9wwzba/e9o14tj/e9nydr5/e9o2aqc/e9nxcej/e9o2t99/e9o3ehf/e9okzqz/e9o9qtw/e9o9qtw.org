So we started off with Sve-as-Black poking holes in Cat's plan. Apparently Cat thinks that the Drow can't get loose because the Heavens wouldn't want to deal with Drow. Which I sort of get - the Drow are bad news - but half the point of Heroes, and Black/Cat's problems with them, is that it doesn't matter how unbeatable your army, how powerful your artifact is, what dread sorcereries you wield, or what terrible demons you've summoned - the heroes are still going to show up and deal with these things. But apparently you can have an army of terrible monsters, magically enslaved against their will, whose thematics are about as dark and Evil as you get, and you can avoid repercussions by... having them be an undefeatable horde of darkness? Because the Heavens apparently shy away from a challenge?

Personally I think it undercuts the unfairness of the Heavens if the way to solve having a big obvious flaw in your dread army.... is simply to make it a bigger and stronger army.

But the really weird thing here to me is the treatment of terrible things happening when you beat villains being a deterrent against beating villains: terrible things happening when a villain loses is built right into the premise of villains losing. Praes has made a habit of unleashing terrible doomsday weapons and demons when they lose. Calernia is still dealing with some of the fallout from Triumphant losing. There was a whole big deal made about how heroes win, and how villains curse them with their dying breath. This is all just part of the game.

Leaning into Classic stories shouldn't be a path to victory here. Hopefully Cat does something clever to justify this working beyond crossing her fingers and hoping the Heavens don't blink. Reinforcing the measures controlling the Drow, maybe, so that everything isn't instantly FUBAR if something happens to the oaths. Or a clever subversion of the story she's currently barrelling straight down.

There were also questions raised here about where the Drow would be put. We know from earlier chapters that Cat has a plan, and I'm quite curious about it. Callow's not in great shape at the moment, having trouble feeding itself let alone an extra army, and there are obvious issues with integrating the Drow literally anywhere. Should be interesting to see.

We also learnt about Sve and why she's called a "two-faced goddess". I wonder if Ivah knew about this / why it didn't mention it - it's not hard to work out if you have any interaction whatsoever with Sve (not that Ivah would ever have been anywhere /near/ Sve, but it was high up in a major inner ring sigil, and the two-faced-Sve-thing doesn't seem very well hidden). But yeah, there are obviously questions being raised about the various motives and schemes of Sve Noc(s).

We saw what happened to Cat during the Kaleidoscope arc, which I'd essentially forgotten was still an open question at this point.

There was a bit more of the new Cat-Archer relationship, which is going to be a continuing thing.There wa also a mention of Killian, who hasn't really been mentioned in this book at all up till now.

Not really any progress was made on the front of the Drow-city that is three times the size of Lotow, filled with two hundred "Night-powered Ranger equivalents" and about to go to Cat with Sve looming in the background. I'm not sure if Cats not thinking about it because she's just that confident or has everything completely compartmentalised or what.

There was also talk about stories that might be in play, which gives a model to compare things to. That is very nice to have. Although if Cat's plan is to murder the proverbial ogre, uh, I'd have to recommend attempting the clever knight's strategy instead. Also, I still really want to know about what Drow stories might be in effect - we just recently had an object lesson in the dangers of wandering into another culture with an unfamiliar literary landscape.
