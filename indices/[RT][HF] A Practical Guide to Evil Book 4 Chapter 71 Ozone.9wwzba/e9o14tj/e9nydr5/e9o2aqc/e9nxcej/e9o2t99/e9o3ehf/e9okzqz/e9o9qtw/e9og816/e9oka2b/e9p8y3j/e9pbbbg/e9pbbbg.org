  But alternatively... wouldn't the Mighty (both Winter and not) be especially vulnerable to this kind of attack by Sve Noc, then? Cat was able to fight her/them off, but would a Mighty titled with a low nobility have the same ability to do so? They might not have any useful information, but they could still be Manchurian candidates. Even if all that's accomplished is that the Mighty are instantly killed by their oaths... that still wipes out Cat's entire host of Winter Mighty.

Yeah, I think they definitely would be. Frankly, I'd be surprised if Sve Noc /didn't/ pull some Night shenanigans to cripple Cat's army. And I think your idea would be a pretty clever way for Sve Noc to wipe out a significant portion of Cat's Mighty, or, if she's lucky, get some Fae-titled Mighty of her own.
