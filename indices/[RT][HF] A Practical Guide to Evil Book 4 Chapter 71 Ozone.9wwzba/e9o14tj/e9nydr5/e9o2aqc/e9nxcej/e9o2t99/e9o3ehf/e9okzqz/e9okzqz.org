Two questions:

  “Fate is a useful tool,” Black said, tone irritated, “but it does not-”
#+end_quote

This quote is what made Cat realize it wasn't Black. I assume Black has a different outlook or said something different about Fate but can't remember.

#+begin_quote
  She did not answer with words. The pressure should have crushed me. Would have, if this was her realm and not mine. But old words echoed and rippled, the whisper of a pair of crows surrounded by a sea of birds of paradise, and it washed over me like rain. It was not my truth, but I had partaken in it.
#+end_quote

And then there is this. I don't get what the birds represent nor what truth she is talking about. Can anyone shed some light on this?
