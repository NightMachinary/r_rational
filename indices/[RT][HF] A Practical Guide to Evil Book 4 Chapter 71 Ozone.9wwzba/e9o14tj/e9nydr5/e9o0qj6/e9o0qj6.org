Archer is the only one who hasn't bled. She's just been more or less successful or and done every task like it's a big joke.

Hakram lost a hand and gambled away the other one. Masego went blind. Viv burnt herself on the actual sun and she's not even combaty. We're being set up for an archer injury that gives her a flair and a serious tone and maybe a reason to hang around.

My prediction is an injury, a line or two about needing Zeze, realising she isn't Ranger and a cool power up from it all (Night related?)
