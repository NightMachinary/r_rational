So Cat has partaken in the truth "I do not Kneel" which is basically Black's Arc Words.

While her own words are different (Justifications matter only to the just), the basic intent of defiance against rules and expectations imposed from outside remains the same.

I'm actually very interested in how this conflict goes - While Cat has habitually fought against enemies stronger than her and won mostly via narrative aptitude rather than mere strength, she doesn't quite "identify" with her domain & mantle - while she /IS/ the Queen of Winter, she doesn't embrace her domain, but shunts off its influence and wields it in a very controlled / simplistic manner. She obviously is planning to abdicate as Queen(of Winter!) and utilize the domain of Winter itself, alongside the title of "Sovereign of Moonless Nights" via the oaths & drow to create a permanent nation of enforcers of the Liesse Accords; POWER, lots of it (both from Night & Winter), chained to PURPOSE(=enforcing the Liesse Accords), and transferred to those who uphold that purpose. Cat views herself as replacable and actively prepares to "pass on the mantle" while pursueing her goals with iron determination...but she considers even her mighty domain and all her successes so far as tools and means, not as something to clutch and fear losing.

With the Dead King introducing Cat to the Game of the Gods, she will likely sooner or later plan to play on THAT stage, rising way beyond the petty hero vs villain squabbles encouraged by the Gods Above & Below.

Her victory over the Fae exemplifies this: She took a third option, sidestepping the enmity of Summer & Winter, ignoring their laws and customs, and defeated/recreated both by marrying the courts and inheriting half of their old power.

The Hierarch showed that it is possible for someone to be "Neutral" in defiance of the Gods above & below and even bench someone as ancient and powerful as the Bard; I suspect Cat will manage to "solve" the Hero/Villain conflict on Calernia via the Liesse Accords, by enforcing standards of decent behaviour to both sides (no demons/angels summoned, no plagues/miracles of mass destruction, limited collateral damage, etc...).

I truly wonder of the scope of conflict and challenge that will arise from Cat challenging the very "Rules of the Game" in open defiance of the Gods.
