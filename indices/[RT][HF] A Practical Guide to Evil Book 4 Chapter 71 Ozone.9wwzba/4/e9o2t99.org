As I suspected, the spider queen (two? interesting twist) knows quite a bit about what cat is up to.

Still sad Indrani is seemingly going to die. I like her.

What is actually happening with Black right now? The suspence is painful!

What is the game cat is playing? Sve seems to believe she can break the oaths of winter, and cat doesnt seem to care. So why bother putting together this army knowing it is going to splinter when it matters?

Also, nice to know cat's Name is still hanging out under there somewhere. Will be interesting seeing how the Blacknight Name reacts with Winter when the succession comes into play. I hope she ends up with a new Name though. It would be really neat to see the genesis of a Name.
