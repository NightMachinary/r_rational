I'm a History teacher and I'm fairly skeptical of Internet Historians, but I followed the link and it's fantastic. His teardown of Sparta reads as slightly biased in a few sections, but it's also absolutely wonderful at recontextualizing that era of History. If I taught an IB / AP class I would have my students read it over a couple of days.
