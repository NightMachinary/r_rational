Any good alternate history stories?

I'm game for anything of quality, but if there's a story of a timeline better than our depressing world that would be swell. Maybe a timeline where there was no transatlantic slave trade, or where there was no scramble for Africa, no colonialism, or where there third world movement actually succeeded.

A good alternate history novel that I'd recommend would be [[https://www.amazon.ca/Years-Rice-Salt-Novel/dp/0553580078][Years of Rice and Salt]] by Kim Stanley Robinson, where the main premise is that the black plague killed off 90% of Europeans.

edit: er, just to be clear, the request and the recommendation are not connected, except by the alternate history theme. I do not think that killing 90% of europeans would lead to a "timeline better than ours", except maybe by chance. Human nature is /human/ nature.
