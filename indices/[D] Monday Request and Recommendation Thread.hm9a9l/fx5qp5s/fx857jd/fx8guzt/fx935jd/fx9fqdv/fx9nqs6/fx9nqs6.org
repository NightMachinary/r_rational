So? Can people not be happy without macro economic growth? It will likely lead to a universal basic income being tested and applied to several countries which in the long run will improve the lives of most people and lead to a much higher degree of freedom and artistic and cultural expression..

The chinese gov is bad, but we can't do anything about it without war. This war would likely lead to the deaths of millions and likely nuclear fallouts. Therefore what we currently have is optimal given the circumstances.

Climate change is not nearly as bad as you imply. Most predictions you'll see are worst case scenarios for 2100, and none of them have large percentages of africa become uninhabitable by 2040-60.
