That's a very pessimistic way of imagining our future. Things are getting better overtime, I know a lot of people don't like hearing this but it's a fact. You can find dozens of books and hundreds of articles on it. Murder rates dropping, war casualties decreasing, reduced death from disease on average, higher quality of life...

Obviously the correct view is the balanced one rather than blindly optimistic or pessimistic, things are statistically getting better over time but new problems are arising that need solving.

Here's the thing, you can optimize your content and information consumption in such a way that makes you feel good and happy or in a way that makes you feel bad or sad.

Unless you're in a position where you can make a meaningful difference, doing things that make you feel bad is not necessarily a good idea. It may feel important or meaningful likely due to some outdated evo psych heuristic our brain uses but it probably factually isn't.

Or if you're like me and cares about the truth, just focus on that. Optimize your content consumption in a way that's compatible with it rather than focusing on optimistic or pessimistic sources.

PS. I'm almost certain things aren't going to be as bad as you seem to think.
