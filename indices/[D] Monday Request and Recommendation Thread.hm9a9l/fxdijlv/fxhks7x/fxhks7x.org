I haven't really seen much rational-genre explorations of litrpg, but these skirt the edge.

- Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends has a few main characters and a power system that is pretty well understood. Leads to some good worldbuilding. Characters are pretty well done too for the genre, with no character really holding the idiot ball later on (beginning is a bit different, but hey at least the characters learn and evolve past their mistakes).

- Ar'Kendrythist starts off like Delve but goes on to do its own thing. The characters are well done imo and undergo some good development. Not as much of a rational munchkining as you may want, but for me it has been satisfying.
