An off-the-wall ...not sure whether I'd say "recommendation", but I'd really enjoy seeing [[/r/rational]] discuss this work:

[[https://github.com/sensui/the-craftsman-book/tree/master/originals/1.%20ObjectMentor][The Craftsman]], a sci-fi serial by Robert C. Martin. (The link goes to the first collection of chapters; further collections can be found by navigating up from there.)

Yes, [[http://www.cleancoder.com/products][that]] Robert C. Martin; "Uncle Bob" Martin; the guy people most associate with the popularization of [[https://agilemanifesto.org/]["agile" software development]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID][SOLID principles]] in OOP programming, etc. Back in the 90s, he wrote extremely campy edutainment fiction.

These stories, from what I can tell, were originally intended as a sort of cute ongoing bonus (like comics are in the newspaper) for readers of Martin's own /Object Mentor/ magazine. But, even after that went defunct, he continued contributing the serialized vignettes for a while to various other magazines: first /Software Development/, and then /Dr. Dobb's Journal/.

I call the story "edutainment", but I mean that in the same way that HPMoR is "edutainment": it's meant to teach you things, but it's also so heavily /dramatized/ (at least, after the first few chapters) that it feels less and less like a thought-experiment or satire, and more like a real attempt at science-fiction by someone who just happens to have a special interest in software engineering that they want to communicate through the work.

The setting for these stories is also kind of interesting: the protagonist's is a "maintenance software engineer", which doesn't seem that notable until it is gradually revealed that the codebase he's (in part) charged with /maintaining/ is that of the generation-ship he and a million other people live within. The maintenance they're doing is to the generation ship's centuries of accrued cruft logic that determines everything from soylent-green allocation to emergency bulkhead release. (Also, much like in Yudkowsky's fictional /Bayesian Conspiriacy/, or in [[http://thecodelesscode.com/contents][these well-known programming koans]], the protagonist is seemingly an apprentice in some sort of software-engineering trade-guild system.)

Honestly, it's not that I think this story is very good (or even that it accomplishes very well what it sets out to do: teaching people software-engineering concepts.) But the premise is golden. I'd love to see someone here take "maintaining the codebase of the thousand-year-old ship you and a million other people depend on" and run with it as a real ratfic, intended solely for entertainment value. Maybe even still keeping "the value of software craftsmanship" as a theme, but presented less as a thing to be beaten over the head with, and more as a /hidden power/ that you can observe the story's characters winning with, or losing for its lack (like solid statecraft is in /Practical Guide to Evil/.)
