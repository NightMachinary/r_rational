Nonfiction recommendation, [[https://acoup.blog/][*A Collection Of Unmitigated Pedantry*]], a historian's look at a pop culture depictions of historical topics. One particularly good series is [[https://acoup.blog/2019/05/10/collections-the-siege-of-gondor/][an analysis of the Siege Of Gondor]] that talks about how the process of a siege works, the operational concerns of the Gondor campaign, and more. I also enjoyed this [[https://acoup.blog/2019/10/25/collections-practical-polytheism-part-i-knowledge/][explanation of what the practice of polytheistic religion is actually like]], which will ring all sorts of bells for people who read the Less Wrong sequences. And for a more challenging series, a look at [[https://acoup.blog/2019/08/16/collections-this-isnt-sparta-part-i-spartan-school/][what Sparta was actually like, what's inaccurate about its modern reputation, and where that reputation came from]]. Also of relevance to this community, the author has built an index of the articles by what [[https://acoup.blog/resources-for-world-builders/][would be useful for world-builders]].
