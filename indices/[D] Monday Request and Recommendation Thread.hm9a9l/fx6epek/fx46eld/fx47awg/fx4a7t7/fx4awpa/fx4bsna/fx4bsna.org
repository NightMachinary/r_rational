I used to love the WoT series. I read it as it was coming out (the latter half at least), and reread it several times during that period. However, what I eventually came to realize was that about half the books/plot don't really serve a purpose in the larger narrative.

You could completely remove several major plotlines (each of which took up at least one full book, and parsts of others) and all it would do is help make the story clearer.

The series has cool worldbuilding (with a host of interesting cultures, creatures, locations , history etc.) and an interesting system of magic, but that's about all it has going for it. If that's enough for you, great, you'll probably enjoy it. But you if want good characterization, decent writing, lack of unnecessary angst, and plots that make sense, well.....there is a reason that I haven't gone back to it since it finished.
