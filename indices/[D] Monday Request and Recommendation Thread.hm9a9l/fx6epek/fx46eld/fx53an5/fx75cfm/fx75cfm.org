  I'd love to see someone here take "maintaining the codebase of the thousand-year-old ship you and a million other people depend on" and run with it as a real ratfic, intended solely for entertainment value.

Someone actually did write that. It was about nonbinary computer programmers, and partway through the main character discovers a subculture of people who hew more closely to the binary and enjoy having sex. Or something like that. I don't remember the title though. It was hosted on Archive Of Our Own.
