I am looking for self insert fanfiction that focuses on the SI having realistic expectations. They just want to survive whether it's by laying low or by a accumulating power. A lot of self inserts are crack or they go out of their way to ingratiate themselves with the canon characters to have a happy go lucky adventure. Not my cup of tea. Fix-it is fine as long as it's for personal well being and not because they feel sorry for someone. Worm self inserts have a free pass because they got to play Peggy sue fix it to stop the sword of Damocles IE Scion for killing them in 2 years.
