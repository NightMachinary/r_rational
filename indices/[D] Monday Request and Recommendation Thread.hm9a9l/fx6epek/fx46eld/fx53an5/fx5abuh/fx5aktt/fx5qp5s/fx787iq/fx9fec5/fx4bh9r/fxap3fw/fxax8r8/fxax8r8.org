[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28639/as-the-godking-wills][As the Godking Wills]] of the same author is even more rationally adjacent story. The premise is that there is real omnipotent god above the government of theocratic empire, and the leadership should follow every command of the god to the letter, or else... It happens that the god is cruel, immature, not caring and like to issue a lot of commands. And then not issuing commands he is making disasters, just for fun of it.
