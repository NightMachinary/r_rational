I remember watching the first few seasons of Lost and liking it. Maybe it's time for a rewatch.

I remember I started Elemental Arena and got a bit past where they explained the whole thing is a game that a human "referee" came up with to test if they were worthy of ascending or something, which seemed really weird. Might be time to pick it up again.
