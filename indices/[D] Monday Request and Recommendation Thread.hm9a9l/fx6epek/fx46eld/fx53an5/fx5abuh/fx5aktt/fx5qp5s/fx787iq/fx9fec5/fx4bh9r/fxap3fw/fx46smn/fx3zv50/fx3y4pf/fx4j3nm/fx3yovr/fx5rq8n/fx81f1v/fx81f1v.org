Ok, this recommendation is a bit adjacent to what you are looking for. “Alone” is a history channel survival reality tv series where 10 contestants are left alone to survive in a wilderness environment. The last remaining contestant wins 500k. Contestants are able to bring 10 items from a list provided by the show as well as 45kg of camera equipment to self document their time. Full disclosure I've only seen the first season.

Seasons 1-2 are on amazon prime. Seasons 3-6 are on hulu. Season 6 is on Netflix.
