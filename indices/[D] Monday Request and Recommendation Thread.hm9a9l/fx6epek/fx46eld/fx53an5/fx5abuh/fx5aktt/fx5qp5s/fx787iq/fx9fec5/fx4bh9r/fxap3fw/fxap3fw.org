Blessed Time is a relatively new story on Royalroad and scratches my time-loop itch. It's set in a fairly normal LitRPG fantasy world - with classes, skill levels and such. On their sixteenth birthday, people are given a gift from the gods. This gift is a supernatural (or in low level cases preternatural) ability. Once gifted, they also get access to classes, a status screen and the other LitRPG elements. Some people don't get gifted and there's hints this creates a discriminatory caste system but that's not been developed much so far.

The central idea is the main character has an ability called Blessed Return, which sends his mind 5 years into the past. The ability then has a 5 year-cool down before it can be used again (so he can redo events multiple times but his 'redo window' only ever moves forward). This is a rare Mythic class gift, making it very powerful and very sought after. When he travels backwards in time, he looses his class but keeps his skills - resulting in progress across loops.

I'm really enjoying the story. It's written at a fairly fast pace. Normally I'd think it's too fast but it's really needed to make use of it's five year time loops. It jumps along, highlighting important moments before skipping forward months or years. This means we actually get to see the MC take advantage of multiple loops and it's enjoyable seeing how differently they can go.

I recommend people give this story a read, if not now (as I said it's new with only 23 chapters), maybe in a couple of months.
