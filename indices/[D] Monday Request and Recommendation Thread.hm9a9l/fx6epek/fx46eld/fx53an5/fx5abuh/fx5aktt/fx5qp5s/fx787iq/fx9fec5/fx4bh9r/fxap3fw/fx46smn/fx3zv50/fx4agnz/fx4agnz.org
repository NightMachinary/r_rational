I like this story - it falls in to a sibling genre that's sort of like "competence porn"; I like to call it "reasonableness porn".

The basic idea is, instead of killing the monsters why don't we talk to them?

And the classic example is Ankh-Morpork's approach to warfare: let them in and sell them stuff.
