It's not just the year. Anti-intellectualism is on a sharp rise, right wing authoritarianism is ascendant in several western countries that should know better, China is murdering/suppressing over a million of its own citizens(and no one is doing shit), corporations are dominating the political discourse to their own stupid, short-sighted ends, and above all else there is climate change, on which only the most milquetoast proposals are actually considered and implemented.

You say Africa is going to be the next southeast Asia, I say a good part of it is going to be increasingly uninhabitable in 20-40 years. 50+ degree summers, extreme and unpredictable weather patterns and water scarcity is going to result in tens of millions of displaced persons in Africa, maybe hundreds of millions worldwide. And it's going to be blamed(correctly) on the west.

What is this a recipe for? I don't know, but I think the effects are going to be as bad as the causes.
