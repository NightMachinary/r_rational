Author of the Elemental Arena here. Thanks everyone who has read and is discussing the story here. It is true the MC is intentionally flawed, but he does have a character arc with growth. The flaws are not glorified in my writing. For instance, his "white knighting" is a knee jerk emotional reaction that immediately results in him getting his butt kicked, and chastised by other characters he respects and wants to be respected by. He recognizes his mistake, and makes changes immediately, growing his viewpoint as he learns more about the nuances of the situation. The changes to his brain and thought processes by the Mental stat growth is a recurring theme of the story.

  If this was a book where editing could happen or the author was brave enough to go back and change it I'd give it a shot. That's one of the problems with webfiction, in a book the beta readers would point this type of thing out and it'd be removed from the root. On webfiction it's very difficult to remove it.

As of right now, I am working on an edit of every chapter posted so far. Even before now, I have already made a major edit and update to the most problematic chapter referenced indirectly in i_choose_magikarp's feedback. I would recommend checking the story out in a couple of months once the full updated chapters are posted.

One of my major goals in posting the story online was to receive feedback on my writing in order to improve and execute my ideas better. Since I completed the first book last week, it seemed like a good time to take a short break and do some editing in between working on the second book.

Mainly I will be focusing on improving the prose, removing repetitive sentences and ideas, and tweaking the dialogue to sound more natural. Additionally, I will be pruning back a few of the problematic scenes, and toning down some of the initial romantic flirting.

The characters are still flawed, that is intentional to some degree and definitely a matter of taste for the reader, but hopefully my execution will continue to improve.
