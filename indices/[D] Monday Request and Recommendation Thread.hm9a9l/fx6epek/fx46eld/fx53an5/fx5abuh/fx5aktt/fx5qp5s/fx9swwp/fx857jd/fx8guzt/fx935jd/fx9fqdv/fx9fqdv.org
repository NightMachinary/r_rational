Agree to disagree. I think a rational study of current trends can only lead to a dire outlook, short, medium, and long term. I didn't even go into the inevitable great depression that's on the horizon, where we can expect around 10% contraction of the world economy this year. Who knows what that will mean for 2021...

And while you're right that being depressed due to pessimism does no one any favors, the world could use pessimism more than it could use the status quo of willful ignorance and baseless optimism, imo.
