It's not 'rational' in any of the definitions commonly used here, but I do think it's the kind of webnovel most posters here would enjoy: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31429/cinnamon-bun][Cinnamon Bun]] is a fun wholesome litrpg-lite about a very nice girl isekai'ing into your typical system-sy fantasy world and getting by on sheer enthusiasm, disarming niceness, being adorable and a special eponymous class that she got for the first three.

It's a very chill, pleasant read.
