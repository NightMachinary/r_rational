The first thing that came to mind was the light novel Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka? (So I'm a Spider, So What?). Although, it does take a while to get to the human-creature interaction stage.

Other than that it's pretty similar to the snake report (or really vice versa) in that protagonists are both human minds in the body of (mutant) animals, in a dangerous dungeon.
