Thanks, might give it another spin eventually. I do think it fell into the common web serial trap of not introducing any characters or stakes for way too long. The system itself is also pretty incoherent, she gets a (presumably pretty strange) class for doing a little dance within ten seconds of appearing in the world? Her reasoning about moving on to the next dungeon level, rare in that she actually stopped to do some small amount of thinking, was notably bad, and, though I stopped reading shortly after that, I have to assume her poor strategic thinking was handsomely rewarded. I was down for the premise, as far as it went, but that dungeon is chapters and chapters in.
