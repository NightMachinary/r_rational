Hm, well one contemporary poet that's very well-acclaimed is Sharon Olds. Her most famous poem is potentially [[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47057/i-go-back-to-may-1937][I Go Back to May 1937]], and my favorite collection by her is Stag's Leap.

I also enjoy Louise Gl√ºck's work, though it's a bit less accessible --- she heavily references mythology and can be sometimes very abstract. My favorite collection of hers is Averno, and an accessible poem of her's is [[https://drunkenlibrary.com/2019/01/09/nostos-louise-gluck/][Nostos]].

You might also check out Kenneth Koch, whose New Addresses is a collection of modern odes to surprising topics. I really like [[https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2009/09/04/to-my-twenties/chronicles/poetry/][To My Twenties]].
