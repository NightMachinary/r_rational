I've tried to find good male SIs as well. Here's a few that I enjoyed. They don't all follow OP's premise though.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13398050/1/Going-Native][Going Native]] is a great DBZ/DC crossover with a dubious SI who reincarnates into Tarble. It's a well integrated crossover and has some really good galactic politics.

- Brockton's Celestial Forge has the SI be a shard, and is from the pov of the bearer of that shard (which comes with the powers of the celestial forge, basically nerfed inspired inventor). It's a good way to avoid the pitfalls of the usual SIs, plus the main character actually has a character. Slow paced but picking up speed.
