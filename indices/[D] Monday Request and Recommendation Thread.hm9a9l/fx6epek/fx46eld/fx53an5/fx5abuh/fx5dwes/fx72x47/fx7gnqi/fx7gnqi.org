In my opinion, "Plasticity" has some important qualities that set it in a different category from crack fics.

To me, crack fics are ones that frequently disregard realism and internal consistency for the sake of humor. "Plasticity", on the other hand, realisticaly portrays the internal lives of its characters and the consequences of their actions.

The humor comes from the clash when the main character's futile struggles conflict with the expectations of her captors and sometimes lead to absurd results. While the situation is deadly serious for the people involved, it comes across as humorous to an outside observer. Thus, rather than being a 'crack fic', to me the fic falls into the separate category of 'crack taken seriously'.
