I've been reading a lot of /Naruto/ SI fics recently, so I can recommend some of those.

The /Naruto/ universe has an apocalyptic future on a similar scale to Worm, so in my opinion 'fix it' stories in that fandom would also benefit from your free pass. That being said, all of these fics are ones I like because they don't indulge in any of the typical 'fix it' stereotypes:

These two are set in the past before /Naruto/ canon:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/][Sanitize]] - A doctor reincarnates in the Warring Clans era and gradually changes the world by introducing modern medical practices.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10564973/1/The-Clan-of-Samsara][The Clan of Samsara]] - An entire clan composed of people who reincarnated from Earth throughout history.

The following fics are closer to the canon timeline but only touch on it peripherally. Each SI is a civilian who has to deal, in various ways, with the harsh realities of living in a world dominated by ninja.
