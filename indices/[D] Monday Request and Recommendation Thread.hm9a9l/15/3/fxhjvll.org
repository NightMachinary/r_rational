Brandon Sanderson does magic system exploration well. In most of his books, the magic systems are used to their potential. His writing on earlier works are kinda stilted, but he's gotten better each book.

For quick punchy reads, try Vlad Taltos and Dresden Files and Alex Verus. Alex verus is perhaps the darkest of the bunch, but each series consist of quick 300ish page books. They also have some nice audiobooks.

For long reads, you can't go wrong with Steven Erikson, Glen Cook, Robin Hobb, or Janny Wurts.
