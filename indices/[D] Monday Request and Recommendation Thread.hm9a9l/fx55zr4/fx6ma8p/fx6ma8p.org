Roger Zelazny (prominent new wave scifi author of 60s-90s, known for /Amber/ and /Lord of Light/) wrote some pretty good poetry, most of it early, before he moved on to prose.

Unfortunately, it's not super easy to get your hands on it these days; I just looked for an online source and failed to find anything good. It was originally published in small, limited-run collections that [[https://www.amazon.com/Spin-Miracle-Poetry-Roger-Zelazny/dp/0934438498][go for a lot]] used these days. It was reprinted more recently in the [[https://data.nesfa.org/press/Books/Zelazny-Project.html][Zelazny project]] omnibus volumes, which are easier to get, but they're expensive. Maybe you could get them from a library, though.

If you do manage to get your hands on a source, poems of his I recommend:

- To Spin Is Miracle Cat
- Spring Morning: Missive
- Song
- Lobachevsky's Eyes (this one appears in his novel /Doorways in the Sand/)
- To His Morbid Mistress

/edit/ [[https://libcat.ru/knigi/fantastika-i-fjentezi/kiberpank/57724-roger-zelazny-to-spin-is-miracle-cat.html][Here]]'s a sketchy Russian website with a bunch of them.

Found a source for the full text of one, so here's a sample:

--------------

*Song*

When I learned the other day

that everything Emily Dickinson wrote

can be sung to the tune

of "The Yellow Rose of Texas‚Äù

I was crushed.

It was true.

I can no longer read Emily Dickinson

but Lone Star ghosts flit across the page,

the Alamo is not forgotten

and I hear the thundering hoofbeats

of the great horse Silver.

.

I wondered then

whether every person who pens a poem

has a tune,

a secret melody which will destroy him

if the word gets out.

A small thought, perhaps,

not quite as profound as it sounds;

and those who fool with /vers libre/

should be safer than most.

Yet the notion nags.

There's an awful lot of music in the world...

.

To be trapped by John Cage

or crushed by Leadbelly

would be bad enough.

But I have this nightmare

of being done in by a hymn.

If /Rock of Ages/ gets me in the end,

mocked Emily's diamond eyes

may sparkle like the dew

in stillnesses that lie

between the words and the Word.
