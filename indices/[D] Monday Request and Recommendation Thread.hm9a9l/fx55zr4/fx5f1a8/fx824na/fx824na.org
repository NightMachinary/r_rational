I recently started reading Dune, as one of the sci-fi classics, and was very surprised: it has much more of a a fantasy feel to me. I knew that was going to be part of it but was still surprised. I would recommend it for the world building, but I think age and the permeation of its tropes have hurt it in terms of reader enjoyment.

Working through "classic" literature has made me deeply suspicious that 99% of people talking about and recommending them haven't read them at all or at least within a decade. It might seem obvious but the historic/classical parts of these stories tend to be very minor parts of them.
