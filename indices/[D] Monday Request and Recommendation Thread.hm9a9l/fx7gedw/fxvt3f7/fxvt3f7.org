I would strongly recommend Max Gladstone's /Craft Sequence/ pretty strongly to anyone on this subreddit.

It's set in an alternate world that vaguely resembles a magitech ealy-mid 20th century. The basic premise is that magic is generally based on belief and life energy, but about a couple hundred years before the "present" people figured out how to quantify and rigorously manipulate it. This left to a huge war that resulted in the new style of magic triumphant, creating a world where magic resembles modern financial and legal instruments, with the major players essentially acting as multinational corporations.

The first book is about competing teams of necromancer-lawyers competing over which faction gets to resurrect a deceased god that died because it over-leveredged its belief and didn't have enough power to survive an unexpected contractual obligation.

In general, the books are thoughtful and imaginative in ways that should appeal to folks that like this subreddit. They tend to examine modern issues through a lens of magic in ways I've not really seen any other author do.
