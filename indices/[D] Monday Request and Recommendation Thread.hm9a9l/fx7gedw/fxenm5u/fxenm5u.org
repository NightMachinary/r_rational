Good audiobooks that should appeal from looking through my audible library:

Murderbot.

Thessaly series by Jo Walton.

Baru Cormorant

N. K. Jemisin the broken earth

Ann Leckie.. pretty much everything she has ever written.

Marie Brennan the lady Trent series.

All of the Brandon Sanderson books in my library have top notch adaptions, but be warned, they are bricks in text form, so the audio books are very, very long.

Jacqueline Carey also gets the platinum adaptions, and Santa Olivia is a very fun romp.

And for some lightweight humor (but humor very on brand for /rational) off to be the wizard by Scott Meyer

And having said that, it occurs to me that Terry Pratchett is likely very well produced too, but since I read most of him in dead tree format, and the rest as ebooks I cant make promises.

Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was originally a radio play, and thus works fantastically well in that format, but I presume you have already read it.
