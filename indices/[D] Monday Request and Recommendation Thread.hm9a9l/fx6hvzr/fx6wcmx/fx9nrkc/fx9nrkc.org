Yeah, I don't mind them been enjoying Blue Core (other than the kinda awkward harem elements, but it's not that bad) and tried the puns one but got bored when They go into the next dungeon, since I'm in it for the human interaction, not dungeon exploration. Most D.Core stories focus too much on the development for my tastes, I wish they could just skip all the prologue and getting-to-know the interface parts and just do the fun societal interactions. XD
