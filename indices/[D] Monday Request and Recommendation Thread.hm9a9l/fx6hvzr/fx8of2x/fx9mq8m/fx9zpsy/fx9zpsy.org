I said both of the books were masterpieces, just that I Liked the start better. I really like it when he interacts with people, as the stream of consciousness stuff gets old as time passes by.

This is my interpretation of the events you described. I don't understand everything, but it doesn't seem random. I just don't think we have enough information about the underlying mechanics to know what happened.

Swordmaster Zane interrupts the Elves' blood magic ritual by killing everyone. This is a bad way to interrupt a blood magic ritual, because it just makes more blood. This ends up overloading whatever the spell the Elves were trying to perform on the Snake. Blood magic is powered by some sort of deal made with past generations or Gods or something. Somehow, The Snake gets into the air, and is looking down on these Gods (collectively known as Chaos) from above. They like him because they know he'll be the Enemy of the World and do all that crazy stuff with the giant frog god and I guess that's pretty chaotic. But don't like him because they think it's too soon, so they hit him with fire and force(?), to try to attack him, but only push him up higher. Eventually pushing him up into space. Then he falls back down to the ground on another continent. Presumably saved by the cage erected for him by the elves. I'm not sure why his magic was messed up, but everything messed up had to do with the earth (assuming the messages were some manifestation of the Voice of Gaia). Possibly his connection with it was severed after he travelled far enough, or the ritual blocked it.
