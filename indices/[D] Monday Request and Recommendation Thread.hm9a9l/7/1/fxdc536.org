I'd say it's worth watching if you have Disney+. The musical being filmed makes it so that some elements of the play are being lost in translation. Part of what I loved about the musical was the choreography of the background dancers, and when filmed, naturally the cameras will focus more on the main characters and you don't get all that's happening in the background.

This might just be me, but the emotional moments just didn't hit like they did the times I saw it live. Again, I think it's just a difference in the medium where if you see a live performance you will will be more engrossed and not be distracted by your phone or anything else.

I'm a huge Hamilton fan so I still enjoyed it quite a bit, just if you get a chance in the future, try and see a live performance. It's a great story where Hamilton is both the protagonist and antagonist and his ambition is both his greatest strength and weakness while Aaron Burr is set up as a foil to highlight Hamilton's strengths and flaws.
