I watched it, and while some parts of it were a bit weak, the best parts were truly powerful and executed masterfully. The music is also really great as I'm sure you heard. It does have a few historical inaccuracies, but none of them are plot-breaking.

Really, for a time investment of ~2 hours, if you have Disney+ then you should certainly watch it. Cost to reward ratio is very low here.
