That's kinda general. My goto recommendations are [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game][Ender's Game]], and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60926.Lilith_s_Brood][Lilith's Brood/the Xenogenesis Trilogy]] for books, although I just finished [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report][The Snake Report]], and that was really good (the third book has yet to come out).

For TV I'd recommend [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][Hannibal]], [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/][The Americans]], and [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][Avatar: The Last Airbender]]. And for anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note][Death Note]], [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica][Puella Magi Madoka Magica]] (if you choose to watch this, make sure to stick with it until at least the 3rd episode before deciding to abandon it), and [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/37779/Yakusoku_no_Neverland?q=the%20promised%20neverland][The Promised Neverland]].

Edit: also, recently watched the Hamilton musical, and that was amazing (it was recently released on Disney+).

Edit2: A bit controversial I'm told (not in the culture war way), but I really liked [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online][Sword Art Online]] too (but /not/ the second part, I'd recommend stopping after episode 14, and going no further).
