Just finished [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report][The snake report]] which reignited my yearning for stories where the MC is "*mentaly but not physically human*".

Any more recommendations for more stories like this?

Almost anything is fine (translated/manga/anime is fine too, but I probably read/watched most of them already and unfortunately none up to the quality of The snake report) and I am specifically after HUMANS reincarnated/transferred whatever into non-human bodies, (so not like Mud's mission where the MC is not actually human).

Also ideally one where the MC actually does interact with the human population and is not just stuck in a dungeon the whole time or something. - I don't know what is so appealing to me about just reading the reactions of normal people to intelligent whatevers, and for some reason just the meaningless kindness of something which normally wouldn't do so makes me feel so happy.

I asked last week, but didn't really get any answers for what I was after so wanted to try again.
