- 1632 series. A town is transported from Virginia ca AD 2000 to the middle of the thirty years war and begins uplifting surrounding towns and nations.

- Destiny's Crucible. A chemical engineer is accidentally abducted by aliens and transplanted on an alien world with humans and a 1600s tech level.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31377/an-advance-in-time][An Advance in Time]]. Medieval uplift, but seems to be on hiatus.

I don't know if AI uplifts scratch your itch, but some good ones are:

- Bobiverse series.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human][Post Human]]

- Crystal trilogy by Max Harms
