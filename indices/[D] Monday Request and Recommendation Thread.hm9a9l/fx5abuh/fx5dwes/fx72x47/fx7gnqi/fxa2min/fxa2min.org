Ya exactly - IMO the difference is that normal crackfics have insane versions of canon (e.g, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/taylor-has-a-strange-hobby-yandere-taylor.860167/][Taylor Has a Strange Hobby]], or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/][Seventh Horcrux]], or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13472966/1/Sasuke-Uchiha-and-the-Power-of-Lies][Sasuke and the Power of Lies]] (the last two are by the same author, what can I say they do a great crackfic)); Plasticity is largely true-to-canon, but the SI gets put in to crackfic-esque situations /because/ the canon characters are so insane.
