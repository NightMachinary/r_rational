Sort of, yes. You don't need an in-depth understanding of the canon plot or characters, but some aspects of the story make a lot more sense if you have basic familiarity with the backstory and setting.

When I read it, I only had vague memories of what Hollows and Shinigami were in the anime, so I used the wiki to fill in the blanks whenever the fic touched on something I didn't know.
