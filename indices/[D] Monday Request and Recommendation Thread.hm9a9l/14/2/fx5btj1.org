The first book of Dune is great. The second and third are quite bad (Although if you do like them, you should definitely read more Philip K Dick). Some people claim to like the later books, of which I think most were eventually written by Frank Herbert's son. Anyhow, my rec is to go read the first book asap and then pretend there were no others.
