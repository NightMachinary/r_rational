Speaking for myself, I enjoyed the /Dune/ series thoroughly when I first read it, and I've continued to enjoy it every time I've reread it over the years. It's not a matter of nostalgia goggles, not remembering the details, or thinking of the books in a historical context: /Dune/ is just as good now as it was ten or twenty years ago.

It's not hard scifi by any means, which is probably why you think it's closer to fantasy. I enjoy stories across the whole spectrum of the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness][Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness]], so I don't see that aspect of Herbert's setting as a negative.
