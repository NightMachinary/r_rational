I personally found that the length of the books and the size of of setting they try to depict became grindingly difficult halfway through. Like, taking 6 viewpoint characters and separating them, swapping between them between chapters, building up a story and cast around each of them that is as big/complicated as an ordinary ensemble in its own right...kinda just tired me out. Not to say that there aren't amazing moments in each one of the books, but it sometimes get buried under the weight of everything else.

And also, as much as I think Sanderson is a good author, the last book was almost entirely gibberish to me. Maybe from being worn down so far by the preceding books, maybe from the way the plot is executed.

Overall I think the series has lots of great ideas and characters, but getting access to all that is far from free in terms of mental work.
