It probably peaks around books 4-6 or so. Good worldbuilding and pretty memorable characters. The plotting doesn't really shine. I actually think the first two books are pretty weak, so the best is still ahead of you. It does get appreciably worse by the end of the Jordan segment, to the point where ther's a whole book you should just skip toward the end, as literally nothing happens. The Sanderson send-off is tolerable, though, if you'll need closure.
