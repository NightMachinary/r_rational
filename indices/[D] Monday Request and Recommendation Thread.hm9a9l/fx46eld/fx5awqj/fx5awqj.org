I would say that it does get better. And then worse. And then better again, and then worse again, and then better again.

There's space for it, after all.

Book 4 is where the world really starts to open up. If book 1 is the honeymoon phase and book 2 is the "honeymoon is over" phase (and book 3 doesn't fit well in this sequence), then book 4 involves a lot of getting to appreciate your spouse as a person. And then things go sideways for a few books, and eventually start to go sideways-of-sideways.

Anyhow, I'd say the boring is worth the payoff of the exciting - often these are side-be-side, particularly in books 9-10. And then Brandon Sanderson comes in and more or less cleans everything up in books 12-14.

The antagonists will never be compelling or competent. The books, despite all the fighting, are not about Rand al'Thor defeating the forces of evil. They're /about/ all the backstabbing intrigue and personal growth of the characters that happens along the way of Rand al'Thor defeating the forces of evil.
