I don't mind the "farmboy becomes hero and defeats the supreme evil" story, especially fresh takes on it. As I stated in the linked comment; that's a good way to start out with a relatable protagonist, introduce the reader to the world, and provide a steady raising of stakes throughout the narrative.

It's the execution and the journey I'm having problems with; the protagonists (especially Rand) are always on the back foot, and the antagonists aren't compelling or competent.
