For long book series where each book is quick and punchy, you can't go wrong with Vlad Taltos, Alex Verus, or Dresden Files.

Vlad Taltos is about a fantasy mafia leader/assassin. Alex Verus is about an urban mage with short range precognition, and Dresden files is about a wizard in modern chicago.
