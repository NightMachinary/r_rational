[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52382796-sh-gun?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=4MYseDdSOV&rank=1][Shogun by James Clavell]], about an englishman shipwrecked in Japan in 1600, based on a true story. Truly one of the best "stranger in a strange land" stories every written. Keep in mind that it's only loosely based on real events, and some of it has not held up that well.

Anything by [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/545.Neal_Stephenson][Neal Stephenson]], still my favourite writer despite flubbing his last 3 books(imo). Easy mode: start with Snow Crash or Diamond Age. Medium: start with Cryptonomicon or the Baroque Cycle(trilogy). Hard mode: start with Anathem(my favourite, but very divisive).
