I read all of Neal's books when I was still in high-school. I loved Snow Crash, Diamond Age and Cryptonomicon.

I don't terribly remember the Baroque Cycle, but think I liked it. At that time, Anathem didn't connect with me, but I'm thinking about revisiting it.

As for some scattershot recommendations spanning a broad range of Genres with some relatively unknown and other quite popular:

Book (nonfiction): The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements by Sam Kean. My all-time favorite book.

Book (Fiction): Probably the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. I'd recommend either starting with the Night Watch series of books or one of his YA standalone novels, Nation, which is a masterpiece. Good Omens is also a good stand-alone novel.

Korean Webnovel- [[https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/flow/list?title_no=101&page=1][Flow]] by HoneyB. My favorite complete korean webcomic. It has a setting in which everyone gets a wish from a gaurdian god but you have to pay an equivalent price. It's quite well done and I especially like the ending.

Finally, as someone is highly involved in rocketry, [[https://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/ignition.pdf][Ignition]], is a story of experimental rocket propellant chemistry and is quite a good read.

I've watched a few movies recently and found most mediocre, but liked the Apollo 11 documentary, Parasite, Knives Out and 1917.

Finally, I would recommend Waltz with Bashir which is an animated war documentary film.
