Well, [[/r/rational]] fad [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Woman's Political Record]] actually fits in to this request - the MC essentially takes Hitler's place in a somewhat alternate history WWII (there's magic, but it's restricted enough that it actually doesn't affect history that much - special forces units can fly, is basically the main difference).

Being the isekai reincarnation of a modern Japanese salaryman, she obviously doesn't go for the whole "blame religious minorities" and "genocide as an industry" thing, leading to a much less horrifying not-Germany in the alternate universe.
