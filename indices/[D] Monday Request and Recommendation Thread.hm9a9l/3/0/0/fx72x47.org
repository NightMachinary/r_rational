I'll have to de-recommend Plasticity. While it /is/ true that the main character is mainly focused on surviving in a world full of unstable murderers no matter the price... the fic in general is more of a meandering, demented dance between 'full grimderp' and 'full crack' that broke my SoD within several chapters and only continued to get more absurd with time. It's not /bad/ per se, but it's definitely not 'laying low', 'accumulating power', or being 'realistic' in any way. Well, there's something to be said about how 'humor' is a part of real life too, and so 'realistic' in its own way, but, at least for /me/, Plasticity goes way beyond that and into the 'crackfic' category. I liked some of it, and would recommend it in other contexts, but definitely not in this one--while I can't really speak for the OP, I get the feeling they're looking for something more down-to-earth.
