I read *[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][Hear the Silence]]* recently, which is a Naruto SI fanfic that would probably fit. The SI's goal in life is basically to die of old age with as many friends and family as she can manage to bring with her. Unfortunately, the story is pre-canon and starts near the beginning of the Second Shinobi World War. Since the story is set so far in the past, most of the characters are original by necessity, though canon characters are mixed in. For example, the SI's parents are original, but her brother is canon.

The main character is born into a very minor clan, with her mother being the only surviving member at the time of her birth (her father married in). She doesn't have a kekkai genkai. However, her clan can acclimate to different poisons they come into contact with, which lets them prepare and use poisons more liberally than other shinobi. So she has a few advantages to leverage, but isn't in a particularly special position to start with.

Unfortunately, Naruto is a story about child soldiers, and this causes a fair amount of trauma for the SI and the other characters. Dealing with trauma is a major reoccurring theme of the story, in fact. It can get a bit angsty, to be honest, but if you can get past that it's pretty good.

The story is quite long at 675k words, and progresses slowly but steadily though the years. The SI regains cognizance at around one year old, and has thus far made it to the age of 13 years old.
