I'm two books into the Wheel of Time and... does it get better?

This isn't exactly the place for it, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hm4a3c/what_books_did_you_start_or_finish_reading_this/fx42rp5/][I've posted my thoughts elsewhere on the first two books]], and the TL;DR is that I'm not particularly impressed, especially given the popularity of WoT and general praise I've heard directed towards it.

I'm probably going to read the rest of it, either way, but I'd like to know how to calibrate my expectations.
