It's a conventional fantasy, in that it follows the "farmboy becomes hero and defeats the supreme evil" to a T. If you don't like it by book 2 you probably won't like it later on, because while book 3 has a nice ending the books thereafter keep getting slower and slower paced, and book 10 is a total slog (which is where I gave up). However, it is a very polished and well executed version of the classic fantasy story, where you already know what the ending would be. The fun part is seeing the journey the characters take to get there. Unless you're in the mood for something like that, my guess would be that you won't enjoy it.
