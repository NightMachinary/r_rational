I've been watching anime lately. By default, it's not a particularly rational medium, but the following at least have consistent characterization.

Evangelion (Whole load of fantasy science, but covers real psychology. Picks up around the halfway point. Dubs are mediocre.)\\
Steins;Gate (Pop culture, science; will not hold up under scrutiny, but some of the science at least pays lip service to real theories. Picks up around the halfway point. Dub throws in some awkward slang occasionally, but also adapts references, and is high quality.)

Madoka Magica (Irrational characters, rational setting. Gen Urobuchi's works: Kamen Rider Gaim; Psycho-Pass; Fate/Zero, tend to fall under this banner. Picks up a few episodes in. Can watch as three movies, or a series + the third movie. Dub is great.)

Re:Zero (Realistic protagonist. Does a good job foreshadowing and keeping viewers hooked from the start. Probably my favourite of the lot. Dub is great.)
