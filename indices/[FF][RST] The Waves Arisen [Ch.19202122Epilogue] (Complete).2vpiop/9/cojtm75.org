Well. That...was a thing that happened.

My main criticism was that you clearly cut corners in order to bring the story to a close within X number of words, rather than allowing it to play out at its natural speed. One chapter power-levelling and then /surprise/, final boss? You can't /possibly/ think there won't be people who will find that incredibly unsatisfying. Other than that, great!

Edit: my most-mourned casualty of the above is the fact that the stuff /this/ is referring to happened off-screen: [[#s][]]
