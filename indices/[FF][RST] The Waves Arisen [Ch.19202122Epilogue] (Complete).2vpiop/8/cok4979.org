Nagato's actions/beliefs were quite in line with what I would expect of him from canon, while also fitting the fic perfectly. Well done.

Really, my main issue with the story is what has already been said - it needs more filler, amusing as that sounds.

It was still very, very good. Thank you for this, Wertifloke.
