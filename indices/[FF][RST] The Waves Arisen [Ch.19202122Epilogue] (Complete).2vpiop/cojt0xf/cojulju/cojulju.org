Oh I'm sure he'll get around to it eventually...

Now I want a second epilogue in the year 32,645 of the Reign of the Undying Emperor, with all of our favorite characters getting culture shock and reacting to Naruto's new position...

Kinda like the epilogue flashes after Luminosity and Radiance...
