I soundly enjoyed this entire series. I found it well-written, aggressively paced, and enthralling. I liked that it didn't dick around and pushed the plot and exposition forward quickly. I liked that it dealt with the ninja society and I liked the worldbuilding. The villains and heroes were good. Overall, this is my favorite Naruto story, canon and non-canon.

Thank you for writing and publishing this story. You did well.
