Truth. I read it all in one binge, and though lots of fanfics waste a lot of time on elements of the story that would ultimately be cut in a polished novel, this story felt a little /too/ rushed. It's a common conundrum in Naruto fanfics, I think, as many of the long stories want to start around the academy days and end with total victory over all canon enemies.
