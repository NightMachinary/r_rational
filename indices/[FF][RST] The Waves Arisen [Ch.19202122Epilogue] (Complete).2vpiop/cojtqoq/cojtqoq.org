To me, this story felt less like /Time Braid/ than like /Vulpine/--a light-hearted, recklessly-rushing, only-/semi/-awesome homage to /undiluted/ awesomeness, rather than undiluted awesomeness in its own right. Maybe it's just because so many of Naruto's super-smart schemes went over my head. (shrugs) Still--any amount of awesomeness in a story is appreciated!
