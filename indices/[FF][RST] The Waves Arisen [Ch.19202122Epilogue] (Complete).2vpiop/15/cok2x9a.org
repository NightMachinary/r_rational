No offense, but I would have preferred if you didn't include the epilogue. It was underwhelming, and Naruto's threats felt too overblown and childish. It felt silly, when the previous chapter had just left me feeling in awe (with just the right small amount of humor at its end).

I liked Hinata's genre savvy choice to not tell Naruto she loved him.
