The Shadow Council using Pein's own mind reading against him was hilarious and awesome. I can respect Naruto decision to hold off on the unlimited resurrections until he had gotten things under control, but it seems like he should at least resurrect useful allies like Kakashi or historically trustworthy people like the First Hokage to help him.

I like how Pein's plans seemed shallow/hollow compared to the way Naruto thought things out. He didn't really have any ideas that would make peace last more than a generation.

Also, I like this part so much I just want to requote it:

  “Maybe not, but you've reminded me of something important---something I think I might have forgotten lately, with all this focus on getting stronger... It's not enough to be strong, even if you do need a lot of strength to get anything done. You've still got to figure out what should actually be done, and whoever ends up with the power to fix things is going to have to deal with a lot of big questions, because we don't understand even a fraction of what the ancients knew, yet, and I don't think I can trust you to navigate a situation that requires regularly acknowledging your own ignorance. Maybe I am just being stubborn, but I make a thousand mistakes before breakfast every morning, and I've hurt too many people with my own stupid decisions to ever think very highly of my stupid little thoughts. I'm terrified that I'll screw up once I start changing things, and if you're not, then that's a weakness I can't accept in a leader. So I'll just have to beat you and do it myself.”

Excellent synthesis of Shounen determinator tropes with Rationalist fiction tropes.
