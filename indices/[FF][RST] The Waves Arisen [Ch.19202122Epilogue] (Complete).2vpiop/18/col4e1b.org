I'm not sure if I understand the mechanics of the shield technique - are spheres allowed to intersect or not? If they don't intersect, breaking three shields per second, each maintained by a different person standing 0.5 meters apart would result in 1.5 m/s of physical movement. I'm not sure if that's taken properly into account in all cases.

If they are allowed to overlap, then should it even matter that they can only surround Naruto? Couldn't you trap and squish most of the Peins by trapping them in partially overlapping barriers?
