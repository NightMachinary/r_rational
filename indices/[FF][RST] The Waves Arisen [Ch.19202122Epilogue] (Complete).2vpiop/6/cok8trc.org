I enjoyed this a lot.

My only objection was Hinata -- she stayed a plot device the whole time, with no character development and no power ups. Nothing would have changed in the story if she had been completely removed and Naruto had gotten his Byakugan by killing some random Hyuuga and then had Sasuke give Naruto the rinnegan at the end. (Sasuke had enough medical ninjutsu to do eye transplants, after all.)
