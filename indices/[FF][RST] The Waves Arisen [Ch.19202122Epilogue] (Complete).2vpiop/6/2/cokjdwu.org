I think mastering the healing under Tsunade is a pretty big achievement and reflects her level of talent fairly well. If you took away the ridiculous power-multipliers of Naruto and Sasuke, she'd probably kick their asses at that point. It's thematically fitting that she's had the most progress out of all three teammates and is the weakest. The universe (in this fic) does not grade on a curve and unfair advantages pretty much decide everything.
