Perhaps less subjectively, I feel like the implication of "the same thing we're going to do every night, Sasuke" is that Naruto will continue to have difficulties and challenges in the utilitarian pursuit of his goals, while the implication of the epilogue is that Naruto, through overwhelming strength, will soon rule everything and cause everyone to live happily ever after. I find the first implication more satisfying for epicurean reasons and also because it is more compatible with the idea expressed earlier that simply having strength is not enough and one must also figure out the troubling logistical details to be a good person.
