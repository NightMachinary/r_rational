I don't think that was Hermione (that "Griffindor through and through" said more about Merlin than her). She's from real world, and a narrator to boot. She /could/ be Sean's fanfic author (he did mention her being /no more than/ 16 years old).

Yes, Efreets are for sure their own faction here. However, I don't remember who was their narrator. Didn't it come from Haley's Pathfinder, so essentially our dragon lady?

Also, that was my gut reaction to a known genius having possibility of an access to genies. Forgot to mention they would /at worst/ have this odd, adversalial relationship, where Concept!Characters try to monkey paw on purpose.
