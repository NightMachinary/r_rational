Oh right, my mistake. I don't think she's Sean's fanfiction author--her name is Gretchen, and Sean's current narrator is Harriet. Regardless, she's explicitly using Harry Potter magic, not the system from the visual novel you linked.

Pathfinder seems to be the odd man out as far as the stories go--it's a ruleset, not a narrative. Even if Haley is the one bringing it into being, the efreets will still act according to their Lawful Evil nature. Haley made them a promise (the details of which I'm forgetting), and now they're taking their due.
