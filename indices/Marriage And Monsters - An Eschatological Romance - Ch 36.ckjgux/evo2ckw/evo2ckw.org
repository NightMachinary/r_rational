Reading this I realized throughout the work there's a lot of hyphens (-) where I'd have used double hyphens (--) -- as when breaking up a sentence containing separate but related thoughts. Not a typo really, just a stylistic observation.

#+begin_quote
  Eulogy's gonna have all our asses”
#+end_quote

Missing comma.

#+begin_quote
  /Yeah definitely video game slavers./
#+end_quote

Maybe a stylistic choice, but I'd put a comma after 'Yeah.'

#+begin_quote
  not killing any of them on principal.
#+end_quote

Principle*

#+begin_quote
  anyway. ”
#+end_quote

Extra space.

#+begin_quote
  this world operates on but you
#+end_quote

Another possible stylistic choice, but I'd put a comma after 'on.'

#+begin_quote
  “Ah, welcome back”
#+end_quote

Missing comma.

#+begin_quote
  /Whatever that was I don't/
#+end_quote

Possibly-stylistic missing comma after 'was.'

#+begin_quote
  small arms
#+end_quote

I'm not that familiar with the IP, but I think it's Small Guns (with that capitalization.)

#+begin_quote
  place 3 shots
#+end_quote

This is nitpicky, but I think the style guides would call for 'three' rather than the numeral.

#+begin_quote
  the rest of the mad max gunmen
#+end_quote

/Mad Max/ unless intentional style choice.

#+begin_quote
  Roy wasn't in immediate danger.
#+end_quote

Oh, the irony.

#+begin_quote
  “ Damn you, Emrys,
#+end_quote

Extra space.

#+begin_quote
  function of our utility . ”
#+end_quote

Extra spaces around the period.

#+begin_quote
  knowing what you know.” he said
#+end_quote

Period instead of comma.

#+begin_quote
  perhaps I can just show you” he said
#+end_quote

Missing comma.

#+begin_quote
  impact me long-term, but short- term
#+end_quote

Space between short- and term.

#+begin_quote
  we were just outside of town.
#+end_quote

Could be stylistic, but 'outside town' is correct.

#+begin_quote
  “ God DAMN it,”
#+end_quote

Extra space.

#+begin_quote
  “ OW. I don't know.
#+end_quote

Extra space.

#+begin_quote
  he killed... god,
#+end_quote

Usually capitalized, but that's between you and the big guy of your choice.

#+begin_quote
  “Did you say Merlin ?”
#+end_quote

Extra space before question mark.

#+begin_quote
  who else does the Concept have.”
#+end_quote

Period instead of question mark.

#+begin_quote
  “I don't know,” I told the little creature honestly. “I really don't know.”
#+end_quote

Yes, Haley, Sauron /does/ have the Death Star. At least you seem to have found some minty, party drug proton torpedoes! Now it's just a matter of finding the right thermal exhaust port to stick them in.

Great chapter! A few more typos than usual, but I enjoyed it a lot.

I wasn't expecting Haley to run into the Concept in the wasteland, but in retrospect it's a good thing; if she had no forewarning she'd have gotten stomped upon her return. I enjoyed Haley's reactions to Fallout physics.
