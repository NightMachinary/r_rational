Always happy to help (especially since you're so responsive about fixing typos!)

I know you have some backlog/cushion to keep up the impressive post schedule, so if you ever wanted an extra proofreader, I know somebody who would be supes excited for the opportunity to get a few chapters ahead ;) (it's me.)
