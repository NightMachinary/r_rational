I appreciate the offer- I've been searching for a way to share chapters early but I haven't found one that satisfies me yet.

There's an awful lot of plot-relevant stuff that stays fluid right up until the day of release and I feel like letting anyone read those chapters early would set the worse versions in stone mentally, so to speak.

I might start pre-publishing the next week's chapters as some kind of super-cheap patreon reward, like a dollar a month or whatever their lowest tier is. But that's going to depend on me getting far enough ahead to be comfortable with the quality of the work. Right now I'm juggling a new job and a house sale, so writing and polishing time has suffered considerably.
