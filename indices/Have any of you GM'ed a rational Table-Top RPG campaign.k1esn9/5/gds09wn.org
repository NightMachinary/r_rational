This is sort of the default way that my group runs things. We will sometimes dip into more campy Exalted type stuff, but for the most part we try to carefully ensure that things that happen in game follow whatever appropriate in-universe rules (with most second order effects thought through, exploits either house-ruled away or NPCs also exploit them, etc). Honestly, even the Exalted stuff generally faithfully follows its own vaguely narrative-driven variant of physics/metaphysics. I think that rational pen and paper games are the natural result of just sitting and thinking through the world that you are creating or running.

On the other hand, pushing things into Rationalist territory, we have found, tends to have mixed results. Rationalist villains can be fun, but need to be kneecapped somewhat or they will murder the party most of the time. If I use an actually capable Rationalist as a villain, they are almost always lower level than the party, physically/magically crippled in some lasting way, or sport other disadvantages that the players don't have. Also, since playing this sort of villain means you are actually trying to be convincing, I have to ensure that his purposes are sufficiently opposed to the players', otherwise they will just switch sides and join up (which is fun once in a while, but not for every game). You can also have two or more Rationalist villains in direct conflict to make sure the player ends up against at least one, but I personally find this tricky to do. I am not good enough to consistently and convincingly run two different Rationalist characters at the same time, especially in encounters where I have to run both in real time.

On the player side of things, Rationalist PCs tend to be either terrible, or at their very best fun for only a little while. The best result my group has was a Rationalist wizard focused on divinations and item crafting. Having a dedicated support caster plus massive information superiority let the other players punch waaaaay above their expected weight class. The DM had to escalate wildly, but ultimately he wasn't able to find something appropriate to stand up to us before we crushed what was supposed to be the primary source of conflict in the campaign. It was neat, but ultimately probably less fun and satisfying than if the campaign had run longer. At the beginning it was fun to be one step ahead, and have the power to make the GM give us extra information, but by the end it just felt like powergaming, but as a support character so it didn't annoy any other players. I guess playing a Rationalist is just powergaming but with the appropriate in-universe explanation for doing so, so I would personally recommend against it.
