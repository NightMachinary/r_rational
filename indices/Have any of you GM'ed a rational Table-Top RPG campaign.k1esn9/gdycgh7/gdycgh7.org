I'm running a pretty successful rationalist character in one of my games.

Our party is a group of college students who have been dropped into a high-magic homebrew fantasy world. We are running the game in GURPS, and our GM is running it mostly open sandbox with factions and actors with their own motivations doing their own things. When we did our session 0 and character creation, all the players agreed that we wanted to focus on solving mysteries and exploring themes of culture, technology, and power dynamics more than combat. I got sign off to make a character that would want to poke the world at its seams. (I think my exact request to the GM was something like "Can I make a character who will try to hack the world from the inside?") GM-player collaboration is especially important when playing a game that involves scientifically studying magic. We've had a lot of out-of-character conversations about how magic works beyond the game mechanics and how to close loopholes or explain why our characters would be the first to notice certain exploits.

My character, Gwen Arroway, is an extraverted nerdy former girl scout who was pursuing a CS degree and following all the rationalist blogs and had the career goal of being a science communicator. After adjusting to being isekai'd into a fantasy world, she has made a printing press, has started teaching math classes, made amateur radios, has started work on getting support to upgrade the city's water system, and has nearly gotten the whole party killed by correctly inferring a secret the gods of the world want to keep hidden. Just last session she was leading the party and NPC allies through a goal and planning workshopping session. (We frequently joke that we aren't playing GURPS, we are playing "minutia simulator." But hey, now we have a solid goal that the whole party can agree to.) Her end goal is to make a transhumanist utopia, naturally.

Another character in our party, Ivan, is inspired by the mad scientist archetype. He isn't really rational, but he is an excellent materials engineer. He has made chlorine gas bombs, a rifle, nylon armor, and bicycles. His motivation to uplift the world is purely so that he can have good lab equipment again to better investigate magic. Or he would like to fight and take the place of one of the gods so that he can skip needing to interact with other people. Whichever is easier.

Our third PC is Iris, a pre-med student who wants to eliminate illness and cure the veiltouched (people who have been changed by the Dead God's magic).

Last but not least, the PC who keeps us all in check: Libby, the "ethics committee." Libby is an anthropology student who has to periodically remind the other PCs to listen to the NPCs and to think about the implications before, say, soliciting blood for iron distillation in a world that is conspicuously devoid of iron ore and were "iron" is a strong swear. (I'm talking to you, Ivan)
