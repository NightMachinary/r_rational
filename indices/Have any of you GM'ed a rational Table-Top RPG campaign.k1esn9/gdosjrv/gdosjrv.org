I'm not the GM, but I'm in the process of playing an [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/archetypes/paizo-investigator-archetypes/empiricist/][Empiricist]] [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/archetypes/paizo-investigator-archetypes/natural-philosopher-investigator-archetype/][Natural Philosopher]] in my current Dark Sun campaign (both [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/][Investigator]] archetypes stack). He's an excessively educated man in the middle of a desert apocalypse, which serves as a pretty delightful contrast to the rest of the band of murderhobos I've fallen in with.

- [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/magic-traits/precise-treatment/][Precise Treatment]] + [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/conduit-feats/healers-hands-conduit/][Healing Hands (Conduit)]] (and soon [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal/#Heal_Unchained][Signature Skill (Heal)]]) has obsolesced the cleric, show-casing the power of secular healing.

- Empiricist + [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/social-traits/student-of-philosophy/][Student of Philosophy]] allows most conversations to focus on facts and evidence rather than Charisma.

- Natural Philosopher helps fix the fact that otherwise I'd probably just die in the desert by giving me survival skills and better alchemical crafting abilities. Given it is such a low magic setting and we're mostly going to have to build rather than buy, this has been a godsend.

In terms of the meat and potatoes of combat-focused gameplay, because you still have to survive: He's mostly battlefield control using Combat Reflexes w/ a longspear and cestus, which lets me fumble for extracts and still maintain reach. The cestus will go obsolete as higher rank extracts come online and I spend more time under Alter Self or Monstrous Physique I. Longarm offers good battlefield control, Expeditious Retreat is used mostly to run around and cut off retreat, when combined with reach and combat reflexes.

Plot shenanigans gave me a jumping spider familiar (Novelty!), who chomps an occasional [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/adhesive-spittle][Adhesive Spittle]] infusion to great effect.

There's lots of cheap alchemical toys that help fill in for situational benefits. Powder to find invisible creatures, silver weapon blanch to hit undead, smelling salts to get the brawler up, nepenthe to offer said brawler extra saves when they inevitably get mind controlled, smokesticks when too many things start sneak attacking or shooting arrows at squishier party members.

At 5th level Signature Skill comes online, the brawler gets [[https://aonprd.com/TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Resilient%20Martyr][Resilient Martyr]], and the cleric dips a level into [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/vitalist/#Collective_Healing_Su][Vitalist]] for collective healing, and Healing Hands becomes a couple hundred hp a day, spread over the party wherever we need it to go, and it just keeps scaling. The doctor is in.

There's also something to be said for being the skillmonkey/face, as you get forced to choose the direction of the party for a lot of things.

The campaign itself isn't particularly rational, but the doctor has been very fun to play.

Now I just need to figure out a way to stop all of the sorcerer-kings, fix that whole death thing, and restore Athas.
