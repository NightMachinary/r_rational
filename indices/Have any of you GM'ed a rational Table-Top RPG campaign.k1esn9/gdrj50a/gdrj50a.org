The notion of GMing a rational TTRPG is absurd. The rationality of the campaign is not up to the GM in any meaningful sense. You can make a campaign setting with verisimilitude, and you can reward clever thinking, but if the players /want/ to do the rational thing or don't know how to figure out what the rational thing to do would be, you're not going to be running a rational campaign.
