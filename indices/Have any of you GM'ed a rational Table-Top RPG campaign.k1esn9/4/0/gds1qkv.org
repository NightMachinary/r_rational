he's probably talking about the world that the GM creates behaving in a rational way. in that respect, the rationality of a campaign is solely up to the GM. for example, if a player finds an exploit that gives infinite salt, he can't use it to make infinite gold because either that would crash the price of salt, someone more powerful would come and try to take it away, or this discovery is already in use and the price of salt actually reflects the price of refinement/transportation/taxes or whatever other factor beyond just obtaining the salt itself.

a rational campaign is, to the best of the GM's ability, a living world instead of just a bunch of rooms with mindless monsters that throw themselves at the players with no thought given to why they are there in the first place. the players don't really have to ask why the goblins are in that particular mine, but what makes it rational is that the GM knows why, and if he is a good GM there will probably be some natural reward for the players for finding the answer.
