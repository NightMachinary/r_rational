Not enough swift actions, ah ha ha, I ran into the same issue. There's a feat that lets you enter a style feat as a free action.\\
Kirin style is terrible.\\
You could spend the first round drinking an extract and studying a target. Let them come to you, trip them with your spear, then drop the spear and savage them.

Style Shifter is cool! The wildcard slots mean MoMS is a good dip.\\
Keep in mind, you have to choose a style that matches your a shifter aspect. With MoMS, you can have a (bad) animal style and a (good) other style.

I think that [[https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Outslug%20Sprint][Outslug Style]] would be your best option, unless you can get Pounce.\\
If you can, then use [[https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Charging%20Stag%20Style][Charging Stag]] Style to get more charge options.\\
You could try [[https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Street%20Style][Street Style]] but you'll need a magic item to avoid opportunity attacks from the bull rush. Perhaps your GM will let you pick an urban animal with this style. [[https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shapeshifter%20Style][Shapeshifter Style]] is quite versatile.\\
[[https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Jabbing%20Style][Jabbing Style]] could add a lot of damage, if it applies.
