Unfortunately, the 'bonus style feat without prerequisites' can only give you the first feat in the chain. [[https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Kirin%20Style][Kirin Style]] is of type (Combat, Style) while [[https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Kirin%20Path][Kirin Path]] is just (Combat).

The Kirin Path idea is pretty nice. I'm surprised that it can be used every round. It seems very powerful. I suppose the 12th level requirement means you'll be flying half the time, which makes this much less useful if you don't have a great Fly skill check.

There's a swashbuckler archetype that gives you panache based on your intelligence.

The Lunge reach with Outslug Sprint is nice, because you can start making full attacks from 20 ft away (10-ft step and 10-ft reach). You'll have to drop the polearm at some point in every fight, if you want to make attacks with both claws.
