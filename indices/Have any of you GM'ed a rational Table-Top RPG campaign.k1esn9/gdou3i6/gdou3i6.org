I've DMed a homebrew campaign before. It's a lot of work building the setting, but that part is manageable with extensive prep time. The hard part is improvising the story while keeping things rational. I've found that a lot of the time what is rational isn't always going to be fun for the players, and for personally, I found it more important that my players actually enjoyed themselves.

Another issue with improv is that you don't have the time to consider the greater ramifications of whatever it is that you are creating. For example, you simply don't have the time to consider whether it actually makes sense in the setting for your AI dungeon custodian to accompany the players on their journey in a small and compact chibi form in order to continue to watch over the dungeon relics that the party had looted.
