Yeah, thats how I DM too. tbh not sure if calling it a rational TTRPG is quite apt, as that seems to imply something in particular, but what I do is basically write down some major events to create a narrative around, and give the NPCs involved their own agenda and interests, consider how and why people would be involved (which implies a lot about the economical circumstances of a location) and just set the players loose in that. It works pretty well for my group, but to be fair my players like social challenges like that and don't mind going a session or a few without any combat. It took a bit for them to get used to my style, but they do have taken to it and enjoy the depth of the world around them. *Really* depends on the group though.
