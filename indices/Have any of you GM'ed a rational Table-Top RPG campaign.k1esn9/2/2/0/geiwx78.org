The rough part is that Orator is a feat that requires another feat while Student of Philosophy is just a trait. Worse, you also have to take Skill Focus, which eats yet another feat slot just to get 3 non-combat skills, admittedly, through the roof.

By comparison Additional Traits: Student of Philosophy and, say, Bruising Intellect can be taken for the same slot, and the Intimidate will stretch to cover combat uses, leaving you a feat left over, for say Combat Reflexes or Enforcer (so that Bruising Intellect can get used basically every round in a fight if you fight non-lethal), and you can slide those back into base traits to free a feat slot if needed.

I realize you pulled Skill Focus off of Half-Elf, but a Human build would get a bonus feat in its place. Arguably that /could/ juggle things so that your base build was cheaper.

Humans get an alternative racial trait (Focused Study) that lets them take Skill Focus at 1, 8, and 14 in exchange for their starting bonus feat. This basically offers you an eventual rebate of the 'ante' feat you needed to make Orator work half way through the campaign, and in the end game even gives you an extra one. OTOH, the loss of elven immunity hurts with low wisdom. -- I wound up 18/14/10/20/6/6, due to game-specific point buy shenanigans, so I'm even worse off on than you on that front.

(I also didnt have the room to fit anything around Bruising Intellect, so I didn't take it as it doesn't stand on its own well, and I don't have a way to run Improved Unarmed Strikes in the build.)

I'm winding up straight Investigator through 4. Then I'll dip once I have Studied Combat to help rebate the loss of BAB.

At that point I have a few options.

One of the weirdest and most non-standard ones I'm considering would be to dip Wild Effigy Style Shifter for one level adopting a boar minor aspect (for situational Diehard, we get hit HARD by way above CR level fights) and taking Snake Style w/ Form of the Snake. That'll let me basically ignore one attack per round, due to my over the top Sense Motive, and by using alternate shifter claws I can net gore/hoof on top of the claw/claw/bite from Alter Self (Lizardman), brings me to 5 attacks per round before the brawler in the party even gets their second iterative, and if the gore/hoof hit, the opponent is flat-footed for the remainder. Studied Combat applies to all of those attacks, and eventually VMC Magus at 7 will give me Arcane Accuracy /also/ applies to all of those attacks for each use, while letting me boost damage on the spear to +1 +1d6 fire/cold/electric or +2 as needed to get through DR when the fight isn't just a bunch of mooks. Compare with just going straight to 7 Investigator where it isn't until 7th level when Monstrous Physique (Thri-Kreen) will give me 4 claws and a secondary bite, so it mostly just moves up my combat effectiveness by 2 levels.

The natural attacker build is a bit of a trap, though, as Shifter is an /awful/ class, and is hardly worth going 3 levels in to get the ability to claw through DR/magic/silver/cold iron.

This invites possibly retraining at 7 to drop the shifter level at the same time I retrain to bring online VMC Magus. VMC isn't PFS legal, but the GM is willing to let it into the campaign. A +5 to all attacks for a round several times/day and the ability to pop my spear up to a +2 weapon (or +1 +1d6) in such a cash poor campaign is hard to deny, and both class abilities offered by VMC Magus way outclass any 2 feats I could take at 3 and 7. Spellstrike at 11 is harder to justify, but then so is going deeper into Investigator than 3rd level extracts.

If I go deeper on melee combat I'd probably keep the trappy Shifter level. If I have to retrain to go more into magic for campaign reasons I'll probably drop it.
