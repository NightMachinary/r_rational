On the minus side. No ninja vanishing moves. (I had vaguely recalled there was something that kept you from skipping to the end of the chains. I just didn't remember what it was.) It looks like Kirin Path isn't happening in the scope of a campaign that will probably wrap before level 10 then.

On the plus side, since I wouldn't be spending so many feats this leaves me enough room I might be able to keep the VMC.
