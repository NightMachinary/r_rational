The first two are Teamwork Feats, so the ally has to have them, too. The third needs me to become an ifrit. Neither of those seems likely to happen in this campaign. =)

Cloak Tricks (Distracting Cloak) is good, but hard to bluff that hard in combat with a 6 CHA. Then again, I suppose I'd be better at it than our brawler, who this level just got forced to take [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/brawler/archetypes/paizo-brawler-archetypes/snakebite-striker/#Snake_Feint_Ex][Snake Feint]] with /2 CHA/.
