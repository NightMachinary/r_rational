Shapeshifter Style has the problem that it only really applies to one attack in the round. 10' climb is kind of situationally useful, but the natural armor enhancement bonus collides with the wild effigy one.

Charging Stag runs into the problem that I don't have /that/ amazing of a CMB so the add-ons don't help much, and if I'm charging I'm not full action attacking.

Street Style has a huge problem:

I'm going to be spending a lot of time out in the desert.

Outslug does look quite passable, if I could get Style Shifter and keep going Brawler: +1 AC, +1 to damage with the two shifter claw attacks that'd count as unarmed for the purpose of the feat via style shifter, but I think I'd need to go pretty deep. Taking 2 5' steps off Outslug Sprint would be huge on a very tactical table like the one I play at. When considering I'm most often set up the poor sap stuck running into enemy territory so the Snakebite Striker brawler in the group can flank, I could see a lot of use. Also, if I had enough Charisma to make better use of Dodging Panache via stacking [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk/archetypes/paizo-monk-archetypes/kata-master/][Kata Master]] on Master of Many Styles I could be quite difficult to approach.

Devil's advocate is that one could do much the same repositioning (if only using it for flanking purposes) off Kirin Path as a reaction to them stopping anywhere within reach of the longspear/longarm. With all the natural attacks, I do more damage to whomever is trapped within my reach unable to flee due to the spear.

Heck, Kirin Path + Kata Master's deed's giving Dodging Panache would mean after an opponent inevitably 5' steps in to try to get a full round attack by wading slowly past my spear, dodging panache would let me walk away after they try their first hit as an immediate action. Now, their round ends, but they are still within reach of the longspear, so I can move up to 25' to get behind them to flank or to force others to approach me through the longspear, while it is still their action. Sadly this uses up an immediate for dodging panache and an AoO for the Kirin path, eating into my damaging opportunities and you'd have to focus on that one enemy, so its not good in a mob situation, but it /is/ some fancy footwork. Also, with my Charisma I'd only have 1 point of panache, but with snake style on my gore/hoof/unarmed attacks can count as one handed piercing weapons for recovering panache, so maybe it wouldn't be bad. I hit hard enough to get a lot of killing blows.

Another odd option which I'd never really seriously considered is style-skipping to get to [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/indomitable-mountain-avalanche-combat][Indomitable Mountain Avalanche]]. In a setting with jumpy gith and thri-kreen trying all sorts of acrobatics, it might help me to keep reach w/ longarm and the longspear, but time spent pushing is not time spent killing from an action economy perspective.

I've been trying to think of ways I could justify a more martial build than I'd originally planned.

One thought is to go Wild Effigy Style Shifter at 5, then zag immediately over to (Kata) Master of Many Styles for 6 and 7. That'd give me two more out-of-sequence / out-of-level-range style feats, and a style shifter form. Combined with the bonus feat at 7 it'd open up a bunch of options and make a huge dent in my saving throw deficiencies.
