Taking Natural Philosopher cost me free Lingustics/Spellcraft in favor of free Heal/Survival. Trading magical trap finding for Knowledge (nature) driven crafting/herbalist checks and free inspiration on Survival is probably not something I'd do in a regular campaign, but in Dark Sun it has proven to be pretty key; both are pretty situational to the setting I admit.

I'm legitimately curious, have you been able to use your Orator pumped skills much in practice in your game so far?

MoMS has been a key component in a bunch of my theory-craft builds. The problem for me here is the dip is expensive (it is a bit better if the GM would allow it Unchained, where it doesn't cost BAB). There are annoyingly few ways to add in your natural attacks to a the various cost-effective flurry-/spell combat- like attack options, none of which are sufficiently cheap in my eyes to actually use. And at 4-7 are the highest damage options I know of for a STR investigator run off Alter Self/Monstrous Physique. This is what is leading me towards the weird Shifter dip.

Style Shifter also skips style feat prerequisites just like MoMS and Unarmed Fighter, and gives full BAB like Unarmed Fighter or Unchained Monk while offering better saves than the fighter (an extra +2 to Ref, matching Unchained). In addition it ensures the style feat applies to the two natural attacks granted by the Shifter Claws class feature. This has the nice side-effect that if I take shifter claws from a minor aspect that allows appropriate "alternate shifter claws" they just stack with the other Alter Self (or skinwalker) natural attacks, without demoting everything to secondary attacks like taking a single (improved) unarmed strike or normal attack does, or not getting them at all like in a flurry of blows. (Gore/hoof from Bear or Bull are then the only real options that give two non-claw/bite alternates, with Bull's +2 enhancement bonus wasted in the presence of oft. better enhancements being available later though). The major cost is that shifter claw damage doesn't scale up like a monk's. (You could take Shifter's Edge to make it scale, but the rest of the class is a steaming pile of garbage..)

Wild Effigy stacks with Style Shifter and trades in a bunch of other useless class features (wild empathy and later stuff) for DR 1/adamantine (better than nothing) and a +1 enhancement bonus to natural armor, helping a tiny bit with awful light armor AC, and more fully front-loading the class into level 1, priming it for a dip.

One difficult part for me has been seeing how to fit style feats into my action economy. Move actions to study combat are at odds with getting a full-round attack action or taking full-round healing hands actions, so I really need to go with Quick Study to get them to be swift, but now that displaces the swift action to dip into a style, unless I limit my ability to enter a style to the same round in which I take standard actions to quaff an extract. But I also need to worry about losing that swift action to taking an immediate reaction to activate Snake Style. I could go Crane or Kirin Style, which might give a more reliable defense (and let me skip casting Shield in more fights), and avoid the worry of burning an immediate action to get defense. When stacked with Form of the Crane, Crane actually finally becomes good, but I didn't have room to take the traits that would actually fully remove the downside, and Kirin becomes more situational on needing saves and having one big bad in a fight and doesn't stack with a corresponding 'Form of the'. Taking something like a level of MoMS after Style Shifter might work to let me stack, say, Kirin w/ a style that /does/ benefit from the Style Shifter forms, though. Hrmm.
