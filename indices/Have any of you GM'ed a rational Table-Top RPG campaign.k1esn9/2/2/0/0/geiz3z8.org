1 extra skill point or hit point per level is equivalent to a weak feat, in the economy of trading one resource for another (toughness and a few other feats related to Favored Class Bonus).

I like your way as well. Reading that character was quite compelling.\\
I chose the Orator route because I'm able to add inspiration to Linguistics without spending an inspiration point.

If you go the Human [Focused Study] route, then you can take SF: Linguistics at level 1 and take SF: Knowledge at 8 to qualify for [[https://aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Student%20of%20War][Student of War]], which can add INT to armor class, /instead of/ DEX.

Re: your edits. You can get a free style feat without meeting the prerequisites, from either:\\
Monk (Master of Many Styles) nets you two style feats at levels 1 & 2, and lets you use both of them at once.\\
Fighter (Unarmed Fighter) gives you one style feat, but has full Base Attack.\\
Both of these classes also give you Improved Unarmed Strike for free.
