Slight pushback on this: priding oneself on 'secular healing' in a setting with obviously functional magical healing, making a Mother of Learning reference with your familiar and being Int-based instead of Cha- or Wis-based are all not particularly rational - that's just taking surface level features of rationality as it manifests itself in the real world and inserting it into the game world. Which isn't to say that the character isn't rational in other ways (the fact that they're using reach weapons to avoid getting into melee combat, practicing self-sufficiency and environment-appropriate skills, trying to foresee their future needs and acquiring supplies that will satisfy those needs and identifying the magic-induced environmental collapse of their current planet as a serious problem all point to a character for whom reason takes the wheel), or that you're playing the character wrong. It's just that those specific examples aren't really good examples of what a rational character in Dark Sun (or any other D&D setting) would actually do compared to the other things you could have been highlighting.
