Strongly agreed on all fronts about the mixture of superficial and actually rational elements in play.

Re: my overly glib comment on secular healing: He observed that his ability with the Heal skill was just barely keeping up with the party's needs. It supplemented the cleric, but an hour out of combat to Treat Deadly Wounds? Where do you ever get that much time? At the time it was basically just a good investment of a couple of skill points on a character with all too many for yet another skill check that can't fail due to stacked bonuses. Spending a couple of levels talking to the thri-kreen cleric about the nature of religion, (which in athas focused around elements rather than gods) and after witnessing a rapid series of plot-driven events involving a huge outpouring of energy from the dark sun version of the elemental planes, I was able to justify that he had an idea. Healing Hands is a form of directly channeling positive energy, so it acted as a sort of entry point to trying to figure out how to directly manipulate mana. At the same time it offered a sort of in-game munchkining of diverse systems to keep everyone around me alive at the expense of the usual party structure. Now the others are getting into it: the brawler is getting very good at power-napping, because I heal in combat as if you got a full day's rest. The cleric has been able to focus on being a full-fledged combatant, and is losing a level of spell progression to maximize the ability to spread that healing around, because it'll have way too much overflow healing to make efficient use of the resource. Between it and working on how to manage overlapping field of reach with the rest of the party it pretty much tripled the CR of the encounters we were able to handle. I meant to focus on this aspect, but it was lost a little when I dropped into info-dump 'talk about your character' mode. Splitting off the bit about the actions the others are taking made it feel a bit disconnected.

Mechanically, the familiar exists primarily because she helps with my AC (+2 from Bodyguard before boosts). The choice of spider was basically to maximize dex for the number of uses of Combat Reflexes for taking Bodyguard actions, which is the highest for a stock familiar, and she will act as a hitpoint well at 5th level via Shield Master, covering for my poor starting CON. This is the same level the cleric dips vitalist, so her hitpoints and mine become /mostly/ interchangeable. Both help compensate for potentially fatal weaknesses to the core character build.

As for other things I can be highlighting the game hasn't had long enough for me to accumulate enough exploits. There's also the balancing act unlike when playing a CRPG between munchkining and optimizing for other players' fun at the table, which has left me with building abilities that primarily enhance the rest of the party's effectiveness, while trying to steer our overall course in a way that yields progress towards his goals.

Right now, he is trying to figure out ways arcane magic can be used without defiling, which mostly focuses on trying to figure out what is true past a huge pile of cultural biases. Here is where his efforts have shined through the most: The familiar and a mending cantrip (shockingly useful in a land of bone weapons) are about the extent of his direct dabbling in the arcane, but his initial progress focused on extracts, infusions and alchemy were a more effective experiment. He is exploring what it means to infuse things directly with energy from the planes, which led to his style of healing, and provides a logical progression to the next step on the character's path.
