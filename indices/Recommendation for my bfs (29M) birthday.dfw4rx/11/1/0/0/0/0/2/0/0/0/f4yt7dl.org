So, I began writing about Sanderson before I realized I was pirating his books (I've since lost my copies legally purchased) and honestly, it became a mess where there was no point to what I was writing. So I'll keep my opinion succinct, if you still care.

a)Magic Systems and World Building do no a good story make.

Sanderson wanks about how his magic systems are internally consistent, and his first mistborn novel is all about the cast showing off their powers only to be useless and outshined by the protagonist, who has them all.

She then proceeds to defeat the ultimate boss by an asspul. And the guy before that. And the guy before that too - She gets powered by a god for... reasons in the first book, is 'faster than a guy seeing the future' on book 2 and on book 3, as a god, fighting someone with aeons of experience over her and stated to have more power she.... gets angry because love interest dies. Then beats said god.

Then, we come to his 'Worldbuilding' which is done by rule of cool. You have Mistborn, where there is a large theocracy, with a 'living god' as it's ruler, and two strata of people - Skaa ('slaves') and the nobles.

This is where it gets wonky: the above Living God made (through ass pul magic sans limits) the two people's different. But that ends not mattering at all when the plot needs.

Large parts of the plot is the Living God not wanting skaa and nobles to interbreed - for reasons which are stupid. Why didn't he make them unable to conceive - he made wonky ass magic people too - the plot needed it.

You need to infiltrate the court of said living god (whom are outright the highest richest nobility?). Said nobility are said not to speak to their slaves directly. So the plot sends Mary Sue... I mean, the protagonist, a street rat who was /consistently/ underfed (but not only flip flops on the trust issues of her life story) but also looks like the best fed nobles and manages to speak like them too.

Then you have the more egregious flip-flopping. Interbreeding is a no-no, to the point our protagonist is hunted over cities (before they even find out she has powers). This hunt is led by a minister of the Living God, who is an absolute, undisputed monarch who sometimes engages in noble wars... to maintain his grip, or because he finds it fun because we're told he could level cities if he wanted to.

But the noble houses constantly engage in intermarriage to try and get superpowered people. Constantly. It's a major plot point in book two even. This going right under the ruler's nose, in his city. The main thing he is worried about.

See, the 'world-building' and 'magic system' fall apart under scrutiny. And it's no me being nitpicky, those are major plot points.

b) Sanderson cannot write characters who are deeper than a puddle.

His characters are not consistent if they have any depth - Vin, the protagonist of the mistborn series, flip flops between trust issues and risking herself for people she barely knows.

When his characters are bad, they're bad - even if it makes little sense for them to be. And if they're good, they're good.

The dude who betrays our anime protagonist du jour seems to lead the life of an honorable man. But because he is eeeeeeeevil he needs to be truly and completely evil. He couldn't have been motivated by a momentary weakness. He is evil, and gives in to the god of Evilness.

Or just morally myopic - his fans bitch about a character named Moash being angry at the nobility and killing a king - when said king had his grandparents unjustly imprisoned by said king and died under exposure by the prison conditions.

Then you have characters who are so evil to go counter their interests, like a merchant whose name escapes me - who wants to betray the government that gave him rights (and it's under siege) for... the posssiblity the other government might let them keep them. No agreement, no nothing.

Part 2 tomorrow.
