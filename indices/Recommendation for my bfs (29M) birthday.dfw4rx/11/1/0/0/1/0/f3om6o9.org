  She's being groomed to become a shard and so can draw on the mists.

Right, the shard who had lost coherent thought at that point. And whom was barred from helping her for most of her life due to an earring. And who was later shown to be unable/unwilling to kill the Lord Ruler but seems completely okay with it as the PLOT SAYS SO. Right.

This either contradicts the book or she is a Mary Sue. Either way is fine by me.

  Plus she was trained by Kelsier and his crew. Reach doesn't matter much when you can shoot off like a bullet by pushing on a nail.

'Trained' aka have conversations with a bunch of stooges who are later useless in every other book including the first, including the super genious plan of being murdered in the daylight in front of a million witnesses by the guy with infinite propaganda powers is going to somehow inspire some people. Because a guy seeing a bald copy of a guy at night is going to counter that.

Kelsier is a moron.

Except she fought mistborns and won against a guy that could see the future BECAUSE SHE WAS QUICKER THAN THE FUTURE.

Vin pulls power out of her ass as the plot demands. She kills a god whom she previously couldn't move against because she got angry.

  Dalinar is an overprotective honor bound father and has been since Adolin was around 13.

Sure. And there was no opportunities for this guy who is always with girls to get laid even once, in the middle of a large camp? Right. It's not like there are slaves or anything.

Except you know, having sex before marriage is evil because Sanderson is a mormon and we can't have our heroes do that. And people who are evil are completely so. Which leads to him being charmed by talking about shitting mid-dinner.

God that was cringe.
