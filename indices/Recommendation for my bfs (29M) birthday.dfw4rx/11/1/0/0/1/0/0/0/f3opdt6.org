  Kelsier's plan It inspired people because the plot said so. Kelsier's plan is completely and utterly moronic. And again, thousands saw his bitch ass being killed in front of the Lord Ruler opposed to a few that saw the sponge guy pretend to be him. How that would have gained any traction if the LR was still alive is beyond me.

When preservation imprisoned ruin he lost most of his conscience as we're told. Doesn't stop him from interference as the plot demands. Hell Lord Ruler was taken over by lol powerup.

Yeah let's return to the moral sense of morals. Drunk conquering asshole isn't a rapist despite a harsh world making women commodities in real life... why exactly? Dalinar should be a-ok with rape. He is not for reasons.
