I looked up their stats in the rpg. Zane has 10 steel and 5 pewter, and Vin has 8 pewter and 6 steel. In a steel pushing contest she will lose, but in a brute speed contest she might win.

She convinces him to do something dumb, charge against her. Because her physical magic is stronger she's able to out speed him.
