The goal was to inspire a revolution and kill him, which Vin did.

  When preservation imprisoned ruin he lost most of his conscience as we're told. Doesn't stop him from interference as the plot demands. Hell Lord Ruler was taken over by lol powerup.

Leras wasn't exactly especially smart. His sacrifice clearly did something. 1% of his remaining intellect may be enough to sorta function.

  Again, Mary sue is quicker despite reach/strength and seeing the fucking future despite being malnourished. .. why exactly? Dude had the same magic as her.

She is stronger than average because she can suck in the mists and does so several times, and pewter is much more important as to her reaction speeds than her body. Zane's main strength was in steel, he was never an especially good pewter user.

Plus, Pewter was reducing her malnutrition.

  Yeah let's return to the moral sense of morals. Drunk conquering asshole isn't a rapist despite a harsh world making women commodities in real life... why exactly? Dalinar should be a-ok with rape. He is not for reasons.

Rape historically had very harsh punishments, there was no universal consensus that it was ok. Some people like Sadeas would definitely be fine with it, but many would not.

People do have morals even in harsh worlds. Philosophies and religions are often against rape, and Dalinar became extremely religious after murdering his wife.
