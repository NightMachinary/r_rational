Depending on what he /likes/ about rational lit, he might enjoy some Neal Stephenson books, like Cryptonomicon or Anathem. They're fairly rational, and very introspective/thoughtful (that's actually the main reason I love rational stories - they tend to include a lot of introspection because the authors are thinking /about/ what the characters are thinking).
