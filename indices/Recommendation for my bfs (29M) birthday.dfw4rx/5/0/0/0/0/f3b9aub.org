It depends what your deal-breakers are. The protagonist acts basically like the protagonist from The Martian pretending to be a woman, i.e. is not remotely plausible as a woman. Also Andy Weir and the other characters are all way too amused by how slutty she supposedly is. The plot itself contains no glaring holes, the science is sound, and it's all interesting enough. If you can look past the lameness of Jazz herself, it's an okay read.
