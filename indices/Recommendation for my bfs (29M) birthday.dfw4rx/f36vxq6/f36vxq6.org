As a fan of rational fiction, something that caught me completely by surprise was the DIRE series, starting with DIRE: BORN. It's rational adjacency and style of humor hit all my “spots” in a very satisfying way. Has the added benefit of being something not on many people's radar, so it's less likely he'd already have read it.

As a related aside, you may want to check that he hasn't already read/listened to the works recommended here, before investing. If he's significantly into this style already, chances are not too bad that he's read things like Sanderson or The Martian, for example.
