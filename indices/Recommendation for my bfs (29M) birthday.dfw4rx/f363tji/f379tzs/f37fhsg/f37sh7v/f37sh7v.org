Yeah, I really should. After all, a girl who never had enough food would develop just like a highly fed, weather-sheltered noble - Vin, sans formal education, her speech patterns would be the same as a nobles, and of all things, she'd be the best assassin there is because she is small and fast? Nevermind that reach, muscle mass or whatever should influence proportionally. That is just mistborn.

The stormlight archive has a war-like society, that has lower strata of slaves, plebeians and nobles. And yet a highly prolific womanizer, attractive and wealthy noble would still be a virgin (and be wooed by talking about shit), due only to the fact that Sanderson is a mormon.

Listen, I get it, the guy is prolific and has a great work ethic. Does not in any way make me wrong. I like some of his animesque fights - he just isn't rational.
