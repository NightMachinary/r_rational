Well um, I'd like to call both of you out on your tone, then, haha. Paxona, I appreciate that you elaborated calmly with only a little initial sarcasm in your follow-up comment; I suppose I didn't highlight that very clearly in my own reply. LazarusRises -- I hope you understand the issue I take with your first reply :(
