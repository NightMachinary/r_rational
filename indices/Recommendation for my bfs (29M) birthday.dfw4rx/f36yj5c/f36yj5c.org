I wanted to point out the distinction between 'rational' and 'rationalist' fiction - illogical characters are realistic, and totally belong in a rational story as long as they are illogical in human-accurate ways. If those also bother him, he probably is into the more specific genre of rational/ist/ fiction, which is mostly about rational people having plot in a setting filled with largely irrational people. HPMOR is an excellent example of that.

Oh, and if he loved Methods of Rationality, I heartily recommend the continuation-fic "Significant Digits". Not something you can really get him as a present, unfortunately :-\
