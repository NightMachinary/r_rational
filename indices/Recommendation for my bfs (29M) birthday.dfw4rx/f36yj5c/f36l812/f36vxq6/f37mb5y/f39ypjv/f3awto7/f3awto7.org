Wow, thank you for a great answer! There is a lot to consider, but the way you described The Traveler's Gate trilogy feels pretty spot on! I'm a bit unsure about the fact that it's a fantasy, I don't really know how much he enjoys those. He's definitely more of a well-made scifi guy, but I really like the twists the author does on fantasy clich√©s that you mention.
