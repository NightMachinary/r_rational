Epic fantasy of the best kind. He's written a few different fantasy series all set in the same universe (the cosmere), each with a magic system informed by a different set of rules. All magic systems are knowable & discoverable by characters in the stories, and characters always use the magic available to them in consistent, creative, /badass/ ways.

The Stormlight Archive is set on the world of Roshar, which is periodically ravaged by huge Highstorms that travel east to west, damaging everything in their path. The whole ecology & society is structured to deal with this (all cities are built with heavy fortifications to the east; all animals & plants have shells they can withdraw into for protection; etc.) Highstorms also carry with them a powerful magical infusion called stormlight, which can be used for various enchantment/transmutation abilities focused through devices called fabrials; there are also myths of the Knights Radiant, who could absorb stormlight and use it for varying magical effects based on the oaths they swore. Emotions and concepts can also generate tiny magical beings called spren--a wounded person might spawn painspren like little crawling hands, a victorious general might have gloryspren pop into existence like tiny golden orbs around his head, etc.

It's very, very good.
