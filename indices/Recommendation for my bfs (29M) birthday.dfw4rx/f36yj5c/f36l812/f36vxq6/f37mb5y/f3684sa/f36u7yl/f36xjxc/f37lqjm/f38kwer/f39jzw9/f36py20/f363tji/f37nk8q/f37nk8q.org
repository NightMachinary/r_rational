I pretty much fit this description, and the best book I've read recently is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]].

It's still unfinished, and it's free, so probably not the best recommendation for a present, but it's insanely good.

For a present, there's [[https://www.audible.com/pd/Rationality-From-AI-to-Zombies-Audiobook/B076ZY6Y9C][Rationality: From AI to Zombies]]. It's not fiction, but it's written by the author of HPMOR, and if your boyfriend hasn't read it yet, he'll probably appreciate it.
