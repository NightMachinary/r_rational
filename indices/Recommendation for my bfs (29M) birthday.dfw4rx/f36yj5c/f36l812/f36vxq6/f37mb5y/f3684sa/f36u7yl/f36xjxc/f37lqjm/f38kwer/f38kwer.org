Given that he has an background in programming, I might recommend UNSONG. It's definitely not everybody's cup of tea, and to really GET it it helps to have a background in both Jewish mythology (preferably Kaballah-specific) as well as computer programming, but the people that like it tend to really enjoy it.

Basically, the world *used* to run on physics (thanks to an angel, ironically), until Neil Armstrong took a spaceship up to the moon and accidentally cracked the crystal sphere that holds the stars in place. Now the world runs on God, and by invoking the Names of God you can cause things to happen. The main character starts the story working at a "theonomics corporation", which researches, discovers, and trademarks the names of god in order to make a profit.

The whole thing is a bit silly, and while the setting may not be rationalist the characters are very consistent and the consequences of the setting are played out in a rational and consistent manner.
