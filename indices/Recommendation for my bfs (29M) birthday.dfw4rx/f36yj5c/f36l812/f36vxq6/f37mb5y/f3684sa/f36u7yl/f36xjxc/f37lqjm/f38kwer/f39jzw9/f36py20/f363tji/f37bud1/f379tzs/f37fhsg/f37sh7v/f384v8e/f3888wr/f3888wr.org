Well, I wasn't planning on starting a discussion, but I am more than happy to explain why Brandon Sanderson is a poor writer, if there is interest.

He has work ethic, but he produces subpar work - with no consideration to how his world's should work and be internally consistent, nor is he able to remove himself for Christian morals. And by christian I mean Mormon. When I am home for work I'll expand on it if you have any interest.
