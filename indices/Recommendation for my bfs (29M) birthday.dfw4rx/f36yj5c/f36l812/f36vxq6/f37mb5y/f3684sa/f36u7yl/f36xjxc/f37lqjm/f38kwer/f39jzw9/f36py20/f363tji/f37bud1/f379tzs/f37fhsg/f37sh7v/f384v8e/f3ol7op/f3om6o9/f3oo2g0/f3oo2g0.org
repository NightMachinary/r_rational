  Right, the shard who had lost coherent thought at that point.
#+end_quote

The shard was sort conscious ish and communicated with them often and did things, and had powerful long term prophesy powers to plan her birth.

  And who was later shown to be unable/unwilling to kill the Lord Ruler but seems completely okay with it as the PLOT SAYS SO. Right.
#+end_quote

He wanted his champion to take over. Lord ruler also opposed Ruin, so Leras didn't innately oppose him.

  This either contradicts the book or she is a Mary Sue. Either way is fine by me.
#+end_quote

Vin is very power fantasyish (As is common for many popular fantasy heroes) but not especially Mary Sue. There are many deeper characters around her fairly blank personality the reader can imprint on, and they don't obsess over her or relentlessly praise her like Mary Sues typically get.

  'Trained' aka have conversations with a bunch of stooges who are later useless in every other book including the first, including the super genious plan of being murdered in the daylight in front of a million witnesses by the guy with infinite propaganda powers is going to somehow inspire some people. Because a guy seeing a bald copy of a guy at night is going to counter that.
#+end_quote

It did inspire people, and worked well. Having shapeshifters around people don't know about is useful.

Also Lord Ruler isn't an especially good propagandist. He generally doesn't care much about most things going on in the empire unless they impact him.

  Except she fought mistborns and won against a guy that could see the future BECAUSE SHE WAS QUICKER THAN THE FUTURE.
#+end_quote

No, she won because she was a better fighter than him and was faster with pewter. She acted based on what he did, creating two atium shadows, and he could only respond to one of her shadows.

Zane could have beat her, but he charged straight at her so her superior speed let her overcome him. He picked a strategy that let her fool his atium.

#+begin_quote
  Vin pulls power out of her ass as the plot demands. She kills a god whom she previously couldn't move against because she got angry.
#+end_quote

The idea that power shapes your mind over time is a continual theme in the book. She hasn't had her mind shaped very long, and so can act against her instincts.

#+begin_quote
  Sure. And there was no opportunities for this guy who is always with girls to get laid even once, in the middle of a large camp? Right. It's not like there are slaves or anything.
#+end_quote

He could get laid, but he self sabotages and it's a bit harder than average to get laid. His father is also against rape, and probably against him sleeping with a commoner slave as a violation of protocol.

Other characters have sex before marriage, as I noted in my link. Wax and Lessie say.
