He doesn't actually read that many books, and he's talked to me a lot about e.g. hpmor (actually got me to listen to it too), so I'm pretty confident that he hasn't read them, or he'd have mentioned them. But it doesn't hurt to check, I agree! I know he's read The Martian, I'm not sure about Sanderson. I'll definitely try and subtly check before getting him one.
