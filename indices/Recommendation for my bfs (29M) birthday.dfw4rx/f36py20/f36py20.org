Some recs:

- I'm partial to Graydon Saunders' Commonweal series,
- Dexter Palmer's Version Control
- Pratchett puts me to sleep (but maybe gives me good dreams :)
- Not a complete book, but I'm quite partial to Alexanderwales Dark Wizard of Donkerk. Although it certainly has its flaws, the core concept is something that really appeals to me, personally.
