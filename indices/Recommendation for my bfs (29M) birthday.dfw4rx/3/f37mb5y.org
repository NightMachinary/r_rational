More rational-adjacent, but I really enjoyed the Cradle series of books, and by the same author, The Traveler's Gate series, which I'm relistening to right now.

Traveler's Gate is fantastic because, all in the first book, it takes several fantasy cliches, and flips them all on their head, perfectly, with perfect interactions in how things are different. The main protagonist isn't actually the chosen one, but there is a chosen one, and he's not actually unhelpful. There's a princess, but she's not actually in danger, and she's actually quite competent. The antagonist in the first book isn't actually that bad, and there isn't really one particular person/group that I'd call the bad guys.

The book is a perfectly executed car crash in slow motion. Most books like this have a ton of irrational bits that cause the story to fall apart on further inspect, but Traveler's Gate doesn't. Every single event and motivation makes perfect sense, which is the hallmark of rational fiction, beyond the surface level sci-fi bits that usually adorn the genre. The first book is amazing, and funny, and incredibly well executed. It's an amazing story.

And the other two books in the Traveler's Gate trilogy are just like the first. They're amazing, and they portray the direct consequences of everyone's actions in each earlier book. Exactly how rational fiction should be. This is all on top of a neat magic system, which certainly helps, too.

Cradle is more of a [[/r/progressionfantasy][r/progressionfantasy]], which is somewhat adjacent to [[/r/rational][r/rational]], more about having a good and rational system of power levels in fantasy, which are satisfying to watch the protagonists learn about. More so than the shitty versions of the genre, LitRPGs. I like this series, and the author releases a new book every 6 months or so, and I'd definitely recommend it, but it's not as obviously rational, though the protagonist does have to be pretty clever to get out of some crazy situations.

Both of these have great audiobooks. TTG is read by the author, who's surprisingly good, and Cradle is read by someone else, who does amazing voices and is a delight to listen to.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249][Worth the Candle]] by Alexander Wales is an amazing work, that gets updated around every one to two months, and you can download the latest ebook from that link, or just read it online. It's the epitome of rational fiction, and it's definitely of the best (i.e. best demonstration of rational fiction) this sub has. No audiobook, though.

[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/102/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] is my favorite story of all time, and it's about to be completed. It's been ongoing since 2011, and although it came after the genre was named, it's also a good example of progression fantasy. This sub is also obsessed with this one; posts about it reach the top of the subreddit, if you go and check. You can download an epub from that link using [[https://ficsave.xyz]].

There are multiple ongoing audiobook efforts, three I know of, but two of them suck, and I /hate/ the voices of the third one. I've listened to the first four chapters, and the female voices suck a ton, and the protagonist's annoying mentor is stereotyped into the unintelligible Chinese teacher, and you can't understand him /at all/. Besides that, the narrator just generally has a really unusual accent in general, which isn't terrible, but that in addition to poor voice choices for basically every character (I only mentioned the worst bits) mean that he sucks to listen to. I recommend that Mother of Learning just be read instead, then maybe listened to later. And it really should be read, because it's a goddamn amazing story.
