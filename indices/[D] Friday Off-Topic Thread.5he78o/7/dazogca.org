At DnD last night I used some thinking from HPMOR.

A fire giant was magically trapped in a forge, and it attempting to exit wouldn't work as a magic net would stop it. The giant using an anvil as a hammer to damage the walls similarly was halted.

I asked what about the giant using the anvil as a projectile?

It turns out that the creator of the ward hadn't planned on the walls being destroyed.
