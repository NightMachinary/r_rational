I could rant about names for thousands of words, but instead I'll just say that you can reasonably expect the audience to learn a finite amount of information. For example, if you include too many characters, the reader is liable to forget their names. Extending this, if you provide a mythological figure for each of the 18 pokemon types, you're asking the reader to remember 18 things, or else be confused whenever you bring it up. There are ways around that, but it really doesn't seem worth it.

Besides that, you should think really seriously about how much space (wordcount wise) you have to devote to each of these many, many characters and concepts you're introducing. If I were you, I'd pick three, or maybe five at the most, and flesh them out more extensively, since that's about the most you'll be able get to if you want to finish some time this century.
