You're going to need to clarify somewhat; your description is missing some words. From the types I'm assuming this is pokemon, but what's the deal with the names of mythological figures?

Without knowing more, I'd pare down a lot. Focus on what the reader will actually read about, especially to begin with. You can't fit all that in without an infodump, so don't try. Focus on making one or two of those things /really/ good, and then work on making the others fit with that. Think about what the whatever-they-ares feel like from the inside, and explore that.
