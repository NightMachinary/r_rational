It's also more potent, often. When you've read the source material, you already have connections to these characters and the world, and caring about them comes naturally. Original stories like Mother of Learning had to work to make me care about Zorian and Zach, but when I read a Pokemon fanfic caring about our trainer from Pallet Town is like sliding into a pleasant groove well-worn by the games, anime, and the fanfics prior to this one.

The whole effect is that any inspired person can tap into this groove and make their story satisfying by merit of their plot-writing skills, without needing an assortment of worldbuilding skills to supplement it. It also attracts an already-existing fanbase of people hungry for variations of their beloved canon, so feedback is easier to reach as well.
