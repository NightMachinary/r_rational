I'm here for the fiction as well, and I would like to thank this community for making me a fanfiction reader. I didn't understand the point before HPMoR; now I do, and I'm working my way through FimFiction and AO3.

Fanfiction is definitely overrepresented here, but maybe that's just because Mother Of Learning is skewing the data.
