I understand that there is a mix in what people want out of the sub, but honestly the sneaky education aspect is a huge draw for me too. Much of what is linked here I just read for entertainment, and what I want to sneak into my own writing is as much about what I consider good political and philosophical values as good habits of reason, but the frank discussion of what makes for good educational fiction is very helpful.
