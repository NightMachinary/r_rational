I've watched everything but the finale of Westworld. Quite enjoyed it. For an HBO series, there's a refreshing absence of filler.

I thought Westworld's ideas and twists were all pretty unimaginative and expected given the premise... And then I had a look at [[/r/westworld]] and realized I was just looking at the top of the (meticulously foreshadowed) iceberg. There are twists behind the twists. Lots and lots of details that look like they're just minor continuity goofs or awkward lines have hidden meanings. It's a show you can approach like a puzzle. (Possibly the finale unveils them, IDK yet.)

(You can't approach it like a rationalfic puzzle though. The technology (and [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/01/her-isnt-realistic.html][the state of the world]] considering the existence of that technology) does not stand up to [[http://theferrett.livejournal.com/2084376.html][scrutiny]], so ultimately the mysteries are held together with strings and ductape.)

I am worried that the show is scheduled to last "up to five seasons" if popularity allows. It's not a monster-of-the-week sort of show at all. It's a story that wants to unravel its key mysteries and solve its characters' arcs and then be /done/, whole world goes up in flames. I /really/ don't want it to be dragged on for too long, and especially not for an /unpredictable/ amount of time where progress will be gummed up and new mysteries and new character arcs will be forced in. This would have done well as a single movie. *cough*
