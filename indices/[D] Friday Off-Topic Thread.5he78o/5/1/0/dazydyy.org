I have to say, I recently finished it and mostly agree with you. After so much praise I was expecting something more, but overall I felt like the show was good for people who weren't familiar with sci-fi rather than sci-fi fans who were already exposed to all the ideas in it. I think the last couple episodes wrapped up most of the problems I had with the show and elevated it beyond what it started out as, but overall it's not nearly as good as it was hyped up to be.

And yeah, the only characters I really cared about were Ford and Bernard, and a little bit of William. The rest weren't particularly interesting to me at all, and some (like the two healers who help the brothel madame) were infuriatingly irrational.

All that said, technically the show was gorgeous. Great acting and visuals and beautiful music. So I get why it's so popular, and overall I'm glad I watched it, since it's just 10 episodes.
