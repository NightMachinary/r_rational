I think I'm one of the few people who don't like Westworld. The production values are incredible, but I didn't get invested in the story and characters. The pacing was too slow, the plot jumped around too much, the character arcs felt really predictable, and I didn't understand what themes were being explored. The show felt like it was pretending to be profound and tricked the audience into feeling intelligent without actually doing anything special.
