The system you should use depends on what you want the game to focus on. Bubblegumshoe is all about the mystery and is designed to emulate teen detective stories. Fate is best if the story is more pulpy, where the mystery is just a framing device for adventure. Call of Cthulhu/Delta Green is great at horror, assuming you're good at telling horror stories. I've never played it, but World of Darkness seem to be a jack of all trades.

I might be too interested in your offer of co-GM. I love worldbuilding modern settings and I'm a great editor/critic, but I couldn't write a narrative if my life depended on it. The idea that I could help someone put together a quality game is incredibly exciting, which makes me worry that I'll get too into it and make mistakes without realizing it. So, consider me?
