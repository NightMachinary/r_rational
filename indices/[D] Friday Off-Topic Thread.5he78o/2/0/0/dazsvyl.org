The easiest solution I could think of for Ditto's stat copy would be to give each unique Pokemon it's own numerical ID (something you'll want anyway) and just copy the Pokemon for a few turns. (or minutes, real time) Alternatively, each Pokemon has a body ID and a mind ID, which make up mental and physical attributes (is that what you were talking about). That allows you to carry certain other stats, like obedience and intelligence, over between possessions/bodies.
