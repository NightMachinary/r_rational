Hmmm....I think I'm missing the point of horror. Is that that they're going to have an endless army of starfishes? And that the healing pool is now an instant heal because the tree has taken on the regenerative properties of all the starfish pieces? Also what does forkstorm mean?

In hindsight, I think it's just easier for me to admit I know very little about D&D (All of my D&D knowledge comes from reading the 2YE and being a general nerd, never played a game of it in my life). So explain it to me like I'm five, please :P
