I've been going through shifting BACK into game development as a career after a brief stint in education in the american public school system.

In the mean time I've been building a prototype for a crafting system that focuses more on manipulating, creating and altering properties of objects rather then following proscribed recipes to acquire discrete objects with singular purposes.

along side a kind of rough and tumble use of rigid body physics, mesh deformations and eventually mesh splitting I anticipate this to make a fun and/or !!!FUN!!! game driven half by the chaos of poking and prodding the world to try and make things work and the hilarity of when they don't.

shout out to [[/u/ketura]] for mentioning my help on the pokemon project. And also I'm not sure of which names you use on reddit but to the lovely people in the discord that have helped entertain me with their antics/test the super early alpha builds.
