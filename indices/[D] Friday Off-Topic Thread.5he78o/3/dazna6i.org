So my mother sent me a link to a video that purports that cell phones are a health risk; specifically that they're causing cancer in people and that big businesses do their best to suppress that sort of research, as cancer is a multi billion dollar industry. I was naturally skeptical of this, as you can justify almost any BS scientific finding with 'Big Brother doesn't want you to know this!!', and have watched the video and am in the process of trying to research some of the things this video claimed.

[[https://youtu.be/wXax0-MTTsk][Here is the link to said video.]]

If any of you rationalists have about half an hour (the video is only ten minutes long but I factored in the remaining twenty for you to think/research the topic) to watch and comment on it, or even just comment on what you already know about the radiation cellphones emit and/or how that radiation contributes to cancer, please do comment and let me know what you think.

As I said, I've begun doing some basic research and will spoiler tag some of my findings to avoid inflicting bias on you or spoiling the video:

1. The video claims brain tumors leaked to cellphone usage are the leading cause of child death in the USA. Some basic research will show you that, while cancer has been the leading cause of child death by disease for quite a while, brain tumor rates have remained steady for DECADES. It's simply that brain tumors haven't really seen much advancement in treatment over the past age, compared to cancers like leukemia. So it's remained higher because other cancer death rates have been lowered.

2. The video, at around 6:10, claims that cellphones are altering human DNA. Several studies on the radiation cellphones emit, being non-ionizing radio waves, have been conducted and the only conclusive effect we've seen of this radiation is the ability to generate heat in tissue. It's why we use these waves in our microwaves.

3. The video, at around 5:40, makes an erroneous claim that Apple instructs iPhone users to carry the phone at least 10 mm from their body. The video fuzzes the other info and highlights ONLY that sentence when he brings it up. I call this an erroneous claim because, while it does indeed say that, the host purposely leaves out the part where it says to carry it at that range to ensure your exposure remains at tested levels. He also leaves out the part where they did tests with the iphone at 0 mm from your head, aka no separation. They did testing at the ranges mandated by regulation, which stipulates they do testing with it both at 0 mm from your head, aka no separation, and 10 mm from your body when carrying. And simply tell you that, if you want exposure consistent with their testing, carry it at that range. The host also makes a comment about how the text here can't be enlarged, as if it's some scheme by Apple to have this text really small, when in fact it's standard text size and perfectly legible, so that you don't read it. That point overall seemed like a blatant attempt to misrepresent facts and fear monger.

4. This isn't really a finding, per se, but the host has a segment at 4:43 where he uses a radiation detector to show the radiation emitted by several common devices, claiming that routers and microwaves emit about 800 microvolts/meter. Tablets emit about 2000 microvolts/meter. And cellphones emit about 40000 microvolts/meter. I have two issues with this. One: While I see the 4 among the numbers on the meter, I can't see the tolerance indicator of the radiation detector. What I mean is, as with volt meters, when you're detecting energies that vary so much, you can set the tolerance of the display to be in different ranges. So that the digital display only needs to hold 3-4 digits at any time. So I have no idea whether that 40,000 claim is true there in the video. And two: I can't seem to find any source for that 40,000 microvolt/meter claim. Googling brings up several websites, that all feel very conspiracy theory-esque, that say cellphones give off that much radiation; but it's all based on that documentary, as far as I can figure out. So I have absolutely NO idea if I can trust that stat.

So these are just some of my basic findings so far. I'd love to hear feedback from you guys :)

TL;DR: Are cellphones cooking our brains and giving us cancer? And are big businesses letting them, so they can keep bringing in the /dinero/? This video makes that claim. But how much of it is actually good science and how much of it is baseless fear mongering? You tell me!
