It's thoroughly depressing. If these people were half as concerned about /actual/ life-threatening problems (e.g. car accidents, pollution, malaria, diarrhoea, cardiovascular diseases) then they might actually do some real good in the world.

Instead they're doing real harm. I'm struggling to think of a good term for it, but I suppose I'd say they're misappropriating activism.

"Fighting the good fight" feels good, especially if you can cast yourself as the embattled victim who never gives up even againt your overwhelming, faceless opponent. It doesn't really matter from an emotional standpoint whether you're fighting against a tangible issue like HIV or a nonsensical one like vaccines causing autism.

Generally speaking, activism on an individual basis is limited by the availability of three resources: time, willpower, and desire. Faux-activism uses up all three just the same as championing a true cause would, except it has no benefit. It's literally worse than doing nothing, because you can drag other people down with you.

I really dislike this behaviour, to the extent that I'd be tempted to go on a crusade against it if it weren't for the fact that that in itself would be a dire example of a failure of priorities.
