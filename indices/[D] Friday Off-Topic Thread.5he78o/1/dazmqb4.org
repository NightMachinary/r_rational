I have a confession to make concerning the goal of modern rationality/rationalism (ie this subreddit, and the goals of its various members).

After some thought, I'm mostly here for the literature. This might be selfish, but I don't care about 'increasing the sanity waterline' with rational literature. I love the good writing here, and I think that the goals of rational fiction and rationalist fiction lend themselves to good writing, and so I stick around. Oh, and helping [[/u/ketura]] with their !pokemon project.

I hope that we get to see more awesome literature in the future, on the level of Mother Of Learning, but as custom fiction, not just fan fiction, allthough the barrier to entry is lesser with fanfiction, I'm more excited about where people take ip that they create on their own.
