And even Mother of Learning piggybacks on your existing familiarity with high fantasy pseudo-D&D settings, and to a lesser extent with Groundhog Day-style setups and the attendant cliches (cf. Zach's comments about his experience with the different girls in class).

I'll be honest: I mostly /don't/ care about Zorian and Zach (though I do care about Kirielle, and I adore Kana). My investment in MoL is for the plot and the metaphysics.
