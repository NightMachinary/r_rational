Yeah, the mass slaughter at the end was kind of discordant for that reason: we know that they're concious, but none of the people dying do. I made the Red Dead Redemption comparison to my friend while watching it too: if someone went around killing people who play video games because they think the characters are alive, I would be pretty inclined to consider the killer an insane monster.
