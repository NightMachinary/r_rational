Agree with you there, film-quality acting and production values spent on a story that's been done before and done better. I guess I have to give the show credit for introducing people to new ideas in an accessible way, but as stories about the boundary between AI and humans go I prefer Ex Machina or even Bicentennial Man (why does everyone hate that film?).

The thing that immediately bothered me about the show was how similar the park was to open-world games like GTA or Red Dead Redemption. The metaphor just doesn't work because nothing in this story will change the way I think about games or the people who play them. It may be disturbing to watch people hurt the hosts, but that's only because we know they're alive.
