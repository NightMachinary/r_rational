So, my Pathfinder group in the 'party of Kobolds attempts to become legitimate citizens' campaign ([[http://i.imgur.com/Ex8ujQW.png]]) I'm currently running has, almost accidentally, begun the Starfish Singularity. ...Let me explain.

For context, when they first set out from their dead dragon-ruler's lair, they looted an artifact-grade seed from his treasure vaults, and planted it in the center of their town. Over the months, this has grown into a fairly gigantic tree with the ability to take on and blend together the traits of other plants they graft into it (this is kind of a bio-punk sort of world, where mages can extract traits from plants/animals and hybridized them into others over enough generations, leading to uplifted familiar-grade messenger birds, gryphon-mounted strike-force knights/postal workers/tax collectors, and the whole human/elf/dwarf/halfling genetic clusterfuck. This also explains where half the D&D monster manual comes from). To make a long and world-optimizing story short, they immediately went out and found the largest redwood trees they could and combined them with the artifact-tree, resulting in a 5 mile tall living superstructure that led a nearby pseudo-nation of shared-subconscious-linked druids and awakened animals to be split amongst whether such a sacred thing as this world-tree should be shared by all or cleansed of such interlopers as the party.

Now, an insurgency of druids is a terrifying thing when you live amid the roots of a titanic tree - any animal could be about to drop some /fire seed/ IEDs or turn into a swarm of bears - and there was no centralized form of government to negotiate with or fight back against. Not all of the druids were hostile or accepting of those that were, however, and some Bardic Knowledge and Diplomacy on the part of the party got some of those they captured around to their side and figured out that convincing enough of the not-quite-hivemind would pressure the attacks into stopping...

One of the randomly rolled awakened druid animals they captured was a Starfish. OK, I thought, this isn't too implausible, their town is on a river, they have docks and the like. So they persuade the Starfish to go along with their plan.

'We made that pool of healing, right?' Yeah, I say, trepidation growing.

'And if a creature that has natural regeneration was placed in it, it would make sense that it could help speed that up, right?' I can't see any reason it wouldn't, I say, my voice cracking as their plan becomes obvious.

So they start cutting this awakened, consenting, druid-leveled Starfish into pieces in a healing pool, continually, in order to forkstorm the Druidic collective's value system. I love my players, but FML.
