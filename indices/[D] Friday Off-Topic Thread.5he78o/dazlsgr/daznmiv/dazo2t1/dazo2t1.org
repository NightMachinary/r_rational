The horror here is that they're creating a swarm-mind of an unbounded number of Starfish, each capable of casting Druid spells, and that with all of these additional friendly minds influencing the wider Druid collective subconscious, it'll 'outvote' the other druids. This is what forkstorming is: it's an idea from the likes of Eclipse Phase or other settings where you can fork your consciousness (admittedly, I'm pretty sure I made up the term itself, but the strategy is obvious), and you just do it constantly so that you win (be it votes or fights) by sheer, weaponized /demographics/ after outnumbering your opponents 1000 to 1.

No, they haven't tried grafting the Starfish into the tree, stop giving them ideas!
