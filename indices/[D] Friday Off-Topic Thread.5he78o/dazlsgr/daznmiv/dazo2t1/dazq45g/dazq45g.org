Lmao, it just seems like the logical next step! The tree would essentially become indestructible unless you could take out the entire structure at once, as its regeneration would (presumably) simply go faster and faster the more starfish they graft. And, as you pointed out, they have an essentially unlimited amount of said starfish. Shit is really gonna hit the fan if the pool's regeneration also benefits and they can grow said pieces of starfish at exponentially faster speeds!
