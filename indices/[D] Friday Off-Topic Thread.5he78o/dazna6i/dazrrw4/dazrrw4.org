Without reading your spoilers or watching your videos- my first thoughts are that since it's so trivially easy to detect ionizing radiation that no grand conspiracy could hide the fact that phones are emitting it. It would instead either have to sabotage all commercial radiation detectors and homemade detector blueprints, or sabotage our very understanding of which types of radiation are harmful to humans.

Since both of those would be among the largest international conspiracies to have ever existed I find it much more likely that some clever engineers found a way to safely use radiation to send information over large distances.
