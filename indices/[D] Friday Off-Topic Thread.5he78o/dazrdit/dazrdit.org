Couple of questions.

1) Which Secular Solstice events are people attending?

2) Does anyone have experience making informative websites? I want to start a site for helping people gtfo from their countries as we head into dangerous times. That would include immigration advice, refugee assistance, and crowdfunding/crowdsourcing for dealing with bureaucratic obstacles.

Oh, and seeing the therapist this week at last was a blessing. I've got a bunch more appointments lined up.
