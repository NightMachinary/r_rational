I decided it was time for a change on a whim a while ago and have been waiting to think of or find a good new phrase.

When I read the most recent Marked for Death chapters, there was a joke about being "somewhat fuzzy on the concept of kneecaps" which is hilarious in the context of a ninja story. To me, it's still hilarious if used in the context of AIs. I dare you to imagine situations where someone says "My AI's somewhat fuzzy on the concept of kneecaps." It's a great prompt!

I doubt I'll keep this flair as long as the previous one, but it's staying around for at least a few months.

If you (or anyone else) wants to use "Working on a FAI to save us all with ponies", feel free!

EDIT: Another one was "I'll live forever or die trying!" but I decided not to use it due to it not being original enough.
