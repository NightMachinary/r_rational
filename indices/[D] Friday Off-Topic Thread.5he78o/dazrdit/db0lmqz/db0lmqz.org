  Does anyone have experience making informative websites? I want to start a site for helping people gtfo from their countries as we head into dangerous times. That would include immigration advice, refugee assistance, and crowdfunding/crowdsourcing for dealing with bureaucratic obstacles.

Is there anything you want to do that you can't do by starting an immigration subreddit, making good use of the attached wiki and making a very informative sticky post at the top?
