Answer: Sure, but you'd A.) Need quite a lot of evidence to show that it does actually lead to more good and B.) Probably precommit to not going any farther.

That last paragraph about losing some of your own sense of what's right/wrong is probably true (or at least, difficult to show that it isn't) as your actions become more normalized, so you should both ensure you can't go farther and probably also take steps to prevent you from getting to make such decisions again.
