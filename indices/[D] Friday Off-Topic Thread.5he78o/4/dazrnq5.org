I've been thinking about the concept of a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon][Moral Event Horizon]] and the question that appears to pop up is if there truly exists any action so irredeemably evil that it can't be forgiven no matter how much good one does before or after.

I can't help but think it's exactly the wrong thing to ask. It's not that certain behaviors are so bad that we cannot forgive the villain for it. I'm confident that for every horrific action, there are actions which can 'balance' it out. For example, did you brutally torture and kill one million people? No problem, just save the lives of one billion people. If that's not enough, then just by adding enough zeroes to the number of lives saved, one can be 'forgiven' for any horror.

I have realized that the Moral Event Horizon is in fact a heuristic rather than a commentary on how evil a given action is. If someone commits an evil deed, we can make a guess at how likely the villain will ever do good in the future (or how 'redeemable' he is). If the villain robs a bank but goes out of his way to not harm the hostages, we can probably say that he's not likely to commit genocide. But if he burns down the building a la Joker style, then he's a psychopath who is less likely to ever be a better person.

This comment is meant to discuss how people should approach Moral Event Horizons in fiction. It's not /just/ a statement of how horrible a person is currently, but rather how unlikely the individual in question will do good in the future.

Note that Moral Event Horizons are subjective and very from culture to culture. For example, being a slave-owner centuries ago wouldn't mean you are a psychopath, but nowadays you would be considered one if you tried to keep a slave.

Discussion Question: Is it ever justifiable to cross a Moral Event Horizon if you believe it will lead to more good or for the 'Greater Good'?

I'm of the mind that such actions will have negative effects on the mind and 'damages' a person's own moral compass. Actions change people. No matter the outcome, if someone had ordered a genocide and it worked out to save more people, I still wouldn't trust the person with the same level of authority they previously had.
