One interesting direction to take this in fiction is the question of whether the ends justify the means.

For example; you give the example of torturing and killing a million people but then saving a billion. If those are independent actions, then it's trivially better to save the billion /without/ torturing and killing the million.

What happens in the case where you can only save the billion /by/ first torturing and killing the million?

There are a lot of stories that raise this question, where people try to create a utopia by doing terrible things, with varying degrees of success...
