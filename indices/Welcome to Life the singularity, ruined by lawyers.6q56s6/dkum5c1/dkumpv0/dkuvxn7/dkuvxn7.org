Not sure what you're saying. Would superintelligences abolish capitalism? Would superintelligences just delete stored consciences? I don't think mentioning a superintelligence is any more relevant here than saying, "Well, civilization will probably have collapsed by then." Well, it might have, but so what?

I think the blue sky nature of imagining the far future should make you more, rather than less, tolerant of scenarios like these. In this scenario, maybe there are superintelligences, and maybe they just don't give a shit about uploaded minds. Or maybe they exist, but have executive function deficits that basically mean that humans still call all the shots, but just can do more--kind of like the "A.I." of today. Or maybe they're just modified emulated human minds (like in Saturn's Children) and humans can also add processors to their own minds, so it's a still relatively level playing field. Not hard to think of scenarios where A.I. exists and doesn't really matter, or where uploading is possible but creating A.I. is not. In fact, I'd say the exponential, Elon Musk branded A.I. of our nightmares seems pretty damn unlikely.
