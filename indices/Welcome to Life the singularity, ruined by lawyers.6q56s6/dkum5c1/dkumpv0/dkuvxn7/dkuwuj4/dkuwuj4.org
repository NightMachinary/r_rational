  Would superintelligences abolish capitalism?

Well, yeah, unless for some reason capitalism is built-in the utility function of the super-AI. We may be thinking of different things when saying "superintelligence", I think you may be thinking of something like Hal, or at least a really clever computer who knows everything on the internet, I'm thinking of a planet-sized quantum computer who tries to optimise the matter configuration of the universe according to some formally specified utility function.

  Would superintelligences just delete stored consciences?

Yes, the human simulations are running on matter that the super-AI could re-purpose for its own goals, if the superAI goals are not well-aligned with ours, it will delete the stored simulations.

My point was that the technology level implied by the video is inherently unstable, a civilisation which is capable of full-brain emulation, yet doesn't advance any further for long enough that the scenario in the video arises is very weird. Full-brain emulation almost trivially produces superAI by simply emulating many AI researcher minds and running them much faster than real-time.
