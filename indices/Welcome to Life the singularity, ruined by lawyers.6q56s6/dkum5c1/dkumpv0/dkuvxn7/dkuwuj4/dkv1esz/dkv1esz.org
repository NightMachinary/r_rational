Even in a universe in which problems are being solved by duplicated and networked human intelligences, does that preclude a subscription service (probably low rent) targeted at legacy meatbags? I agree that this would be unstable in the sense that, eventually, you'd have a computronium scenario in which all intelligence became emulated, but it seems at least possible that there would be a period between being able to upload a mind and turning all matter into computronium. Could even be a long period, or even indefinite in some scenarios, such as if it turns out that we don't need matter for increased processing (admittedly unlikely) or that there's some advantage in keeping wetware around (likely, given how much legacy tech is sitting around my office, let alone the rest of the world). And, honestly, would you be shocked if capitalism were part of an A.I.'s utlity function? It's the first thing we'd have them do, and once they were competing with one another they would have to continue using money for the same reeasons that we do. (i.e., we use money because we use money).
