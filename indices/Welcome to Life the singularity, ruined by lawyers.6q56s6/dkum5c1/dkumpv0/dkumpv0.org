You find this realistic? I think any civilisation capable of not only full-brain emulation, but also of searching the emulation for specific content would automatically be able to create a superintelligence in a very short time, at which point things become either a /lot/ worse or a /lot/ better than what this video depicts. It's very hard for me to imagine a scenario in which we have the capabilities implied by the video, but don't almost immediately go far beyond them.
