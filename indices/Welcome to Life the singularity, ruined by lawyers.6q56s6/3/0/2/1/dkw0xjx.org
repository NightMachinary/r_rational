  Sorry, Professor Quirrell, but "you fools, you'll destroy us all" is actually just a rallying cry for clamping down on anyone capable of powerful magic to make sure that the Malfoys' political chess-game isn't disrupted.

Upon review, this actually explains a lot about Voldemort's actions in HPMoR. He spent a long time trying to maneuver politics and institutions to handle what he considered his long-term self-interest, which sometimes even lined up with the world's long-term interest. This turned out to be incredibly difficult to do with subtlety and precision rather than with massive blunt objects.

So he decides to make a blunt object. Fuck it, he says, I'll make a persona who's a mad, evil villain right out of all the plays and stories. He can give himself an overinflated name, stupid levels of braggadocio, and a mutated face. He can run a stupid fucking cult, preach a made-up ideology that panders to some easy prejudices, and his colorful supervillain lifestyle will ride on the backs of the wealthy and powerful.

/And it works./ It works better than anything he's ever tried before. The wannabe cultists come to him, in droves! They listen! They fear him! They /do what he says/! He doesn't /need/ subtlety or precision when he's playing a supervillain. He can literally just kill anyone he wants, for any reason or no reason, and his followers will rationalize to themselves that /they need to do better/.

So he /retires/. He becomes the mask, not because it's part of some complicated scheme, but because it's just /more fun/ and /works better/ than all those other things he tried.

Wow. I feel like that's a really appreciable character motivation, actually. The guy basically just got tired of doing things the most difficult way possible and decided to go get an easier job. Loads of people do that.
