  Given that you have an AI which can optimise the world, it should also trivially be able to optimise its source code, given that it is part of the world,
#+end_quote

The jump there is between a Cartesian dualist modeling of the world, and a "naturalized induction" system. A Cartesian dualist system given access to its own source code will usually muck itself up.

I think it's a short path from second to third, but I'm not sure /how/ short. I can't quite tell whether self-modeling in ordinary causal-model terms is enough to really achieve Vingean reflection, or whether you need to include something explicitly Vingean /in/ the self-modeling to get it right.
