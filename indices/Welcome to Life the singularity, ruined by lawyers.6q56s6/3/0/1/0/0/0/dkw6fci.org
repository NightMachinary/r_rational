The still-incomplete story is at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracted]]. Fair warning, I have some significant rewrites in mind for the second half.

As for weighing in, I'll cheat a little and paste a comment I recently posted to a private group:

Working with analogy on the level of a person from a century or so again being presented with today's fashion and being able to file most of it into "clown suits" but being unable to differentiate finer details...

I currently have a suspicion that early superintelligences will appear to current-day baseline humans as being "well-run corporations". One platform such WRCs might run on might be clans of em-clones who have good enough self-recognition mechanisms to be able to trust with high certainty that their copies possess highly similar values; but that seems likely to be one of the less efficient possible forms, eventually to be shuffled off to niche economic niches (such as, say, having enough concentrated bits of sapience to be able to put up with being spread across areas with significant light-speed lags).

It also occurs to me that the transition from transhuman superintelligence to posthuman superintelligence will mirror AlphaGo's recent progression, as the WRC or WRCs change from making surprising and particularly good tactical choices (which result in baseline humans exclaiming "What a clever strategy! It opens whole new fields of approaching these problems!") to making choices that are incomprehensible even in retrospect (outside of meta-analyses such as "I don't know why that WRC did X, Y, or Z, but I confidently predict that WRC is going to end up better off after having done them than if it hadn't").

Conclusion: When I get back to 'Extracted', I'm going to need to rewrite the behaviour of the em-companies (including the one hosting our protagonist) to match this framework.

And now, laundry!
