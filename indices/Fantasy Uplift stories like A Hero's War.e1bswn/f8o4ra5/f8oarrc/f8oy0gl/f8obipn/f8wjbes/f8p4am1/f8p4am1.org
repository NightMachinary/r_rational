With This Ring is a fanfic set in the DC universe (specifically Young Justice) in which the MC suddenly is isekai'ed from our world to that one with an orange power ring (they run on avarice). It's really long and goes all over the place, but it's pretty dang good, and the MC (in one of the timelines, there are multiple occuring in different dimensions I guess) is all about the uplift, both with technology and magic.
