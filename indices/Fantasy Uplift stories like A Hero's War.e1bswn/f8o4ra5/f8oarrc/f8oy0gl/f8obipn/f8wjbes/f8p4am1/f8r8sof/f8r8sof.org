I love WtR, read it every day. And while the MC's primary goal is societal uplift, and it happens throughout the story, the actual uplift things are /usually/ backgrounded, occasionally coming to the fore for a few chapters. If uplift is your /primary/ interest, I'm not sure that WtR will really scratch that itch. Especially because it is very much NOT about developing the tech himself, but more about trying to get people to intelligently use things that exist/have been developed elsewhere and connecting people to better use their ideas/technologies.
