It was on Sufficient Velocity until the author displayed some pretty blatant transphobia (SV is supposed to be a safe space for all, and explicitly gave the terms he used as examples of stuff that'd get you a ban) so last I heard he moved to QQ.

This was after he ragequit SpaceBattles because they gave him a 1-day ban for not observing spoiler warnings for Star Wars 7.
