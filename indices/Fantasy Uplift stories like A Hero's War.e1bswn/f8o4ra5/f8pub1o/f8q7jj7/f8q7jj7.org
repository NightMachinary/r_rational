I agree the Dream stuff is terrible. It felt like I was suddenly reading two stories where one was the original uplift story that I like, and the other was the typical trashy story where an OP protagonist uses random magics he didn't work for to beat up enemies head on. And it does not get dropped or handled better.

But if you push/skip through the trashy second story, the first story is still there and still awesome.
