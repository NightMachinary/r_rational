I've read a fair bit of Release that Witch, and yes, there are parallels. However, victories felt cheaper in that one than in A Hero's War. It seemed like timelines were too optimistic and without the slew of complications that any real world project would have. And the consistency with which everyone was amazed and delighted by a more egalitarian society doesn't mesh well with the level of prejudice that is supposed to exist outside said society.

It's still decent writing, and an impressive quantity, I just find A Hero's War to be much more impressive.
