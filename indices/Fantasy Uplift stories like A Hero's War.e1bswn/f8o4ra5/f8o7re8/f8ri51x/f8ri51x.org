RTW basically uses witch magic to instantly get around issues of research and production which took decades or centuries in real history.

It doesn't /quite/ go "Oh hey a nuke would be useful to our medieval-level army" and five pages later, guess what, there's a nuke-witch knocking on the door asking for work, but it's not entirely escaped that kind of thing.
