Release that Witch is a Chinese novel that is very similar to Hero's War. The MC is an engineer that woke up in the body of a prince in a fantasy world with magic and different warring races. He starts off in charge of a tiny town in terrible conditions because no one expects him to inherit the throne. A lot of the story involves him finding witches and using their magic abilities to kick-start the industrial revolution.
