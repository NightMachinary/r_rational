I'm...not going to disagree. Conrad is a bit of a Mary Sue from day 1, and the series gets increasingly weird about women as the series progresses.

For some reason people who write this sub-genre tend to get weirdly sexist. I loved the Destiny's Crucible series but the last few books got weirdly sexist.
