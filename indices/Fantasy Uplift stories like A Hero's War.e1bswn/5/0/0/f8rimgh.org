It's a lot about the MC getting the people and super-technologies (ftl, mass teleportation, freeze rays, zap guns) which already exist in the DCU into mass production, which they obviously can't be in mainstream DCUs because that would make society rapidly diverge from our own.

Plus going around plinking some of the supervillains and external threats which are sandbagging the world. Either removing them from the equation or giving them channels to go legit and make a ton of cash.

I'd peg it as being less about uplift per se, and more about being a fix-fic for the DCU, using uplift as one of several methodologies.
