Except there's almost no actual uplift, at least not in the first million-ish words that I read before giving up. Sure, the MC makes noises about it, but he doesn't really /do/ much. The exceptions are:

1. Gets some upgrades for some of his teammates' tech. Also for their bodies in the Renegade sideline.
2. Talks to Atlantis about using their magic for uplift... And then only actually used it to make anti-magic tech for himself and his friends.
3. Talked to the Greek gods and the Amazons about making industrial amount of some of the special metals they have access to. Never actually did it, though.
4. FINALLY, hundreds of thousands or a million words in, starts talking to London about setting up portals for public transport. AFAICR, it never actually happened before he wandered off into space, but at least he had the meetings.

Zoat doesn't seem that interested in making society change and having to do the work of figuring out what that would mean. He wants the SI character to point out that it COULD change, and show how rational he is and how irrational all the locals are for not having done it (which is entirely true!), but he doesn't actually want to make it happen. Either that or he's just forgetting about plot threads as he moves on to the next shiny idea. The story isn't super tightly plotted.
