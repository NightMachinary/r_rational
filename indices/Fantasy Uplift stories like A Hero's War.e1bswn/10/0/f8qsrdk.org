I like parts of Frankowski's work - specifically, he really believes in showing his work in his time-travelling technological reintroduction fiction. More so than anyone like David Weber or David Drake or Eric Flint who have done that 'time traveller reintroduces technology' schtick in recent times, Frankowski really believes in writing out the details and making it seem believable and plausible. You can tell he's passionate about and interested / knowledgeable about science and engineering, and he does a remarkable job of writing about it. It's the most detailed and interesting competency porn about uplifting technology from medievalish levels, I think.

That all said, I have some problems with his work. They're really really bad for women in general, in an extremely fucked up way, across pretty much all of his work. It's not subtle. Frankowski's work is much, much more overtly and rampantly sexist than, say, Heinlein, as a point of reference. Also his main character in the Conrad books seems to come across as something of a Mary Sue way too often.

Even if you do enjoy the great things about his books enough to ignore the weaknesses, the series goes downhill after ~ book 4, The Flying Warlord. Book 5's science and technology stuff isn't great, and in the books after that the whole story devolves really hard and fast - book 6+ basically don't have redeeming features and indeed Frankowski doubles down on the worst parts of his writing while omitting the better parts.
