Not exactly what you are asking, but in [[https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]] the protagonist finds that the Industrial Revolution has already been started years ago by another reincarnated person (A bit similar to Worth the Candle). This is pretty compelling in that you don't need to suspend the disbelief of the protagonist not using his knowledge to his advantage, as most of the useful stuff is already in use.
