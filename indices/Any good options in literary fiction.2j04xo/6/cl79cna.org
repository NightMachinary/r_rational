What are the characteristics of such themes? Especially with regards to serious philosophical themes I can think of huge disagreements to what applies and what doesn't.

EDIT: I don't ask to criticize your post but because it may become easier for people to point you in to the right direction if you elaborate what you mean. Also, are you looking specifically for rationalist fiction or would rational fiction be enough?
