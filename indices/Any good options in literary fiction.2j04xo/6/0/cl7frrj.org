  What are the characteristics of such themes? Especially with regards to serious philosophical themes I can think of huge disagreements to what applies and what doesn't.

Well, I think "questions that would be asked by historians or philosophers" might be a sufficient characterization. When there's controversy there, we can probably be reasonably inclusive. For example, Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End covers questions of ultimate purpose, animal ethics, and historical teleology. Philosophers study at least the latter two of those. But the book is generally not considered literary due to other factors.

On the other hand, books by Ellis, Palahniuk, and Hornby are frequently not considered literary, even though they (a) have distinctive & considered writing styles, and (b) their work isn't "genre." It seems their salient themes relate to specifics of culture and subculture, not about enduring philosophical questions. Again, I /absolutely/ don't mention this so as to demean their books. But I hesitate to suggest them to someone who specifically is looking for literary fiction.

Since you asked elsewhere for examples: nearly any book by: David Foster Wallace, Thomas Pynchon, Zadie Smith, Donna Tartt, Haruki Murakami, Toni Morrison, Salman Rushdie, GÃ¼nter Grass. As before, I offer this list without implied endorsement of the books themselves (I love some; others no).

One of the peculiarities of how this works in English (which I didn't clearly state earlier) is that "literary fiction" is to a degree understood as "serious & writerly, but not genre". All these lines are fuzzy, but if you have too many sci-fi trappings, it falls out of the literary category: e.g. clones and human-looking androids can be "literary", but aliens, space travel, AIs are probably not (with maybe some minor exceptions).

  Also, are you looking specifically for rationalist fiction or would rational fiction be enough?

Rational fiction would be enough.
