Reading the linked article I can only say that things are far less clear cut. Especially the part where they say "only literary fiction does X" but then continue on saying that they can't or won't determine the line and the difference between literary and non-literary fiction seems odd. They chose books that fall "clearly" in to one category or the other. I would say there are many many texts that most people would judge as not literary which would have similar effects while there surely are /some/ that are considered literary fiction but do nothing for ones empathetic skills. Without further research I at least remain unconvinced.
