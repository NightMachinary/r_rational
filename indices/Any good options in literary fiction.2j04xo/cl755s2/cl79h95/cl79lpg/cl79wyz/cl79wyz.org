I must admit that I have never read /much/ literary fiction. But my distinction was always that it puts more weight in the art of the written language itself. Tries to be great and interesting with regards of /how/ something is expressed instead of concentrating mostly on making sense and on /what/ is expressed.

EDIT: It seems this is a subject where English not being my first language takes its toll. I misunderstood what literary fiction means (if the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_fiction][Wikipedia article]] is correct) because it seems to be more a question of content than I thought. If the criteria really is if they are "works that offer deliberate commentary on larger social issues, political issues, or focus on the individual to explore some part of the human condition" then I'm rather confused by how many works are judged to not be literary fiction. I may need examples of some literary fiction that has become famous internationally.

In German we only have the term "Trivialliteratur" which is regarded as being lightweight, easy to understand and, as the name says, trivial. But instead of taking a small subset of literature and declaring it to be "literary" more so than other its more the other way around where just /some/ literature is considered Trivialliteratur. Pretty much the inverse.
