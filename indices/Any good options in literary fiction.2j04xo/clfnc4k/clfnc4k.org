I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for, but I feel like the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson fits a lot of these criteria. Its use of language is sophisticated: varied, witty, and self-aware. It certainly considers serious philosophical and historical themes. It can be read on multiple levels. It ultimately concludes with the victory of the rational, scientific worldview. What keeps it from being literary fiction? It's no less serious in tone than, say, Infinite Jest. I guess the main differences from literary fiction are that it has a strong plot and its characters are all more concerned with getting things done than paying attention to their own state of mind, most of the time.
