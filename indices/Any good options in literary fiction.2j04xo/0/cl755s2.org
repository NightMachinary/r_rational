I've been meaning to make a similar thread for quite some time. Literary fiction is most popular among those who have read a lot of books and spent a lot of time analyzing them. While some of this popularity is surely just status signaling, it's generally not a good idea to dismiss the opinion of those who have more knowledge and understanding of a field. Most importantly, there's an objective feature that distinguishes it from other fiction: [[http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/oct/08/literary-fiction-improves-empathy-study][reading it improves your empathetic skills and ability to understand other people's opinions.]] (Though the definitions of popular and literary fiction are a bit weird in this study.) Popular fiction (I think rationalist fiction usually goes under this heading) doesn't have this effect.

The fact that it improves empathetic skills and the popularity among critics, professors, etc. probably have something in common. If I had to guess, I'd say literary fiction models the human mind and social relationships better. If this is true then it'd be good to understand a little about literary fiction when writing rational fics.
