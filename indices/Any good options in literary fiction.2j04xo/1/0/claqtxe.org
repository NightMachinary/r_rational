While walking on the beach, Mersault is threatened with a knife by the Arab. Mersault draws Raymond's revolver, and begins to back away toward Masson's beach house. The Arab lunges forward, but Mersault shoots him in the leg, incapacitating him. Mersault runs into town and summons medical attention.

Later that day, once his condition had stabilised after significant blood loss, the Arab is arrested on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Mersault is exonerated on grounds of self-defense in a trial held later that week.

Mersault muses on his indifference to the pain of the man he had shot, and discusses this with Raymond and Maria. He discovers that his apathy is not common, and consults a therapist.

He goes on to teach philosophy at a the Academy of Créteil, in Paris, where he lectured on the subject of moral nihilism. He publishes a paper in the summer of 1951 introducing the "[[https://intelligence.org/files/ProcrastinationParadox.pdf][Moral Procrastination Theorem]]", contesting the idea that divine authority resolves any of the basic assertions made by moral nihilists.

Significant political backlash results in Mersault losing his position at the Academy. That winter, having difficulty making ends meet, Mersault contracts pneumonia. Receiving treatment at Cochin Hospital, misdiagnosed with Consumption, he meets the pulmonologist Jean-François Buisson. Prescribed isoniazids, Mersault notes an improvement in his mood, and brings this to the attention of Buisson.

Mersault applies for a staffing position at the hospital, where he helps Buisson conduct preliminary trials for the first antidepressants.
