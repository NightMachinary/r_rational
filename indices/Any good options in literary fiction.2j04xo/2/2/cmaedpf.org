Alright, I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding the purpose of literature. It's incredibly arrogant to think that wisdom in literature is all idealism and world-building and cannot be found in immersive stories that allow the reader to be in dialogue with the text. Because allegory has a purpose. Because most writers aren't so foolish to think that their own wisdom cannot be made better from the reader's creativity, attention, and love. They know that the work as it exists in the reader's mind is greater than any sum of its ideological parts.

That's the problem I have with you. That's why you are unable to create art: all you want to create is propaganda.

I would recommend Martha Nussbaum's /Poetic Justice/, but since it draws on virtue ethics and critiques utilitarianism, you might write it off. Here's a review of it and similar works, anyway: [[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/07/books/moral-fiction.html]]
