It seems to me that science fiction is the place that you would find it. Rationality is as much a technology as compact deuterium fusors (though with a more modest R&D budget). And science fiction has sort of /always/ been stories about humanity as it is, convoluted by some supposed technology.

One of the major themes of Red Mars was "If you could build a culture from scratch, how would you go about it?"
