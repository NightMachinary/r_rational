Let me start by asking a simpler question: Where is the literary fiction that is unabashed about its ideals? Which, instead of being about broken people becoming more broken, is about good people becoming better people? Which pits good vs. good instead of evil vs. evil and manages to show both sides in the best light, instead of needing to show them as being tainted? This is what I would expect from a literary writer who was not merely pretending to be wise, who wanted to probe deep enough to find questions that would genuinely confuse and divide their own audience rather than lead them by the hand to a foregone conclusion. But then perhaps that literature would not pass the gatekeepers who were pretending to be wise and who deeply feared that someone else might think them not cynical and sophisticated enough.

But if you can't find literary fiction with untainted ideals and good people becoming better, how will you ever find any rational literary fiction? Mastering the art of probability theory is just one kind of ideal, and if all you can do with ideals is show them to be tainted, you're not going to teach anyone much about how to reckon falsifiability. And if you want to say anything more about sanity than yelling at the reader about God not existing, then you had better start from a reasonably okay rationalist to start with and show them getting better, and be able to show two ideals of rationality in opposition (without pretending them to be tainted or hypocritical, without making yourself out to be superior to either one).

The qualities of serious literature are a prerequisite to serious rational literature. But I do fear that the qualities of serious literature are also very much opposed to the conceits of those who imagine themselves the gatekeepers of their tiny, dying audience.
