/The Name of the Rose/ by Umberto Eco comes to mind. I would ague it as literary fiction (or at least, it appears in the fiction/literature section of the bookstore as opposed to mystery, despite being, itself, a mystery.) The central character, William of Baskerville, is definitely a rationalist character, his name alluding to Sherlock Holmes and William of Ockham. Add to that, he's a student of Roger Bacon as well.
