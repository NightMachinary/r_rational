It depends to what degree you think weapons substitute for each other.

My guess would be that if people can achieve the same strategic objective with fewer civilian deaths, they probably will, so a weapon that allows you to kill exactly the people you want dead will probably end up being used in situations where people would previously have used a weapon that kills the people you want dead and also millions of civilians.
