The problem is that the basic R&D tech you'd have to ban is "drones", "face recognition", "AI", etc. Small terrorist groups aren't going to get the raw source for killer drones regardless of whether they exist, and even if they did they're going to struggle to get the hardware from military supply chains. Hijacking military drones is very difficult and doesn't scale super well; thievery also has fairly straightforward protections and scaling issues.

Neither of these really class as major dangers IMO, since the big risk of drone weapons is that they're decentralised, scalable and difficult to trace. I feel for that we're much more at risk from the not-technically-as-good amalgamation of whatever open source drone/ML/etc. software and simple drone hardware that terrorist-hacker types will have access to.
