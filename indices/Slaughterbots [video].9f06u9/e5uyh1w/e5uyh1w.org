I think this video gets it exactly wrong. Replacing weapons that can wipe cities off the planet with weapons that can kill exactly the people you want dead sounds like a very very good thing.

Probably the equilibrium is a lot of police drones in the sky, so that small non-state actors can't just assassinate anyone they want, alongside a new type of warfare that basically consists of overwhelming the opponent's drones and then precision-assassinating their leaders rather than killing millions of civilians and grunts.

(On a higher meta-level, this video is boiling what should be a fairly nuanced argument down to a bunch of scary emotional imagery, which I find abhorrent. It's the worst sort of political propaganda.)
