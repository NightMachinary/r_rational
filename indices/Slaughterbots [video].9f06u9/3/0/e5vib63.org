Beyond the part first world countries play in facilitating the arms trade, I'm under the impression that our militaries import weapons to unstable/third world countries directly, accompanied by our forces and stockpiled, misplaced and stolen during campaigns. I'm also under the impression that they do so through intermediaries, such as through signing multi billion dollar arms deals and 'strategic partnerships' with countries like Saudi arabia, South Korea, Japan, etc. Though I've only researched and studied topics that border this issue, I could be mistaken, I think that acquiring weapons is perhaps disturbingly easy, and it's in large part due to active policy of countries such as America, Russia, and China
