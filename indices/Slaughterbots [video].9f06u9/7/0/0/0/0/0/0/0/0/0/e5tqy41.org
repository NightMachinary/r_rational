[[/r/rational]] was first established as a fiction discussion forum for people talking about specifically fiction similar Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. The author of HPMOR has written several pieces /extremely similar to this/ in terms of 'this is a short story about technology leading us into a darker tomorrow to make concrete my doomsday predictions', and parts of HPMOR itself are very definitely drawing on that theme too. HPMOR was definitely intended to be rationalist propaganda, like 100% intending to influence how you thought. Demanding that we not discuss fiction that warns of future problems with technology is to some extent demanding that we don't do what people first started this forum to do. Now, you could make an argument that it's totally reasonable to do that - that we shouldn't discuss HPMOR or Failed Utopia #4-2 or Friendship is Optimal or Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect or Three Worlds Collide - but frankly I don't agree. I think that works that express opinions about how the world is changing and the future of technology can be at /least/ as interesting as total works of fiction that are completely divorced from the real world. Works that have a 'point' politically can be at least as interesting as works that don't.
