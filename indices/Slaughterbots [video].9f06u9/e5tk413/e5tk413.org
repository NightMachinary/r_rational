so, there are a lot of issues with this like where would terrorists get all that c4, why would they try to use the "stockpile" method as defenses against an opponent that can be taken down with EMPs, how would terrorists get access to a list complete with locations and pictures of every person that shared a video?

I get "yes lets maybe not make better killbots" but let's also understand that people are pretty good at not dying too.
