I would say this leans very heavily towards fearmongering. I'm not so sure it's as unharmful as you say it is.

Even if the problem presented is in fact the real problem we ought to be solving through political means, a significant assumption, you're still presuming the action called for is the correct action to solve the problem.

Arguing about this kind of thing is hard, and I don't think taking a stance where some propoganda is OK in this forum for fiction because you believe it's correct is a good idea.
