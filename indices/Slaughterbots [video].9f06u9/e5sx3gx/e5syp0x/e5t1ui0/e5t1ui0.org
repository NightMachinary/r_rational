I don't think it's necessarily networked. The list of targets could be physically stored on each device, and since each one has lots of cameras they could communicate through visible light bursts instead of radio/microwave broadcasts. I'm not sure how well hacking would work given each device could easily self destruct if it detected any tampering or after a time limit. If the source code was known, sure, but that's a big if.
