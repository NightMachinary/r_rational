yeah, classic 'X is bad' propaganda.

its an interesting look at the concept, but i wonder if such a small package could hold enough data and processer power... its a networked weapon, you fight it with ECM jammers. and if its networked, someone can find a way to hack it. the video was a worst-case look at a deadly new weapon before a countermeasure is deployed. shadowrun already has rules for stuff like that.
