Unmanned planes are essentially drones, right?

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_U.S._drone_strikes][Since the September 11 attacks, the United States government has carried out drone strikes in Pakistan (see drone strikes in Pakistan), Yemen (see drone strikes in Yemen), Somalia (see drone strikes in Somalia), Afghanistan, and Libya (see drone strikes in Libya).[1][2]]]

But hey, if you decide to simply classify [[https://washingtonsblog.com/2012/06/u-s-labels-all-young-men-in-battle-zones-as-militants-and-american-soil-is-now-considered-a-battle-zone.html][any male over the age as 16 as a 'militant]]', you can even pretend that you mainly kill terrorists and not random people.
