Frankly I prefer my own fears, of the super rich protected in enclaves, dotting the world as the seas rise and mass migration destroys society, of the tattered masses feeding on each other until packs of those DARPA dog robots are released, programmed to ram to death any moving human who hasn't been tagged with the right chip.

I assume these enclaves have been properly prepared for the end of the world, with 3D printers and other manufacturing capabilities, created by someone who possesses rational ability far superior to the individuals involved in this story, but with similar mindsets, as evidenced by their inquiry of collaring their guards with explosives was a good idea to safeguard society through the end of the world.
