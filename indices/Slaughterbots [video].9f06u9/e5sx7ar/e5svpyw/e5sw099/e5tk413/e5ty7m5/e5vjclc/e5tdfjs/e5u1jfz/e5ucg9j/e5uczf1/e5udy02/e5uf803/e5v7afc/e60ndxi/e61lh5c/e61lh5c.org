Thank you for a well thought out expansion on the topic. I'm a former bureaucrat, so I often tend to think of institutions as slow (and I should add in light of your comments fragile) hyperintellegences. [[/u/DocFuture]] and Stross have illustrated this in their works, but you bring up a good point that their weaknesses are vulnerable to devastating attacks *now* even if they will recover and devise defenses, if they survive.
