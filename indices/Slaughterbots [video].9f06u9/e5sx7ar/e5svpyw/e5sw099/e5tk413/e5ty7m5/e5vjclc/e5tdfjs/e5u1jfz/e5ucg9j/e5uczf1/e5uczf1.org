Honestly, one would think so, but one would think also that the terrorist equivalent of biohackers would have unleashed some weird plague on the world, or that they would just in general come up with... smarter plans that tying an explosive belt to your waist and blowing yourself up. /If/ they were smarter, or /if/ that was actually what they wanted. I suspect efficiency isn't as high on their priority list as doing things that /feel/ scary; terrorism is all about making as big as possible a cloud of smoke with a relatively small fire.

Anyway, can't say my first worry when thinking of murderdrones is "terrorists" anyway. It's more along the lines of either "oppressive illiberal governments" or even "malfunctioning or rogue AI". I think both would constitute a much bigger danger, potentially.
