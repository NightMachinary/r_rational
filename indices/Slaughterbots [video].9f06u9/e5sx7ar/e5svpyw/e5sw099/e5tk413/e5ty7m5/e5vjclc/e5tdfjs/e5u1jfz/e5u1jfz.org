Terrorists seldom have the resources for vast amounts of R&D. What terrorists usually do is act as parasitic entities to big military ventures - they steal weapons, or hijack resources created for other purposes, and use them for their ends. The raw power that brought down the Twin Towers wasn't paid for by Al Qaeda, but by US airline companies. All Al Qaeda did was steal their stuff.

Similarly, if we /develop/ kill drones, even supposing that they are used responsibly and not at all in horrible human-rights-violating ways by the governments who did so (insert bitter laugh here), we also open up the option of them being stolen or hijacked, and add another rung to the ladder of military escalation. By the way that's hijacked by other humans or potentially, less likely, /by the AI itself/. But even without considering such sci-fi sounding scenarios, it just opens up a whole Pandora's box of issues. Without public money poured into these developments, sure, terrorists might cook up their own murderdrones in their basement, it's not impossible (this is all cheap stuff after all, and there's a disturbing amount of engineers among their ranks), but they won't be as good as government-sponsored ones, and they won't escalate things quite as badly.
