  Probably the equilibrium is a lot of police drones in the sky, so that small non-state actors can't just assassinate anyone they want,

1. Is state actors being able to assassinate anyone they want okay?
2. Why would that be the equilibrium? Hacking seems like a risk.
3. If you have any worries about AI, or terrorists, this does sound like a terrible idea. They locate specific people, go to their location, and attack based on their face (or head). More loosely, that means the drones can be set to just go towards the nearest location where humans might be, and kill the first human whose face, etc. they see.

  It's the worst sort of political propaganda.

Yes. It is. I think that's enough reason for it to not be here, as opposed to say, [[https://xkcd.com/652/]].
