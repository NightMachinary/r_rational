This would be a nifty plot device in a magical setting, where magic is, as HPMOR puts it, supersaturated with ways to cheat; so every time a world-ending spell is discovered the Council of Something or Other puts a Ban (a magical compulsion that makes thinking about something impossible) on the train of thought that led to the discovery, so ten thousand years later learning magic is basically a cautious navigation of hundreds of dead ends, and aspiring wizards occasionally actually become deadlocked in trains of thought that make a dangerous conclusion inevitable. Excuses for why something can't really work are highly prized, and people have learnt a form of double-think that involves cautiously probing ideas for consequences without actually thinking about them in detail. Then, a meteor impact a few days' travel from the capitol creates a magic-dead zone...
