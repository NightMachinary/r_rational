Great, you've had an idea, now invent the story.

- I recommend dropping the Oppenheimer conspiracy and simply taking as a premise that the human brain has this defense mechanism.
- Good stories and originality both come from taking the premise to its logical conclusion. If human brains have this low cap for mathematics or abstraction, what else would be different about our thinking? Go back to the Ice Age. Go all out. Then, what happens when we can no longer progress in physics? Does it prompt the early development of computers? Are there certain chemicals that combat the effect? Presumably the pain would increase exponentially with mathematical difficulty? Here's a cool character: a mathematician or logician with an iron will (think newton putting the knife under his eyeball) who is methodically trying to train himself into the capability for higher maths. Set it a little after 1800 and you have a huge cast to draw on. Chemistry at this time is more advanced because at least it's graspable, so it's where all the talent flocks.
- /Of course, the REAL thing of interest here is how people could "cheat" by creating incremental heuristics that let them juggle complex terms and ideas without hitting that roadblock./

Also, short stories are pathetic! No idea is worth doing unless you do it /long/. (By that I mean like novella+, and not something padded. Your thing is taut, which is good. Also, no need say that someone says something -- just put their name by their dialogue, like a script. It's more economical.)
