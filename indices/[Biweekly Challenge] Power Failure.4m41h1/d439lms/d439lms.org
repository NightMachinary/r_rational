[[https://medium.com/@spacefountains/europe-down-c83215407e75][Europe Down]] 3,473 Words. (edited the link, should still be the same content, but as I dropped out of hosting for a bit not completely sure) Why does magic always need to be the thing going wrong?

Still rough, but I think better than what I had last time and I would rather get something out than nothing. Please tell me what you think if you read it.

I think I had to have deleted more text than I ended up using on this one. First I tried writing an entirely different story in response to the prompt, realized I was being way too broad and started this instead. Then I had trouble coming up with a plot and indeed had something quite different until I realized that while there was once an air force base in Amesbury there now isn't.
