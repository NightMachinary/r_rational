Get out their coming -> get out they're coming / get out, they're coming

Who brings a toddler on a an early morning tour? -> on an early morning

Rank after rank of soldiers dominated the scene their uniforms a alien garish mix of purples and greens -> ... scene, their uniforms an alien ...

All our sympathy are for those affected -> sympathy is, sympathies are (? not entirely sure)

Old planes probably should work now anything with physical linkages to the control surfaces should be safe to test at least -> you probably want a comma somewhere here, "Our planes should probably work now, anything ..."

The story doesn't describe the soldiers other than their uniform colour. At first I thought it was medieval soldiers (didn't pay enough attention to the colour), and then I didn't know or suspect they were aliens.

Why are they really surprised in the end? They already determined that only aliens made sense. Also technology not working isn't really "good" news, maybe "less bad".

It's all fine that you use the Angular logo (and angular presumably) but I can't hit the back button in your page.
