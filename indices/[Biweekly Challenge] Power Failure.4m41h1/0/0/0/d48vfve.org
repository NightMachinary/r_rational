Thanks, I'll look into fixing at least the angular issues. I was playing around with angular-cli and hadn't noticed that for some reason I can't go back. To be honest anything Angular related is way overkill, but I wanted to experiment with it and it lets me "render' my Google Doc to html based on where line breaks are which made it a lot simplier to port over. Yea I could have also written a script to do the same thing statically, but this was more fun. Not really sure why it won't let you go back though.

As to the rest. Yea, I definitely need to get better at editing. I'll fix the back button issue when I get a chance this evening, but I'm not really sure what the policy is on editing in the middle.
