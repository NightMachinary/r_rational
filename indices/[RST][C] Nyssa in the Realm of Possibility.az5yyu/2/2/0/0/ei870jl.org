I don't have the phonological background to explain my intuition, but I am pretty sure there is some sense in which "Yes, it is raining" does not put as much emphasis on the "is" as "Yes, it is" does.

Of course, maybe this is totally off-base and I am inventing intuition that happens to match the grammar we get at the end.
