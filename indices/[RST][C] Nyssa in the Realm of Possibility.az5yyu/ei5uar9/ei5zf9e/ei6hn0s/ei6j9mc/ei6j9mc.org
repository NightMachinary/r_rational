Yes, that is exactly what I am saying. In the terms used in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory][X-bar theory]]: In "Yes, it is raining" 'is' is a verb, and in "Yes, it is" 'is' is not a verb; it is an inflector, and the verb phrase is elided.

(X-bar theory is now a minority view, but its terminology is more clear for this purpose.)
