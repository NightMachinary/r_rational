It's pretty good as a first try! The important thing about being a writer is that you keep reading, keep analyzing and /keep writing/. Stick with it!

[edit] Something that helped a friend of mine, was try to find a story schema such as the [[http://blog.janicehardy.com/2013/10/how-to-plot-with-three-act-structure.html][three-act structure]] and /explicitly/ stick to it, beat by beat, scene by scene. It may seem formulaic and boring but it's a tried-and-proven framework for good writing. Remember, explicit rote genre writing got us the Dresden Files.
