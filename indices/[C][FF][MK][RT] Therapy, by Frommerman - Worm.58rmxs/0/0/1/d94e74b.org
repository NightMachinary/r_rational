  That's all fair. It's the first time I've actually written anything, so I expect it to be bad.

This is /damn/ good for a first attempt. Amazingly so, in fact. The simple fact that you've got good grammar, spelling, and copyediting puts you above 90% of fanfic. The fact that the story is actually engaging puts you above 50% of the remainder.

My complaint is that things seem a little easy for Taylor. Her power keeps her sane so she has no internal conflict [[#s][]]. She is objectively improving people's lives, so they are on-side with helping her. Her one weakness is that she's squishy and not very combat capable, but [[#s][]] get rid of that PDQ.

I think the real missed opportunity was with Dragon's halo scanner. You had a chance to explore the moral and psychological implications of forcibly changing someone's mind. From an outside view there was no difference here between Taylor curing people and Taylor turning people into happy pod people loyal to her. There could have been some real conflict there that would have made for a great story, but having Dragon definitely say "nope, s'all good" killed that plotline. Indeed, everything is a little too easy for her.

Please keep writing. I look forward to seeing more of your work.
