That's all fair. It's the first time I've actually written anything, so I expect it to be bad.

I'm not sure why it was posted here, honestly. It's not rational fiction, and I gave up on trying to make it a ratfic less than half the way through because the Wormverse is nearly impossible to make rational, and also because I didn't want to devote that much time and effort into trying to make it make sense.
