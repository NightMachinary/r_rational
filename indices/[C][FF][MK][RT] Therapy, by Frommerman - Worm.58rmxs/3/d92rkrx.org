Wow. Two chapters in. I just finished reading another Worm fanfic called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mixed-feelings-worm-oc.375923/page-46#post-25708409][Mixed Feelings]] and this is literally helping to cure the stress that story caused.

It's a pretty weird feeling for a Work fanfic, but interested to see where it goes.
