I have such mixed feelings for this story. On the one hand, it's just /nice/. On the other hand, orthogonality thesis! The author seems to just have /defined/ the shard's notion of "mentally healthy" as correct, and it just weirds me out that nobody questions where her power's definition of "sane" comes from. It's all a bit too /unquestioned/, which just ... does not /at all/ put me at ease, given the situation. It reminds me of the Madoka quest where the players make a character with the power to make people "better", and it takes about six updates for her to start mindcontrolling people into being her friends. Like, that's /tragic/ but it's how you'd /expect/ it to go... this story is going /too well/. It makes me suspicious.

I should probably go finish it.

[edit] Okay, finished it. Um. ...... I get the WAFF, but it seems kind of like ............ it's not a very good /ending/? Like, it's a good /outcome/ but it doesn't seem to have any narrative connection to what came before it. It's the kind of ending you write when you've gotten all you wanted out of a story and just want to close it. Like in /DM of the Rings/, where the players get kinda disinterested and the DM just ends it all with [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1293][one dice roll]] about an event hundreds of kilometers away.

I think one thing that often differentiates professional authors from amateurs is the use of /arcs/. If you're looking at fanfiction, what you often have is a desire to play with a few concepts and see what happens, but no notion of what happens beyond that. So once you reach the cool stuff you wanted to do, that's it, it's done, nothing comes /of/ it. Like, if this was an arc-based story, you'd actually show how sanity improves the decisionmaking of the heroes that Sanity helps in a practical way that comes back around to help accomplish Sanity's goals of a more capable world, in a way that connects back to Sanity's personal story. Instead, the Shard, a minor character at best in story terms, solves everything because what is agency?? (Oh also, nothing bad happens to her in the Birdcage; her fear is entirely unfounded.) It vaguely reminds me of a story that I fuzzily remember reading as a child that /literally/ ends with "and then Jesus returned and solved everything." It's not very narratively satisfying.
