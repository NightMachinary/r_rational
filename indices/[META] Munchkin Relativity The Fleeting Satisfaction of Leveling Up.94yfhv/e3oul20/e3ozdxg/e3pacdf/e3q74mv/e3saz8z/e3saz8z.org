  Basically, "Xianxia: The Game."

Not sure I understand what you're getting at here. In Xianxia: The Game, once you're the baddest-ass thing around, isn't the best part walking around pretending you're /not/ the baddest in hopes that arrogant people will pick fights with you so you can slap their faces while being praised by the peanut gallery? I don't know who in their right mind would end the game /before/ the face-slapping.
