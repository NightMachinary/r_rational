Same thing in tbs, the endgame should be rote if you've done well which makes it dull. Walking the knife edge between certainly lost and basically won is hard. However losing certainly can often be funner than the slow trod of victory, especially in gsg since you just change the goal to being how long one can survive. I've felt like that when staving off the Germans after they've broken through my lines in hoi4.
