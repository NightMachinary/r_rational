The closest thing I've come up with is harboiled detective serials. It's not exactly what you're looking for but they usually keep things close and personal, rarely deviate from the "street level" and there's an element of gaining competency there too.

Maybe something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Grant_(book_series)][Rivers of London]] series? It's been ages since I've read the first couple of books but they might scratch your itch. [[http://moodylit.com/index.php/the-good-student-table-of-contents][The Good Student]] fulfills some of your criteria too. The stakes get higher (much higher, in fact) but they're still largely personal and the protagonist never reaches full understanding of the system. Plus, there's a lot of "ah-ha!" moments.

Honestly, I think you'll be very hard pressed to find what you're looking for in the realm of fantasy. Capability is already tied to power in real life and this is exaggerated in fantasy settings, where being a master of a field often means you can kill thousands instead of just having enough money to buy a nice house. It would be hard to keep things tense without escalation and a shift of goals for the main character.
