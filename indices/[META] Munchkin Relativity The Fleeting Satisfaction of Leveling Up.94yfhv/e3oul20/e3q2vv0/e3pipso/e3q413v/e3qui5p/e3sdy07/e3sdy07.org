I think this is part of what makes Chinese cultivation webnovels appealing to a lot of people and is the major reason they can be so /long/ without losing their reader-base.

Major plot events always focus on the individual (even if faction-level things are going on in the background) and the final determinator is always the MC's individual strength. Individual strength is more important than the strength of a faction (in fact, the strength of a faction is usually classified by the strength of its strongest expert.)

Power levels are neatly divided into levels (even if the MC can "jump levels" to fight) which clearly shows what kinds of events and enemies the MC can feasibly content with right now, which kinds are totally out of his reach (for the time being), and which kinds he'll be able to reach within the near future. It also makes the level-up process explicit and obvious so you can celebrate whenever it happens and the MC will be /instantly more capable/.

Though this genre often milks the "victory laps" in the form of face-slapping, so it's not a perfect response to your request, they manage to always keep things within the individual-level "power-up" part of the story, so it's always exciting. The MCs have their "victories" where their had work pays off and they get to do a victory lap, but then the stakes are raised, they go from being a big fish in a small pond to a small fish in a big pond by changing locations or worlds, and then they do it all over again.

Here's an example plotline that I just came up with to illustrate:

- MC Starts off in a small city in a small country. City's highest cultivation level is level 2, country's highest cultivation level is level 3
- MC flees the city and goes to the capital, levels up until he reaches level 2, then goes back to his home city to dominate it
- MC goes back to the capital and runs into trouble, eventually working his way up to level 3, then dominating the country
- As soon as that gets boring, he leaves the "small pond" and goes to a bigger country or a sect that has maximum cultivation level of 5!
- ...
- Eventually reaches level 8, becoming the strongest in his world.
- But WAIT! Turns out his girlfriend is actually from the Immortal Realms, a greater world than the one he originally came from, and was taken back there, so he must /ascend/ and now he's a small fish in a big pond again.
- Join a smaller influence in the immortal realms who's maximum cultivation level is /only/ level 11, whereas his lover's influence goes all the way up to level 20!
- Slowly grow and dominate the small influence he joined
- Help that small influence contend against a larger influence, then dominate that too
- Compete against young geniuses in their quadrant of the immortal realms and do well, being invited to a larger influence that can contend with his lover's influence, but he's in too low a position to be comparable to her
- Work his way up bit by bit, going on adventures
- ...
- Finally become strong enough that lover's influence can't ignore him. Compete for lover and win!
- BUT WAIT, turns out the immortal realms is only one of the 4 "greater realms" and is significantly weaker than the other 3 realms. We're about to be invaded!
- Time to train and get stronger to resist the invasion. But no matter how many level 20s they gather, they can never beat a level 21, and the Immortal Realms don't have level 21 experts anymore. He's only level 18 right now, but he'll have to reach level 21 before the invasion or everyone will suffer a fate worse than death
- Time to go on an adventure to try to do what no one has done for billions of years... and hopefully gain a chance to reach level 21
- ...
- Success! MC now stands a good chance of resisting the invasion as a level 21 expert.
- BUT WAIT
- An ancient slumbering menace has awakened... and it's level 22!!!!
- ...

And there you have it. Sure it can get repetitive, but it does always stay within the part of the story you seem to like the best. But is that necessarily a good thing? While it's one story overall, it's essentially just many cycles of what a normal story goes through from start to finish, with raised stakes and a larger world each time.

If someone were to plan it out meticulously from the very beginning, I'll bet a really good story could be written. But most of them are written as web serials with seemingly little-to-no planning ahead of time, so there's retcons, asspulls, and deus-ex-machina galore. Along with everything that's happened so far being rendered trivial by power creep.
