I get this with... er, whatever you call the kind of game that Minecraft and Factorio both are. Trying desperately to protect yourself while bootstrapping out your capabilities and fortifications is fun, /as long as/ one wrong move will kill you. Once you've got enough stuff and "backup plans" set up that you're not only safe when doing nothing, but also don't have to gamble with 100% stakes whenever you are trying to "level up"---then the game just becomes drudgery.

Has any game in this particular genre tried just detecting when the player has enough resources to be "successfully bootstrapped", and just calling that the victory condition? I.e., the game constantly predicting whether the player, given their behaviour observed thus-far, would be assured of eventual victory against all further PvE obstacles---and, if they were, just "forfeiting" the game there, like a PvP opponent would do under similar circumstances?

(This would also be interesting for roguelikes. Imagine a roguelike with no Amulet of Yendor to grab, just a constant metric of whether you are the baddest-ass thing in the dungeon, and the game stops once you are /or predictably will be with no further chance of failure given your current equipment and play-style/. Basically, "Xianxia: The Game.")
