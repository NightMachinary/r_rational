I think A Practical Guide to Evil succeeds in this area because leveling up in its narrative isn't predictable, and exercises of power have non-trivial costs. For all practical purposes, you can treat the protagonist's power set as a fixed set of tools, rather than another thing the development of which can be balanced against other investments.

Worm and Twig similarly grant their protagonists relatively fixed sets of tools. Wildbow branched out from this with Pact, which (while still very good) ended up suffering from introducing more powers and possibilities than could be neatly tied into the narrative.
