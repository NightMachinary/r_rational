Although your argument has merit, I simply must disagree.

In those stories, early game and late game are very different. I'm not drawing parallel with MMOs for nothing, I think they apply here too. In MMO, your early game is focused on leveling up. You gain power quickly, a quest hopelessly beyond you now can be done by your summon alone after an hour of playing, or something like that. This is interesting in it's own way, but it's not sustainable.

In the late game, you are playing a very different game altogether. Much slower levelups allow more focus on any particular quest/storyline, and higher difficulty quests require cooperation between players (rather than simply grinding for a bit and then doing it solo). The game is completely different from what it was in the beginning, and the way it is interesting to play is also completely different.

I think you are simply making a mistake of expecting an early-game enjoyment from a late-game situation. You are reading the book the wrong way! Rather than acquiring competence it's now about applying it. Book one Zorian spent all his time in Cyoria simply leveling up. His competence level simply did not permit him to actually do anything, and the book ended with him leveling enough to try something major for the first time. Book two still focused more on relatively rapid level ups, only with sidequests requiring a bit more travelling and throwing fireballs around.

But in book three levelups are in a completely different position. They are relegated to background, while the story focuses on Z&Z's adventures and pursuit of the ultimate goal. They leveled enough, time to complete the quests stored in the story log. To enjoy the story just like you did around chapter 10, you simply need to recognize that you are reading a different book altogether, and switch your mindset accordingly.
