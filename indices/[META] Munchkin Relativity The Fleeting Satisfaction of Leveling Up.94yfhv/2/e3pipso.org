It's a balancing act. If the ramping up is too slow or drawn out for too many thousands of words, some people (including you) will complain that the story is boring and repetitive in its methodical powering up of the protagonist---but, if the ramping up is too fast or compressed into too few thousands of words, /other/ people will complain that the story is glossing over parts of the setting and/or the magic system that they would have liked to see explored in greater detail. One person's trash (meaningless, boring powerup) is another person's treasure (meaningful, interesting powerup).

In my opinion, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]] does a pretty good job of making boosts to the protagonist's power level seem meaningful. I cannot deny, however, that, on at least two occasions (IIRC), it introduces powerups only to never bring them up again (merging aspects for a temporary power boost and flying as a winged human with self-transformation and air techniques).
