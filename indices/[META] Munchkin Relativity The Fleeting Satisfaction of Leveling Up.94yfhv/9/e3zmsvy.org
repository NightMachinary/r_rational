This is topic-adjacent (lol for the term, analogy is the usual term, but I want to be stylish today), but let me introduce you to the game of Go (weiqi/baduk).

At the early game two players has the whole board to occupy. They try to claim each part first, challenge their opponent claim, and defend your claim. As at this stage, all claims are weak and they're easily ejected. It's fun because each step is significant and greatly affect the end game.

At mid game, you fortify your claim and siege your opponent claim. This is where a show of might happen, or cunning and subterfuge if players prefer. It's fun because you try to contest strong positions, each winning gave huge satisfaction, each lost can be devastating.

At the late game you seal your fortification and try weaknesses on your opponent's. But sometimes, you can do a daring attack! Two competent players will never hope two change the board situation much, because they know their strength well and timed the patching of their weakness just as well. But when one player (critically) missed his timing, a complete reversal can happen. The game can be broken. And when it does break, it's an immense fun for the winner, and ruin for the loser.

This is what happen with stories. The setting define the board. If you wish to stay at the early game forever, you will have to keep expanding the board. You will have to expand the scope of your setting. The consequences it bring, your move will be less meaningful, not much fun gained from clever positioning or being the first mover. Also, why bother challenge your opponent claim since the board will be expanded anyway; there's always new territory to claim, starting a skirmish is just sub-optimal. In the other word, boring.

Other commenter said this doesn't happen in real life. Because new player keep coming, old player must depart, and the rule sometimes changing. But real life is not a kind with ultimate conclusion. Our scope is limited to our lifetime: you will need new analogy to identify where the fun to be found. In the work of fiction, otoh, ending is big part. I even put 50% worth of fiction on its ending. All because that's where I seek the ultimate satisfaction, maybe a catharsis. So, a fiction without ending in sight (or twist too big to keep things fresh), imo, is lame by default.

And no, Zorian isn't conquering continents. He doesn't play early game anymore.
