  every battle is a victory lap because my previous good decisions have compounded; boring.

I think this is key. Why do good decisions compound like this in Stories / GSGs, but not in real life?

In real life, for every system, there are lots of munchkins, with more munchkins entering the system every year. They'll learn from your every success, and they'll team up on you if they think you're pulling ahead too much.

It's like the coalition mechanic in EU4. The more you conquer and bootstrap yourself up into position, the more /the rest of the world/ turns against you. Or in PGTE, the story of Triumphant, who conquered the continent only to have the continent rally into a coalition/crusade against her.

Clearly, the next level is of munchkin/rational fiction is about how to bootstrap in the face of a crusade. How to win against a world that instinctively doesn't trust you, and is happy to join together to kill you.
