Taking what you said about later upgrades tending to not feel as important as early upgrades, a story has only a few ways it can go:

1. Allow your upgrades to become boring.
2. Remove the focus on upgrades.
3. Progress and escalate fast enough that it /doesn't/ become boring.

Option 1 is kinda the default, for various reasons. It allows you to scale power tiers fairly linearly for a long growth arc, and is generally easy to fall into even if you don't know what you're doing. As you mentioned, it also just isn't the same as the early upgrades, and can damage investment and entertainment over time.

Option 2 is your character-driven stories, for lack of a better description. The driving force of the plot stops being how strong the protagonist is, and starts being the personalities of them and the people around them. This doesn't /retain/ the giddy entertainment of early upgrades, but done well it smoothly transitions to a capable plot without the listless void of dull upgrades. Done poorly and you're in roughly the same state as option 1, honestly.

Option 3 is where things get /fun/. The biggest downside is that story length becomes limited, because you can't move at such a fast pace without going really far really fast. Beyond that, though, a good writer can indeed make each upgrade feel like a game changer, primarily through making each upgrade /actually a game changer/. To compensate, the challenges the protagonist face must escalate similarly as quickly, which creates a very entertaining dynamic.

Off the top of my head, the only two stories I know that escalate that fast and munchkin that hard are The Two Year Emperor (set in D&D Rules As Written) and The Waves Arisen (set in Naruto). Both stories can be found on the wiki linked in the sidebar.
