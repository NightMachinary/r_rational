I started noticing it more when Professor Quirrel ranted about that in HPMOR. He says people like heroes who are servile and non-threatening, and asking for a reward causes indignation.

As counter-examples, Quirrel says ancient Greek heroes, "from when men were less sophisticated in their delusions", do get gold and jewels as rewards. Harry mentions Han Solo as a more modern example.
