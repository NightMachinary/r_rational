  Keeping technology out of the military-industrial complex's hands might be worth that.

That would make a lot of sense, but in the story Paladin specifically says that Templar is paying more than market price, and that their evil plan consists of doing nothing.

  Paladin: "They are gonna buy it for a fortune, they're gonna sit on it and never make it, and they'll sic an army of lawyers on whoever tries to replicate it"

In this story, the supervillain who controls Templar is secretly a good guy, so he might be trying to do just what you say, keep technology out of the military-industrial complex. Paladin is the naive heroine who used to make super-suits to fight crime and is now working on artificial intelligence.
