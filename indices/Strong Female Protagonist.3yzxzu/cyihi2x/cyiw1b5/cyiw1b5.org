Alright, well feel free to not discuss, but I'm going to share my thoughts on the matter.

I was willing to accept it as a... political device. It felt the need to re-affirm it's membership in the feminist phyle, and that's fine. That's its target audience.

But it's decidedly tying to be sane, outside of issues of social signaling.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm willing to put up with a lot for sane fiction that's a member of the feminist phyle.
