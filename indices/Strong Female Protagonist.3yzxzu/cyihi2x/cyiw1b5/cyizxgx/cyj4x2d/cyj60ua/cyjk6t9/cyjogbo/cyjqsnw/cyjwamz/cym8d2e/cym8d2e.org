In universe it came out that Menace, the psychic supervillain, was the former CEO.

He got 'arrested' and removed, but her (rightly it turns out) thought process is that either he or people selected or working fro him are still in control of the company and can get up to some shenanigans.

Considering they used her robots before to do supervillain stuff, it isn't an irrational opinion to have, though likely including some guilt-based bias.
