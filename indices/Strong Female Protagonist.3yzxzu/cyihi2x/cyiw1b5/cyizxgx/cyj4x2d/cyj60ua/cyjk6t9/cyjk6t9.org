So Paladin gets a shit-ton of money and an evil corporation loses a shit-ton of money every time she invents something?

Where is the bad side? She should keep inventing things and bleed Templar dry.

If she fears she will accidentally invent something that helps Templar take over the world or something, well, that was already a risk before.

She will probably be /more/ careful with her inventions now that she knows they will be bought by an evil corporation, which was all part of the anti-villain's plan, or course.
