The protagonist always sucked as an effective altruist. The story is about how she realized that punching bad guys was not the best way to fix the world so she went to college to find herself or something like that.

She didn't even accept money for letting people make a documentary about her, because she doesn't want to make money off some movie.

She could make a lot of money and become a philanthropist, but her self-image won't let her be such a normal, boring type of hero.
