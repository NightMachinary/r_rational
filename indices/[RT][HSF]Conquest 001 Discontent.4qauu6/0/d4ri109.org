It's by the guy who wrote Significant Digits, the most popular fanfic of HPMOR. It's about a failed AI, which was supposed to help the world, but instead ignores it.

It gives me vibes of Worm, in the first chapter.

I also screwed up the title. It's Consolidation of Conquest, but Conquest for short. So it's ok, I suppose.
