I think you mean "principal /an/tagonist" rather than "principle /pro/tagonist".

I agree with you about it being very similar to the beginning of Worm, but I'm hoping it's because he intends to subvert the expectations that Worm readers will be making like dealing with Melissa differently from what happened with Worm's Sophia and maybe showing how to interact with unreasonable/violently insane characters.

Fingers crossed!
