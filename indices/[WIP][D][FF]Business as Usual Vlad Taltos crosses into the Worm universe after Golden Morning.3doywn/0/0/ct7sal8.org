It was also removed. I decided that the story would be entirely in the narrative voice of Vlad.

I'm probably going to have to re-read how Imp's power works in Worm, specifically in the last couple places where she shows up. I was not happy with it, and she's going to start showing up more.

EDIT - There was another change. The next scene will be narrated from the viewpoint of Imp, in the same manner as Vlad narration, but (hopefully) with an Imp feel to it.
