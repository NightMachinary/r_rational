Actually, I'm currently reading Working Memory and Academic Learning: Assessment and Intervention, and it has some evidence suggesting that increasing processing speed in humans also increases bandwidth, and/or vice versa.

  Many working memory models represent working memory as a unitary, limited capacity system where processing and storage demands compete for a limited, common pool of resources. Essentially, the shared-resources position, known as the general capacity hypothesis (Engle, Cantor, & Carullo, 1992), promotes the view that working memory (and short-term memory) performance is supported by shared resources that are flexibly divided between processing and storage. The gist of the hypothesis is that there is moment-to-moment trade-off between resources allocated for storage and resources allocated for processing, with processing demands receiving priority. When the processing demands of the task are high, less capacity will be available to meet storage requirements (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980), resulting in a decrement in short-term memory span (the main measure of capacity). The resource pool has a total capacity limit, which the combination of all engaged processes and activated buffers may not exceed. Executive control, which consumes some capacity itself, is thought to flexibly and automatically allocate resources from the common pool. As one process or buffer ‘‘demands'' more resources, fewer are available for other components and processes. When the demands of the task are high, such as trying to solve a complex mental arithmetic problem, capacity cannot meet demand and working memory becomes overloaded. The result is information loss, an inability to complete the task, or, at the very least, slower processing. Studies supportive of the general capacity hypothesis (Engle et al., 1992) have usually found that increased demands on working memory slow down processing and decrease short-term memory spans. In typical cognitive activities, the difficulty of the processing task is inversely related to memory span. Performance may be further impaired when the processing task has its own competing storage demands (Towse, Hitch, & Hutton, 2002).

  The specific processing hypothesis posits that working memory capacity is task specific--- that is, processing efficiency, not storage capacity, is the real determinant of individual differences in working memory (Daneman & Tardiff, 1987). For example, phonological loop span is dependent on the efficiency of phonological processing.More broadly, the efficiency with which people process language determines verbal working memory capacity. According to this hypothesis, originally proposed by Daneman and Carpenter (1980), working memory capacity will vary, depending on the task and the individual's processing proficiency at that task. For instance, individuals who display working 42 THEORIES AND MODELS OF WORKING MEMORY memory deficiencies during reading may demonstrate perfectly normal working memory capacity for arithmetic. As task expertise, efficiency, and automaticity increase, the greater the apparent working memory capacity (Daneman & Carpenter). Despite the intuitive appeal of this hypothesis, direct empirical support for it is equivocal. Perhaps the best support for the hypothesis is the fact that experts appear to have much greater working memory capacity than novices (Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995). A related alternative is the general processing hypothesis, which postulates that general processing efficiency determines working memory performance. Recent research (reviewed by Bayliss, Jarrold, Baddeley, Gunn, & Leigh, 2005) has reported convincing evidence that the capacity of working memory depends heavily on general processing efficiency. This hypothesis is consistent with the general capacity hypothesis in that the more efficiently the processing systems work, the more resources remain for temporary storage. The effective use of strategies may promote general processing efficiency. For instance, there is ample evidence (McNamara & Scott, 2001; Turley- Ames & Whitfield, 2003) that individuals with high working memory spans are more strategic than those with low spans.

The authors don't seem to like the views articulated on page 40 (they spend most of page 41 and 42 criticizing it), but I feel like there's potentially room to combine the evidence presented at the bottom of 42 with the ideas of 40 in a sort of two way relationship that preserves the notion increased working memory will increase processing speed despite the lack of a literal shared resource between the two. Perhaps executive functioning could fill a role similar to the resource's?
