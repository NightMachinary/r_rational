Sensation seems to be the way to go here:

1) Train in combat techniques while drunk/stoned/hallucinating/profoundly off balance/etc. In combat, you force the sensation on your opponents, and kill them while they are distracted and you are functional.

2) Reinforce "nothing has changed" as an illusion affecting a sense. Learn how to fight without it.

3) Subtle assassination. Give someone the illusion that they are starving, and put them in front of a massive meal. Project that they aren't seeing the person who is attacking them/poisoning them/what have you.

4) Psychological torture: Forcing pain and ecstasy to reinforce a target behavior.

In this society, you could never trust your senses. The people that succeed would be able to disbelieve and work around their inputs at every moment. It would be utterly terrifying.
