If illusory sound doesn't convey kinetic energy, how does it influence mechanical or electromechanical sound recording devices?

That is, if I build a purely mechanical device that turns air vibrations into grooves on a wax cylinder or a plastic disc, and you make illusory sound in its vicinity, does it record them?

If it doesn't work, then it would be trivial to build portable devices that allow the user to tell the difference between what they are hearing and what real physical sounds are extant.

If it does work, where is the energy to move the mechanical parts coming from? I can harness that for power production...
