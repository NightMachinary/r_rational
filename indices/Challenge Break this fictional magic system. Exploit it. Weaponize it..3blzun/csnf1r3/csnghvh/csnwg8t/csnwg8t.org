Active camouflage should be a thing. Complete invisibility from in an angle behind your head while moving (opposite of the direction you are looking in, you have two eyes, so it should cover everything behind you, holding an image in your head that you are seeing right now should not be a problem) and complete invisibility from any angle for mages that are standing still in an environment that does not change rapidly or without great irregularity.
