Could a sight caster create a replica of themselves, occupying the same space, with the same movements? You mentioned that casters have the ability to detect whether something is an illusion by blocking out everything else. Any caster using this ability will see the sight caster as an illusion, and will treat them as such. Casters require great concentration, but if the thing they are concentrating on is themselves and what they are currently doing, they would be able to move about without too much trouble.

Nobody would flinch at seeing someone walk into a bank and take all the money if they were absolutely certain that what they were seeing was an illusion. However, unbeknownst to them, what they are seeing is an illusion of what's actually happening. If this becomes known, the ability to detect illusions becomes effectively useless when used on mundane things. You can never be sure if you're seeing an illusion, or something masked by an illusion.
