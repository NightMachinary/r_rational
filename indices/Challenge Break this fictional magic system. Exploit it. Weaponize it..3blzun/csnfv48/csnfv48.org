I'd use your "physical sensations" magic to take over the world.

Step one: Learn to create the sensation of heightened happiness. Create this on people you are around.

When people leave your presence, they will become less happy. Even if it's subconscious at first, they will start to want to be around you because they will want to be happy. When they leave your presence, everything will get a bit subjectively worse. Their own brain will become addicted to being around you.

Step two: Use people's desire to be around you to upgrade your associates to higher status, higher wealth folks. When people get in deep with you, get them to find better people to be around you even if occasionally. As we've seen, just being around you regularly enough is dangerous.

Step three: This step depends on the social order. The fewer at the top, the easier -- you just need to create addicts of the people who run things. Once they are addicted to you, you can jerk them around and get them to do whatever you need for their next fix of happiness. And you are effectively controlling the world.

It's a slow process - it would surely take years - but it would certainly be extremely effective, and it'd be much easier if you can create an area of effect. It wasn't clear from your text if you can create a room, say, where anybody walking in it suddenly gets extremely happy, or if you need to target individuals. Either way though it's fairly straightforward, as you're basically using your magic to make yourself the best cult leader ever.
