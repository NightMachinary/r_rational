Sure but I'm not talking about generating ecstasy, I'm talking about generating happiness, contentment, good feelings that are not just tolerable but actively desired continuously.

The addiction isn't caused by the feeling itself, but by its absence when people left your presence. People wouldn't want to go away because they wouldn't want to lose that sense of peace. You aren't really at risk because you are always experiencing it. Either you adjust to generally being a happier person or you're just a little more positive than average.

The sensation I'm imagining wouldn't debilitate you or anybody else. Perhaps you'd be addicted too but you'd cast it on yourself first thing in the morning and keep it up as long as you can anyway. You don't leave your own presence after all.
