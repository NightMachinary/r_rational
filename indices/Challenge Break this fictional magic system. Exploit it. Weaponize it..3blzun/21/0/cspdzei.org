If you encounter a "solid" construct, if a tactile caster is present, your brain does tell you its a solid, but you can push your way through it with minor effort. Lack of sensation isn't really a sensation for casting purposes, but you could create "phantom limb" sensation if you have experience with it. Size limits are line of sight, basically, distance increases difficulty. If it leaves your sight it's not dispelled, but it is weakened and harder to sustain. The physics engine is the collective subconscious that fills in how those things should work, so it would fill in what's /probably/ there if you make a hole in a solid object, but not x-ray vision.
