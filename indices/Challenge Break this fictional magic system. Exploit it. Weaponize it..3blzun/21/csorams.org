Create an illusion of a hole in something, the magical "physics engine" will fill in the details. Bam, x-ray vision. (Although everyone else can see it too - windows made of steel?)

It's odd that anti-feelings can cancel out illusions, but not real pain/pleasure. Could be a way to check if it's real, if you're a caster who doesn't have that Mage Sight thing.

... could I create a tactile illusion of "your leg is missing"? Not /pain/, just a total lack of feedback from your leg and a vague feeling that it isn't there?

Do illusionary flashbangs blind and deafen? Do you recover instantly if the casting is interrupted?

Most industrial applications are messed up by the fact that this requires an active spellcaster to be present, but there are some interesting edge cases. Can you force yourself to push through a "solid" tactile illusion /without/ rolling to disbelieve? Can you create an illusory telescope that lets you see troop movements from miles away? Can you create illusions with optical properties that don't exist, like a wall that's opaque from only one side, or a super-duper microscope more powerful than any real one?

What are the size limits, as well? Making an illusion that the Earth is transparent so you can map everyone seems like an obvious trick - I infer this is a low-tech setting? - but some git would have made the whole world dark if that were possible.

Can you give someone a sensation that they, or you, can't normally experience? If you're congenitally incapable of feeling pain, can you feel illusion!pain? Can you show people impossible colours, or what infrared and ultraviolet look like? You have to have felt something in order to project a tactile illusion of it; can the time you felt it have also been an illusion?
