Peaceful economic usages:

Every composer with magic talent would be a sound mage. It is simply too useful, and it takes fairly little to vividly imagine instrumental music.

Similarly, visual artists would be light mages and use it for concepting paintings, or creating reference still-lifes to paint wholesale.

Perfumerists could create pleasant bouquets for concepting new perfumes without the need for expensive ingredients.

Tattoo artists could either be visual artists as above, or sensory-mages and numb the pain of the needle.

Surgery staff would use sensory mages as anaesthesia, to keep the patient lucid and aware for questioning during surgery.

Hunters and farmers alike could be -- or have on hand -- visual mages to plunge animals into darkness for ease of capturing.

Basically, your artistry will be crazy elaborate.
