You wouldn't need to fake the sound of footsteps unless you were faking the whole floor.

However, if you really wanted to be certain that somebody would fall into a pit trap, you'd need 3 casters to maintain the one camouflage:

1. The visuals of the fake floor.
2. The sound of a fake footstep.
3. The sensation of stepping on the fake floor.

If any one of these is missing, there'd be a potentially brief window where they could rectify ther misstep.

This would hold true for any "trap" that has visual, auditory, and tactile feedback that's noticeable before the point of no return.

With that in mind, I think there're some effective traps that can be done with less than 3 casters:

- Disguise the visual appearance of a tripwire or other trigger. You could also disguise the mechanism if needed.
- Disguise the sound of a rushing obstacle (like a torrent of water, a boulder, or a collapsing roof - something that can't really be avoided once it can be seen).
- Fake wall concealing a projectile launcher.
- Counter the sensation of increasing heat in a room that is being cooked. Once it stops working (since most casters won't be willing to experience the sensation of true burning being relieved) it could easily be too late, depending on the design.
