Create invisibility by making an illusion that you're not there. Create illusions of people not being where they aren't to fool mages using their illusion sight. Or create an illusion that you are there, to fool mages using their illusion sight into thinking you're an illusion. Train pain mages to be able to withstand high amounts of pain. Use it on people who haven't been trained. Generally try to surprise and confuse people in battle. Blind people by sticking opaque illusions over their heads. Counter that by making a huge opaque illusion so they can't track you, moving, and making it go away.

You said that visual hallucinations have no reflections? That can be abused. Make a pair of glasses that's basically a pair of periscopes so that you only see reflections.
