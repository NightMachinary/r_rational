See edits. Passive psychic network, all pure mental. The caster would have to make a conscious effort for mirrors, cameras, water, etc. Thank you for asking these questions. The network is based on collective perception, and so sound propagates essentially through the subconscious without the conscious mind having to calculate trajectory, scattering, adsorption, etc.
