Sleight-of-hand or non-illusion-based trickery could be used to greatly strengthen illusions. Do some initial (presumably expensive) tricks to build and reinforce a belief, then use illusion to maintain that belief indefinitely (and cheaply.)

In this manner, it should be relatively straightforward to socially engineer yourself into a powerful cult leader (a pretty decent step on the road to world domination.)

In terms of carrots and sticks:

Stick:

1. Say "I have a new form of the power that allows me to strip you of all your senses indefinitely." This sets up an expectation.
2. Use poison or flashbangs to induce temporary blindness/deafness. The most heartfelt attempts to disbelieve will not restore the senses of the victim.
3. Sustain the blindness/deafness/numbness using illusion. The victim, having despaired, will be unable to challenge the illusion.

Carrot:

1. Say "My new form of the power allows me to grant infinite pleasure, peace, calm, and clarity of mind."

2. Drug the victim with something particularly potent.

3. Sustain the sensation once the drugs wear off.

Higher-tier zealots could work together as invisible, silent assassination squads. Combine with some legends about being able to kill with your mind alone, and again, it becomes much more difficult to challenge the illusion.

Countermeasures:

Any secured area would need to have airlocks, preferably with turnstiles. If illusions do not affect computer hardware, it would be advantageous to do things like set up cameras connected to computer vision algorithms. (In fact, if computers are entirely unaffected, all guards could just wear some kind of mediated reality goggles (like an Oculus Rift with cameras on the outside, or Google Glass with a live feed.)) If humans are affected even through mediated reality, the guards could enter their count of the people in the airlock and the computer could automatically check that count and sound the alarm if there is a discrepancy.

By the same token, ubiquitous motion detectors are a must in any secured location.

Any important persons should have multi-factor authentication schemes for identity verification. These persons should carry around PGP keys on their persons, memorize passwords and countersigns, and have extensive logs kept of their movements and communications.

The most important persons (heads of state, etc) should never leave secured locations (although it might be advantageous to have an illusory body double make public appearances and give speeches.)

*TL;DR:* Belief is currency in this society. Foster and reinforce it and you can be god-king. Any mind that wishes to be free must be stingy with its belief and must be prepared to deal with anything, even if it rocks the foundations of the reality it previously knew.
