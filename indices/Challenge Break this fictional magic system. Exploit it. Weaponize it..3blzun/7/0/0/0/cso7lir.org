They would not stack. The presented illusion has a very special relationship with the caster, in that it was constructed mostly by their subconscious (remember said image/sound/sensation) and fine tuned with concentrated effort, so each one would be unique. Maybe if two casters trained specifically to that end, they could get it to harmonize, but it's almost always more beneficial to just have a caster for each aspect of the illusion.
