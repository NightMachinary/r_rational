  [Illusory sights] are refracted, "bent" light, but they do not carry heat, therefore no death lasers.

I don't understand this. I think you mean that they are pure hallucinations that don't actually exist. Refracted real light must carry and transfer energy, since that's what photons /are/. But these make different predictions. Will illusions have reflections without the caster consciously making it so? Do illusions show up on camera?

If no, then distorted funhouse mirrors will very quickly make believable visible illusions infeasible. A person could also wear bifocal glasses to check everything.

If yes, then forget illusions. You have detectable zero-energy stuff! You can make a photodetector report increased energy state without increasing its energy state somehow. Non-interacting atomic microscopes, radiationless x-rays and CT scans, telescopes that can see into black holes, optical computers with no power limits whatsoever!

And the same thing with sound, which you say does propagate through a real medium despite zero energy, while still being detectable... somehow, even though energy waves is what sound /is/. Ships can use illusory nuclear explosions as sonar pulses, to give themselves functionally limitless range, without even badly disrupting the wildlife. Survey crews can do the same to examine the internal structure of the planet, and easily map out cave systems. If you're lucky, you can quickly and cheaply experiment to find a resonant frequency of a structure, before setting up a real pendulum to destroy it.

Or, in the other case, can audio illusions be easily defeated anywhere with familiar acoustics? If you transmit illusory audio through a cans-on-a-string phone, and an enemy ties a string onto yours, the line will remain secure - its not real sound and the energy doesn't pluck the enemy's string. Really, secure communication is a much better use for disbelievable hallucinations than most straightforward offensive uses.

Why can't tactile illusionists be semi-suicide bombers? Real world monks can and have sat calmly after setting themselves on fire, so the discipline is doable. Especially since the illusion itself is simple and shouldn't take much concentration. Just: /Hurt./ This is especially useful if it can be broadcast over a huge number of people, and it's functionally impossible to believe you're not in pain when you're in pain. One monk could disable an army.
