So you pretty much create hallucinations.

That would probably be the most powerful/useful when the victim doesn't know he is being attacked. You could drive someone crazy, or scare a person. You could make a person think he is attacked by an animal so that he would run off a cliff(that he thinks is harmless terrain).

You could definitely scare enemy's horses. Spook a giant herd of animals from a distance, make them trample the enemy's soliders. Or confuse fish, cast illusionary net over the ocean - you'll have as much food as you want.

You could use this magic to share information with each other. Like transmitting thoughts/visual images, maybe, if you live in ancient times, could be useful to replace photos. Could do some cool forms of art. Cast a Virtual Reality on a person. Or produce music without an instrument or a good voice. Put pressure on multiple small patches of skin, do it for a long time with another person - telepathy.

Probably some psychological torture, like showing horrible images to defeat the enemy's spirit. Or as a distraction in a battle. Make him think floor is falling from under him. Or create several "copies" of yourself, so he wouldn't know which one is real!

Disinformation. Make it seem like you have a giant army attacking a castle, when you are just one mage. Or - camouflage. Make enemy see some terrain/empty space instead of you(and your army).

Can you cast the opposite of a sentation? Like one guy casts "horrible pain" on his enemy, and the other guy casts "anti-pain" on his buddy. Would also be useful for anesthesia. Or come together in a large group and everybody casts "small" pain on some poor guy.

Can you cast "an orgasm" to please ladies? And have fun yourself too =)

Or cast "infinite pleasure" to get someone addicted.

Cast "vertigo" to disorient people. Super deadly in the air-battle.

Cast "darkness" to temporarily blind a person.

Cast "push" on a person, so his brain overcompensates in the opposite direction and he falls.

Confuse internal organs? Make heartbeat seem irregular to the brain, or lungs feel constricted. Maybe you could learn to compensate for it in your own body. Or make your own stomach feel full - easy to be on a diet and lose weight! Cast it on enemy's bladder - he will desperately have to pee while fighting you =)

Cause an epileptic seizure by flashing lights really quickly?

Cast "perfect room temperature" on yourself - never feel uncomfortable in hot/cold weather.

Is there a restriction on how far it can be cast? Or on how many people? Cast simple flashes of light in every direction, across the universe - communicate with aliens!

Do you actually bend light? - telescope/microscope/mirror to look around corners. Perfect optical fiber! Spy on anything anywhere. Explore space if you can take it far enough.

Or is it affecting just brain? If you could use at a huge distance, and it is instantaneous(faster than the speed of light) - send messages backwards in time. Somehow.

All kinds of fraud - exchange a fake bag of gold for real one.

Oh, another one - you could impersonate other people!! Make yourself look like a king or a president and give orders.
