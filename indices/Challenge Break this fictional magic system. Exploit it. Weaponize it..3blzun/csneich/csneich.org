Lasers don't transmit heat. The energy is in the photons of light themselves. Either there is no physical light being transmitted (and therefore no sensor or detector outside the target themselves can pick it up), or lasers and flash-frying are an inevitable result.

I suspect from your framework that the illusions are purely mental/psychic, in that they affect how the target's brain perceives sensory information rather than supplying actual sound/light/smell/taste/touch/kinesthesia/etc. In which case all infowar tropes apply.

Have two people in a conversation. Each hears something completely different because they're both being targeted. If it's done skillfully enough, observers will just see them misunderstanding each other (unless they too are being targeted). Or the two people verbally talk about one thing while affecting each other to hold an undetectable conversation.

If you're able to mess with anything the target perceives, no-one could ever be 100% sure that they haven't been dropped into a dreamworld in the last half-second, even if it looks identical. Nothing that you see, hear, touch, smell, taste, or otherwise sense (direction of gravity, sense of balance, whether your own body is functioning normally) could ever be trusted.

Not to mention that illusions of normality could be just as deadly. I'm a magical assassin, I cast an illusion on you so that instead of perceiving me, you perceive a normal-looking empty area. I have a colleague cast "normal physical sensation" on you (not numbness, but just feeling completely normal). Then I walk up to you and stab you thirty-seven times while you just stand there going about your normal business. Or I inject you with poison, or cut your throat, or smack you in the head with a brick, or shoot you from point-blank range, or literally anything at all that kills you, either fast or slow. If I'm mean, I bolt a very obvious bomb to your skull and let you walk out of the room into a crowd or to meet your family. They can see the bomb, and two seconds later when I drop the magic, you get just long enough to realize your horrifying situation before you go boom.
