Any difference between an action and an observation of that action can be exploited, assuming sufficient technology. To break an illusion, you simply need information that the illusionist does not have and cannot replicate. If you have a tech level comparable to today then a pair of google glass with a infra-red, UV and a microphone would be sufficient for all but the most well-heeled illusionist.

Basically, have a UV and IR view of the world in front in the heads up display, as well as a soundwave. Now, it is impossible to imagine information that you do not have so any illusion made without information of the UV and IR would necessarily not have that information for the camera to see. You get a man walking down the street and the IR sees straight through him because he's not emitting heat - illusion detected. That should deal with touch-based as well, if you're being touched and the thing touching you doesn't show on the cams then you're fine. The soundwave just forces your opponent to be more skilled in most cases, unless there is a situation when a sound beyond human hearing should show up on the chart, but doesn't. Which would probably be rare to be honest.

From there you get a standard technological arms race, with aggressors implementing fake UV and IR into their illusions while defenders buy miniaturised microwave scanning software and try to figure out shoulder-mounted sonar. The person with the most senses wins. At some point either the aggressors's minds collapse under the weight of fooling so many sensors at once, or the defenders run into the limits of how many things can be carried and worn (and afforded) by your average person.
