So, if there is no OP area dispel, isn't invisibility OP? I'm in a room with you, invisible and you don't know I'm there. You don't just randomly go "I'm gonna try to concentrate very hard in case there are any illusions around." You can't concentrate on just the invisible guy, because you don't know he is there. Also, you don't see him in the psychic network, because he is invisible. If he was illusioned as a pink elephant, you'd see pink elephant there, right?
