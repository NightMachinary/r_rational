How convincing can the following sensations be made:

- Sudden acceleration
- Instant deceleration
- Rotation about a given axis

If I, as a kinetomancer, were to project on you the feeling of falling to your death (because I have previously gone cliff diving or bungee jumping) will I trick your brain into believing it is about to die? Can I make you dizzy enough to vomit if I have practiced and schooled my own reactions to extreme disorientation?

If I have been horrifically maimed (3rd degree burns, limbs violently removed) and survived it, will I be able to transmit that pain while I myself take morphene to insulate myself from the casting? Sufficient pain stimulus could induce tachycardia and a host of other real stress responses.

If I am an amputee experiencing phantom limb syndrome, can I convince someone with all of their limbs that a fictitious and non-localized chronic pain exists for them?

From the countermagic side, what prevents a person from disbelieving /everything/ in order to discover what is real? Would a member of a sufficiently-dedicated monastic order be walking antimagic due to strenuous and habitual applied disbelief? With the ultimate goal of unmaking the universe by disbelieving it harder than God believes it, but with the side-benefit of being impossible to fool through magic.
