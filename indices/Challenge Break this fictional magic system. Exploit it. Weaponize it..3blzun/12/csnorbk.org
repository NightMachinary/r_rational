If you want to disable all enemies in an area, have one caster project an illusion of darkness (should be relatively simple), and another caster project an illusion of sound at a sufficient frequency to cause the people hearing it pain (not through kinetic energy of sound, just through the design of the human ear).

If you want to disable one person, have the same two casters; one caster projects the illusion that the target looks like they're acting normally (to everyone else), while the other sets up the same high-frequency noise, but only for that one person.
