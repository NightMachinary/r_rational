Maybe a little, or more maybe that is the way the technique was discovered. I was talking about the fact that there are humans that have no sense of touch and with practice they can function but if they haven't taken a lot of time and effort to focus on their physicality the're very clumsy and don't know when they are hurt.

This way you can stay about the same as you normally are, a trained assassin, and they become a clumsy joke unable to tell that they are already dead.
