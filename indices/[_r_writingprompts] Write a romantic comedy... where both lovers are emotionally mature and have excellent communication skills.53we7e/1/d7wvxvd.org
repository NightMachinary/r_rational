I feel like, if both lovers are emotionally mature and have excellent communication skills, it can't really be a romantic comedy. Romance can drive the characters' motivations, but there has to be some external problem making it interesting, and the "romantic comedy" genre is defined by the problem making it interesting being internal, a result of failures and flaws on the lovers' part.
