I don't think I agree that romantic comedy needs to be driven by problems internal to the couple. I think that's /usually the case/, but that's because most movies in general have character arcs, which work better in romantic comedies if they tie in with the resolution of the central conflict (because they're one and the same).

So you could do like /Kate & Leopold/ and have the central conflict between characters be more about a clash of cultures, which provides both the romantic tension and humor. Or like /50 First Dates/ where the romantic tension mostly comes from the male lead coming to terms with the female lead's unique disability (though that movie does /not/ do the emotional maturity thing, I'm not sure that it couldn't be done with emotionally mature people).

(I guess there's a discussion to be had about what "emotionally mature" means, but I think it's entirely possible for emotionally mature people to nonetheless have difficulties deciding what it is that they actually /want/ out of a relationship or a partner, and romantic conflict can happen even if both parties are fully communicating their conflicting desires.)

Edit: On reading some of the responses to that thread, it does seem that many people take "emotional maturity" to mean that any internal values conflicts can be solved instantly and decisively without much thought or data gathering, and emotionally mature people never change their mind about what it is they want. And excellent communication skills means that people instantly communicate everything with all parties, including damaging and/or intensely private personal information.
