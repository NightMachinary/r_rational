  like 50 First Dates where the romantic tension mostly comes from the male lead coming to terms with the female lead's unique disability (though that movie does not do the emotional maturity thing, I'm not sure that it couldn't be done with emotionally mature people)

If the characters in 50 First Dates were emotionally mature would the movie still be funny or just sad?
