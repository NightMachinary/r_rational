  Edit: On reading some of the responses to that thread, it does seem that many people take "emotional maturity" to mean that any internal values conflicts can be solved instantly and decisively without much thought or data gathering, and emotionally mature people never change their mind about what it is they want. And excellent communication skills means that people instantly communicate everything with all parties, including damaging and/or intensely private personal information.
