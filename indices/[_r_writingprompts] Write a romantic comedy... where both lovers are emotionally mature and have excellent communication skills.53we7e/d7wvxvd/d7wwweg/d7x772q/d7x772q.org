You could also have a "romantic, comedy" - romance (at least for the leads) is not a subject of comedy but a part of the genre.

For example, John and Jane Smith are so mature that their marriage is in danger from boredom - so as a couples retreat they decide to take one year to pass the world-famous /Clown Exams/. The remainder of the movie features plenty of communication, slapstick, personal growth, romantic moments, and when everything seems to go wrong in the performance for their final project... they just spent a year having fun together and that was the whole point.
