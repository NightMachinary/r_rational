[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103484/][Mad About You]] is a comedy about a married couple. In that show the humor is more slice-of-life-ish than dramatic and it worked pretty well.

Edit: Some episodes were about silly misunderstandings and such but some episodes have none of that and are still funny.
