This already exists, it's a webcomic called Love & Capes. It's about characters based on Superman and Lois Lane being in a relationship together, and that's it. There's no Will They Won't They, it's just two people in love sharing their lives together. It's sweet, smart, and funny in a lighthearted way. It's no masterpiece, but it's good for what it is.
