As someone who didn't watch all of DragonBall, can you explain the cause of these changes?

What leads you to believe that Goku would marry Bulma? What would lead Radditz to such a delayed arrival?

As an aside, Gohan in your story references his 'Saiyan blood'. Unless something is very different between the dubbed and/or subtitled DBZ I've seen and the original Japanese, Goku never thought he was anything but a normal human until Radditz told him otherwise.

Sure, I could buy into Bulma testing him and discovering he wasn't human (though how he could have a child with her would then be problematic) but it isn't like the word 'Saiyan' would be encoded in his DNA.
