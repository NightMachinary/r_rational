I was just reading a summary of Bulma on the Dragonball wiki: [[http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Bulma]]

It has this interesting quote near the end of Dragonball: "With Goku now being 18 years old and Bulma now 22, Bulma refers to him as handsome and almost takes a liking to him. However, any possibility of a connection was not going to happen since Goku ended up getting engaged to his childhood sweetheart, Chi-Chi in the Quarterfinals."

If he had not ended up with ChiChi, it is very possible he would have ended up with Bulma. They have a lot of history and friendship together, so their union would not be that strange. I mean, if we're supposed to believe Goku and ChiChi have a happy marriage, we really should not have trouble believing Goku and Bulma would have one.

ABout the delay in Radditz arriving, it's also not that serious. They expected Goku to kill all life on earth. Assuming he only needs to kill humans, and there are 6 billion people in the world, and Goku kills 1 million a day, he still needs about 16 years to kill everything. Obviously an adult Saiyan can do a little better, but a baby does much worse, so it averages out. If these Saiyans know basic calculus, it makes sense to give somebody a lot of time to achieve all this. Having Radditz explain the Math behind his reasoning, shows why he would give Goku more time than in canon. He can say he used a logorithmic scale, working on the assumption Goku would get stronger each day, working on estimates on how many organisms are on earth etcetera etcetera.

Personally, I have no problems with a fanfic making a few changes like that as a premise. It does help though if you can have some single excuse to point to. HPMOR says Harry was always a genius, but the neglect in canon caused his intellect to decline. So yeah, it makes everything simpler if all changes come from Goku not choosing Chi Chi at that time, and everyone getting an intelligence upgrade.
