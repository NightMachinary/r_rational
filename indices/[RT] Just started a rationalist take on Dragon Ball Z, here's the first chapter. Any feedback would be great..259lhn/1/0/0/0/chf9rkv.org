I dunno - it seems like a pretty major change to the character of Bulma for her to become interested in Goku as a sexual being/potential husband. Chi-chi at least always seemed interested in marrying Goku.

Goku was very impressionable and easy to sway (as long as he didn't think it was a wrong thing to do) so I could see him marrying either.

I'd guess that the only thing that would slow Radditz down is conquering a few more planets first, meaning he'd be a bit more powerful, having more experience.

EDIT: Also, Chi-chi always pushed Gohan hard in his schooling, so I could see that meaning he'd get a decent education. I mean, he was 4 and studying Trig, if I recall.

Just my off-the-cuff guesses.
