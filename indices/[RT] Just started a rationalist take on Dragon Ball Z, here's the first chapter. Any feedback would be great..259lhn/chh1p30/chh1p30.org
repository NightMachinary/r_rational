Basically, I really liked this, but it was way too short. I want more of the rational Dragon Ball Z concept. I want Gohan using his scientific mind analyzing and investigating chakra powers. I want him consulting with Bulma and making batteries that are charged with the body's energy.

SO yeah :) definitely looking forward to more.
