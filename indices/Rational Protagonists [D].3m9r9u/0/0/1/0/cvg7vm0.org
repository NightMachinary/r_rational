Well, I've never thought about it in-depth, but I feel like the shard shenanigans (PtV being blind to Scion, Conflict Balls, etc.) were implemented so that the game wasn't broken too early, and we still had a story that was somewhat recognizable as our standard caped crusaders style of fiction.

I wouldn't consider Worm to /strictly/ be rational. Like it would never win a "Most Rational(ist) Story" pageant. But it's a lot more realistic than most conventional superhero tales, while also staying true enough to the formula that Wildbow didn't have to break the bank by coming up with a totally revised world landscape (which is what would happen, if we tried to rationalize an Earth that has had superpowers for 50+ years) As it stands, Worm is recognizably Earth, with a few superhero niceties tossed in there (the CIU, Endbringer destroyed cities, Ellesburg, etc.)

In addition, I find that most of our antagonists had reasons for their actions that made sense. The S9 were about wreaking havoc and having "fun" but the end goal for Jack was that he be remembered. That he be the story parents told their kids about to make them behave. He literally derives pleasure from being evil. Even when he goaded Scion, it was fulfilling his utility function which, handily, was to do evil. Now, it was implied that there was a lot of behind-the-scenes management that Jack was doing, to keep everyone held together, so you COULD say that was contrived. I suppose.

The other gangs also fought for their own reasons. Their ideologies were widely varied and fairly deep, and I feel those particular plots were thought out well. Each gang had its own motivation, even the Merchants. And the little conflict worms probably didn't help things at all.

And, as far as Cauldron, I honestly feel like either the PtV directed them to handle Case 53s that way, or Cauldron simply didn't care to risk keeping all of their failed experiments on hand. Some of the mutations would've been a BITCH to keep under lock and key, and it was probably more trouble than it was worth to actually hold onto all of them. The security leaks possible with so many unpredictable power sets in one secret organization facility were probably through the roof. Although I'm fairly certain Cauldron held a few in-house, for a variety of reasons.
