Technically no, but I don't think the OP was asking "Is there a way for me to do an HPMOR-rational type of story, without HPMOR-rational types of terminology?" My interpretation of the OP was "Can I make a smart character who doesn't do stupid things, without being a strict rationalist?" That's the question I answered.

That said, The Reckoning (rational Animorphs) seems to do a good job so far of showing rational characters without book learning or strict terminology.
