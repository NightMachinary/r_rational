I'm sure it could be made to work, but it might occasionally run into difficulty with making it clear to the audience that there was actual rationality involved rather than authorial magic ass-pull solutions - if your protagonist makes a logically possible but /genuinely difficult/ leap of logic in their deducing/planning/scheming, but doesn't say anything out loud to indicate their thought process (and it isn't the subject of an internal monologue or other exposition), then if the audience fails to follow along it just looks like they pulled the answer from nowhere.

Would also need to be careful to avoid swinging too far the other way, and making the plot problems and their solutions too simple/obvious so as to be sure that an audience who aren't having things explained to them will still follow along; then your rationalist looks more like the one halfway sensible person in a world of dunces.

I guess this brave new world of online fiction allows for the author and audience to actually talk, which could be the remedy; constant assurances that there really is a rationale behind it all. Although then your failure mode is losing the trust/interest of your readership if it starts to look like an exercise in obscurantist ego-stroking bullshit, with you expecting everyone to apply mass concentrated effort to your puzzles. Or if people just get plain frustrated with the difficulty level.

So whilst I feel like it /could/ work, I also suspect it would be walking a tight-rope between multiple possible ways that it could also potentially not work. The most promising way I can picture would be to drop the author-screed level explanations and have a more pragmatic flavour of rationality applied, so that the character can summarise their reasons more concisely without listing references or giving lengthy theory explanations. Less rational/ist/ if it stops trying to educate, but could provide enough little hooks for it to be clear that it is at least rational.
