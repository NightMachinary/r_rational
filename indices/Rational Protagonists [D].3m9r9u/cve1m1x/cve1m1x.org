A related point that's easy to forget is that rational does not mean intelligent. If you apply the intelligence (and other resources) you have as best you can, then you're rational. It's not like it's impossible to be rational just because you're not smart enough in the same way that it's not impossible to be rational just because you aren't physically strong enough. Intelligence is just one of many tools.
