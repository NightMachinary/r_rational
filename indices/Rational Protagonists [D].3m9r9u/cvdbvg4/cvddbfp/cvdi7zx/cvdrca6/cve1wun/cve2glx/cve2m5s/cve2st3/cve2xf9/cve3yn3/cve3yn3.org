Ahhh. The S9000s. Lol. I personally didn't enjoy that arc too much. It seemed to diminish or trivialize how threatening the Slaughterhouse 9 has been in the Wormverse. I would say Worm is worth finishing, then. The resolution to the S9000 is fairly interesting and the final conflict is a /very/ interesting read. Both for its stakes and for the perspective we see it from. The epilogue and associated interludes are also a nice touch. Kind of a "Where are they now" sort of deal.
