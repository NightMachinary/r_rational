  Well, I've never thought about it in-depth, but I feel like the shard shenanigans (PtV being blind to Scion, Conflict Balls, etc.) were implemented so that the game wasn't broken too early

Sure, I agree. I have no problem with the idea of the PTV shards being blind to the entities -- if you were going to hand them out, it makes perfect sense to make sure they can't be used against you. My problem is that we are canonically told that they weren't supposed to be given out, then they actually worked against Eve, and /then/ they stopped working. Did Eve do the switch as she went brain-dead? Did Scion do it? If so, why didn't he turn off everyone's shards when he was fighting them?

  I wouldn't consider Worm to strictly be rational.

Right. And yet, it's almost always included in the list of rational stories, and I don't understand why.

  ...Wildbow didn't have to break the bank by coming up with a totally revised world landscape (which is what would happen, if we tried to rationalize an Earth that has had superpowers for 50+ years)

Believe me, I know what that's like.

  Some of the mutations would've been a BITCH to keep under lock and key, and it was probably more trouble than it was worth to actually hold onto all of them.

No argument from me, but they /did/ keep people locked up. The first scene where Numbers Man fights, it's because a bunch of 53s are trying to escape.
