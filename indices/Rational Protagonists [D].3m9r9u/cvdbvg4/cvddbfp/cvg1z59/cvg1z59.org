*SPOILERS FOR WORM*

You know, I frequently hear Worm held up as an example of rational fiction, but it always leaves me confused. I've forgotten large swaths of the story (it was huge, and I read it a while ago), so maybe there's some important fact that I'm missing -- the fact that Worm is almost universally regarded as an exemplar of rational writing suggests I'm missing something.

Here are some of my issues with Worm as a rational story, laid out according to the points on the sidebar. Would someone please explain to me what I've missed?

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

Capes fight each other instead of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck][CuttingLexLuthorACheck]] because they have alien worms in their heads that are a literal [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall][Conflict Ball]].

The worms were put there by giant aliens who are seeking a way to stop the heat death of the universe. These aliens are looking to gain power from (comparatively) primitive alien races in order to further this goal. Their idea of the best way to do this is "put alien worms in their heads that will make them fight each other" instead of "approach them diplomatically and work with them, putting alien worms in their heads for research purposes."

Contessa's "path to victory" shard showed her how to kill one of the aliens but not the other. Here's the way I remember this sequence; please correct me if I have it wrong:

1. The alien (Eve?) crashed into Earth for reasons I don't remember and became injured
2. Because she was injured, she accidentally handed out the PTV shard without meaning to
3. She set the "don't work on me or Scion" bit on the PTV shard, but only after Contessa and Dr. Mother had used it to stab her in the neck
4. From then on the PTV shard no longer worked on Scion or anything related to him. This is suspiciously convenient for the plot. Am I forgetting something?

Scion was a hero because that's what his first human contact told him to be. Then he became a villain because Jack talked him into it.

Scion started wiping out humans in all dimensions, but when attacked by capes he toyed with them instead of just killing them.

All of the capes knew they couldn't stop Scion in a straight-up fight, but that was what they did until Taylor came along and saved the day.

- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

Did the original Slaughterhouse 9 have an agenda? I remember them simply being sadists and serial killers for the fun of it. I believe that Cherish and some others got dragged in against their will and remained reluctant, but what about the ones we met first?

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

No one really munchkins their power except for Taylor. Who was that Ward who could make hands come out of anything around him as long as he was touching some of the same substance? Taylor was the one who taught him to keep samples of stuff inside his costume, and to make hands come out of the hands in order to extend his reach.

Doctor Mother, Numbers Man, Contessa, think that the best way to handle the Case 53s is to wipe their memories and drop them off somewhere instead of using them in-house.
