True. But that's not exactly what I'm getting at. It's not so much that I'm asking about NOT preaching in story to characters. I'm asking about doing away with the "preaching" entirely. Internally or otherwise. As someone pointed out earlier, Worm is a very good example of a fairly rational piece of fiction (fairly.)
