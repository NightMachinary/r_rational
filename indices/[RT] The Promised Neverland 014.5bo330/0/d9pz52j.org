I think this is the first time that I really noticed these children aren't /quite/ human. I mean I can conceive of children being smart enough to perform complex deception, coming up with elaborate plans, and even being good at fooling experienced adults. But the biggest anomaly to me is the fact that Ray at six years old was able to come up with and act out a plan spanning a period of time equivalent of /his own life span/. It is rare to non-existent to find such long term planning abilities in children so young. This is concrete evidence that the demons must have been selectively breeding for higher intelligence.

Also, the part that I'm most curious about is just what has Ray ordered over the years. Because I doubt Mama is going to tell him anything about the outside. So if he's been ordering based on the books he has read, then all of his information is partially out of date and there are hidden gaps in his knowledge concerning objects made/technology within the past few years. Finally, others probably know about Ray knowing, because would Mama really not tell anyone and keep up a constant rate of 'ordering' unusual objects over years without anyone noticing? I bet Mama has guessed part of Ray's plan.
