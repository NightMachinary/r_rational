Ray could be lying and being in fact working for mama while he pretends to be pretending to spy for her pretending to work for them.Ray could even be a quintuple agent( and If Yudkowsky was the author I would even expect that) . But I don't think Ray has any motive to be working for mama since the only thing mama could offer him would be keeping him instead of shipping him but Ray isn't stupid and wouldn't had believed that .

Also Maybe mama has micros and or other spy in the house? so I woulndt talk about Ray's secret in the house ,and also not in a place were it was obvious that they are talking about something secret or at least they should talk in whispers . Mama surely knows Ray is trying to escape but maybe she doest know all his plan although is posible she has a good enough model of him to know he was collecting intel instead of just getting things he wants .
