I can accept her just adding on Ray's orders to what she normally orders, but unless Mama varies what she orders each month, then Ray's order should stand out as unusual by changing each month. Also I really doubt that Mama is allowed to handle everything on the farm without any form of oversight. She most likely has to justify her decisions/orders to somebeing. I'll bet anything that there is some hidden enemy waiting who is aware of most to everything that Mama knows.

Maybe Mama isn't even human herself and only /looks/ human.
