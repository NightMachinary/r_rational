I don't think he was planning so much as simply working towards a goal.

Even when I was six, I had long term goals that I worked towards, some even spanned multiple years.

So I don't think he hatched a plan six years ago and it's coming to fruition now. I think he just had a goal six years ago, and slowly acquired information and resources over the years while a plan fermented in the back of his mind.

I mean, it's not like they're using Ray's Surfire Escape Plan(tm) now, they're coming up with their own plan and Ray's intel will probably be a key factor in ensuring it's success.
