I really *really* fucking hate the gross (gross as in excessive, not gross as in ewwww.....although it could be that too) caricatures that certain animes and mangas have. For some characters, it really works. But, more often than not, I'm just put off by it and my immersion is completely broken by the sudden shift in art. Ugh.
