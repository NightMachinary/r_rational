Damn, Ray's been playing the long game. I can understand where he's coming from, not wanting six years of effort to go up in smoke due to Emma's desire to save everyone. On the other hand, it was either a miscalculation of his when he set the wheels in motion for Norman and Emma to find out about the whole charade, or it was unavoidable. He likely knew he couldn't get out alone, and informing just Norman would have resulted in Norman telling Emma anyway.

And now, he's really putting the pressure on Norman with this latest move. I'm curious to see what Norman does, as the effective leader and primary planner of the operation.
