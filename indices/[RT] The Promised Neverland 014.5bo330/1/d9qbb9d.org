I enjoyed this chapter especially because the main characters are approaching the escape plan from totally incompatible perspectives, but all of them are understandable and sympathetic. Emma's idealistic determination to pursue the "golden ending" even at the risk of losing everything, Ray's pragmatic hedging of his bets to protect what he values most at the expense of any chance at the "golden ending", and Norman's internal conflict between those two approaches all make perfect sense to me. I'm really interested to see how this conflict plays out.

I kind of find all the dramatic shots of Ray's edgy facial expressions hard to take seriously, but I guess that's just part of the medium. It doesn't detract from the story too much.

I also wonder how much Mama suspects that Ray might imminently stab her in the back, and what her contingency plans are in that event. He was loyal to her for six years to keep himself alive, but she has to expect that her hold over him will slip as his shipping date approaches, right? What does she have to offer him at this point?
