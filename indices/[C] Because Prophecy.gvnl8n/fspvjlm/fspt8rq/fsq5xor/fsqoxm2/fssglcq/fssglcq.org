I might really enjoy a story about prophecies where there's like, five different competing deities that each keep sending their own to people to get them to do different (ultimately not often great) things. People wouldn't even know they're not from the same source, but the meme of "Omg a prophecy we have to listen to it" is itself just such a bizarre thing to have in any world that takes itself seriously.
