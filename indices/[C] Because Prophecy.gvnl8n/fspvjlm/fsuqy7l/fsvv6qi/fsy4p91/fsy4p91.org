Sure! What I meant was, I feel that

#+begin_quote
  "Sometimes you have to trust people [to] be more than their worst thoughts [or words]."
#+end_quote

is a very important message for many people to internalize, but it didn't feel directly analogous/relevant to the scene we were shown. When I tried to map it onto part of the story, the two likeliest candidates were

- Kaylee's mother's (unspecified!) unfavorable thoughts
- Vanessa's thought line, /Am I really going to risk throwing my career away for a girl I just met?/

Both of those seem to be related to the overall topic of the story (the distinctions between thoughts and feelings, and how each characters' abilities cause them to form potentially inaccurate judgments due to incomplete perspectives).

However...

- the first is a bit distant from the ultimate conclusion and focus; we're not specifically focused on Kaylee's relationship with her mother (perhaps moreso her relationship with her ability, and with other people in general)
- the second doesn't give a "worst thoughts" vibe, at least not to me; if Kaylee (understandably) falls for the same "selfishness" bias that she notes in others' thoughts, maybe that makes it a bit more of a match I suppose!
