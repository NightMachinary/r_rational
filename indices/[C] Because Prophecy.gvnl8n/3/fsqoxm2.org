I'm reminded of something thought when reading a scene in the Recluce series--"I saw myself acting more brutally, and I didn't, and now people are dead who didn't have to die"--/who's steering?/ Who's deciding desirable outcomes and dictating to you what to do to get them? More to the point, how can you get to the position of being the one to choose the outcomes and know why your choices are having those effects, rather than being yanked around by someone else's priorities?

(Mental image: "...and as it turns out, that one moment was the crucial tipping point to set in motion a chain of events that would end in the complete genocide of the green-skinned peoples. The ancient wizards HATED the green-skin peoples, mainly because they believed red was the most holy colour and thought back then that green was the opposite of red.")
