For prophecies, as with contracts, the 'or' is nice. 'I will do such-and-such OR be fined by the government for two thirds of my net wealth at time of signing, to be paid to the other signatories.' 'I will not betray my spouse in sickness or in health, OR my own pre-nuptial contract defenses will be invalidated.' 'Quit it with the slavery, OR all your innocent children will mysteriously die.' 'Repair the dam, OR after about two or three more floods it's going to break and kill everyone nearby with floods.' After enough prophecies--ideally delivered with aspects which are hard to fake--which provide meaningful things, the idea of enforcing them becomes more compelling... at least (for the case of punishments) until humans could reach up and drag the punisher down from their throne.

Something I've enjoyed in a few different fictions is 'Yes, we found you because of a prophecy, and the prophecy also prophesies our eventual triumph over the other side, but the other side also has its OWN prophesies.'. One that I can't remember the name of at the moment more or less played it straight, and fairly shallowly; The Redemption of Althalus I remember had a scene of {Side B making a prophesy of Side A's member being laid low (as a princess in her own palace?) by Side B's member} which was dealt with by going along with it and being obediently laid low before, prophesy having been satisfied, having lots of long-prepared secret forces jump out and easily overcome the Side B members who had just been doing the laying-low of Side A members.
