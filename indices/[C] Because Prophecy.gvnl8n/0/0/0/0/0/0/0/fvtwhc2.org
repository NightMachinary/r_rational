Yeah, the general pattern in Kaylee's life so far has been one where people's worst thoughts have seemed representative. Vanessa is demonstrating herself to be someone where that's not the case, and she's basically just saying she's not special; the fact that everyone has thoughts like that on occasion doesn't mean they always reflect how they really feel, or how they'll act :)

  Haha, your “late response“ only serves to remind me of how awesome it is to be able to talk with you! This fan wasn't expecting a particular response and so hearing your explanation is 100% a bonus :D
