Oh, that makes a lot of sense! It's now been awhile since I read it but I don't recall making that connection, because it seemed already addressed. The explicit spelling out of Vanessa's (your?) message made me try to pattern-match to a specific event rather than to assorted multiple events in the story; of course, it might be just an idiosyncrasy of mine to do this!
