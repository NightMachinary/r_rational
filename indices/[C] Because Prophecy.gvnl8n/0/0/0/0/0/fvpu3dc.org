Wow, sorry for the late response, for whatever reason I missed the notification for this!

My intention was for the thoughts of the mother to be seen as (probably) indicative of how she really feels, while Vanessa's thoughts are clearly not, but the broader examples are those like the school attendant who Vanessa asked about earlier, which Kaylee said is concerned about how long this would take, or other school staff whose thoughts are not always supportive or empathetic :)
