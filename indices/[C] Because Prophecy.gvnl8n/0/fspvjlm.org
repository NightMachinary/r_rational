Also, might as well post this here for those that missed it; a few months back I was commissioned to write a short story set in the universe of a new superhero comic series called Incident Report. The basic premise is pretty straightforward: a substantial minority of people started developing powers in the not too distant past, and in the modern day the government tries to keep track of everyone who develops powers, called Chimerans.

My story is unconnected from the main plot of the comics, and is just a "what if" scenario I thought would be neat. Hope you enjoy it!
