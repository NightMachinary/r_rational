As I recall from actually reading the story, the magician is for some reason unable to use the ring or retrieve the lamp. I think that you can only do either if you are naive, or something, kind of like the "diamond in the rough" concept from the Disney film. That's why he sends Aladdin: the magic somehow bars him from retrieving the lamp himself. I don't think he actually knows that the ring can summon genies, only that it's magical and somehow related to retrieving the lamp.
