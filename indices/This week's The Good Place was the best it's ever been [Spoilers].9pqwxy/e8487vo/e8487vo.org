I've been watching the first few episodes and the attitude really irks me. The total disregard for the potential of an eternal future in the hell feels so unrealistic. Sure, someone might in moment forget or hope that nobody finds out but I can't possibly imagine someone being like "oh I know that these lessons will secure my eternal life but I can't be arsed to even open the book I was given for homework."

Does that attitude change?
