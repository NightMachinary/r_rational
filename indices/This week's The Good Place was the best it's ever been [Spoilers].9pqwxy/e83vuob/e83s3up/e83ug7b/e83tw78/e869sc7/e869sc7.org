This is one of the main reasons I love The Good Place. It really showcases just how uncaring and thoughtless divine beings would have to be, to actually design and implement an afterlife that works anything like the traditional one.

I especially love how it contrasts this with all the evidence that these beings really are beyond human understanding in real, concrete ways. Like the Jeremy Berenstein sketch they had in the episode, about how time works differently in the afterlife relative to the normal world, or all those throw away signs about humans having too few senses to truly perceive the universe, or how all of the afterlife characters are all really, really old.

I find the Good Place at it's best, when I realize that Michael isn't just being particularly bad at explaining something; it's just that the concept is, canonically, supposed to be beyond what the human brain is capable of handling.

I would say it's less that our human characters are smarter than whoever designed the universe. I think it's more that they're in a situation, where the afterlife was designed by eldritch, ascended, beyond human-comprehension Cthulu-like beings, who didn't actually understand humans that well, and never bothered to do the research. It would be like a particularly lazy teen trying to design a perfect zoo for animals they've never seen before. They may be smarter than those animals in qualitative and quantitative ways, capable of producing thoughts and entertaining concepts the animals could literally never understand... and yet they're still probably going to do a really, really bad job at designing that zoo, because they simply don't care.

To me, the scariest part of the Good Place is the sheer apathy of the afterlife. Nobody involved in the process of judging people actually seems to care that much about people; they're all just punching clocks, waiting for their shift (the universe) to end.
