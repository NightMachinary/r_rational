It'd be interesting if, when her time comes to be judged, her selfishness-via-knowledge bars her from the Good Place, but her actions nonetheless bar her from the Bad Place... and all of a sudden we find out that /there is a third option/ - one which is not generally known about, which only a vanishingly small fraction of souls end up with, but the existence of which could, in theory, have been logically deduced from carefully watching the show.

Examples: Do there exist beings/characters in the show which are (or might be) younger than the existence of the Places, are not currently living a normal pre-death life (i.e. regular humans etc), and which also have (as far as can be told) not been sorted into one of the two Places? Where do you think they came from?

Other alternatives: the Unsorted are the ones keeping everything running behind the scenes. They're bureaucrats, assistants, maintenance, tech support. The vast majority of beings of all stripe couldn't recognize them on sight and wouldn't pay attention to anything they were doing. They have appeared in background shots throughout the series.

Or... there are more afterlife frameworks than the Places. Possibly older ones. But since their creation, the Places have been sucking up almost all the souls. That doesn't mean the older afterlives aren't there any more...
