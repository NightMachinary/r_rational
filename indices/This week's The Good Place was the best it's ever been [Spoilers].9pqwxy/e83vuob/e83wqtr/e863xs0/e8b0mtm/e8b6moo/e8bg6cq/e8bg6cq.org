Another take: Michael mentions "millennials," who are demons who have only been around for a thousand years. Maybe demons (and angels?) are former human souls who have become purely good or evil through enough thousands of years of torment/paradise. That would explain why the standards for getting into the Good Place are so strict: only the humans who start out with the most inherent goodness have the potential to ascend to angel-hood.

Maybe the whole afterlife system is how they reproduce.
