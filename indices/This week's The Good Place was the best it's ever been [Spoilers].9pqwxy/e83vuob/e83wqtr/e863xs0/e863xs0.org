  My dream for the show is that it ends with the Bad Place being dismantled entirely. I don't think you can have a good show about moral philosophy where the characters don't eventually reach the conclusion that eternal torture is unacceptable. Fingers crossed.

Yes, exactly. Especially since it doesn't even work as a deterrent. It /can't/, by design, due to the just desserts doctrine. So it's literally completely pointless. Eleanor had it right from the beginning: give people /at least/ a Medium Place if you really don't feel like rewarding them.
