  My dream for the show is that it ends with the Bad Place being dismantled entirely

I would go one step less far and say my dream is that the protagonists realize that this should be their ultimate goal. My impression is that the universe of the show is organized less as the machinery of a grand designer, and more as an ecosystem of competing values.

The problem is that the demons have about half the power, and they get to use it more efficiently. It's less work to design a world that tortures 234 people forever, than it is to design a neighborhood that keeps them happy forever.
