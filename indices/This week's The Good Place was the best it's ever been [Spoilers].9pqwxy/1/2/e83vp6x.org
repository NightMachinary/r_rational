  Is the system for assigning points both unable to discern internal mind-states
#+end_quote

I believe it is able to discern them, because Tahani was originally sent to the Bad Place, in spite of her impressive track record of charitable giving, specifically because her motivations were corrupt (everything she did was basically a futile attempt to one-up her sister). But as [[/u/daytodave]] points out, the Judge doesn't seem to have that ability, or at least hasn't been shown using it. That suggests to me that the point-assigning system and the Judge might be distinct entities.

Notably, the system overall seems pretty unfair, in that it apparently demands that you adhere to /both/ deontological and utilitarian ethics. Tahani got Hell'd for corrupt intentions despite her positive impact, while Chidi got Hell'd for failing to make a positive impact despite his good intentions. I don't say this as a criticism of the show, since I think the unfairness is intentional.
