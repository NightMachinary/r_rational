What's interesting is that Janet /does/ have perfect knowledge of the humans' internal mind states, but Jen /doesn't/. Jen is shown listening to testimony, reading case files, and performing tests to make the final decision about who goes to the Good Place or Bad Place. It's not clear if Jen is capable of looking inside Janet's head, but it seems like Jen is "programmed" with a misguided notion of "neutrality" that tells her that because Janet has already decided to side with the humans, information that comes directly from her can't be trusted.

Did I mention that this is an NBC comedy? And that they pack all of this into a story that still gets the popular viewership to run in NBC primetime? And that I'm extremely drunk?
