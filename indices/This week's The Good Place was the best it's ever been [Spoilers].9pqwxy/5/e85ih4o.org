Given that they are supposed to now be in an alternate timeline (goodness how many jokes did they get out a freaking timeline!), I'm honestly confused how they are supposed to actually save "anyone". Are they actually saving copies of the people they used to know? How does that work?

From what they said in the episode my intuition says that everyone else in the universe, apart from the main six, should actually be philosophical zombies.

And if not, then the afterlife folks end up with a curious situation where they will have judged the same soul twice, with potentially different outcomes. How could they square that?
