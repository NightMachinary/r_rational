Yes! This episode was amazing. For starters it was consistently hilarious, but I'm also really happy to see Michael and Janet re-expanding their focus from "save these specific humans" to "rework the whole fucked-up afterlife system," and to see the Cockroaches' focus expand from "save ourselves" to "save as many as we can." Michael was so hyperfocused on the main four in the second episode that I was worried those larger threads would be dropped. I'm not worried about that anymore.

My dream for the show is that it ends with the Bad Place being dismantled entirely. I don't think you can have a good show about moral philosophy where the characters /don't/ eventually reach the conclusion that eternal torture is unacceptable. Fingers crossed.
