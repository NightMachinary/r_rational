Demons consistently describe torture as fun, and at the point when Janet realizes that the main four are the only actual humans around, she decides to help them, simply because her purpose is to make humans happy. In the episode where they introduced the Medium Place, they described BP and GP entities as arguing over who /gets/ the soul of Mindy St. Clair. So it seems that the purpose of the places isn't to encourage good behavior on earth, but to fulfill the eternal beings desire punish/reward people.
