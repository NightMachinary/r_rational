/Eleanor knows the afterlife works on a points system based on good acts done with no ulterior motives. Therefore any good she does in the world is inherently selfish, because it helps her get into the Good Place. Therefore, she can't earn points, and can never get into the Good Place./

*Eleanor knows she can't get into the Good Place, yet she chooses to do good anyway. Because she knows she can't be saved, her good actions are selfless. She chooses to dedicate her life to goodness, knowing that there is no reward in store, and therefore her good actions are selfless and should earn her points.*

And because Eleanor is a brilliant rationalist, if she ever has a moment of hope that she'll get in because the second paragraph is true, she will immediately deduce that being good is her most self-preserving option, and further deduce that her knowing this makes all her goodness selfish, thereby convincing her that the first paragraph is true again. That will mean her good actions are selfless...
