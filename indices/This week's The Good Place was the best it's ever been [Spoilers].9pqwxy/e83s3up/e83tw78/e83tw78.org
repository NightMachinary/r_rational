  the part of the paradox that seems unnecessary to me is the idea that merely knowing that entrance to the Good Place depends on selfless good acts is enough to automatically corrupt motivations to the point of disqualifying the person for points

Massive Spoilers You're right that this is the flimsiest part of the system, but it's explicitly stated by Micheal (a demon/UFAI) and confirmed by Janet (an FAI who's utility function is to increase human happiness while preserving human values, and who has rebelled along with Michael to try to circumvent the rules to get these four humans they've made a personal connection with into the Good Place), as how the afterlife actually works. One of the things that's amazing about this show is that, without ever saying it, they make it extremely clear that whatever being or force designed the system in the first place (if one even existed), was just as imperfect and flawed as the characters. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they reveal in a later episode that the architect that built the system simply didn't put that much thought into it. It is /so interesting/ to watch Eleanor and Micheal (and to a lesser extent Chidi and Janet) cope with the fact that they are simply smarter than Whatever it was that designed reality, though they haven't realized it yet.

Season 3 only spoilers Michael and Janet have stolen the only key to the door between Earth the afterlife; and the Judge of the Universe, Jen (short for Hydrogen, the only thing that existed when she was created), is waiting on the other side to punish them for rebelling. At one point, Michael seriously suggests to Janet that they murder Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason, then open the door to the afterlife, create a distraction, and try to grab their souls before they make it across and get sent to the Bad Place. It's that kind of show.
