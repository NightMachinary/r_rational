I haven't seen the episode, but the part of the paradox that seems unnecessary to me is the idea that merely knowing that entrance to the Good Place depends on selfless good acts is enough to automatically corrupt motivations to the point of disqualifying the person for points. It certainly raises the /question/ of whether or to what degree motivations for that person's good actions are selfish or unselfish, but it shouldn't change the /actual fact/ of whether the person principally has others or themselves in mind as they act. Is the system for assigning points both unable to discern internal mind-states and willing to reject selfless but knowledgeable people merely on the basis of their knowledge? If this were a justice system it would be "guilty until proven innocent".
