Well, given that he isn't /dead/ dead, maybe something else trumped it.

  Between this and fusion beams barely inconveniencing Flagg

Flagg/O'Dim (and countless other names besides) is a functionally immortal being who is highly skilled in magic, alchemy, and social manipulation. He has 'walked' pretty much every ruined version of the Tower multiverse, and in most cases has been the cause or at least the catalyst of their destruction. He also has a patron in the form of a demonic entity that is functionally a Lovecraftian incarnation of chaos.

He was at ground zero for a /nuclear blast/ at the end of *The Stand*, and escaped simply by moving /sideways/ to an alternate Earth. He's darn near impossible to kill by any physical means if he is able to act, and it's only through mind control by a powerful psychic that he was ever finally defeated at all.

I'm cool with a suddenly radioactive knife being unable to kill him. She was lucky to get his hand.
