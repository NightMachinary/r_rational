Hah! Excellent final line.

I am still a bit miffed at Aslan's instakill dagger overruling Pathfinder spells when we just went through the whole Cecelia arc to show that people in stories are most effected by things that match their stories when conflicts happen. Sean being in Haley's story should overwrite Aslans.

Between this and fusion beams barely inconveniencing Flagg, it really seems like Haley's powerup is flashy but useless. Despite it being story magic based its treated like physical attacks against conceptual attacks.

It is clearly done because without narrative rules, Haley has already become God, but it still leaves a dirty taste in my mouth when a protagonist wins early and then has that win invalidated for plot reasons (external Doylist plot not Watsonian).
