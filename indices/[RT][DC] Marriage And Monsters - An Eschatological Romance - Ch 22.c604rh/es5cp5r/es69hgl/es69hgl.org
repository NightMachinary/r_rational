The thing is Haley changed her story. Initially it was Seans story about keeping up with his idealized wife; when she took over it changed to being her story of finding purpose.

Sean isn't part of her story explicitly because she denies him /being/ her purpose. He became just a plot Macguffin for Haley to use against Aslan.

Sean isn't a part of any story when Aslan traps him, so Aslan has priority.
