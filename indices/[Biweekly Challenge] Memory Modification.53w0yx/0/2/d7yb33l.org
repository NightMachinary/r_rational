Note that the fourth paragraph, describing the official records of the war, does not update properly; it should change the initial Eastasia reference to Eurasia.

Also, since the change appears to be based on when elements lose visibility, you can play with it by zooming out (thus reading the whole thing without it changing) or in (thus making early references change before later ones do).

Cool effect though :).
