Yeah, it's an effect of the javascript scrolling. If you zoom in and scroll down more (or if you use a smaller screen), it'll update properly.

(It updates when you scroll past the enitre paragraph block)

With longer webfiction spanning multiple pages, you could store cookies so that it all updates properly. Although that would force the reader to go back and reread the updated content, which may or may not be annoying.
