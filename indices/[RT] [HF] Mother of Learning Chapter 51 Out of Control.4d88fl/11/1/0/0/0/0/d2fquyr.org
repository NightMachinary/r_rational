You're probably right about that, the conclusion of Sakoru Mansion's siege and taking out the undead dragon probably will take quite a bit of time out of this update (we've never really been shown a protracted battle but this seems like a good time for it; might even get a glimpse of the Silver One again if we're lucky). And even after that, I guess there's a lot that needs to happen in the next restart (mind packet, etc.)

I'm just trying to hold myself accountable and putting opinions online before an update is one way of doing that.
