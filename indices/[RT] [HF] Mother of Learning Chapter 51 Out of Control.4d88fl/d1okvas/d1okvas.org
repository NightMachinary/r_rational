That chapter name is promising. Yep, registering multiple substance impacts on the fan.

When Alanic said the soul well was tugging on his souls... Is it a typo or does he really have multiple souls?

And... as long as we're talking of plurals, I'm fairly certain plural of vortex is vortices. (don't hate me)

So, Zorian made a huge splash. It is possible that the gateway to Ibasa is already functioning and invaders will be sending backup in the next chapter, meaning even further escalation of conflict. Not that they have a chance against Military forces, but they could wipe Zorian's party, since it's not a full-blown army and then stall, maybe. Somehow.

The bigger problem is that this should alert Red Robe in the next restart to see if Zorian would repeat the assault on Sudomir. Zorian should really try to lay low and focus on that memory packet. The clock is still ticking.
