Zorian finally achieves his goal of levitating his little sister at the beginning of the loop. I think he entirely skipped the small animal portion of that training, (the last living thing I remember him levitating was a praying mantis) so Xvim's lessons must have been pretty damn useful.

I agree with the other poster that going after Sudomir instead of focusing on the memory packet wasn't entirely sensible, but at least Zorian made an attempt to explain his actions and things spiraled out of his control pretty quickly once Alanic decided he needed to be involved. I feel like the major factor is still plot reasons though. The information in the packet would either alter his later decisions too much and/or it would be more dramatic to reveal it after this particular storyline.

Feels like that early bit of discussion with Barak is some supporting evidence for the time loop being alternate universes, because of the whole "copies of people" thing.

The basic theory I'm running on at this point:

1. From the original timeline at the start of the planar alignment, a few hours before Zorian wakes up, a copy is made of the nearby physical universe.

2. Copies of souls are added. For time loopers, it uses the soul that existed at the end of the last loop. For "soulkilled" beings, it doesn't make copies at all.

3. This splinter universe and people in it carry out their lives for a month, at which point the planar alignment reaches its peak and the splinter universe ceases to exist, any "time-looper" souls tagged by the master spell are then inserted into their new bodies in another newly created universe. This can be triggered early with the death of the prime time-looper (Zach) or activation of the switch on Zach and Zorian's souls.

4. Rinse and Repeat several thousand times. The timeloop spell runs out of charge.

5. Loop ends, the time-looper souls are reinserted into their original bodies at the start of the "loop". "Soulkilled" beings are once again present.

And then we'll have the final story arc, with no second chances at that point. Interference from demonic/divine planes will once again be on the table, as will predicting the future after the planar alignment's peak.
