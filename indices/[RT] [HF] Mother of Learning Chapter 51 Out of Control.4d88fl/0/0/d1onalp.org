It feels like the memory deterioration deadline is used whenever something needs to be handwaved away and is ignored whenever the main plotline needs to be advanced.

I am guessing author is trying to synchronise the moment when the two plot lines (Aranea's revelation v.s. Ultimate stand down) will blow up in Zorian's face, and the timelines ended up a bit more mismatched than originally intended.
