Has it been confirmed that it works this way? I mean, if Zorian dies after one week, would the mind packet degrade by a full month anyway, or would it only degrade by that one week?

Does his soul get sent back immediately (and concurrently from the souls of Zach and Red Robe and any other potential time stragglers because of time shenanigans), or does it remain floating around somewhere for the entire duration of the restart, with the mind packet continuously degrading, for the entire month until the restart?
