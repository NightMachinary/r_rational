I thought that the reason Zorian usually didn't go twice after the same web was because after reading their minds once, he saw no value in doing so again, as he had already gone through them. Maybe he thought that there were no longer any secrets hidden in that particular aranea, or that if he had done it once, that he would be able to do so again effortlessly and thus it would be useless to him in gaining more skills?

They never really specified, so it's hard to tell whether or not that method you suggested would truly help.
