are you sure the probability of him showing up rises, or the probability that he /will have shown up/ rises?

if he has a 50% chance of showing up, the chance of him having shown up will be 50% the first day, 75% the next, 87.5% the next, 93.75% the next, if I'm doing my math right... is that what you meant?
