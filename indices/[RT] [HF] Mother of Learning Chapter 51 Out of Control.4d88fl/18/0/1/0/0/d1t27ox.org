I was also frustrated with the animation spell recall scene because of how vague it was... But based on soft clues, I'd agree that 4-8 is a pretty likely range.

Speaking of animation spell practice (which was basically light torture), this means if it is Daimen, for him to have gained soul sight he must have performed one of those murder necromantic rites Kael describes, btw.
