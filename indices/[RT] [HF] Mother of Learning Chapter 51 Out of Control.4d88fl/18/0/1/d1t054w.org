It would be much easier to answer this question if we knew how much older Damien is compared to Zorian. If he's only a couple years older, it's possible. If he's five years older, I seriously doubt it since that's about as long as Zorian has been in the time loop and his brother is described as a genius.

Personally, I'd guess that Damien is about four or more years older (two years older to have graduated already, and then to have been successful at archaelogy at least another couple years).
