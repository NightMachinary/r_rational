Edit: It is nice to have the author to reply :)

Good Worldbuilding is very hard to write. Many great stories simply ignores the Economics of their world.(E.g. Harry Potter's bullshit currency exchange rate) I don't think theres in a need for an in-depth worldbuilding for the story cos it will takes up a large part of the story focus. Adding in snippets and commentaries will be more than enough.

Mother of Learning have very few plotholes in the stories, most of the political motivations could be explained/covered/traced back to the effects of splinter wars & The weeping.(A few comments by best girl tinami or old history teacher will do) Which makes it easy to explain without adding alot more unnecessary information.(Too much info might hurt the focus & enjoyment of the story)

--------------

I feel the need to address this cos it might cause major plot holes in the future. Especially:

1.)The motive for Great North Push

2.)The motive for Ibasans Invasion (I have another explaination for the motivation other than the above, however its much more complex than the one above.)

3.)The unfeasible relationship between the crown and mage guild.(Harder to explain due to complex relationship between the Nature of Power & Politics)

However all this could easily be explain with less than half of a chapter. Other than this the story have a wonderful world thats extremely well built and thought out, which really impresses me alot for a writing as a hobby!

--------------

I just wanted to point out that to write a good world-building:

1.)Geopolitics is VERY important.(Determines all of a country political strategies)

2.) All political actors MUST* be Rational thinkers(Unless they are mad like Sudomir.)

3.) Politics/history should be dynamic and Interelated*. (Chain(s) of Events/ Cause & Effects)

4.) All action taken by actors should be feasible. (Economically and Logically)

--------------

P.s Half of my motivation of writing this essay is me hoping for a sequel more in-depth into the world:D.(A huge waste for such a well built world to end.) Especially a good one that explain about how the existence of magic might affect the Politics, Economy & Production. (E.g. Crystalised mana powered train) Its an itch that no story ever addressed before.

P.P.s I shuld really start explaining on the crown and mage guild.
