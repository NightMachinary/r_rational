I love the world building that nobody103 is currently doing. However i have a few questions and speculations particularly on the politics of Altazia that i wish for clarification.

NOTE: I highly suggest people View the map and READ all of the comments below the Map

1.) Where did The Weeping originated from?

The Weeping, in my opinion, is the most interesting point in telling history of Altiazia. It acts a major catalyst for the whole story. The Weeping wipeout 1/5 of a country population. Sapping the vitality of major nations and their ability to wage wars, due to the reduced productivity & loss of population. This break in turn allows lots of micro-nations to continue to exist after the Splinter wars.(More in Details later) The Ulquuan Ibasa seizes the opportunity to launch an invasion. (Which seems to be extremely ineffective in the terms geopolitics and more like to terrorism). The only clue given on the origin of Weeping is that it originated from Eldemar. The logical Conclusion i have is that the Weeping is naturally born from the war during the splinter wars. Diseases such as thyroid, INFLUENZA /wink/, Syphilis, cholera could traces their existence in Major Wars/ Warring period. (source below) I like this idea as it adds depth into the World Building by showing that the world built is dynamic and the events are interrelated somehow, a sense of realism to the world.

2.) The reason Behind The Great Push. Colonizing and cultivating new lands is extremely costly in terms of money, resource & Manpower. Historically, the colonization of Americas boils down to 2 points, 1. The hope of finding gold 2. Escape from European religious and feudal war. It makes no sense for Eldemar to devote its resources into cultivating new lands when

1. No mention of precious mental or resources throughout the story in the Great Northern Forest.

2. Weak, fertile/developed micro-States neighbors ripe for the taking. Developed lands are way easier, cheaper and profitable than cultivating new ones.

3. Strong rivals that are either Extremely Wealthy/Technologically Advance or have Powerful Military. The rival Nations may threaten Eldemar if it focus too much resources into cultivating & colonizing new land, neglecting its military or technology.

4. Decentralizes the government. Larger area = harder to maintain = more power to governor/merchant/church/Mage Guild/(/Impt). A big No-No to any monarchy constitution.

I speculate that Eldemar are diplomatically isolated by her rivals and neighbor states. Meaning, all of them wants Eldemar to fuck off. This could be due to the fact that Eldemar is the direct successor to the old alliance and a lot of historic grievance towards Eldemar due to The Splinter Wars. This provide powerful incentives for other major power to form a coalition to wipe out Eldemar. Couple with the fact that Eldemar is located in Altiazia Central valley, which infers that Eldemar sits on a large spread of fertile plains that geographically speaking extremely easy to invade.

Eldemar might had taken the Russian approach and colonize large swath of land as buffer zones. (For more information into Russian reasons for colonizing Siberia the /Video Link/ below provides a great summary into the subject) might plan and using the Great Winter Mountains as a geography barrier thats much easier to defend. (Look at map 2)

4.) Is the Lich, Quatach-Ichl the de-facto Leader/King of Uquaan Ibasa? Is the Lich a Rational Actor in the story or is he mad and dangerous.

The Lich is my favourite character in the story for 1. the most OP character inside the story. 2. Seems to be highly intelligent/rational, given that his the most powerful mage in existence for a thousand years or something. The personality of the Lich is very important as to the next question.

1. What is even the purpose of Cyoria invasion for the Ibasans.

The Invasion itself seems to me to be utterly meaningless. Why would a country sent its finest army and general to commit seemingly meaningless terrorism?!? Even trying to summon a primordial demon just to wreak meaningless havoc! Even Real life terrorist have their own agenda in carrying out terrorism. It would make zero sense for a country to spend so much resources (Eg. Loot-crates filled with expensive potions and Cash) They even use up tamed Trolls which i guess cost a fucking bomb to breed and train. Sure its mentioned that the Ibasan felt left out by the rest of the continent and wanting to stay relevant like a suburban dad with his teenage son, but this invasion seems to be a utter waste of time and resources for such a poor country. They simply do not have the logistics and resource available in maintaining rule even after conquering it.First will be the army, than rebellion, followed opportunist neighboring countries invasion. The campaign was doomed to fail! Summoning the primordial rampaging around the continent is practically asking for it. Countries might group up and attack the Ibasan island as they view them to be a very serious threat. The same way america felt after 911 for this invasion. The invasion might be a rally point for a full blown invasion with full public support. Hell, even Zorian himself also said so that the government will act instead of idle around if the invasion succeeded. I hated this as it portrays the Ibasans as the same villain you will find in cartoons that find joy in creating meaningless trouble. The enemy suddenly feel very shallow and exist purely for the sake of the plot.

I feel that this invasion should serve as a act in a grander geopolitical strategy. For example, to become the 4th Force in the Altazia Central valley. The Ibasan have been looking for ways to get back into Altazia ever since the Necromancy Wars. However, as the old alliance stands, they do not have much chance against a singular powerful force that could crush any chance of invasion. So, they waited for any opportunity that arises and that first opportunity arises from the ashes of Splinter wars. The Old Alliance have finally been broken apart, however being isolated for the continent for a long time, their military was simply unmatched for the more technological advance militaries of the central continent nations. However, The Weeping which wiped out nearly 1/5 of the population on central continent had greatly reduced military power and influence of the bigger nation such as Eldemar and Sulamnon. The Ibasan view this as an opportunity to re-enter Altazia politics. The first thing they need to do is to be "relevant", to do so they decided invade Cyoria. I mean what better way to say your powerful and scary than to suddenly invade the second biggest city filled with powerful mage with a freaking huge as army that have mutant trolls and ironbeaks and ending off with summoning a huge as primordial beast in the middle of the said city. The Ibasan prolly plan for the primordial to rampage around the countryside of Eldemar for a day or two before it running out of juice. They then prolly "mysteriously" disappeared back in Cyoria.

Once the invasion is proclaimed successful, they could start reaching out towards all the smaller states who are sick of the three major powers. I mean between your neighbor enemy who prolly will annex you the next few years or an potentially strong ally who demonstrated the ability to raze a fucking city with an army of beast and able to summon a huge ass powerful beast to destroy you, theres really not much of a competition. Beside the Ibasans Mainland is so far away from the altazia continent. The huge distance could provide the smaller states relief as if they ever go to war with the Ibasans, they will have trouble maintaining the huge logistics and supply line for a prolonged war.

The end goal of the Ibasans is to establish itself as the 4th power by creating a new alliance of smaller noble nations, encircling the major power (REFER TO THE MAP BELOW) and acting as the center pillar of the alliance.

--------------

I hope that i have not missed out any minor details in the story and feel free to correct me if theres any flaws in my theory and pleas provide me with your opinion and your take on the political situation in Altazia. I Hated stories that perceive history and politics as a single chain of events. It should be dynamic as many factors are always connected with each other; cause(s) and effect(s). If requested i will do sort of a story version of the history Altazia Named "Splinter of Splinters" and post it up on reddit :P
