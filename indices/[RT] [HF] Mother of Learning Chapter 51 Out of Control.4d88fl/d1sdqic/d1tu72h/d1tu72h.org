  The Invasion itself seems to me to be utterly meaningless. Why would a country sent its finest army and general to commit seemingly meaningless terrorism?!? Even trying to summon a primordial demon just to wreak meaningless havoc!

I feel necromancy and any of the angle/demon stuff are both poorly explained and based on the planet alignment and time travel being linked, probably deeply related

Maybe demons are/have masses of soul energy? And this lich used a terrorist group to summon it just to drain it

Maybe the lich was late to join in this war and he's really after the soul crystal? He does have all his forces go through the place its being held which the day after the invasion may, just may be on their way home
