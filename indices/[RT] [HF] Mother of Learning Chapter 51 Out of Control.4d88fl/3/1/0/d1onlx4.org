I don't think that the process by which red robe survives a reset has been teased yet. My theory is that the simulacrum came about as a result of the whole situation revealed regarding Zac's family and inheritance in the last chapter. Kind of like a wonky "dark side" thing HPMOR had going on with Harry. This additional mention of simulacrums is meant to remind the reader of this previously established, unfired chekov's gun.

What I think will happen is that the upcoming end of arc 2 will reveal the identity of Red Robe at the climax, leaving the exact details as a cliffhanger. Zorian will be confronted on his distrust of Zac in some way, perhaps causing him to change his mind on it, and then he will be vindicated when Zac unwittingly betrays him, and Red Robe is revealed.
