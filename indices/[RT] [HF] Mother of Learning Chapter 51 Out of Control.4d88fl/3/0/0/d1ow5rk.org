  Perhaps the destruction of the simulacrum somehow confused the time loop sufficiently that it failed to loop him. If the time loop was built by people, programmed in soul magic, then it almost certainly has bugs. The destruction of a simulacrum of a simulacrum of the targeted entity might just hit a corner case.

I can't speak for the rest, but we know that this explanation cannot be right. The restart in which Red Robe confronted Zorian was the one after his simulacrum had been defeated. Therefore, we can confirm that he has already looped at least once since this event.

Furthermore, he seems to have a much better understanding of the time loop's characteristics and limitations than anyone else. If anyone would be aware of such an obvious problem with his own existence and the time loop itself, it would be him. Therefore, I strongly doubt that he would have used one of the only spells that could permanently disable himself. He's never shown himself to be this foolish.
