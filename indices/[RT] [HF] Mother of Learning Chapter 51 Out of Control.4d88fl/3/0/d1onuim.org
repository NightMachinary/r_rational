  For a moment, the matriarch was afraid that they had killed the man, making all her preparations and plotting meaningless... but the reality turned out to be far worse than that. Instead of erupting into a shower of blood and gore, the robed man simply... turned into smoke.

  The opponent they had been fighting hadn't been the third time traveler in person. It had been merely an ectoplasmic shell infused with some of his skill and magic. A simulacrum, meant to test the waters and distract them.

  A cone of purple light washed over the room, instantly slaying all of the human mercenaries and scores of her loyal aranea. Damnation -- their opponent had taken advantage of the distraction their simulacrum had provided and set up an ambush of his own. She turned to sound a retreat to-

  Grey hunters had known weaknesses. First of all, they were purely melee opponents -- if you could keep them at distance, there was nothing they could do to you. The trouble was that they were really, really good at closing in on their target. Secondly, they were ultimately just magical animals so they could be lured into prepared traps and kill zones fairly easily. The problem here was that they were fast and tough enough to probably survive such a blunder. The magic sense the grey hunter demonstrated in Zorian's first encounter with it probably also helped it avoid the most blatant of such traps.

  He could think of a several ways to trap it, but most of them required knowledge of spells that he didn't have. If he knew how to make a simulacrum and open portals, he could simply send in his simulacrum as bait and then open a portal leading to wherever he set the trap up. Hell, simply knowing how to make a simulacrum would make things a million times easier since he could make test his ideas without endangering himself. If he knew large terrain alteration spells he could simply seal it off in its lair and wait for it to suffocate. If he knew the spells to manipulate large amounts of water he might be able to drown it. And so on, and so on...

It's already confirmed that at one point in time Red Robe was a simulacrum, so that is evidence (though fairly weak) for your theory. If simulacrums are "sufficiently real that some people have argued the use of the spell is inherently unethical", then it seems possible that a simulacrum has sufficient agency to make different decisions than its progenitor. Alternatively, as a creation by soul magic, perhaps it might be possible for a hostile necromancer to forcibly create a simulacrum of a targeted individual and twist its purpose to their will; could Red Robe have been created by Quatach-Ichl when he attacked Zach and then have persisted separately in the time loop through Zach's soul mark?

Red Robe's simulacrum was killed by the aranea, then he ambushed and "soul-killed" the aranea, then he defeated Zorian and he hasn't turned up since. If Red-Robe-as-a-simulacrum could create a simulacrum of himself, that would be consistent with his ambush of the aranea.

Red Robe's disappearance could be elegantly explained if it was a consequence of the destruction of his simulacrum, however I don't see a particularly plausible set of circumstances and events that would be consistent with this. Perhaps the destruction of the simulacrum somehow confused the time loop sufficiently that it failed to loop him. If the time loop was built by people, programmed in soul magic, then it almost certainly has bugs. The destruction of a simulacrum of a simulacrum of the targeted entity might just hit a corner case.

It is also possible that Red Robe is some sort of soul construct, similar to but more "real" than a simulacrum, created by Quatach-Ichl from Zach. This might make it more credible that Red Robe could create his own simulacrum. Importantly, it means that if we learn more about the limitations of simulacrums and they are inconsistent with Red Robe's actions or being looped, it wouldn't necessarily contradict this theory.
