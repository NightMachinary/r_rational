Very nice chapter, I hope the story keeps surprising me, but the longer it gets the easier it will be to foresee what will happen.

I believe the aranea memory pack will have very limited use to Zorian, he'll discover something really important but it will take several restarts to do something with/about it. There probably will be things he dismisses/overlooks that are important, though. There always are.

What I'm most excited about however is how far can he get with Xvim properly instructing him. What worries me is the fact that the loop is "deteriorating", we don't really know what that means yet, right? I hope the story doesn't simply end without the loop ending, or when the loop ends, but that it keeps going for some time. It'll be fun to have Zorian get used to being mortal and having no time again.

As for Red Robe, the simulacrum idea makes a bit of sense, but I really doubt that he is Zach's, because if he truly is then wouldn't killing Zach also end Red Robe? Why would the simulacrum have to mind read Zach? He might be something else, maybe when the Lich used the spell that brought Zorian into the loop, he also mangled Zach's soul enough that it created another being entirely? Zach went missing for several loops after that and came back with his memories all screwed up, he likely hasn't gotten them back yet, so Red Robe might be a "soul twin" with part of Zach's memories or such.

TL;DR Story is developing nicely, can't wait till Zorian can be strong enough to deal with surprises. I seriously hope it happens, the fact that he could get in trouble if a dozen owls attack him by surprise is kind of pathetic. I also wish he did more life-risking things, like going after the grey hunter. Ending restarts by the time limit is boring.
