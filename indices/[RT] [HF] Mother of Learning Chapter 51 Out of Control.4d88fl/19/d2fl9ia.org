I was re-reading the last chapter in preparation for today's (hopeful) release when I realized that no one had commented on the discovery of another possible mechanism for Red Robe's "soulkill"-

  If he remembered correctly, life force was simply a special type of personal mana that wasn't part of a mage's mana pool and was used exclusively by the body to keep itself living and resist foreign magics. Since the amount of life force rarely varied much between humans, and couldn't be used to power spells, the academy instructors hadn't spoken much about it.</p><p>Wait. That was it, wasn't it? Life force was something every living being had and depended on to stay alive. And it was basically just an exotic form of mana. And the outer portion of the soul -- the part that can get warped and mutilated -- was the one in charge of regulating a person's mana flow. If a person's soul was damaged, that would cause their very life-giving energies to spin out of control...

So by disrupting someone's personal mana from the outer shell, Red Robe would be able to disrupt the part of them that allows life. I think this is significant because it's different than the mechanism I've been assuming up until now of just excluding someone's soul from the time loop so that at its conclusion they return. If this is true, they'd never return, unless the soul damage was repaired (and since they're dead, this is unlikely).
