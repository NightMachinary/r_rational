Without Red Robe's influence, the invasion would never be as successful. (Without the summoned demons, anyways.) We've seen this ever since the aranea have been killed, since the invaders no longer have the knowledge to take over the wards around the Academy, or to know where the most effective places to land artillery strikes are located. With Red Robe's knowledge, they are fully capable of doing these things. We've often seen the invasion play through with success even without Zach's presence before the aranea were killed, even when he had taken on Tesen.

So that cannot be it. It does not completely remove the possibility that Tesen himself is Red Robe, but it does disprove the theory that Zach dueling Tesen removes Red Robe from the entire equation.
