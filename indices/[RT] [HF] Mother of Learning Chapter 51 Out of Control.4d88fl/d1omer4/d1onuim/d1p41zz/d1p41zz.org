wait a second. What if the simulacron gets made only when Zach doesn't fight his guardian and flees?

Did we see red robe or his influence in loops in which Zach didn't stay home?

I'm theorizing that the simulacron is created from Zac by the guardian or somebody else if he stays in cyoria and if he flees at the start of the loop then it doesn't get made at all
