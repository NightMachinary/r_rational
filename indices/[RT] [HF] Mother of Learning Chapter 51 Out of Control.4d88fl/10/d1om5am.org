That levitation bit was great. Always nice to see signs of Zorian's improvement. Hope he can eventually start throwing around the kinds of spells we see Alanic use in this chapter, as I'm getting tired of him being only a mind-magic specialist. Steel war golems would also be cool to add to his arsenal, as were those fire vortexes (although he would have to team up with Zach to supply mana). Also, I have a feverant hope he can steal those Dragon bones. Hopefully he can use them somehow.

That bit about Daimen threw up so BIG red flags though.
