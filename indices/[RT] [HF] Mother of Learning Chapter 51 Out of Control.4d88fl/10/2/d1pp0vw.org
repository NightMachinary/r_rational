What kind of red flags do you believe they were? Indication that Daimen is open, red flags that he will eventually be involved somehow on Zorian's side, or red flags that he might be Red Robe himself, or involved with the invasion against Zorian?

If you meant flags that Daimen is Red Robe, then if that is true, at the very least, we now know that Daimen himself is not open, as he used a spell to try to attempt to read Zorian's mind in their confrontation.
