(Repost from the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/4d8aso/en_mother_of_learning_chapter_51/][noveltranslations thread]])

Two things that stood out to me in this chapter were that we learned (even if we had to suspect it to some extent) why best-girl-Tinami was interested in Zorian's lineage, being from a witch family and probably sharing their interest in bloodlines. It's likely that knowing that Zorian had witch blood in his veins was enough for her to consider him a good prospect for marriage or reproduction with her or another member of her family.

Second thing that I thought was interesting was this line by Alanic (emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  "There is no need," Alanic said calmly. "I can feel the spiritual sinkhole tugging at my *souls* easily enough."
#+end_quote

Either this was a typo, either Alanic has somehow gained multiple souls through his soul magic ventures, or either he has given us another hint on the true nature of souls, that they are not single and integral entities, but rather a combination of many distinct parts. As long as the explanation is not the first I mentioned, this is very interesting.

Edit: Alanic's line has been confirmed to be no more than a typo.
