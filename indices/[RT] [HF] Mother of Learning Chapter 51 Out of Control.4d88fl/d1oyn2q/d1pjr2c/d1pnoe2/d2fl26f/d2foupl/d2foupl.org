Unfortunately, whatever it was, we won't know for quite a while. The restart in which she gained access to his genealogical tree is already over. All that we know is that she seemed excited for some reason, that Zorian wasn't even curious enough to learn the reason why that would be to try to read her surface thoughts (or that the thought never crossed his mind, but that seems odd to me), and that witches tended to place a lot of importance in bloodlines (as per the priest's words in chapter 51).

I still see very little importance in caring about bloodlines, if not to try to get it to cross with your own to improve it. Unless she was interested in his witch heritage because she intended to take a blood sample from him in order to use it in some ritual or spell.

The marriage aspect seems much more tame to me.
