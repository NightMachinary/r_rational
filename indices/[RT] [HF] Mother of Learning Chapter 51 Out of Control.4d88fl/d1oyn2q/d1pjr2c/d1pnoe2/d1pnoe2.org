Something to consider though is that Zorian himself gave Tinami no indication whatsoever that he was psychic in that restart. And since she has made no mention of him being open in that restart and any other, and since she requires spells to be able to use mind magic, we know that she isn't open herself, and therefore wouldn't be able to find that out about Zorian without him telling her.

So although I am sure that she suspected that it was possible that Zorian had some bloodline power from his witch grandmother, she had no way of confirming whether such a power was ever in his family, or whether his bloodline power (if any) would be related to psychic abilities, or whether she could somehow inherit it herself rather than her own children inheriting it.

So it definitely opens up a potential path for Zorian becoming close to the Aope family in the future, but with the limited amount of information Tinami held in that restart, she had no way to know that he was related to any psychic abilities. Unless she is aware of things we aren't, and all witches are psychics to some degree. Or unless her excitement was because the possibility existed that his family used to be psychic, and she was looking forward to investigating the possibility herself for any potential heirs Zorian might have.
