One of the best clues I found to make a stab at Daimen's age was in chapter 3, I think, when they're talking about the animation spell. Zorian says that Daimen used it on him for practice back when Daimen was in second year, so around 14. Since Zorian remembers it so vividly, he had to be at least 6 years old, probably more. It still gives a maximum age difference of around 8 years. My initial guess when reading was around Zorian being 9-10 years old at the time. Of course, this is entirely speculation.

With the assumption that it only took about 2Â½ years after graduation to become a successful enough archaeologist to be the hero of a lot of people, then accounting for the 18 months or so minimum to account for two younger brothers, would make the minimum difference between the two to be around 4 years.

So although this is still purely speculation based simply on the timing of that animation spell, I'd say that it's unlikely that Daimen is not in the range of 4-8 years older than Zorian.
