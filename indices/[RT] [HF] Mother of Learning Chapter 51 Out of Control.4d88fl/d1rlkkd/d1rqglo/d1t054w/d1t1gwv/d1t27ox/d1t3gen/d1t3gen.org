Unless there are other methods of obtaining soul sight which we are not yet aware of.

I would be interested if in some restart, Zorian showed up at Sudomir's doorstep at Iasku Manor and asked for an apprenticeship. No idea how it would turn out, but if he agreed after Zorian showed his knowledge of Sudomir's actions, it's certain that Zorian would be able to learn a lot about necromancy.

Similar results might be obtainable if Zorian went farther trying to court Tinami and get closer to the Aope family. They are known for mind magic and necromancy, after all. Or maybe Alanic will be willing to teach him a few things after the events of this restart, what with killing an undead dragon and searching through the rubbles of Sudomir's soul trap and all.

Although Zorian stated clearly in the last chapter that he has no intentions of learning necromancy or gaining soul sight for the moment, I'm still hoping that he changes his mind at some point. Soul magic seems to be intrinsically linked to the origin of the time loop, after all. So if he wants to really learn about it, it seems inevitable that he'll need to get some more knowledge in that domain.
