There's somemething I've been wondering and forgetting for a while now, the beginning of this chapter brought it back to me. We know Zorian is sleeping through the first 8 hours of the time loop, is he ever going to find a spell that will force his soul to wake him up at midnight? What could he influence if he did that? How important are those first 8 hours?
