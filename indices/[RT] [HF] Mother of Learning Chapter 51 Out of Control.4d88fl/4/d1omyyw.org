Yes, Zorian's Arc-1 dream of levitating Kirielle has finally been realized!

I think this battle might be the end of Arc 2. It's already about to reach Arc 1's length (26 chapters) and this might be a suitably big event to end it on, depending on what is discovered in the mansion. If not this, then perhaps the opening of the memory packet will do it. Ether way, the story is heating up!
