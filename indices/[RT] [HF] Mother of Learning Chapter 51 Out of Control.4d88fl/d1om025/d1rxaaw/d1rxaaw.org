While the memory packet is useful, he is pissing off red cloak to get the same info that the Aranea acquired. She investigated the invaders with the full resources of her nation, he's investigating it with the full force of Eldemar. It's useful, but it's hardly obvious that it's more useful than a proper investigation being an alien mind package from someone with little proper under. Furthermore, it's not like he's had a general policy of completely avoiding risks up to this point. He fought Aranea with mind magic and attacked the invaders and invaded the manor before.

If he lets Red Cloak enact his scheme then he may return at any time (and he expects him to return soon) with some gamechanging plan that ruins him. The army is there to act as a huge bullet soak. The army pisses off red cloak and the church, and to get to him Red has to fight through the army and the church, forces which already have shown they can defeat the lich who is superior to Red.
