I agree with you that from what we know of soul/memory mechanics it seems somewhat unlikely that the packet would decay while dead, and highly unlikely that it would decay further by "switching" a reset (which is Zorian's preferred response to a bad situation). Recall that Memory of Sublime Glories gave the initial time limit as 3 months, which has nothing to do with number of restarts.

Indeed, if there are a limited amount of "low hanging" aranean minds to experiment on, a strategy to optimize "(memory research)/(time limit used)" would be to force a restart every time he begins to exhaust these easy prey (of course this would alert red robe, and speed the distant degrading of the time loop, but would be a potential last resort)

However, I'm unsure whether either Zorian or nobody103 agree with this line of thought: the wording from the latest chapter of "2 restarts left" instead of "2 months left" mildly suggests they do not.
