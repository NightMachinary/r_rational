Yes. This is incredibly dumb on Zorian's part.

Stretching his timeline out into something linear, he has a deadline in 3 months, and some things he wants to get done in the next year.

Not only does he neglect the nearest deadline for a further one, but he does it in a way that may result in him "losing" weeks of time due to an early reset.

How many updates have we been putting off the memory packet for now?
