To be honest, I'm happy Wekesa didn't see Cat after she went full-winter since he might get ideas about weaving his soul into his name. Or, if he did, he didn't notice it. I mean, Akua missed it and she was bound to Cat for a quite a while.

(Also, I just realized that /absolute positioning/ seems to be a version of Warlock's *imbricate* except with stories and narratives instead of physical parallels. Masego is definitely his father's son)
