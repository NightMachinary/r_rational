This is great. Now there is no way into Callow besides the Stairway, so Cat essentially has a whole year where she is guaranteed safe from invasions from Procer. Stairway would be a bitch to assault if it were guarded by an army, so even after that Callow is fairly safe. This means Cat could (in theory) pop over to Black, Gate his whole army home to Praes, and that'd be it for the crusade, assuming they don't open up the Vales somehow.
