I disagree - the strategic thought behind bonfire was to keep Procer busy at home, instead of sending out its forces to wreak havoc in Callow/Praes. All you really need is to get your army home quicker than the Procerans can march into your country, which means you need the one gate to gtfo once they have actually pulled their forces or to wreck them if they decide to turn things into a siege contest. Until then, jumping from city to city is more impactful and efficient, but not strategic necessity, Black stealing a march and forcing Papenheim into a goose chase achieves the same objective.
