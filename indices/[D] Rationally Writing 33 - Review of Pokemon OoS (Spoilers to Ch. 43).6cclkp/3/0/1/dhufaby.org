I think the best way to articulate my problem is that I feel like I am reading a story about three careers instead of characters with three goals. This aspect makes it seem like the story will remain on its current course for the next forty years (and possibly in real life?) which makes it harder to get excited for whatever is happening in the present arc. I've also never played a Pok√©mon game, which may actually be the bigger impediment now that I think about it.
