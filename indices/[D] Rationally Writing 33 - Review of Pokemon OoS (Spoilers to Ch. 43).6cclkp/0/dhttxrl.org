Re: past tense vs. present tense (as discussed in this episode), it's hard to get actual studies that even confirm that past tense is more common in English fiction, let alone trying to find a study that indicates /why/ that might be the case. Nevertheless, there are some (annoyingly gated) studies that indicate past tense /is/ more common.

Though there aren't studies (that I could find) there /are/ a lot of opinion pieces from authors and professors of literature. "Present tense is immediate and past tense is reflective" is all well and good to /say/, but I would like it to be back up by something more than simply intuition. I think the biggest argument in favor of writing past tense is that the majority of prose fiction is written in past tense, which makes readers more familiar with it, but it somewhat depends on your storytelling style and what you aim to accomplish with it.
