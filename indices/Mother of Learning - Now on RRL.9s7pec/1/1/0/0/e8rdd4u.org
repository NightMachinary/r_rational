Just to make sure, speculative fiction = fantasy + sci-fi. RRL is mostly fantasy, but there are occasionally sci-fi stories as well. I'm going to soon make a post about two recent ones that I've found. Other ones that I've found there:

- The Good Student
- The Dao of Magic (genre-savvy)
- Shoulders of Giants (not /high/ quality, but I'd put it as rationalist-adjacent)
- Threadbare (very fun)
- The Worldforge: Warlock Rising (amazing until it was dropped, and I still recommend it. What drew me in at first was the perfect show-not-tell to describe the main character's personality)
- Universe Online (VR, scifi, realistic engineering+space survival, now on amazon only)
- Flight of Icarus (YMMV)
- Eye of Adventure (My favorite VRMMO story of all time, for doing over-poweredness right. If you can ignore poor grammar. It's on an indeterminate hiatus, but it has > 1 million words already, so that's not a problem)

And those are just my favorites that I found on RR. Most of RR is niche fantasy stories, the good ones being most enjoyable for those who like the genre(s) already. There are more that I enjoyed, but aren't high quality, so I left them out. There are also a lot of hidden gems on RR, but they're difficult for the algorithm to sift through. Luckily, it's easier for readers to find them because you'll usually find reviews saying that it's a hidden gem. There are also stories that I've found elsewhere, but that you could also find on RR if you hadn't yet (eg. MOL now).
