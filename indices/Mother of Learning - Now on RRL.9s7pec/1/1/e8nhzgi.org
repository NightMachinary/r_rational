This site is pretty popular and it's focused around fantasy/VR/isekai/Xianxia stories. It has quite a few great novels in the speculative fiction genre that our rational fiction community largely overlaps with. If MOL's popularity wasn't enough already, this posting will push it even higher. The previous first place on RR had 15 million views.

I guess the name comes from the VR game in The Legendary Moonlight Sculptor, a korean novel.
