you get a few physical attributes for example Tavien is fit, Kael is Androgynous (or as described "not female despite some nasty rumors" and so on, you get one or two traits to build your character image around but not very much.

Raynie is just described as a Red-haired Beauty so that image varies a lot depending on what you think a "beauty" looks like.
