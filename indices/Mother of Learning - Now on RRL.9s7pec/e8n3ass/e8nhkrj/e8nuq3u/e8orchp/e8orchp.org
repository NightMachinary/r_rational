i went ahead and asked the artist if nobody could use [[https://i.pximg.net/img-master/img/2018/08/01/02/43/46/69959210_p0_master1200.jpg][this image]] as a cover image on royalroad.

i wonder if s/he could reprint it without the caption "Caught in the Web" because i think that is a fan-added title.
