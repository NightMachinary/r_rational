so let's discuss what should be on a cover image!, personally if every arc was divided into a book, the first one i'd have show a spider or marbles, the 2nd a glass globe with a palace inside of it and the third either the gate or the crown.

the marbles are probably what i'd go with for image if there was just one for the entire series, because they reflect the name nicely.
