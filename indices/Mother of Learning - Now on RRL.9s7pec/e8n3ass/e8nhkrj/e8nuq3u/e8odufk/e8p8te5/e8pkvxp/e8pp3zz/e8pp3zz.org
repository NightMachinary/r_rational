There IS descriptions for characters but only the first time we met them. For example, I remember alanic is a bald mage with an eye of another color or something like that. They all got their description pretty detailed but nobody103 never use these descriptions again later exept when plot relevant so when tend to forget them. In my first reading i forgot quatach-ichl had black bones shining for example
