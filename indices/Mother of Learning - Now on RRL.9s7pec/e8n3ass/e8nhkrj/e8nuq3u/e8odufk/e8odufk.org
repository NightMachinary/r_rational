So, taking your suggestions into account: - first cover: zorian in front having troubles with learning something and in the background=> a spider,xvim throwing a marble,a clock and a masked assassin with a knife. Maybe akoja too. -second cover: zorian and Zach but not too close,alanic and zedomir with some skeletons and monsters. Red robe too -Third cover: zorian and a group composed of each and the others looking toward a gate with quatach-ichl in the background wearing the crown
