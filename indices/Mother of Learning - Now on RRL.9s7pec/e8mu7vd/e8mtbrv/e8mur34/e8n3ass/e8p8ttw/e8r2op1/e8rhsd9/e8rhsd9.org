[not op] If an author decides to publish exclusively on Amazon, I think they get a much better deal. For this, Amazon requires that only up to 10% of the novel is available from outside Amazon. I'm not sure if this applies to all writers and their deals, but I know it applied to the author of Threadbare (it's still on RR, so I don't know what happened). So if his story is on Royal Road, he has to take it down, either suddenly without warning and getting the ire of everyone and their mother, or with a warning after which everyone will just copy the book for themselves and more than a few of them would re-upload it elsewhere. I don't know about any other publishers, or any other details about publication.
