  mother of learning is really sparse with descriptions meaning everyone makes a very personal image

It has only just now occurred to me that I don't have any idea whatsoever of what any of the characters look like.

Strictly speaking, I never form a /image/ of characters in novels I read, but I usually have a vague collection of attributes that I associate with characters. After your post though I realized that everything I have for Mother of Learning is personality traits rather than physical attributes.
