yes they get a description the first time you see them but even that one is not especially elaborate, it's usually pretty basic rather then detailed, for example all Raynie is described as is a hot "red-haired goddess" and later by Tinami it becomes clear she have at least significantly more in the chest area then Tinami herself. and that is all the description you get for her.

and Kiana's description is "she's as beutiful as Raynie but black haired" that's all, so no the most detailed i'd say.

Kael who get a fair it more screentime is a bit androgynous and have bone-white hair and intense blue eyes, i would not call any of the descriptions very detailed, they give a physical trait you can build your image around but very few details overall.
