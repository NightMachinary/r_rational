[edit: moved geometries down below.]

oh, wait, there already is fan art! here's a book cover, i'm sure any artist would love it if it were used, but we should check with them first:

*my vote actually goes to this one:*

down below are some geometric images that are licensed under creative commons, and free to modify and reuse, even commercially, without attribution.

[i started by searching for icosahedra, fractal icosahedra, sponges, etc, since the dimensional gates and stabilization frames were icosahedral skeletons with a sphere in the middle, and i thought it would be a decent symbol of the nerdiness, structure, and recursion of this fic without needing an artist to actually design something. what i linked isn't exactly that, since the sponge icosadron i found didn't actually look that good, but i think it's a gesture in the right direction, as well as looking like dimensional portals.]
