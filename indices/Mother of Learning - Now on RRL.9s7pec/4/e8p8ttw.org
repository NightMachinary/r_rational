Unpopular Opinion here:

I actually think its bad for the story and the author to be on royalroad. I like the site dont get me wrong , but the focus there is mostly on xianxia / LitRPG storys and not on real original works. Also, if MOL should ever be published as a real book, it can be very important for the author to have the best possible control over which parts are freely available on the web. On royalroad there are quite a few trolls that will make it more difficult to maintain this level of control. I think MOL has the potential to be really successful as a print release and as an ebook, and I'd hate to see this success hampered by the release on RoyalRoad.
