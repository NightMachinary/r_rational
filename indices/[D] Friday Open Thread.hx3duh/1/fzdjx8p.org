This is a bit of a random question out of the blue, but I'm wondering what people here think about pre-nups?

I was talking with someone about this the other day, and they wondering if asking for one would be harmful to their relationship because it implied that they didn't trust their partner.

I argued back saying that it separated love from money and having a pre-nup doesn't mean you don't trust your partner, but rather it allows you to be able to /build/ trust without worries about money tainting the relationship.

Anyway, I'm curious what people here think of it and whether it should be the default with marriages or not?
