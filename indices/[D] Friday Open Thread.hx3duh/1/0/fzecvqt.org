Regardless of having a prenup or not, the act of asking for one should be beneficial. If they say no, that should give valuable information for understanding where your partner's head is at. In my case, asking for one (but not following through, as I wasn't particularly motivated to do so) opened a conversation about fairness, alimony, child support, financial responsibility, and so on that leads me to trust my wife more.

Avoiding the relationship being tainted by money is a naive way of putting it, I think. Money influences everything, and relationships especially. Marriage is a financial arrangement in addition to everything else it is. Avoiding it being tainted by miscommunications about money is definitely desirable though.
