I saw an exchange on [[/r/slatestarcodex]] i think where someone was insisting it doesn't think or feel and so can't write poetry.

dude, i fucking love the idea of the algorithm writing poetry (and i mean, it has, and it's good). i am ALL ABOUT the death of the author in writing, and this is an author who was never alive in the first place. it gives you complete utter freedom to interpret the text however you see fit, because there are literally no invalid interpretations. i'm so excited about what this means, becuase as much as things like e.g. Animal Farm are clearly and undeniably based on the Russian revolution, I don't like it when people say "that's not what the author meant by X".

The primary relationship is between a text and its reader, not its author. Fuck authors. Long live GPT!
