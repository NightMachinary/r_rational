The thing is the author really really wants the MC to be mostly rational. But so many of the MC successes just come from randomly appearing new powers that it completely detracts from the rational aspect of the story, until it feels like an afterthought. The MC spends a lot of time "researching" but it happens mostly off-screen and doesn't really lead to anything.

As to where else you would discuss this, I have no idea =s
