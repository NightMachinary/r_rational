Man is thrown into a world that is, he perceive, artificial. The problem is, he has no recollection how he ended up there. He forgot everything that happened until just a moment ago. He also recognize a programmed instinct that compel him do whatever he supposed to do. Being afraid is an understatement. He desire to know, and if situation allow, be free.

Leonard Dunning maybe an isekai protagonist. Except there's no Truck-kun who sent him, no God who granted him absurd skill, and soon he will know, no harem will be formed around him. But those tropes, he found, is very much real here. Prologue, just like many prologues of similar works, can be ignored entirely. Just jump to chapter 1 and you'll be fine. At least that's what I feel until book 1 completed. He is a genre savvy character, though not very savvy. Just like Leonard Dunning, you can recognize plots and characters from miles away. Unlike Leonard Dunning, you most definitely can see twist much earlier than he could.

I call him a rationalist because he actively seeks answers. The world may not readily give him what he want, but he's not shy venturing experiments. Character interaction is superb. Pacing is nice. Setting could use little work (but hey, author imitates typical Japanese Isekai half-assery, maybe we should not expect solid world building). Action scene is passable. Good webserial stuff, in my opinion. Tell me what you think.
