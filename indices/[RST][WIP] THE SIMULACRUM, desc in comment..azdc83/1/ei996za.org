This story has one of my biggest bugbears, which is continuously giving the MC random OP powers right as he needs them trivializing any situation. I like when the MC gets a set of powers beforehand, then thinks about possible applications for that power, and then uses those powers in interesting ways. /The Simulacrum/ constantly gives the MC new powers for no real reason, which overshadows him being genre savvy(which is the most interesting power he has).

Here's a quick overview of his powers/knowledge/resources as of current chapter.

1. Is genre savvy and aware he is in a battle harem romance comedy. 2. Doesn't need to sleep. 3. Can see magic. 4. Has ridiculous allowance giving him essentially infinite money. 5. Can dispel magic by touching it. 6. Can engage in mystical battle with fauns or something. 7. Can view anyone he has touched at any distance and hear what they are saying. 7.5 Can use viewing power in radar mode to know when they approach. 8. Has foresight like reflexives that makes him impossible to hit. 9. Body is extremely athletic. 10. Can do short range teleportation. 11. Has a weird 4th dimensional tentacle appendage that lets him dispel magic too? 12. Has access and control of the angels entire intelligence network. 13. Has access to the dragon royal family library. 14. Can speak faun language fluently. I'm sure I forgot something but these all came to mind immediately but there are more I'm sure.

It's not even that none of these powers were used in rational or interesting ways, because they often were. But it feels like the author just came up with a power, thought of a situation where that power would be cool, and then just moves on. The MC just feels like a standard OP protagonist after a while with a completely ridiculous bag of tools.

I think /The Simulacrum/ had a reasonable start but quickly jumped the shark and lost what made the first couple chapters decent. I think if it focused on the MC quickly resolving typical narrative tropes as his main power instead I would have liked it a lot more. After a while he just becomes typical OP protagonist half oblivious to half the cast being in love with him even though he should know and act better.
