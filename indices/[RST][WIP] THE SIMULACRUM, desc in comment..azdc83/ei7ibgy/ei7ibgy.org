Finished reading book 1 a few days ago. It isn't awful, and I enjoy the concept, but making all the characters as anime tropes inherently means that they're 2D. Obviously this serves the story, but it causes serious issues with enjoyable characters, when there's really only one. Even Josh, who is supposed to be a real person, is basically a side character for the bulk of the story.

I enjoyed the 'twist' halfway through, but holy shit does the MC have bullshit powers. I was hoping for a story where the powerless side character has to scheme his way to survival, but instead he's probably more powerful than anyone else.

3/5
