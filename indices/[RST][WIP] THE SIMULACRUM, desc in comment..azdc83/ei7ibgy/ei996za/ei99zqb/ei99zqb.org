Now that I think of it, the novel lacks struggle, isn't it? To save the novel from becoming just-other-Gary-Stu, the author really need to create problem that challenge his main character. Problem (seemingly) insurmountable it'll require Leo to use his power creatively. I guess I was too enamored with MC's no-nonsense attitude I forgot he hadn't mentally endeavor yet.

Anyway, I now see why this subreddit is not very enthusiastic with the novel. I'm not really interested to discuss it with other community, but suppose I want to, where should I recommend this novel? (I'm looking to find other novel with no-nonsense attitude).
