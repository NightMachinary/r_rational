From the sidebar "Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction."

The link to rationalist on the sidebar also describes stories that have the quality as "[having] influenced us toward rationality."

So this story probably isn't rationalist by subreddit standards. Based on the submission statement, actively seeking answers probably just makes the protagonist rational.
