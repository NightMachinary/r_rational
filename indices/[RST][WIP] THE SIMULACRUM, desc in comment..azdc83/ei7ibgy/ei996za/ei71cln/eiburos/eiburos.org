Although I did enjoy the story, I am a bit disappointed that the parody of a haram comedy just turned into a literal haram comedy.

I do enjoy deconstructing a genre, and subverting tropes..... But in order to do that, you have to ACTUALLY subvert the tropes.... I feel like the story lost that about half way through.
