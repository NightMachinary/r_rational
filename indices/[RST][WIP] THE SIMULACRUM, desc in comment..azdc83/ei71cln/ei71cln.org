The first couple of chapters were interesting, after that, I felt like I was reading a particulary boring high school type light novel with no redeeming qualitis(Which means, Terrible dialogue, One dimensional characters and basically no plot to speak of). The "gimick" is the awerness the MC to his situation but it has almost no impact on the story.
