Agreed. The character interactions while probably accurate for a shitty anime are not great to read, and pretty tedious and repetitive at best.

I couldn't get into it at all. I was a little piqued when he got chatting with the random girl but their interactions were just so cliche and inane that I couldn't enjoy it. Oh she wants to be paid in three sandwiches, riveting stuff.

Perhaps I'm just not the target audience because nothing landed for me.
