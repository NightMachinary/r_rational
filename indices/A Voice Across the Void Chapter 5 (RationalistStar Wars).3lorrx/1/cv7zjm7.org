Well, a Sith-style solution would be to give the warring parties a common external enemy, maybe assassinate both the royal families. But Noval apparently values sentient life, so it is probably not the solution he saw. And anyway, less brutal ways of taking the royal out (e.g. kidnapping) are still way beyond a puny padawan's capabilities.

Judging by the hints, the solution would establish a truce by convincing both sides that victory is not possible. Hmm.
