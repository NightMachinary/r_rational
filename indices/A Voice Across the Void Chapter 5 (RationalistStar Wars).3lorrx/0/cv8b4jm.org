I'm skeptical that Nerra is actually aware of very much of the world outside of her holocron. I think it's more likely that she was just reading Noval's mind to find information she seemingly could not have known unless she was aware of the outside world. She obviously knows mind-reading well enough to try to teach it to Noval, so she could probably pick up on his reasons for contacting her and the length of time since the last conversation, both salient thoughts in his mind at that time.

EDIT: Actually, I can't think of any reason why she wouldn't be able to listen in any time she wanted to. It's not as if Noval makes her appear and disappear. She's still in the Holocron even when he isn't talking to her.
