Sure, which meant that she explicitly wanted that.

Also, Blue-Eyes didn't go so far as to elicit a safe word. Maybe because she was literally made for him and that, therefore, he wouldn't ever do something she didn't want because otherwise she would have been made to want that. There's something like a really bizarre anthropic prinicple going on here, I think. Succubi who don't conform to the wishes of their humans, and whose humans' wishes don't conform with theirs, probably can't exist. Because such pairings would get spiked sooner rather than later, and the absurd scale of just Sade Hall (only a fraction of the size of all of Pandemonium) indicates that the majority of pairings are effectively immortal, barring outside influence of some sort.
