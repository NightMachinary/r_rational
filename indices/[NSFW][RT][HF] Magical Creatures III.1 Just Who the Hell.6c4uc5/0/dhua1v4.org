Hrm. The 'only talk when explicitly allowed, despite the fact that you both know this place better and have friends other than me here' makes me feel uncomfortable. Especially since it happened by mistake /and/ Blue-Eyes didn't ask how he can reverse it (or even just temporarily turn it off) despite that. Seems both irresponsible and sad. It seems to limit Lyra in her being. And it distracted me from fully enjoying any other sexy stuff mentioned quite as much.

I guess it's just not my kink?
