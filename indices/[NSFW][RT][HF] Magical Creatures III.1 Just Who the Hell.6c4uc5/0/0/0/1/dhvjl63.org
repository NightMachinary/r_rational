First off, succubi regenerate any injury (except those caused by consecrated materials and maybe certain specific bindings) with nectar. Cutting off her arm would probably be really painful, but she would grow it back unless Blue-Eyes somehow managed to cast some kind of permanent binding on the wound. Considering that, in book one, Lyra was worried about the consecration on Cleavage running out before they got through the Perfekti, there is at least some evidence that no binding in this system is truly permanent.

Sure, maybe they get into a situation where Blue-Eyes tries to use consecrated metal to permanently injure her, but there is an argument that this simply isn't possible:

Consider the size of Sade Hall. Blue-Eyes thought it might stretch on for actual light-years, and every room we've seen so far has had several people in it. The total population of Sade Hall has to be pretty close to uncountable, assuming the sections of the Hall we've seen are normal.

Given this, and given that the number of people born in the Hall is likely pretty close to zero (does nectar turning you into yourself cause auto-abortions or no periods? Very possibly. Also alien physiology. Also human/succubi pairings cannot reproduce), it is reasonably safe to assume that all population growth is through immigration.

In addition, Blue-Eyes has seen...thousands or millions of people in the Hall already, just given the sheer population of every space he's been in. And he hasn't seen anyone get spiked yet. Lyra uses it as a curse, but the overall rate of consent control activation appears to be rather low.

Taken altogether: I posit that succubi literally cannot be created such that their desires are not in line with those of the human they grew off of. Given that they are symbiotic with humans it makes sense that this would be the case. Spikings do happen, but Lyra has only expressed concern about this happening with "Creepers," who explicitly do nonconsentual things to others. Every other time she's talked about it has been as a curse. A succubus is made such that their desires are in line with their human, and as a result anything the succubus does not desire is highly likely to also be something their human does not desire. Pet does not desire to have her arms cut off, or to be murdered (though she would let it happen), Blue Eyes does not desire either of those things to happen to her.

Rather than that being lucky or a coincidence (as it would be in the real world), I posit that this is just how things work in Pandemonium.
