She didn't want /that/ to happen. Not specifically. She's just so submissive that he wants him to do to her whatever he pleases. According to her own thoughts she'd consent to being killed by him if it pleases him, despite not being suicidal and in fact hoping that such a thing doesn't please him.

What bothers me in this specific case is the apparent permanence. Imagine if she were really into not being able to use her arms and having her abilities restricted. You know, as a sexy fantasy. Imagine if then He decided to amputate her arms. She likes her arms. She needs them for certain magic stuff. Maybe she even had a shared hobby of wood carving. But of course she'd gladly give that up, and isn't it similar to being in sexy bondage, except always? Now imagine that neither of them even clearly decided on the amputation. During an awesome scene it just fit to cut her arms off and whoops there they go. But he enjoys her new look and dependency so its fine with her because she's his, and thus it should be fine with everyone, right?

And that's how some of the last few permanent changes through ritual magic felt to me. Like cutting in to her. Permanently limiting her abilities and, by extension, her self. All without thinking about the consequences. You could say that amputation seems worse but honestly I'd say that especially in this universe (if not in every universe) editing the mind is much more limiting. Hell, they haven't even figured out the exact limitations of what's happening to her on this front. She is from this world and doesn't know it. He is doing it and /definitely/ has no clue. And yet they are making potentially permanent decisions (if you can call his blind and careless stumblings even that) that go towards limitation and dependency with no heed for the future of her as, well, a *person*.

Sure. But it also seems like they themselves are in some regards missing just as much, if not more. And if inexperienced people are doing serious edge play with one-sided repercussions it isn't everyone's job to look away. Sometimes people /don't/ know what's best for them. Especially when they have a [maximize Master's pleasure] drive stronger than most humans drive to eating and reproduction combined.
