Thank you. I could spend like three hours replying to this comment. Maybe I will later, but here's a start.

Would he?

Quite. It's a shame what was going on that was a problem seems to have been completely invisible to everyone watching (this is not sarcasm - it's a serious hazard in BDSM on earth, and a hazard times a billion in Pandemonium with all this heavy-duty sex magick flying around). Probably half of FetLife's message database is people arguing about whether the bad thing noone saw until it was too late should have gotten seen.

Now, here's the question: where /did/ the voice bondage come from? During the ritual Blue-Eyes is able to produce some pretty complicated temporary mental rewiring (safely and advisedly or not) and volitional inception ("slipping the intent into her...") and reliably get exactly what he meant to do each time with really terrifying precision for a total noob and also get (apparently) nothing more. In order to mark her he has to explicitly ask whatever freefloating coherent extrapolated volition service they seem to have blundered into to do something permanent. So, did he at any point intend the seemingly-permanent voice-bondage effect? Have we so far observed the magic to do wholly-unintentional things unrelated to previous commands? He takes responsibility for it, but, /should he/?

This is a genuine question. This /is/ ratfic, albeit ratfic where as I'm increasingly learning the author could stand to nip-slip his laws of magic a little more freely.
