  And I disagree that wish fulfillment fantasies cannot be rational. You can totally wish for a consistent and predictable world.

I define wish-fulfillment fantasies as everything going the main characters way. He just needs to exist and every other character will automatically solve all his problems. If he actually tries to solve a problem on his own it will always work out the way he wanted or better. All of what I said has been true for this story so far, and it should be clear why such a story cannot be called rational.
