(Didn't read the story so basing the comment only on what you mention)

But from what you are writing the story has a plot: "the author's perfect dream girl shows up to become his sex-slave, make him immortal, ensure all his basic needs are met and take him to place where nothing can ever hurt him."

In that case for the first requirement to be fulfilled, wouldn't there need to be some self-consistent reason for 1. a girl to appear 2. the girl to match the MCs definition of a "dream girl" 3. the girl will want to be his sex slave 4. etc. etc.

From what you are describing it sounds like these things are "just so", in which case it will not meet the 1st requirement on the side-bar.
