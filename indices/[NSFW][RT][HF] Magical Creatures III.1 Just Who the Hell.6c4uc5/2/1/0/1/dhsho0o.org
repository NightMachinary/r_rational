Oh good. You started aggressive, then you doubled down and included being condescending. This conservation is going to be GREAT.

  Plot refers to the sequence of events inside a story which affect other events through the principle of cause and effect. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of sentences linked by "and so".

Man is seed for succubus, and so the succubus inhabits his dreams, and so they form a bond, and so when she gets summoned away she finds a way back, and so she comes back, and so she saves him from the psuedo religious markov chain demon things. So she urges him to run away from horrible death, and so they go on a pretty awesome running away scene with god damn CRAZY ANGELS and shit. And so they get to The Sea, and so there is exposition about succubi, and so they journey to her home, and so they enter her home.

All along the way there are hints of bigger things going on, but the plot is literally OH GOD RUN AWAY, and now we are in a building period where the world is explained in more detail, then after we have a firm grounding in the SETTING, this is a big setting so there is a lot of exposition required.

The sex scene is literally plot fuel in every circumstance where it occurs, because the succubus is a source of FREE energy, he gets exhausted, so they have sex, they can keep running. They succubus uses that very fact as a driving factor, sex is a resource in this fiction, they use that resource intelligently, Rule 3.

They don't just run away "cause" they run away because Earth is occupied territory. The factions are not fully expounded but the conflict is obvious and I'm sure we'll get there, there is a lot of interesting stuff going on.

I will allow the fact that there are some issues with the style, the font, the flow, but none of that disqualifies this as either fiction or rational fiction.
