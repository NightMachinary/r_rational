Speaking towards the four characteristics of RT fiction:

1. You're fundamentally incorrect about there being no plot, as discussed. Was there "no plot" on Harry's journey from the Dursleys to Diagon Alley to the Hogwards Express to the Hogwarts lake to the Sorting feast? Because that's essentially what we have, albeit much longer. We're still covering BE's entrance to this new, magical world.

2. There's clearly no simple "good" or "evil". The angels we saw are clearly on some sort of hidden agenda, as are the mindless creatures we met earlier. And we haven't really met any of the players in the demonverse yet but it's safe to say, based on the set up, everyone's going to be on their own agenda in the sex filled, BDSM fantasy world.

3. There haven't been many problems beyond the initial escape, as you pointed out. But it's clear that BE is fairly intelligent and prone to analyzing things and he has used this to minor effect with coming to understand things Lyra has explained to him such as the dismissals and other rituals. If/when higher stakes conflict does arise, we have sufficient reason to expect he'll leverage his intelligence towards an attempted solution as well.

4. The worldbuilding and rule set up seems fairly consistent. We, just as BE, don't know close to everything about the set up and so it's easy to think that the story behaves inconsistently but, I have to point out, every time someone points something out along that lines to the author, his response usually points to an explanation OR unexplained, spoilerific rules that will explain things later.
