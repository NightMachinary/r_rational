Which no plot? The non-plot where they escape from Earth being chased by literal markov chain demons? Or the non plot where the characters learn about demon magic? Or the not plot where they travel to another world? Or the total lack of hints of a great war against Seraphim?

What lack of rationality, we are literally treated to a blow by blow(heh innuendo) of how, why, what, and motivations behind things, with hints of more in the future. So the plot is sex driven, its literally a rational story about SEX demons, that doesn't mean its not a plot, or are rationalist now also puritans?
