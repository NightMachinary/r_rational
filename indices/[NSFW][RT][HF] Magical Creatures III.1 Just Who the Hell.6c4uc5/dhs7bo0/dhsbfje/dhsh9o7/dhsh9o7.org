So, just to summarize, the whole "plot" so far is that the author's perfect dream girl shows up to become his sex-slave, make him immortal, ensure all his basic needs are met and take him to place where nothing can ever hurt him.

Now, lets take a look at the four characteristics in the sidebar. The first is trivially satisfied since the story has no plot. The second is trivially satisfied since the story has no conflict. The third is trivially satisfied since the characters in the story haven't had any problems (aside from a pretty standard chase scene). And it's too early to say if the fourth is satisfied because, you guessed it, no rules have been given yet.

Looks like whoever wrote those characteristics had the implicit assumption that the stories posted here would either have an actual plot, include some conflicts of any kind or their characters would have any type of problem they are trying to solve. Guess they were wrong.

Re your edit: I agree that self-inserts can be rational, but not wish-fulfillment fantasies.
