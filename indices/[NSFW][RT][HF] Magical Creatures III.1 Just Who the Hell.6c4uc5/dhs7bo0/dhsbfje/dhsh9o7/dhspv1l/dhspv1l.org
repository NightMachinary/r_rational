You're not wrong, per se, but I think it's too early to say that this has no plot or no conflict. (Also, the worldbuilding on its own would make it interesting.) I just think of it as a post-singularity setting dump story so far.

And I disagree that wish fulfillment fantasies cannot be rational. You can totally wish for a consistent and predictable world.
