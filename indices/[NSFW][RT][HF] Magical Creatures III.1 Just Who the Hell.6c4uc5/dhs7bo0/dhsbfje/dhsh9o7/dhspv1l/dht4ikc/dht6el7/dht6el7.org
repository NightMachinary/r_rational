I mean, the setup for this story is explicitly describing a place where that is supposed to happen. The rules of the world they make it to after escaping Earth are explicitly designed to be that way. It's designed to be a literal haven for anyone's sexual fantasies. It was created TO be that.

As discussed, the chase scene was indicative of something not good; there was a real sense of tension and danger to the entire sequence. Even if you were certain he would make it out, as the protagonist, it still was uncertain enough to be entertaining.
