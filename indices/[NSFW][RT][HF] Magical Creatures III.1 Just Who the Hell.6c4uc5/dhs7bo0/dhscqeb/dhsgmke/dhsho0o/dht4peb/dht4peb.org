The "plot" can be summarized as I did in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6c4uc5/nsfwrthf_magical_creatures_iii1_just_who_the_hell/dhsh9o7/][this post]]:

  So, just to summarize, the whole "plot" so far is that the author's perfect dream girl shows up to become his sex-slave, make him immortal, ensure all his basic needs are met and take him to place where nothing can ever hurt him.

You're just writing down every detail that has happened in the hope that it somehow, almost by pure coincidence, could end up becoming a plot. I'm not denying that a plot could actually develop, but given the above it seems very unlikely.

  I will allow the fact that there are some issues with the style, the font, the flow,

Can't say I had problems with any of those things.

  but none of that disqualifies this as either fiction or rational fiction.

Obviously, it's fiction. Why it shouldn't be called rational fiction I also went into [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6c4uc5/nsfwrthf_magical_creatures_iii1_just_who_the_hell/dhsh9o7/][here]], so I'm not going to go through that again.
