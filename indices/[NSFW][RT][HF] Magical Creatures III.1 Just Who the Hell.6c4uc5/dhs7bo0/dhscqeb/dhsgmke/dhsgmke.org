You seem very confused about what the plot of a story is actually supposed to be. It's not often that I link to wikipedia articles in a discussion, but I think you would really benefit from reading [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_%28narrative%29][this]].

  Which no plot? The non-plot where they escape from Earth being chased by literal markov chain demons?

  Or the total lack of hints of a great war against Seraphim?
#+end_quote

These two things happened in probably the only interesting sequence of events in this story, but until they're actually relevant for anything else, that's all they're going to be. We are at book 3 now, so maybe something plot-related will appear soon.

  Or the non plot where the characters learn about demon magic?
#+end_quote

Not a plot.

  Or the not plot where they travel to another world?
#+end_quote

Not a plot.

  What lack of rationality, we are literally treated to a blow by blow(heh innuendo) of how, why, what, and motivations behind things, with hints of more in the future.
#+end_quote

Just because things are "explained" does not mean it's a rational story (or even just a story). This is world-building at best.

  o the plot is sex driven, its literally a rational story about SEX demons, that doesn't mean its not a plot, or are rationalist now also puritans?
#+end_quote

Writing a lot of sex scenes is not a plot. Saying that does not make me a puritan.
