The thing is, there is a coherent plot of sorts. I agree, it's moving /very/ slowly but that's all; it's moving slowly. He's not telling a series of unrelated anecdotes; we're literally going on the journey from Earth to Sade Hall and everywhere in between. It's pretty wordy and very full of exposition (which is a good or bad thing, depending on your tastes) but there's a definitive sequence of events occurring.

BE's going on a journey to become the human partner to a magical demon girl. That's the plot.
