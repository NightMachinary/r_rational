I'm not entirely convinced that it was "power of friendship" vs some kind of psychic thing. It seemed like Emma's determination wasn't enough--she was still sinking--until Norman showed up to lead her back to the surface and Mama pulled her out. We still don't know what exactly happened to Norman or Mama, and Norman in particular seems like a likely candidate to have obtained supernatural powers in that facility.
