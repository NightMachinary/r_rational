I dunno, /never/ is a pretty strong word. What if we paid dying people with hours left to live to use murder-gandhi magic just before dying? The alignment shift itself shouldn't be a big problem then. Unless they get judged for suddenly being evil in the afterlife, I guess.

But yeah, anything that changes your values is in a league of its own.
