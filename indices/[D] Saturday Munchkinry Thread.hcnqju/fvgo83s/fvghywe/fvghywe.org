We're all a bunch of munchkins here. We like to take strict rules and treat them as puzzles to be solved for maximum profit. So what would it take for something like 'dark' magic to /actually/ be icky enough that a good hearted munchkin would stay well away from it?

In Pact it's hard to come out ahead because the forces you call on are mostly sentient and way, way malicious, but it's (just barely) possible to come out ahead without forcing horrible costs onto other people. In the Dresden Files certain kinds of magic can't be easily employed by mortals without it hardwiring evil into your brain, so even using mind control magic to cure someone's drug addiction will cause /you/ to slide down the path of becoming a mustache twirling villain.

How else can we create a branch or system of magic that most well intentioned munchkins would stay away from?
