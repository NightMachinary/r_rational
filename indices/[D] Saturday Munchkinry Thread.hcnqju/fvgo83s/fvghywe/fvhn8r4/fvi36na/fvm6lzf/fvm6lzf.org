*SELF-TELEPATHY.*

Assume you get the power to read your own mind, and ONLY your own mind (note; this telepathy is distinct from just thinking your own thoughts, it basically makes you an objective observer to your subjective mind while the subjective runs). Self-Empathy, memory scan, mental illusions and mind control included.

How would you munchkin it to become as powerful as possible?
