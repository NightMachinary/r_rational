You are Superman and you have to fight a being as powerful as you, say Zod or Doomsday. You want to fashion a weapon to take them on but nothing in the world is as strong as your own body. It's why Doomsday is so ferocious, his bones that jut out of his body are the strongest out of his body. What can you do? I thought about Superman using his nails to make something but am not sure what would serve as glue or whatever? Is there anything he could make out of his body? Thanks for reading.
