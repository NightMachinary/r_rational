Would be difficult since there is an extreme amount of variance in which to describe a city. It depends on the intuitiveness of the system, and the limit on complexity of allowed words. "Defined area fit for dense human habitation with defined areas for commerce, leisure, housing, and employment with a system of road networks and utility networks" semi complex words. Does the system know networks? Do I need to specify what habitation means? Do I need to specify what is using the roads? Do I need to specify what a human is, what utilities are.....? What is the arbitrary line in word complexity that such a system draws? If it was the super basics, it would be legitimately pages long.
