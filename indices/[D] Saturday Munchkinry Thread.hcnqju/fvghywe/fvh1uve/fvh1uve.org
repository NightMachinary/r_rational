You could make the magic come from spirits rewarding you for causing suffering and/or rituals that involve breaking certain taboos, like:

Rape, pedophilia, necrophilia, incest, bestiality, cannibalism, murder, torture.

If the taboo-breaking necessitates suffering, it would rule out most of the moral workarounds like cannibalizing someone that's already dead, murdering an unconscious non-sentient creature (I guess this could still cause suffering for loved ones), torturing consenting masocists, incest between two consenting siblings of similar age, etc. So to use the magic you'd either have to do some deeply immoral shit or put yourself through extremely traumatizing experiences.

I've been thinking about 'dark' magic systems recently and I think there might be a fun balance in which they can be used without becoming an unredeemable monster but they're still fairly unpalatable. Technically things like fear, shame, disgust, etc. count as suffering they're just not quite on par with the suffering caused by physical mutilation or intense psychological trauma, so you might be able to get something out of the magic system from those, you just wouldn't be able to compete with someone willing to go all the way.

There also might be an interesting dark magic system that could arise from spirits rewarding you for doing things that /should/ cause suffering (so most of the taboos above), but they can't or don't check whether or not it actually did which would allow for moral exploits but would still be pretty gross.

Another could be receiving temporary chunks of magic for causing suffering but only while the suffering is happening, which would heavily encourage users to do things that cause long-lasting suffering that affects as many people as possible (like killing a member of a large family). For example, let's say you have X mana and you scare the shit out of someone, you now have 2X mana but only so long as they're scared. Conversely, if you smash someone's kneecap, leaving them with a permanent-painful limp, you'll have 2X mana till they kick the bucket.
