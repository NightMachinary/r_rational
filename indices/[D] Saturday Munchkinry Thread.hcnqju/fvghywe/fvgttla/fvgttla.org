You mention that (at least in one setting) that magic is sapient and malevolent, but it's possible to win. Therefore, a well-intentioned munchkin may be /cautious/ of this magic, but he would not /avoid/ it (unless the magic-minds are knowably smarter than he is). Furthermore, I do not think a system of magic with a corrupting effect would necessarily be evil (or at least not /so/ evil that munchkins would stay away) because many of the things one would expect magic to do (most notably shape-shifting, especially into animal forms, but also mind control or very long-range telepathy [acausal telepathy - now /there's/ a thought!]) would require the magical emulation of a mind that does not exist within a skull (there are circumstance which would make this untrue, but it would depend on the specifics of the setting), and anyone who wished to practice 'evil' magic without being corrupted could simply run his existing mind on a magical rather than biological substrate and so avoid the corrupting effects. If minds do /not/ run on a magical substrate, that means that magic has /extremely/ precise control over brain chemistry and neurons, in which case a practitioner of corrupting magic could (at least in principle) avoid the corruption simply by manipulating (or causing to be manipulated) his brain chemistry back to the uncorrupted state - and an altruist practicing powerful but corrupting magic would teach /others/ this technique. I would imagine this would be one of the first innovations of a civilization which could use dark magic, though I will grant that it might be as hard as developing A. I. - but given that most magical stories occur in a world where magic has been commonplace for millennia, while in the real world we've only have decent computers for less than half a century, I think that the issue would have been solved.

I think a system of magic in which the net costs are /far/ in excess of the net gains would repel munchkins; that is, magic is /always/ an obviously negative-sum game. It could be narratively interesting to compel characters into utilizing negative-sum magic for the sake of preventing some larger evil - but that hardly strikes me as munchkinry.
