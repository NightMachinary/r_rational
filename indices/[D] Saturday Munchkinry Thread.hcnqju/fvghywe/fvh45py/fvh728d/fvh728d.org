I love the happiness fueled version. It's not that you lose the happy memories, they just lose their emotional component, which is /worse/ to a lot of people. After enough spells you can still remember your childhood pet just fine, it just no longer matters to you, and you wouldn't care much if it was somehow returned to you.

Also opens the door to all kinds of tear jerkers. Main love interest saves the main character in a dramatic rescue? They may have succeeded, but now that it's over and done with they can't quite remember why they cared so much for you that they went to all that trouble.
