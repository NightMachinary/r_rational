Is it ever said explicitly that consensual mind control is kosher? The character we know who used it didn't get permission, but they definitely underwent a (semi?) permanent change that made them more likely to use dark magic in the future. Similarly, young Harry didn't get executed because he used magic to kill in self defense and someone took responsibility for him, but is it ever made clear that because it was self defense he didn't get tainted by the act? If self defense is all it takes to make it 'safe' to use magic to kill, I think we'd see it more often. Harry has been near death a lot of times, but he never uses magic to kill humans in self defense. There have been quite a lot of opportunities for him to do so.

I love the series, and am rereading it now in preparation for Peace Talks, but I'm not so much interested in wizard legality here as in the specifics of what corrupts the mind. It's clearly not just that bad people do bad things, it's that unless you have something like the blackstaff breaking the laws causes objective alignment shifts.

Which isn't /fair/, exactly, but it's interesting. Setting aside legality, it creates a world where if you are motivated enough, breaking the laws /just a little/ might possibly be worth it for something important... if you can keep yourself from slipping further. But inevitably a lot of people get less reluctant every time they do it until eventually they no longer need a special reason to break the laws, and boom, you look back and can't quite remember when it was that you became a card carrying villain.
