It is possible to munchkin dark magic in the Dresdenverse though. Killing with magic is fine as long as it's self defense. Necromancy is only corrupting if done on human subjects. Consensual mind control is safe. You're not allowed to bind demons, but summoning them to ask questions in return for parts of your True Name is not banned. Completing a genocidal dark ritual gets you awarded a medal by the White Council.

The only rule you can't break in any way is /Thou shalt not breach the Outer Gates./ Unless you happen to be Harry Dresden, and therefore resistant to corruption by Outsiders. Harry has made an entire career of munchkining the Laws of Magic.
