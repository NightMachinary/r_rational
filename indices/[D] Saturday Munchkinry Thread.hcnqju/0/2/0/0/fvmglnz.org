Would this be any different from photos/videos? People already record their happy memories like birthdays and weddings, and could easily spend their time watching these records to "relive" their memories...

But yes we should probably speak to a bunch of professional ethicists/munchkins/economists/etc. first to determine what features can be safely added.

Maybe start out with just a simple "time dilation" effect where people with the neurochip plugged in can think twice as fast? Since they can easily remove the chip this should not cause issues...
