  I'm also interested in the morality of your usage of this power, maybe you'd just refrain from using it because it seems immoral?

The simple solution here is to get consent.

Absolute control naturally means telepathy is a thing. Send everyone a telepathic message about (part of) your powers and what you can offer them. Don't offer them everything of course, because most forms of mind control are terrible ideas that could turn people into apathetic pure happiness zombies or paperclip maximizers.

To start with, maybe a mental button that can be pressed at most once a day for a few seconds of non-addictive pure happiness, paired with another button that lets them forget the experience if they somehow get addicted anyway.

Then another mental button for energy, that has the same effect as drinking tons of coffee. But have a major warning on the button stating it is not safe to ignore a body's tiredness, along with a timer for how long it has been since they last slept/rested.

Then, a mental library that can let each person browse through their own memories, with buttons for deleting (to forget traumas) or saving memories (so they don't forget happy moments).

Then, perhaps a telepathic form of Skype/Zoom? So that people in areas without internet access can still talk to their friends and family. This might ruin the non-telepathic communications companies though, so we should think this option through carefully.

There are plenty more options that can be introduced to better humanity as a whole without violating any morals.

Edit: Upon further thought, suddenly sending a global telepathic message that announces various mind control powers might terrify people. So here's a gentler approach that trades your personal well-being to avoid possibly inciting mass fear/panic:

Establish a company that creates "neurochips". Hire people to make some hardware chips that can be plugged into a person's neck or worn as a hat or whatever. Take those chips to a secret facility for the software to be written... except there is no software. The chips are total duds that don't actually do a single thing. Yet with your absolute mind control abilities, you can set it up such that the mental benefits system you are giving everyone is only active while the chip is plugged in. Sell tons of chips, and use the excess profits to make more chips to donate to the poor/those living in inaccessible locations.

Now the public should feel safe in "knowing" that their minds can only be "controlled" if a chip is plugged in, and they can take it off (or have someone else take it off) whenever they want. On the other hand, since you are now personally involved, people may target you for all kinds of reasons, many unsavory. And if you die the system dies with you (or does it?) so its debatable whether this is a better option.
