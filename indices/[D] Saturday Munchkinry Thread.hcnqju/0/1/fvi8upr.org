Unite humanity under one banner and pursue immortality. Cloning, genetic modification, body transfers, etc. Then upload everyone old or not immortal into a digital bank so that their experiences and such are not lost to humanity as a whole.

Become a type 2 civilization and take to the stars! The power of the Sun.

But most importantly. Give focus or whatever needs to the authors of dead fics or fics on hiatus. Authors would be left mostly untouched to preserve their creative juices other than making them believe the entire world isn't under my iron fist of control.

In the end when you control everyone, there is no morality. There is only one person playing the puppet master. It'd honestly be kind of depressing and as such would best be counteracted through reading, seeing space, and building huge awe inspiring monuments to the collective capability of humanity that just so happen to serve another (vital) function to a one person world spanning empire.
