Well, let's see. There are some not horrifying things we can do. Let's say we try to end *useless* pain. Still hurts to touch a hot plate, still hurts to get kicked in the balls, but let's cap pain in general somewhere below when it turns into nausea, and let's end pain from arthritis and such all together. Pain is all in the brain. If we can make people dance at will, we can reasonably expect the power to let us selectively weaken pain responses.

Second, blanket massive boosts in will power and self discipline for limited purposes. These include, but are not limited to: Overcoming addictions, cleaning up after yourself, resisting the impulse to self harm, resisting boredom/keeping focus while operating heavy machinery, watching over small children, handling dangerous equipment in general, etc etc. Just to minimize unnecessary random bad things happening. Let's also make it so people have an easier time falling asleep. We presumably can't magically cure mental disorders that cause sleep issues, but whatever the optimal mental state is for someone to fall asleep, that's the mental state they will gravitate toward when they try to sleep.

Third, eliminating corruption. People disagree on politics, especially party politics, so let's avoid that, but I do feel the need to include a point on making it so politicians are honest about their intentions and pursue them with integrity after attaining office.

Fourth, clearly this new power we have has tremendous value, so let's pour a few hundred billion dollars a year into life extension technology and keep the chosen one alive forever.

Fifth, we obviously need to mind control ourselves into ignoring distractions like reddit, facebook etc and spend a lot more time keeping up with global events, studying human psychology etc.

Sixth, instill in everyone a complete disinterest in non-consensual sex, fraud, murder etc.

...There are a lot more things I would do on day one, but those are the ones I can think of immediately that shouldn't be too controversial. You might think eliminating people's desire to commit serious crimes crosses some important line in terms of overwriting free will, but actually /no/, you think it's a great idea and a more than reasonable compromise.
