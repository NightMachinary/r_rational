Let's rebel.

  The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

Let's say you have absolute control over every living human, but of course it's only related to their will and conscience, you can't make them heal wounds faster or get smarter in the artificial way.

How would you use it? What kind of goals would you try to achieve? I'm also interested in the morality of your usage of this power, maybe you'd just refrain from using it because it seems immoral?

Remember that the question is in the real-life based scenario, there is no magic, no aliens, you are still mortal, etc...
