Assume a magic system based on very simple words, that describes objects and effects to force them into being. Inaccurate descriptions tend toward “best available option”, and lack of specification on certain categories also has defaults. Time is always two minutes, colors are always blue, etc. More words in the spell cause the actual activation to take more time, and more resources, with each Word requiring a specific material component that scales up in amount depending on the number of words in the Sentence with it.

Example: ‘Light Here' would, naturally, make a source of light near where it is spoken, would take about ten seconds, and would cost one splinter of wood for ‘here' and one shard of beach glass for ‘light'. Modifying it to ‘Hot Light Here' would create a similar effect, with the light source also radiating heat, and upping the cost of each component by about 25%.

Using minimally complex words, what's the most economical way to describe a city?
