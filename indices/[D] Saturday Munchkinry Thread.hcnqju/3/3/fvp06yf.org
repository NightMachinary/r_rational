I don't know why fashioning weapons out of his own bodyparts would be any more effective for Superman than they would be for a regular old human. The only human-part weapons I've heard of are the occasional spear made of a femur, so unless Supes can grow a spare one of those or find a dead Kryptonian to use for parts, he's out of luck.

I think Superman would be better off trying to learn some martial arts. Which will suffer from inadequate sparring partners, but in some ways they're better for him than they are for us, since his opponents can't get around that advantage by picking up a weapon.
