The problem here is we don't know where the primitives are. A city seems complex to a human, but a grain of sand is very complex, too. As the person said below- why isn't 'city' a primitive of your magic system? Which words need to be described in terms of others? Why can you just say 'light', without having to describe whatever magical EM-field manipulation you're making happen at the planck scale? Where exactly is the arbitrary cut-off for primitive words, and why?

Maybe the magic gets information from the brain of the caster? So you have to meditate for a long time on the word 'light' and what sort of effects you associate with it to lock it in, and the same for each other word; but once you've done that, the magic tries to handle combining the words on its own. Hence why it would be hard to make 'city' a primitive: you can't pack enough detail for a city in your mind to associate with the word, so even though you can cast the spell 'city' quite straightforwardly, the outcome would be look like a melted wax version of a city, like a blurry mental image vomited onto the world, or maybe it looks alright from afar but up close all the details are missing or randomly made of fractal versions of the larger structure. A person can't hold the information necessary to describe a city in their head; the only way to do it, in principle, is have the magic system (which has unspecified computational power) build the idea of the city out of parts you can fit in to your head in enough detail that they don't become nightmarish distortions or weak, broken versions when they're summoned into the world. Hence why you need to start off by meditating on a brick, and also adding a sort-of-programming element to the magic system (You're basically trying to get the magic system to procedurally generate a city).

And maybe you could do something like cast the spell 'paper with the shortest spell I'd have to cast to recreate the city in front of me with definitions of each word in a language I understand', so as to not have to design the spell from scratch.

You'd have to make the spell cost proportional to the effect size as well as word count for the world to not be instantly destroyed under the system I described up there- otherwise someone who knew the moon was a giant ball of rock could just say 'moon here' and get a giant blank ball of rock that only resembles the moon if you squint... but still instantly destroys the world.

Actually, the same goes for your example. Otherwise, what's to stop someone from going 'light here power 3.9x10^{26} Watts'? That isn't much more complicated that 'light here'. I assume you already have some solution to this?
