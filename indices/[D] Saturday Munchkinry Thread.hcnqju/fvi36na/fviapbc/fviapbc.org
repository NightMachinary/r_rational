As far as I'm aware Superman does have a healing factor but not one as incredible as someone like Deadpool who could regrow body parts. I say this because one of the first thoughts in my head was to take out a femur bone and work from there. BUT there is no Deadpool like regeneration so... That's a no go.

Another thought would be to use hair to fashion out a type of garrote. BUT to Superman his super durable, super strong hair is just normal hair? Like he could pluck it out and pull a strand on both ends so it snaps while a normal person wouldn't be able to do either of those things.

So to someone like Doomsday or Zod it'd just be normal hair as well? Same with other body parts.

In the end fashioning a weapon made out of your body without super regeneration or body manipulation is not the best idea. Now another idea would be to involve some magic. Say Captain Marvel (Shazam) blasting the enemy with magic lightning or having Zatara or an Atlantean magic user (such as Queen Mera) doing magic until the opponent is knocked out.

At the end of the magic battle put Doomday in suspended animation and off planet and Zod the same. Or kill Zod. Though Doomsday stays knocked out and off planet with no killing.
