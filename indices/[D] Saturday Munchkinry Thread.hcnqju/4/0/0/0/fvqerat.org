It depends. The telepathy /is/ magic, after all, and it's not specified exactly how it works- which is interesting.

It's self-telepathy, but let's look at the generic case of telepathy reading someone else's mind. You get an understanding of their thoughts and memories. /Something/ is doing the encoding, here, the hard work of analysing and interpreting the changing structure of their brains, and then changing your brain directly to- presumably- convey information about their brains.

If I had the self-telepathy, I would think the above and wonder how it's working. Is there some new lobe of my brain doing this? It seems like a pretty big and complicated job- where's the hardware? If it's just in the ether, then I would start to think: what happens if you can make the mind-reader read itself by thinking the right thoughts?

The mind-reader reads your brain, compresses its informational content, and beams it into a part of your brain as a compressed representation, with only certain kinds of information remaining (it doesn't spam your mind with details a human wouldn't care about, like the average interneural distance, I assume). But if you can 'read' different parts of your mind in an intuitive sort of way- focus on different memories, that sort of thing, or even decide not to read your mind- then the mind-reader /also/ has a direct control link wired into some part of your brain. So I'd try to see if this guess were true, and if I could find where in my mind the uplink to the mind-reader was. Then I'd try and and read the part of my mind where the mind-reader outputs, like recording a tv screen showing the output of the camera you're using to record. What happens, if you can get that, depends on the 'hardware'/implementation of the mind-reader-compressor-broadcaster: It'll be fractal representations within representations (like a camera recording its own output). If the machine is limited, it'll run out of memory and the recursion stops at some point, and/or the representations will get more and more compressed the deeper you go. But this way, you immediately force the machine to run at the full limits of its power (unless there's some sort of interlock for exactly this scenario.) Now, if you can figure out how information gets compressed as it goes down, maybe you can figure out how to use the compression mechanism as a computer: if you can think a thought such that when compressed down the layers it'll change depending on the input thought- boom, a computer.

Your limit now depends on how magically powerful the magic machine in the ether doing this is (from 'it's an extra part of your brain, and isn't that strong/doing this will just give you a stroke' to 'unbounded computation power from outside the matrix') and whether the self-telepathy can help you to hold much more complicated thoughts in your head. (And whether the mechanics of the world you're in, and of neurobiology, allow the compression-computation thing to work reliably in the first place.)
