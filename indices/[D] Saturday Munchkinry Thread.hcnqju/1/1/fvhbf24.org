You should /never/ use Dark Magic if it has a murder-gandhi effect (i.e. it causes you to use more dark magic, and also has other negative effects on your decision making)

You should /rarely/ use Dark Magic if there are large negative externalities, whether that's killing a random person or attracting the Void Beast.

You should /sometimes/ use Dark Magic if there are large known costs, like a gallon of human blood or a certain quantity of experienced pain.
