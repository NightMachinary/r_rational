Ignoring the degenerate case (magic that is too weak to bother with), there are a few different ways to make a thing 'bad':

- negative effects on the user
- negative effects on the subject
- negative global effects (I include randomly targeted negative impacts here, like "a random person dies)

Worth the Candle explores the last one somewhat by way of the Void Weapon Ban - there's a commons tragedy in progress, wherein use of void technology (which is efficient and effective) contributes to attracting a world-ending threat slowly approaching the world (an analogy for pollution in the real world, I assume).
