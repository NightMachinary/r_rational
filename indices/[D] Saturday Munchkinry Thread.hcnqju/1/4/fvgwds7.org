Idea 1: the magic uses a limited, rare resource that cannot regenerate, and that resource is necessary for sapient life.

The inhabitants of the world of Unoidea are trapped on the planet due to the physical laws of the universe preventing exit from the atmosphere. However, things other than living creatures are permitted to exit (though not come back in). Energy and matter do not enter the atmosphere at all, in fact. This would normally result in a closed system that would inevitably die out. Luckily, vortexes exist that constantly release a flow of matter and energy into Unoidea, so long as they remain unblocked. Normally, the input outweighs the output, but this can be counteracted by simply chucking out excess matter or energy out of the atmosphere with rocket ships, or letting it dissipate out naturally.

There is a disruptive force, though. Magic.

With a simple magical ritual that simply takes a full moon and a willing sacrifice, an input vortex can be permanently sealed. In exchange, the magus gains amazing powers with a thematic link to what the portal was spewing out. A portal outputting radiation will give the magus the ability to spew deadly beams of alpha particles from their hands. A diamond output may lead to geokinesis, and so on. But eventually, these powers will fade - usually, the magus will perish first, but it is observed in young magi or magi granted longevity that the powers will always, inevitably, fade. So while each individual power may be munchkinned to heck and back, the smart move in the long run is to never use magic at all. Of course, with the ritual being so simple, people will use it anyway - leading to ill-intentioned munchikins,

The next option is living, self-correcting magic.

The world of Zweidea is pretty similar to our own, with the exception that there is magic /everywhere/. It's astounding, honestly, what sort of things are permitted when the magic seems to /encourage/ weird and fantastical things. It even seems to evolve as time goes on, becoming more specialised, more evocative, and so on.

But... the magic, even as varied as it is, never seems to be fully capitalised on.

A budding pyromancer, aiming to use his powers to propel rockets into space, and make huge quantities of cash (instead of following the tradition of using it in the military, or for entertainment) never seems to be able to develop his talent beyond party tricks.

A healer is experimenting with pushing the boundaries of disease magic, and is astonished to find a seemingly arbitrary hard cap of infectivity, even struggling to replicate the common cold.

A psion attempts to use the ability to make vast illusions real in an attempt to create a supe-intelligent being... But unlike his other attempts, much more poorly designed, at making merely sapient creatures? It refuses to work!

The deal is that the magic is a tool, used by an unknown entity, to generate entertainment, intrigue, violence, wonder, and any number of other things that are close to, but not really, what a human in the world would want. Almost as if it is constantly mutating to justify rule of cool, while preventing world-ending, world-saving, or world-disrupting events. A mage can violate light-speed using portals relatively easily! They can travel vast distances in the blink of an eye, warp in combat in a way that makes viewers become amazed, and perform atomic-scale tricks to justify the coolest things! A mage that intends to set up a meagre series of portal way-gates to revolutionise trade, on the other hand, will find a lack of talent and a lack of connections with the right people preventing this from ever happening. Perhaps the entity that set up this system feeds on entertainment, or maybe it's all a simulation - but the inhabitants of the world can never quite find a way to make all their problems go away.

A third and final idea: tricks can only be done once.

In the world of Tresidea, magic is highly controlled, highly illegal to all but the highest in the hierarchy, and a bad idea to try and do haphazardly.

In the Olden Days, people are told, magic was used freely for all manner of things, and everything was easy. A mage created a regenerating monster to attack a town, and that same monster was captured, to be harvested for its infinite supplies of meat. No mage past that point tried something like that again. An everlasting storm requiring a massive ritual pours endless fresh water into the basin of Partovdewurld. All magical storms from then on were finite, in order to make sure there wasn't too much water. A cataclysmic meteor strike was averted with one thousand mages, each launching a different magical attack. Such a scheme has luckily not been needed since.

Of course, as the population of Tresidea grew, some intelligent person on the street wondered why they couldn't have another regenerating meat source. They would be quite useful, the soul argued, and many agreed that this seemed sensible. Magic was versatile, yes, and could do much good, but maybe some goods could be done more than once?

The population of Tresidea continued to grow, and so came a point where the mages replied that, yes, it would be quite nice, except for the small issue that any time magic is performed, that magic cannot be used again. Luckily, they said, this wasn't an issue, because the human imagination is limitless, and any problem could be solved so long as everyone kept notes and managed not to overlap specialities.

The population of Tresidea continued to grow, and people began to realise why they were using the meat-monster for food, and not just fertilising fields with the much more conceptually simple idea of fertiliser magic, or growth magic.

As the mage-light creation artefact broke in a freak accident, people had to switch to oil lanterns.

As the endless storm was interrupted by a magical accident, new sources of fresh water had to be discovered.

As an assassin kills the God-King of the Empire, his keys realise, horrified, that they can't think of any more ways they could revive him.

Magic is clamped down upon. Each an every potential trick, if discovered, must be saved for when it is needed most. Each potion recipe must be locked in a vault until it needs crafted. Any and every trick and trap with physics or conceptual shenanigans has already been discovered, and all that is left is is imagining the most janky, wonky spells that any self-respecting power gamer would decry as literally unusable.

The world of Tresidea continues to exist, but it always becomes a little lesser as time goes on.
