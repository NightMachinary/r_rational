/"Do not do unto others as you would have that they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same."/

Character/Reader values dissonance is a veritable hydra of plot twists, usually in the form of a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise][Tomato Surprise]]. Protagonist isn't quite so righteous as we assumed, nor Antagonist so unforgivable... but I don't think that's really what you're talking about.

The problem isn't that Ben and Jim are blind to anything but the flaws of what the other loves, it's that they fundamentally disagree about what's enjoyable. Jim is never going to find any classic science fiction dilemmas and moral quandaries in Star Wars. Ben is never going to find any Flash Gordon space opera in Star Trek. Neither belongs in the other.

Worse yet, believing that Jim loves styrofoam rocks and wooden acting or that Ben loves cheesy lines and predictable twists is /not wrong/. Each adores these failings of their beloved works precisely because they had to overcome the silliness of them. When either franchise manages to successfully incorporate the best parts of the other without losing their fundamental character, both sides rejoice.

But that's rare, and actually really hard to do. The benefits works at cross purposes: Star Wars speeds up as Star Trek slows down.

Getting both Jim and Ben at a table together and explaining that their tastes differ will not change those tastes. If the stakes are higher than which silly popular science fiction universe one prefers, it won't even make them less angry. In religion and politics the argument may superficially be about beliefs, but ultimately it's about actions... often ones taken long enough ago that great damage has already been done. Yeah great, Jim's not actually some stupid, insane monster. He's still defending a long line of stupid, insane, monstrous decisions.

So yeah, sometimes a fictional Jim comes to understand a fictional Ben and learns to love his style of goofy fun, but rarely in a realistic way. Values are slow to change, if they can be changed at all.
