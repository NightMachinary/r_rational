this reminds me of the 'bad wrong fun' argument from RPGs (usualy game mechanics vs RP). how dare those people have fun in a way different than you have fun?

even if you can understand the argument of the other side, that does not solve the problem at all. if the guy on the other side hates you for having a different opinion, then understanding why does not help in the slightest. they will often simply double-down on how they hate you for having a different opinion (be it politics, religion, or how you enjoy playing RPGs differently).

so the problem becomes that some people have strong opinions, and hate those who disagree with them. they put the blame for this on the other people, and are not open to debate (and debate may be seen as a challenge or threat). a subset of this are people who Must Be Right, so anyone who disagrees with them is Wrong.
