  this reminds me of the 'bad wrong fun' argument from RPGs (usualy game mechanics vs RP). how dare those people have fun in a way different than you have fun?

I've always thought there was something more going on there. It's not really that role-players are offended that gamers enjoy gaming, or vice-versa; the problem they have is that they're both calling the thing they like by one name ("playing an RPG"), such that it can lead to an expectation that a given RPG session will contain the thing you like---or a given /person/ will /like/ the thing you like---but then it turns out that they like something you /don't enjoy at all/ but which just happens to be equated to it in virtually all circumstances.

If you dissolve the concept of "role-playing game", the competing-access-needs that are going on here become quite stark. Everyone wants to invite their friends to get into doing /the particular thing that they themselves like doing/. Inviting your friends to get into that, and seeing them end up getting into something /totally different/ while claiming that they're "doing the thing you like with you," is decidedly suboptimal. (But, of course, then /they/ want to get /you/ into the part of the activity that /they're/ enjoying...)

Compare and contrast: love languages.
