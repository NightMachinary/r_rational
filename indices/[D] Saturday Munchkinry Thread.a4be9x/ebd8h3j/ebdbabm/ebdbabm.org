TL;DR written after the rest of this: Mine your potential future timelines for knowledge from humanity's possible future technological advances by pre-committing yourself to study a technical field of choice and prepare accumulated knowledge for local broadcast at specific times. Use the knowledge gained from the crystal to advance that field and increase your own freedom to act, focusing on changing the probability distribution of the future towards stability and technological advance. Pick a new field and repeat. Continue until dead or until you win.

The distance limitation is fairly straightforward to circumvent for a lot of things. You just set up your environment beforehand so whatever you want to learn about has observable local effects. One example is looking at real-time market data on a computer. You don't need to send the crystal ball out into the world if you arrange to have the world come to you instead.

Only being able to activate it once an hour pretty severely limits how densely you can sample the future, but if needed you could set up a high-density sample of a time significantly into the future, like spending 100 activations on a specific time a week from today. That would be good for a situation where you need to more accurately assess probabilities, but I'm not sure what that would be.

You might think lotteries would be a good thing to scry, but it only works if the winning number is not chosen stochastically. That tumbling cage of ping pong balls could go a lot of ways, you'll only see one of those ways per activation, and if it's designed well a large number of scryings will just confirm that their process is very uniformly random and that all the balls come up with equal probability.

Anything relying on information not being publicly revealed before a certain time is immediately broken, since you can just scry that time for the information. Pre-commit to finding the answer and writing it on a note on the table in front of you. It'll usually work and you can easily verify when the plan failed, since the most likely failure mode is not successfully learning the information, and you can just send messages to yourself about the failure regardless.

Actually, that brings up what might be a really interesting avenue to explore further. Because the universe is not deterministic, pre-committing yourself to writing down information on a sheet of paper on the table doesn't mean you will /actually/ do everything needed to cause that to /actually/ occur. You can steal information from /potential/ timelines and use it to go to a /different/ timeline. The trick is the shift in futures - you have to pre-commit yourself in a way that means you will almost certainly complete the task, as long as you don't /already/ have the information. Then once the scrying is complete of the timeline where you don't have the information and had to go get it, you can /actually/ go into /another/ timeline where you didn't do any of that work because you already had it from the crystal.

Because there is no stated limitation on how far into the future you can look (besides lifespan), you can mine /all of your potential futures/ for information. One where you spend thirty years studying genetics and absorbing the accumulated knowledge of the field, one where you spend thirty years studying robotics, etc. These scrying attempts will generally provide good information because the possibility distribution for human society is likely to be filled with progress more than non-progress. Even if you pessimistically assume that technological civilization only currently has a 10% chance of even existing in thirty years, you can just scry ten times more to find the information from the timeline where it does.

You'll have bandwidth limits to overcome. Maybe you can arrange to have high-density information signals passed between a future computer and a current one over the visual link of the crystal? Laser pulses, etc. Then you could download huge amounts of data from each potential future.

Your effective final limitation in how much you can change the future will be how quickly you can implement the knowledge gained so as to change the range of futures being scried. Mine the future for knowledge, use it to change the future, mine the future again. All before your lifespan runs out and you can't scry into the future anymore. If you're old, recruit someone young so you can borrow their lifespan to look farther by using the crystal together.
