It does seem pretty trivial to use this to become the richest person alive and then use your wealth to implement tech and discoveries by precommitment to having really important papers on particular topics around you at certain times.

Given the advantages of both your market foresight and prior tech knowledge it seems likely that you can get enough money to build an artificial island and basically form a micronation with the power/resources of a full sized nation.\\
Then once you've done that you can deliberately keep certain tech secret and well contained, letting the researchers working for you have the ability to work on AGI and AI safety without real time constraints (though their future work would be brought back to the past so they'd advance extremely quickly) or competition. So pretty plausibly with this power you can ensure that if there's any chance of FAI you can develop it within at most decades (after all in terms of raw processing power we should already be able to run an efficient AGI) and give it your utility function in particular.
