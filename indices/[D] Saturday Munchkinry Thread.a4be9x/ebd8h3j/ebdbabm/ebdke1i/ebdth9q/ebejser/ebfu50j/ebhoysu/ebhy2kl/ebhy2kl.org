Given in this scenario I'm the richest person in the world I can absolutely afford to spend billions of dollars on supercomputers and their power consumption. However I'm also going to be able to develop computing tech to use here basically as quickly as it can be implemented, so I can use computing tech good enough that that is absolutely not the limiting factor.

  Presumably, you would want your AI development process to work with brains that are far faster than that. Just considering it takes a human about 25 years (9,125 days) to mature and finish schooling and job training, you'd probably want to be running at about 10,000 times the speed of a human brain. This way, you can try out new methods each day to see if you can get the neural network to match or exceed the functions and performance of a human brain. And, of course, once you can get it learning and functioning independently, but processing 10,000 times faster than a human, you can use it to improve itself and achieve runaway AI development. However, this would cost $1.6 trillion, and you'd need to factor in the cost of building and operating a 90 GW power plant.

This scenario presumes not only no improvements to computing hardware, but also implicitly assumed that the AGI is developed from an emulated human mind because actual AI would have /many/ advantages that mean it does not need to spend subjective decades to accumulate expertise. Also worth noting with the sort of insane economic domination my divination can afford me (did you notice how I'm literally going to found a city state with massive economic power?) even the cost that you present is totally feasible for me.

  Just factoring in the construction time alone, Palo Verde took 10 years to build. Chubu Centrair International Airport (an artificial island/airport) took 5 years to build (and $7.3 billion). You need to build the island where you'll put everything, then build the shipping container port, then build your 23 Palo Verdes and all of the other structures. Most likely, you're looking at a minimum of 15-20 years before you can start proper AGI development. You would probably also need a budget of around $5-10 trillion dollars. For reference, Bill Gates has a net worth of about $95 billion. So, you would need to work out how long it would take you achieve about 20 to 100 times as much money. This is quickly sounding like the time needed to get the money, build the island, and work out how to make a functioning AGI may take more than one lifespan.

See you're really understating the sort of completely economic dominance this power could afford me. Really the main limitation is how much money and power I can accrue without worrying too much about state intervention. Not only can I consistently outcompete the market to a frankly insane degree, but I'll be pumping out an enormous number of extraordinarily valuable innovations nearly constantly. I effectively expect that a substantial portion of all the largest companies in the world are going to be controlled by me.\\
So I can absolutely afford to spend tens of trillions of dollars here to get this built in a decade (I can also roll out whatever techs I want to just make everything involved orders of magnitude cheaper). Though given construction times I'd be funding R&D for long before that, with this being staggeringly effective since I can just feed my researchers and engineers back the innovations that they would have made decades from now.

Honestly you just really don't seem to be considering the insane scope of this kind of divination abilities utility and power. It basically means that anything which could have a technological solution prior to superintelligent AI I can start using as quickly as I can implement it. Similarly the degree of planning ability and resulting economic control this gives me is staggering and as another commenter pointed out this power can also be used as a probability pump.
