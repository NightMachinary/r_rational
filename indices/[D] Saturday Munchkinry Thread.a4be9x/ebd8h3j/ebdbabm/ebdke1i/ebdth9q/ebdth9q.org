What did the version of myself that I'm viewing see in the crystal ball? The same thing I'm seeing, or a randomly selected future? I'm assuming the second because otherwise there could be paradoxes.

Don't immediately look into the far future, or I just give whatever AGI wins a way to the present.

I could look one hour ahead and write down what I see for 61 minutes, including the writing I saw in the ball. That way, I could aggregate information from many timelines.

Take care to include an abort chance that is much greater than the chance of coming across information that would maliciously convince me to propagate it.

Include a computer in the loop to acquire amounts of compute exponential in my security. This can be converted into bitcoins at the cost of attention. Looking at day-trading data lets me multiply my money but gets me even more attention.

Precommit to a tiny chance of doing a moderately dangerous experiment to spread that information to many timelines. (If the experiment risks me getting forced to look into the far future, that is beyond moderate.)
