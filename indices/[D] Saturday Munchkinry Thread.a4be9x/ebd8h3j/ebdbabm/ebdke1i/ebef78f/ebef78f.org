I didn't understand your ratcheting idea at first, but I think I do now.

Instead of using precommitment merely to constrain the futures you scry to the ones filled with the activity you want to skip ahead of, also try to constrain those futures to ones with /additional scrying/ in them, since the look-ahead advantages will compound.
