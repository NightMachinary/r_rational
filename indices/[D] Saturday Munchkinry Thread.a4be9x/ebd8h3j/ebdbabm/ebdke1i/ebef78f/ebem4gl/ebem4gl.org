Yeah, it's kind of a hard thing to explain. To add to what you said, any futures that you do additional scrying in are going to be disproportionately weighted in the set of all possible futures.

Now that I think about it more... your scrying can't actually square the number of possible futures, because the number of possible futures is probably far greater than (for example) the number of configurations of the particles in your brain. I'm not sure how to account for that, but I don't think it would prevent my strategy from working. It might be a problem if the intermediate scry event had intermediate scry events of its own... my intuition is telling me something pathological might spring out of that.
