Thank you for taking so much time to try to see how I see!

I'd expect you to see the distribution veering toward "Always flipped heads."

To make this more intuitive, imagine that when you scry after a coin flip, you scry to a point in time where you are rolling a six sided dice (instead of a random future). To simplify, we'll say that there are only six possible futures for that scry--one for each result of the die. Further, you are writing the result of that roll down on your record of whether heads or tails came up. So you'll get a list of results of heads or tails, and if you got heads you'll also write what number you saw when you scryed.

If every possible future is represented, at the end you are looking at a distribution where, at every coin flip, there are six times as many heads results as tails results, because every combination of heads and a number is among possible futures. If you rolled tails and didn't scry, only one future appears. If you rolled heads, six futures appear--one for every result.

But what if you don't write the number down?

It doesn't matter, because just the act of seeing the future affects the state of your brain. Even if two possible futures are indistinguishable from your scrying point of view, if your brain state is different, they are different. That's why I think universes with scrying in them are going to be over-represented. What you saw while scrying affects the future of that world.

I hope this clarifies. Now I wonder if I missed something you were saying, hahah.
