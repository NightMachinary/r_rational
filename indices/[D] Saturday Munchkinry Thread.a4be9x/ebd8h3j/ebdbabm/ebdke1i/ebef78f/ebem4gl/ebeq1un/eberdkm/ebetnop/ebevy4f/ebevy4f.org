  How would adding the crystal or the supposition that the universe is probabilistic change that?
#+end_quote

Scrying on the crystal changes how you behave (in other words your brain state), so it changes the future.

The dice indeed represent macro states. It was just for explaining, but it's clear you've got the gist of what I'm saying.

  Rolling a die does not create more futures than not rolling it
#+end_quote

That's true, but scrying /does/ increase the number of futures. At least, I think it does.
