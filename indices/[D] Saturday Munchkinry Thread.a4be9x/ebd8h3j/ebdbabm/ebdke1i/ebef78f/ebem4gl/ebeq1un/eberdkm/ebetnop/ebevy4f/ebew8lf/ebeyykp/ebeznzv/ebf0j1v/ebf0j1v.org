In that case, if you look forward past a scry, you'll still see all the possible futures that the scry would eliminate--it hasn't eliminated any yet, as of the current scry. And my technique for ratcheting won't work.

If that's how it works, I'd want to find that out as soon as possible. That's the first thing I'd want to test.
