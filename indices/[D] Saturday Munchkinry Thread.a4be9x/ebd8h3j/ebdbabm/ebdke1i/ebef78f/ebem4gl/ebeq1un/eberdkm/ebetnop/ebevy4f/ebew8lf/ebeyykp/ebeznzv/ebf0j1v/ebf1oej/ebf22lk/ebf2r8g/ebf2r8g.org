Thanks, that was something I wasn't entirely clear on what you meant. I agree. The first scrying's results will be from among all possible future results of the second scrying (assuming that second scrying will definitely happen), just like the results will be consistent with everything else in their history. If the second scrying is not /definitely/ going to happen then the first scrying's possible results will also include some futures where the second scrying doesn't happen at all.
