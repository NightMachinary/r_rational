  In that case, if you look forward past a scry, you'll still see all the possible futures that the scry would eliminate

I think you could only see things that are still a potential future from your present. I think you're right to focus on the scrying itself - can you see futures where you never used the crystal at all?

My take is "no". Only things that are consistent with your immediate present and past can be potential futures. So if you're currently scrying, you will only see futures that are "downstream" of the scrying you have already done so far. If the scrying you've already done is inconsistent with that possible future, that's the same as saying it /isn't/ a possible future. It's not a possible future result from the starting point of your immediate present.

If the crystal ever showed you anything that /cannot/ happen in /your/ future then it would seem to have violated its own rules. It can show you possible futures where you ate some fish. But it can't show you one where you are and always have been a fish-person, or one where you never used the crystal ball at all. Those aren't possible. What does "possible" mean here if not "part of the set of consequences that can follow from the current state by following the probabilistic rules of the universe?"

So you can't scry things that are inconsistent with scrying them. I think?
