The best way to extend your time in the past is probably to try a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus][ship of theseus]] thing, where you keep replacing parts of the hamburger so it never goes rotten. You can eat the replaced parts as well, to justify to the jinn that you are eating the burger.

The next problem is that if you change the past, what happens to present you? The 10 year old you is still a kid and very susceptible to changes in his environment. If you do anything major like tell your parents ways to get filthy rich, that could have significant effects on your upbringing, which butterfly to the future where your entire personality and lifestyle may be reshaped arbitrarily. You could go from the current rational you to a rich spoiled brat who thinks people only exist to serve him. So unless you are willing to risk killing own your personality, you should make changes secretly.

If you have a computer that you will keep for many years, you can try writing a program that automatically activates when you are 20 and tells you how to munchkin your future knowledge then, instead of when you are a susceptible 10 year old.

You can also help out strangers that you like by sending them anonymous letters containing your future knowledge. Send celebrities who died in accidents anonymous letters telling them to avoid these accidents. Send anonymous letters containing a list of all future hurricanes you remember to the people in charge of the cities that will be hit by said hurricanes. Advance the state of science by sending future scientific knowledge to current day scientists via anonymous letters.
