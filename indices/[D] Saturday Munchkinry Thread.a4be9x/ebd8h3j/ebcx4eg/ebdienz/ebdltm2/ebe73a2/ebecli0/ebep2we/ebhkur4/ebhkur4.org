I might not have any ability to supernaturally manipulate others, but I probably can nudge people who were previously fairly undecided one way or another. Infiltrating plenty of communities with political bias and suggesting that they either make sure to vote or don't bother to vote because what difference does one vote make may be enough to change the outcomes of otherwise close elections.

Of course, that only counts as doing good if I actually know who best to vote for.
