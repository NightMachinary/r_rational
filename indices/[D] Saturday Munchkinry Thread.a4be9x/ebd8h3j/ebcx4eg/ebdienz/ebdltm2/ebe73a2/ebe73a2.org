Put a Patreon link on your blog(s) and make a modest amount of money.

Your fake identities have to have lives outside of the Internet. Details about those lives are convincing to people, including people who live similar lives (same jobs, same hometown, etc.). Depending on how much you post, this may be a way to access information you wouldn't otherwise have about places, job fields, people, and so on.

Is it possible to make people think you know them IRL? Obviously this wouldn't be a good idea, as they might become suspicious as to why you never come to meetups.
