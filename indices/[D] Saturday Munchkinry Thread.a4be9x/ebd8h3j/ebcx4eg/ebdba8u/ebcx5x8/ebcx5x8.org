And that is the third edition in this miniseries. I must confess I've always been especially fond of allomantic/feruchemic tin, it's just such an incredibly varied powerset and it really speaks to the imagination without being over the top powerful.

For this entry, I have take significant liberties expanding on what we've seen in the books in order to make it concrete enough to do some actual munchkinry on it. I do not believe anything I've said directly contradicts canon, but I am speculating a lot on how each sense works when enhanced with feruchemy.

My current plan is to do this for future entries as well, especially once we get to the more esoteric metals, but I'd like to hear what you all think of that. Do you prefer I stick to what we know is the case in canon and accept that some metals just aren't going to be very munchkinable or is it better to extrapolate (read: wildly speculate) on canon in order to get a more concretely defined powerset?
