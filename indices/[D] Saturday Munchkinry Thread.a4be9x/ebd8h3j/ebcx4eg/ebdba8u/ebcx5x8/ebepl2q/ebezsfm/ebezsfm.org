I had a section on the feruchemist platypus in there originally, but I cut it partially for length and partially because I couldn't come up with a plausible way for people to gain new senses with either contemporary or Scadrial level technology without having to explain yet another magic system.

  Some people implant small neodymium magnets into their fingertip so that they can sense magnetic fields. If you do this and play around with the implant long enough for your brain to adapt, then it might become a part of your spiritweb.

Oh, that is very cool! I'm a little sceptical on this giving you an actual additional sense, I suspect these people just feel the magnet move around inside their fingers slightly, but that should still work for us.
