  Can you turn off your sense of hunger and thus make going on diets easy?

  Can you turn off your sense of fatigue and thus physically push yourself beyond your limits?

Those should probably would work, yeah. I especially like the second one, you probably wouldn't be able get rid of all the effects of physical exertion and I doub't it'll be very pleasant, but I imagine you be able to go a lot further than you otherwise would if your brain is just not getting the feedback from your muscles that something is wrong.

  Can you turn off your sense of danger and thus commit acts of heroic bravery?

  Can you turn off your sense of guilt and thus commit unspeakable horrors (when necessary)?

  Can you turn off your sense of disgust/revulsion and thus wade through filth and gore if needed?

  Can you store senses on the level of proteins and enzymes? For example, could you make your brain extra sensitive to dopamine to make yourself happier?

I imagine these are more emotions than senses, there is another metal that numbs emotions and it explicitly affects bravery and happiness.
