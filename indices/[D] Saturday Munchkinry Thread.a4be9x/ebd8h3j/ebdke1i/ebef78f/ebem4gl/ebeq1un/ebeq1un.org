  To add to what you said, any futures that you do additional scrying in are going to be disproportionately weighted in the set of all possible futures.

This is the part I think I disagree with and I think it's why I was confused at first. As I understand it the crystal doesn't create futures, but instead randomly selects a possible future and shows it. A timeline with scrying in it isn't automatically more likely to be selected by scrying, because all possible futures are equally likely to be selected regardless of their properties. Probabilities show up as shared properties among groups of those futures. For example "what's the probability that the sun will still shine tomorrow" is equivalent to asking what fraction of all possible tomorrows have that property.

If you want to only look at futures with more scrying in them you've got to attempt to eliminate some of the non-scrying futures yourself beforehand by separate means (like precommitment of some kind), and then let the crystal select randomly from that now-more-narrow future.

Say you commit to a plan to setting aside time next week for flipping a coin once an hour for ten hours and using the crystal only if the coin comes up heads, writing down each coin flip result as you go. Then scry ahead to the completed note as many times as you like (or can fit). What distribution of results will you see?

It's my hypothesis that you'll see a binomial distribution centered on 50% heads, rather than something skewed towards heads just because those timelines had more scrying in them.

I think there might be something you had in mind that I'm still missing, but I haven't been able to figure it out.
