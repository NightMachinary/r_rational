That's why I'd deliberately not look too far forwards. Having the future versions of my researchers doing as much work as possible without actually making AGI (though of course how long the work takes is somewhat irrelevant given this ability). So when I eventually do make an AGI I'm going to very very sure it's safe with regards to my utility function, preferably provably so.
