I'm not convinced on the processing power and timeline you're suggesting here for an artificial island research station. An adult human brain has about 22 billion neurons and about 220 million synapses, with an estimated 3.88×10^{16} operations per second needed to simulate one in real-time. It's true that supercomputers have been made which are capable of doing that, like the 2016 Sunway TaihuLight at a cost of $273 million, which can perform 9.3×10^{16} operations per second, though it uses 15 MW of power. Using that as a baseline, we'd expect that each simulated brain worth of neurons and synapses would cost about $166 million and require about 9 MW of power.

Presumably, you would want your AI development process to work with brains that are far faster than that. Just considering it takes a human about 25 years (9,125 days) to mature and finish schooling and job training, you'd probably want to be running at about 10,000 times the speed of a human brain. This way, you can try out new methods each day to see if you can get the neural network to match or exceed the functions and performance of a human brain. And, of course, once you can get it learning and functioning independently, but processing 10,000 times faster than a human, you can use it to improve itself and achieve runaway AI development. However, this would cost $1.6 trillion, and you'd need to factor in the cost of building and operating a 90 GW power plant.

For reference, the largest power plant in the United States is the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, which has a maximum capacity of about 4 GW. You'll need about 23 of those, and each would cost about $11.3 billion in 2016 dollars, so about $260 billion added to the cost of the supercomputer.

Then, of course, you need to factor in all of the personnel and logistics to run all of this. Palo Verde employs about 2,000 full-time employees, so you'll probably need about 46,000 employees to run your power plant. Most likely, this means you'll need to construct housing for 46,000 families, and then roads and infrastructure to support a likely population of around 138,000 people. Of course, now we need to factor in the costs and building time for power plant for them, as well as your desalination plant, water treatment plant (or dump raw sewage into the surrounding ocean?), shipping container port, airport (seems hard to persuade people to live there without one), grocery stores, restaurants, banks, recycling center (or just dump unprocessed garbage into the ocean?), and supermarkets. You'll then need to work out how much more housing and infrastructure you need for all of the employees for all of those parts of the island.

Just factoring in the construction time alone, Palo Verde took 10 years to build. Chubu Centrair International Airport (an artificial island/airport) took 5 years to build (and $7.3 billion). You need to build the island where you'll put everything, then build the shipping container port, then build your 23 Palo Verdes and all of the other structures. Most likely, you're looking at a minimum of 15-20 years before you can start proper AGI development. You would probably also need a budget of around $5-10 trillion dollars. For reference, Bill Gates has a net worth of about $95 billion. So, you would need to work out how long it would take you achieve about 20 to 100 times as much money. This is quickly sounding like the time needed to get the money, build the island, and work out how to make a functioning AGI may take more than one lifespan.
