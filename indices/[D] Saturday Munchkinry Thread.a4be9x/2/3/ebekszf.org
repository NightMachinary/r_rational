I think I could probably convince at least one of my parents that I was from the future and to invest perhaps a grand in bitcoin once it came around, so that we'd be filthy rich when they sold bitcoin once 10k based on my instructions. Given I don't have the time to do research beforehand in this scenario at most we could also make a whole lot of money from buying google stock before bitcoin became available as well, which would incentivize them to take my bitcoin advice seriously enough to not sell until it reached 10k.

Don't really think there's anything I could realistically do to make the world better in this scenario though (I mean even if I could get my mom and /maybe/ my dad somewhat on board I couldn't hope to convince anyone else), but at least I could ensure that my family would probably be filthy rich.
