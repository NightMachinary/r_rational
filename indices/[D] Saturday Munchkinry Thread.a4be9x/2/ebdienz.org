One day you're eating a hamburger, and it's not very good. You remember a hamburger you had during your 10th birthday party, and fondly recall it being delicious. You say out loud "I wish I could eat that burger again". Unbeknownst to you, you'd rubbed against a magic lamp the night before and a jinn had been listening to you and waiting for you to say the magic words. /poof/ Suddenly you find yourself transported back in time, and find yourself holding the mouth-watering hamburger from your memory in your hands. What do you do?

To clarify how it works a bit more:

You get no other wishes. The jinn wasn't one of the 'three piece' ones like in the movies.

You can stay in the past only as long as the hamburger remains edible in normal hamburger fashion. That means if it goes rotten, you go to the future. If you finish it except for crumbs, you go back to the future. If you /freeze/ the hamburger - the moment the burger ceases being 'edible in the normal hamburger fashion' you go back to the future.

You retain all your knowledge and intelligence, but your body is 10-year-old-you's body.

The Jinn is friendly but not infinitely patient. He'll tolerate a little rules lawyering about the wish, but his beneficence is not infinite so beware.
