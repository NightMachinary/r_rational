So are tin feruchemists effectively immune to pain as long as they have tin they can store their sense of pain in? That's useful as a cheap kind of anesthetic for medical surgeries, though not so good for dealing with torture since any torturer would just remove your tin before commencing.

  Of course, humans have much more than five senses and a feruchemist is able to store each of them. How useful this is might be questionable, but if you can find a path to godhood that involves knowing very precisely how full your bladder is, then by all means let us know about it.

What other senses are there?

- Can you turn off your sense of hunger and thus make going on diets easy?
- Can you turn off your sense of fatigue and thus physically push yourself beyond your limits?
- Can you turn off your sense of danger and thus commit acts of heroic bravery?
- Can you turn off your sense of guilt and thus commit unspeakable horrors (when necessary)?
- Can you turn off your sense of disgust/revulsion and thus wade through filth and gore if needed?
- Can you store your artistic senses for a long period and then unleash them to be a super art critic?
- Can you store senses on the level of proteins and enzymes? For example, could you make your brain extra sensitive to dopamine to make yourself happier? Can you make your white blood cells extra sensitive to bacteria, or make them less sensitive to alleviate autoimmune diseases?
