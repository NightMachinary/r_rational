I like the extrapolation. None of what you've posted seems out of place with canon.

I'm curious which parts are extrapolated here, and which are confirmed by Brando Sando? I know the fact that tapping sight lets you "zoom in" is canon, but I'm guessing the decomposition of touch is something you surmised.
