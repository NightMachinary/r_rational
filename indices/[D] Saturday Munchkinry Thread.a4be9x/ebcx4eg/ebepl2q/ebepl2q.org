Hrm. If allomantic tin can increases the amount of info coming in, and feruchemy lets you better focus on the info you're getting (and so mitigate the danger of flaring tin in a bright or noisy environment). Combining the two should let you some pretty crazy things.

- Sit in a crowd, and track a specific individual's movement via hearing. Or similarly track people through walls.
- Full echolocation might be possible, with allomancy letting you hear faint echoes, and feruchemy letting you focus on and interpret the echoes.
- Do that 'listening to someone's heartbeat to tell if they are nervous' thing that Daredevil likes so much.
- Track down people like a bloodhound.
- If tin allomancy lets you see things that aren't actual quite visible, I wonder if you smell things that can't actually quite be smelled. Like odourless gasses.
- Possibly look at the stars during daytime. Allomancy lets you see through the fog of the atmosphere. Feruchemy lets you not get blinded?

The other interesting potential source of munchkinry I see is with expanding your sensorium.

I recall that Sanderson confirmed that a hypothetical platypus feruchemist could store electroreception in tin. If we rule out stealing that sense with hemalurgy (because stapling a platypus soul to your own is probs not healthy), it might be possible to hack your way into the sense using body modification.

Some people [[https://www.medicalbag.com/body-modification/magnet-implants/article/472457/][implant]] small neodymium magnets into their fingertip so that they can sense magnetic fields. If you do this and play around with the implant long enough for your brain to adapt, then it might become a part of your spiritweb. (We know that the in the Cosmere, your soul's residual image can change over time, so that magical healing won't remove scars or other injuries which are part of your self-conception.)

Then once your brain is adapted to interpreting this very weak new sense, it might be possible to compound it up to the point of usefulness.
