  I'm a little sceptical on this giving you an actual additional sense, I suspect these people just feel the magnet move around inside their fingers slightly

On a physical level, the magnet is absolutely just stimulating touch receptors. But some of the people with the implant report learning to intuitively interpret the sensation as feeling em fields. I would guess that it's similar to the mental phenomenon that occurs when an adult receives a cochlear implant.

The question here is whether that self-conception of the sensation is enough to alter the spiritweb.

For feruchemy, I guess it doesn't really matter whether you sense the fields via your touch-tinmind or via a separate electroreception-tinmind. But for allomancy, which magically provides extra info, it might matter. If it enhances the implant-sense by amplifying the feeling of vibrating metal, then boosting the sense might just make your finger feel shaky. Whereas if it interfaces with your intuitive interpretation of em field strength, then the magic might actually give a more detailed map of the local fields.
