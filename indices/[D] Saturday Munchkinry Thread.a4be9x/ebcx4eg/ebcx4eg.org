*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 3: Tin*

Ok then, week three of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For part one and a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][here]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

Up this week is tin. As always I'm interested in what a tin twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantic tin enhances your senses. A soon as you start burning tin your eyesight, hearing and sense of smell, taste and touch all improve dramatically. How much those senses improve depends on the allomancer, but at the (very) high end this allows you to do things like see through the tiny gaps in the fabric of a blindfold or feel the grain of the wooden chair you sit on through your pants.

It's worth noting that while your ability to process all this new information does increase, it does not increase proportionally to the amount of extra information coming in and it's very easy for an allomancer to get overwhelmed. You cannot choose which senses to enhance (it's all or nothing), so an allomancer burning tin to keep an eye out for distant enemies can easily get distracted by some footsteps two floors down or the scent of a cooking stove three buildings over. Somewhat ironically, this means people that make good tin allomancers are the kind of people capable of blocking out the world around them and focus intently on one thing.

Another risk with tin allomancy is that you become hypersensitive to stong stimuli, so burning a lot of tin in bright sunlight might blind the allomancer and loud sounds can daze them. On the other hand, this effect can also be used to clear your head from pain or exhaustion by briefly burning a large amount of tin.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemic tin also centers around enhanced senses, but unlike allomancers, feruchemists store each individual sense they posses separately. This means, for instance, storing eyesight and hearing at the same time requires two separate metalminds (jargon note: a metalmind is another word for a feruchemically charged piece of metal).

While storing it, that particular sense is numbed; storing eyesight makes your vision go blurry, hearing makes sounds become faded and muffled, taste makes all foods become bland and so on. When tapping a tin metalmind the sense stored in that metalmind becomes vastly more acute.

Another area in which feruchemic tin differs from allomantic tin is in how it enhances your senses. Where allomancy just greatly enhances the amount of raw data coming in, feruchemy makes you more capable of discerning tiny differences in input. This manifests slightly differently for each sense:

For sight, it means the feruchemist is able to 'zoom in' on distant things. This works similarly to binoculars or telescopes in that you sacrifice field of view for a greater ability to discern details on distant objects.

Tapping hearing makes a feruchemist able to pick out individual components of the sounds they are hearing, allowing them to, for instance, follow a conversation taking place on the other side of a busy room or picking out the one badly tuned instrument in an orchestra.

Similarly, tapping taste or smell allows a feruchemist to discern specific tastes or scents even when they are covered up by many others, they do not become more able to pick up faint scents/tastes, that's allomantic tin's thing, so in practice this is of limited use (though keep in mind that we /are/ twinborn in this particular scenario).

Touch works somewhat differently. As far as this magic system is concerned, touch is actually three separate senses that each have to be stored in separate metalminds: somatosensation (pressure), nociception (pain) and thermoception (temperature). For each of these, feruchemy allow you to very precisely locate where each sensation is coming from. For instance, a tin feruchemist tapping somatosensation can place a finger on a coin and, without looking at it, describe the relief stamped into its surface, a feruchemist tapping nociception is able to specifically diagnose which of their bones are broken after a fight and a feruchemist tapping thermoception could find nearby sources of heat by tracking which parts of their body are warmer than the others.

Of course, humans have much more than five senses and a feruchemist is able to store each of them. How useful this is might be questionable, but if you can find a path to godhood that involves knowing very precisely how full your bladder is, then by all means let us know about it.
