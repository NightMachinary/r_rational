I assume this lets you change the past, but only about 2 weeks of it before your refeigerated hamburger becomes unsafe to eat. There are better ways you could preserve it, like putting it in a jar, bombarding both it and the jar with gamma rays, and then remotely sealing the jar before putting it into a refrigerator kept at just above freezing, but a 10yo couldn't get access to that equipment unless their parents worked in a lab. Some kind of UV sterilization might help, but that won't protect it from anything inside the bun. I'm assuming there's lettuce and tomato on the hamburger, so flash-heating it might damage the integrity of the burger too much. Better safe than sorry, and again, you can't access this stuff as a 10yo.

Let's assume you can preserve the burger for 3 weeks with the stuff you have on-hand. What can a 10yo do to improve the lot of humanity? If you've memorized loads of sports stats for some reason, you might be able to convince your parents to make a small bet on long odds, which would provide them with more freedom and hopefully improve your future situation somewhat. This would also get your parents to trust you on more problematic future information. Preventing 9/11 is likely impossible because it would be really hard to get the relevant authorities to trust you in 3 weeks, and I'm unconvinced that is the best use of your time. Having your parents take you to a major pharmaceutical company and tell their researchers about modern advancements might help, especially if you can provide them with answers to easy-to-test, difficult-to-guess questions which have been solved in the present day.

The reason I'm not saying "invest in Google lul" is because only some 10yos will have existed at exactly the right time to convince their parents to do so. I'm young enough that I might be able to get my parents interested in Apple stock at the right time, but I'm still a few years early to do it perfectly. There might not be too many butterflies to change their success, but I couldn't guarantee it.

Unfortunately, a huge amount of your success on this issue is going to be tied to how much your parents trust you, and how large the leaps they will take on their child's advice. Having only 3 weeks is pretty brutal.
