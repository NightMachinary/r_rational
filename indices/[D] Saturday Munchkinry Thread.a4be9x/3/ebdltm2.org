You have the power to:

1. Quickly and easily create convincing fake identities for any online community
2. Rapidly accrue status and respect within each identity's respective community, becoming someone the other members pay attention to

This does not give you any special ability to:

- Supernaturally manipulate others
- Enter private communities uninvited
- Create fake information not related to maintaining your identity

You may be able to use your status to browbeat others, fish for invitations, or trick people into helping with a forgery, but you won't have any advantages in doing these over someone who earned their status.

Other than farming internet points, how can you do the most good with this ability?

Ideas I've had so far:

- Shift the Overton Window of politically influential subgroups
- Draw people's attention to information without having to go through the usual crowded channels (I'm thinking of that treatment mentioned in Inadequate Equilibria)
- Infiltrate extremist or criminal groups and leak information to the authorities
