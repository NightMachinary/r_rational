You have actual fortune telling abilities, but the universe isn't deterministic.

You can activate any crystal ball to make it show a future that is randomly chosen from all possible futures, under the following restrictions:

- You can specify an exact time for the crystal ball to show, but the time chosen must be at least 1 hour in the future.
- To activate a crystal ball, you must press one of your palms against it for 10 seconds.
- You can adjust the viewpoint of the crystal ball to any direction and anywhere within 2 meters of yourself in the future. It turns completely black if the viewpoint's distance from future you exceeds 2 meters.
- You can have the crystal ball follow someone else's future instead of yourself, by having both you and your target person place a palm against the ball for 10 seconds when activating it. Nothing happens if more than 2 people press a palm against the ball.
- If the target is dead at the future time chosen, the crystal ball turns completely black.
- A crystal ball remains active for 1 minute before returning to normal.
- Once you activate a crystal ball, you must wait 1 hour before you can activate it or any other crystal ball again.
- The visual quality of the crystal ball depends on how transparent and spherical it is. If it is perfectly spherical and transparent, the visuals will be as good as reality.

Note that the future chosen is uniformly random among all possible futures. This means you can somewhat influence it by pre-committing to certain actions. For example, if you pre-commit to cleaning your room in 1 hour, most of the possible futures 1 hour ahead will show you cleaning your room. It can never be absolutely certain however, since sheer random chance can always block you in some way.
