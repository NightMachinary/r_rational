Hmmm... anything that will be within two metres of me in a possible future. An interesting limit.

So, if I wander past a room, perhaps lean on the wall, at a specific time, then a week before that time I can see what's beyond that wall. That gives me the equivalent of short-range X-ray vision with a time shift.

And then, having seen that information, /I do not need to walk along that corridor/. (Of course, if seeing the information prevents me from walking along that corridor, then there's a chance that I see something entirely different - whatever's two metres from me in the other timeline).

Using this to make money on the stock market is straightforward. I simply need to sample stock prices a few weeks in advance over several futures, and pick the ones that go up in all or most futures. With a camera and a spreadsheet, this should be possible.

On top of this, the universe may not be deterministic but some things are. I can certainly win scratchcard lotteries with my crystal ball (or at least refrain from losing at them). And then there's the matter of horse-racing - I can observe the results of a horse-racing meeting a month in advance (it's easy enough to print that out after the race and keep the paper in a pretermined place at a predetermined time), several times, and thus get a good estimate of the /real/ odds of certain horses winning or losing. I can compare these odds to the odds offered for betting and with some statistics, make a reasonably consistent profit. (A race that turns up the same way in every possible future has probably been fixed in some way - it's probably a good idea to alert someone official anonymously, in advance, including a prediction of the fixed results - though not saying how I know or giving any means to get back in contact with me. When my prediction turns out to be true, an honest official would probably start a very quick investigation into the race). The same goes for betting on other sporting events.
