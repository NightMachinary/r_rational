The ball shows you a random future from all possible futures, eh? So if you scry a point 70 minutes into the future, and you intend to scry again in 60 minutes, you'll be choosing randomly from a squared number of futures--after all, the ball you will view in sixty minutes generates a possible future for each thing it might show you, to the extent that being shown something different affects the future.

Or does it? That's the first thing I'd test.

If so, I can use that to 'cheat'. Let's say I want to find the key to an encryption. I can use a quantum random number generator to generate a key to test. If it doesn't work, I scry ahead 70 minutes and write down the number I find I've written. If my generated number does work, I scry ahead and write down the working number regardless of what I'm shown. Then in sixty minutes, I only scry ahead (to view anything random) if the number I got from the future works. That is, if the future gave me a correct number, I make 'all possible futures' in ten minutes consist mostly of futures descended from this one. That means that in the past, I mostly received the correct number, further increasing the number of futures with the correct number since I'll be scrying a second time in each of those timelines as well. Suddenly, in the overwhelming majority of possible futures, I've got the number that works. I'm basically ratcheting up the fraction of futures in which I'm shown that number.

That makes one wonder...

... can this method generate information from nothing? What if I don't bother with the quantum number generator, instead opting to write whatever number I see I've written in the future? Imagine I don't make any decisions other than "Scry again if the number I received works"--then the ratcheting effect still occurs... even though the numbers have no source?

I suppose I'd need a protocol for 'There was no number', but if that protocol was simply not to scry again, then where would numbers come from?

The chance I break protocol and write a number I shouldn't have is probably nonzero, and of course any random number that I write won't be ratcheted up unless it's correct... or maybe there's a small chance a bystander walks into my room and writes a number on my paper for no reason, which can then be ratcheted. I guess it depends on how finely chopped the future is, but my assumption is that 'all possible futures' includes 'every person on earth experiences all possible brain states, including ones that cause them to randomly walk into rooms and write on papers they find'.

Anyway, the quantum number generator makes relying on such occurrences unnecessary.
