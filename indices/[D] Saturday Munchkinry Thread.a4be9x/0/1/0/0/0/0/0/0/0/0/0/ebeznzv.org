  If you can change the distribution by responding to what you see while scrying, then what you see while scrying has implications for the future.

Yes, by eliminating some possible futures. Namely, the ones where you saw anything else in the crystal or didn't use it at all. In that way it's identical to any other action or event. The futures where something else occurred instead are eliminated. I don't view any possibilities as being "created" here. We're traveling down a tree of potential future timelines and the subtree descending from the present is only decreasing in size as we travel down one branch and eliminate all others. All the variations of scrying or not scrying are just some of those branches.

  It would just be that many more futures with you scrying in them exist than futures that don't.

I don't see how this follows. This seems identical to saying "you are very likely to scry in the future" but I can't see the basis for it.

Going back to the coin flipping, planning to scry each time you get heads does /not/ increase the fraction of the future branches that have the property "you got heads on the flip". How could it? Making this plan does not selectively eliminate futures where you get tails.
