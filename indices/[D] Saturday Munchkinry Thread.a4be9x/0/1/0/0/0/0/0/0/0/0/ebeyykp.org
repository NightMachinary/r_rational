  How?

It seems necessary for the power to have any effect at all. If you can change the distribution by responding to what you see while scrying, then what you see while scrying has implications for the future.

  I think I'm counting them all as already "existing" and waiting to be sampled.

That's not inconsistent (exactly) with my viewpoint. It would just be that many more futures with you scrying in them exist than futures without you scrying.
