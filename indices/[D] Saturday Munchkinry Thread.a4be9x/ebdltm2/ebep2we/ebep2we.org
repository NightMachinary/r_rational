Given this needs to work for /any/ fake identity and you are able to rapidly accrue respect within those communities (which is only going to be possible if there's not a substantial inferential distance between you and the median member of the community), it seem like this power can also be exploited to grant you expertise on any topic for which a niche online community of experts exists.

So doing this you should be able to become a polymath with minimal effort.

Plus even beyond actual objective knowledge, the inferential distance thing should mean that you're also granted detailed knowledge of what the median participant believes and how they think so that you'll be able to fit in. This latter thing is less obviously useful, but you could use it (along with the newfound rhetorical and writing skills you now have) to shift the overton windows of groups far more effectively than I think you were imagining.

Overall I suspect the best use of this ability is going to be using all the knowledge this power gives you to eventually become multiple highly influential online writers, making yourself a decent living along the way.
