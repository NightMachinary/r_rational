  I guess this marks a year into their journey!

I was worried it might give this impression, but no, it's only been about three months :) I specifically didn't want to make it seem like a "You turned 11 today, so you get to go on your journey!" thing: the two aren't connected. Sorry for the confusion!

  So I have to say that as an avid reader of the rational Animorphs fic the bit about the premortem was uncanny. Do you guys collaborate behind the scenes, or were you strongly inspired by its most recent chapter? (Is Aiko going to be the next David???)
#+end_quote

No collaboration here, just neat coincidence :) Someone has already remarked that seeing it show up in both stories around the same time helped remind them of it and cement the technique in their memory, so that's a happy bonus for anyone it applies to.

  I feel like this is your subtle (maybe not-so-subtle? I'm terrible at subtlety) way of informing the readers that Red's psychic training is paying off and it's lifting a kind of depression that he never even knew he had from his psyche.

Not so terrible, since you got this right!

  Lastly, that combee honey must have a crazy strong smell if it's still capable of attracting the hive even while frozen. Freezing things tends to reduce how much smell particles diffuses from the surface.

Yeah, they mostly followed the scent from when the jar opened, it just took awhile to reach them. By the time they tracked it back the honey was already up in the air and melting.
