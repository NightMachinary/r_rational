Hahahaha, I guess this marks a year into their journey! Happy birthday, Red and Blue!

So I have to say that as an avid reader of the rational Animorphs fic the bit about the premortem was uncanny. Do you guys collaborate behind the scenes, or were you strongly inspired by its most recent chapter? (Is Aiko going to be the next David???)

This chapter was a nice break. It's happy, Red's being funny...I feel like this is your subtle (maybe not-so-subtle? I'm terrible at subtlety) way of informing the readers that Red's psychic training is paying off and it's lifting a kind of depression that he never even knew he had from his psyche.

Regarding Aiko...well, she's not dark-type. I doubt Giovanni would send a spy who isn't dark if he knew about Red's psychic abilities. I'm reminded of those escort-type quests in the Gen 5 and later games, where you pair up with someone to go through a forest and get free healing, revives etc. She does seem to get along well with all 3 of them - perhaps too well? Shares Red's preparedness, Blue's love for battling, and Leaf's desire to avoid causing unnecessary harm to relatively placid wild pokemon. So I don't know what she is. I do hope that she doesn't become a long-term addition to the group as imo that'd get difficult to juggle 4 main characters, but if you can pull it off then hey, have at it.

Lastly, that combee honey must have a crazy strong smell if it's still capable of attracting the hive even while frozen. Freezing things tends to reduce how much smell particles diffuses from the surface.
