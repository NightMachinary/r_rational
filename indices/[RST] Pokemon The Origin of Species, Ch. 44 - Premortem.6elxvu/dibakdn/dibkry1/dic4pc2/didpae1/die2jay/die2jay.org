I got a bit carried away thinking through this reply. To be honest, a nagging part of my brain insisted that "Red is the protag" was my real underlying justification, but I tried to think through it better than that.

My theory is that Giovanni would consider Blue somewhat of a known quantity. The Oaks are a part of the Kantoan elite alongside the gym leaders, so Giovanni should be generally familiar with Blue's personality. And I think most importantly, he must already know that Blue is dark, if Giovanni ever had a psychic with him like he did when talking with Leaf (assuming that is close to correct). If Blue thought about it this way, he would come to the conclusion that Giovanni knows, and he wouldn't want that "secret" getting out and tarnishing his image. Blue isn't the story's rationalist protagonist, but I would imagine some-one with Blue's championship​ aspirations would know at least bit about politics/political etiquette​, and throwing a fit because a gym leader "encouraged" an awkward girl to befriend you at a bike shop hardly seems worth the risk of being labeled "Dark" by the tabloids. Maybe he'd almost consider it a compliment that a leader was paying attention to him. Also, like you said, Blue is famous-ish, so Giovanni can do some diagnostic work based on his performance in battles or regular old rumor mill type stuff. I just don't really see what surprising or enlightening​ information this hypothetical fall-spy would get from Blue, unless Blue acts incredibly rashly when he finds out. Which, if your enemy is an idiot, it doesn't seem worth the time or money to confirm that. Burning your trust with a potential champion might be a bad idea for a secret crimelord, but if Blue really becomes a problem, well, powerful trainers die every day.

There are narratively obvious reasons why Giovanni might want to gauge Leaf's reaction. The only unique backlash I can think of is her going forward with the renegade story, but that seems easy to predict, so Giovanni would only go through with it if the renegade story going public was not a big deal any more, or he knew how to minimize/handle the fall out.

This leads us to Red. He is the least known person in the group by Giovanni. And that must bother Giovanni, since he is a travelling companion of that meddling kid-detective and THE Blue Oak. He would feel like the odd one out to me. I'm not sure that Red has been particularly cautious/secretive about his psychic training, so if Giovanni was curious I bet he could find out a lot about Red by gathering intel from his teachers. Giovanni also knows that Red follows his blog, and even once sent a reply to the kid. He is seeding some kind of relationship there I think. And if he is the rational foil to Red's protagonist, I would think that him challenging Red with a multilayered self-betraying deception would be a interesting way to get that seed to grow.

Of course, all of this is assuming Aiko is some kind of plant or spy or something, and also Giovanni is the one setting it up. I'm not sure I'm convinced that is what's happening though. Simplest solution is that she is just a person with some awkward jealousy and sense of inferiority around the main crew.
