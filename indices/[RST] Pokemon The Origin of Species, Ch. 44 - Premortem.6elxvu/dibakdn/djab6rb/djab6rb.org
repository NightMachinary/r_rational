I'm assuming she's from the Koga Family in some capacity. I feel it will be more clear how depending on what we learn about her adaptability to lie and how the scene with her father plays out.

This idea is mostly based on her description: "She has an angular impish face that takes in the room all at once," "Black hair cut short," being similar to Janine/Anzu's description: "The young woman's short purple hair is drawn back, making the clean angles of her face dark" Along with similar descriptions for leader Koga: "So severe and cold, his face sharp like hers"

And manurisms, she touches her forhead to the ground in a bow when she's accepted into the group. While the world came from much of japanese culture, I feel that a gesture such as that would more likely come from a family based in tradition such as the Kogas. (As shown in the end of the second interlude. She seems well brought up in many regards, but looking for her own anonymity.

Though that's mostly only clear because of the second interlude, no reason the trio would guess this with the information present to them.
