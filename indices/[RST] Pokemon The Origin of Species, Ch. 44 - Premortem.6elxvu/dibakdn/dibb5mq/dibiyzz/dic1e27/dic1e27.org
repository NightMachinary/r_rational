Nah guys, remember, this is the rational subreddit. Once you eliminate the impossible, what ever remains must be the truth. Clearly Mewtwo escaped, contacted the time travelling pokemon Celebi and struck a deal. Mewtwo was sent a bajillion years back in time where he met Mew. Mew then taught Mewtwo not only how to use recover, but the shapeshift as well.

Mewtwo than travelled forwards in time, and shapeshifted in to human male, after which he then fathered a girl named Aiko. The reason he doesn't want Aiko to become a trainer is because he's afraid she'll learn her half pokemon, half human pokemorph nature in a freak pokeball accident.
