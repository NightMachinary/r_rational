Just checking your math here.

#+begin_quote
  For kinetic energy: KE = 1/2mv^{2}

  In SI units: J = 1/2(1kg)(1m/s)^{2}

  m = 5.5 kg (from Bulbapedia)

  v = 5km/min = 5000m/min = 83.33...m/s

  v^{2} = (83.33...m/s)^{2} = 6944.44...m/s

  joules = 1/2(5.5kg)(6944.44...m/s) = 19097.222...

So, that combee is travelling with a little over 19kJ of kinetic energy. Let's assume that it maintains its 5km/min speed for its entire 6km typical range (or, for 72 seconds). Then that also assumes it's replacing any energy lost to air resistance/drag. I'm going to stop my speculation here, because a combee does not look very aerodynamic...

19kJ is enough energy to raise the temperature of a liter of water by about 15.83C.

[[http://genesisnow.com.au/reference/energy-examples/][This source]] gives an example of 10kJ of continuous usage as "large electric water heater, peak demand of medium-large home."

Perhaps most telling example is comparing that to typical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy][muzzle energies]]. A high-powered sniper rifle outputs about 15kJ, whereas an anti-tank/anti-aircraft round usually has closer to 30kJ. So, really, it's a good thing Combee (unlike Beedrill) can't learn Take Down.
