Damn that's fast. I guess base stats aren't the way!

Though, interestingly, if you add up all the boosts Pidgeot can give itself (agility x3 + tailwind = an 8x multiplier), and use its old base stats with the Combee method... you get a top speed of nearly 2000mph, which is about Mach 2.5

But it feels pretty wrong to suggest that Pidgeot is faster than Ninjask. Unless the speed stat is about agility rather than top speed, I suppose.
