I bet you could do interesting things with the pokeball technology. You could fill one up with explosives, pressurized water, napalm, etc and chuck/shoot it at rampaging pokemon, or maybe a truckload of magnesium/aluminum for a flashbang on steroids.

EDIT: Maybe teleport one of these canisters right next to whatever you want to hit?
