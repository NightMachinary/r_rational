  I imagine Red spent a ridiculous amount of time to come up with 27! (Counting 0. Basics: Bags, Phones, Wallets)

  As far as giving credit goes, my deviant art is full of crap drawings from high school. I really need to update it, but until I do I don't want people checking out my old work. :/

No worries, if you ever do let me know and I'll add a link! Thanks again, it's the best /real/ first fanart I could have hoped for :) I somehow feel like an actual web serial author now, strange as that seems after writing this for almost 4 years XD
