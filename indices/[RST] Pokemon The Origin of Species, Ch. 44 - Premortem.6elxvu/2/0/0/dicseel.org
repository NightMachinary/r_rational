The alliterations were fun! unfortunately those were all I could think of. Filter Face-masks, Reachable Repels, Shock Safety Sticks, Smear Sunscreen... I imagine Red spent a ridiculous amount of time to come up with 27! (Counting 0. Basics: Bags, Phones, Wallets)

I'm glad you like the Pichu! I've always liked the realistic style pokemon, and it's been a while since I've tried to draw one. It was a fun excuse to test out a different art style.

As far as giving credit goes, my deviant art is full of crap drawings from high school. I really need to update it, but until I do I don't want people checking out my old work. :/
