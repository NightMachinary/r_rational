I was thinking perhaps Giovanni intentionally sent a terrible spy to see how many meta levels the party (mainly Red and Leaf) are thinking on. Do they go "Ah shucks I can't believe Giovanni is spying on us, how mean," or "Wow, what an obvious spy, Giovanni doesn't know what he is doing," or "Giovanni knowingly sent this obvious spy after us to gauge our reaction to the idea that Giovanni is spying on us." Any situation ends up with either them underestimating Giovanni's intelligence, a positive, or respecting him more while trusting other people less, also a positive.
