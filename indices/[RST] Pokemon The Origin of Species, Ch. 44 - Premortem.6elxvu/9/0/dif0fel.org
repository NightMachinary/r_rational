  Was this an intention effect that you subverted with the arrival of Prof. Oak & co., or was that a misreading on my part?

Maybe this won't make sense, but yes, I was aware it was building suspense and wanted to tie it into the more immediate suspense of them hearing something right afterward, even though it was an unrelated and different type of suspense and feels a bit like cheating :)

  That said, I think you were a bit blunt with the "hints" about her character.

Yeah, I'm a bit worried about this too. I might try to tone it down a bit, but honestly it just felt like it would be odd if Red just learned a strategy for predicting bad outcomes and failed to consider her so fully.
