In the last scene, where Red is practicing with his rock and the rest or talking, I had the impression of suspense. Perhaps the feeling was anticipation, and I had the hypothesis that there would be some drama upon the revelation that Red is psychic. Was this an intentional effect that you subverted with the arrival of Prof. Oak & co., or was that a misreading on my part? If the latter, and your intended emotional response was different, I think it may be worth examining what gave me that impression. If the former, nice job :).

Anyway, more broadly, I can see the addition of this character as being sort of amateurish, or as being a warning sign in some other fic, but right now I am pretty interested to see how the story changes if she is not just a brief subplot, but a new mainstay of the story. That said, I think you were a bit blunt with the "hints" about her character. If she is going to be around for a while, I recommend making Red's observations more subtle (addressing them in narration but not his thought, making the things he is noticing more subtle, reducing the number, or adding things that paint a less unified picture), or else revealing whatever the deal is very shortly. I was already getting not-quite-annoyed by what felt like it was supposed to be subtle foreshadowing, and I think the effect would be greatly amplified should things continue in the same vein. Even if the reveal is coming in the next chapter, it may be worth another look at this.

(If you haven't noticed, I haven't learned her name yet. Though I was referring to Leaf as "Green" for some time.)

Looking forward to how this changes the shape of the story!
