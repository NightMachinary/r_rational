I guess a tailwind (and other forms of raw speed) helps the pokemon make its attack more quickly after it responds.

Speed would be 1/(reaction time + travel time) or something like that.

The one thing that wouldn't fit /that/ would be Dugtrio. The Pokedex says it travels at 60 kilometers per hour, which is pretty slow for its base 120 speed...
