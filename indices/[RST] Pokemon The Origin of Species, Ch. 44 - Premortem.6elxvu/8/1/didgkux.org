honestly looking at pics it looks like combees wear parts of their hive as a shell. when a lot of combees gather together in one place that literally forms a mobile hive of sorts kinda. that's also probably why vespiquen can release combees from her body with her order moves. upon evolution her shell moves down and becomes big enough to contain multiple very young combee. maybe when they're flying fast enough they shed the hive-shell and it grows back later.
