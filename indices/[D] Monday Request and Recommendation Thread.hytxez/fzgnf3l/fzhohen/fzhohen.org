If you're fine with fanfiction:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]], is as it sounds. Hogwarts is (and has been for a while) a magical battle school. Almost a reinterpretation of Ender's Game in hogwarts.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]], describes a pretty dark timeline where hogwarts (and wizarding society) is incredibly stratified and students have to fight and maneuver for power and prestige.

From memory, both of those recommendations have some decent wargaming. It's been a while so I can't vouch for their rationality, but I have the impression they were intelligently written.
