Transcendent Humanity is a good fic. While it does have a much more advances Humanity, it actually handles that well (unlike other cringe-worthy fics like the one where the humans brought a diplomatic gift to the council for their introduction to the galaxy, and it was the Bill of Rights).

My main gripe with it is that the Voice kind of magical, and it was human-exclusive - even if individuals from other species moved to their core and adopted their value,s they still wouldn't be included.
