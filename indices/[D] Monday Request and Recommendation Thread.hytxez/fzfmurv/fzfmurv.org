I recently read and liked some Mass Effect fanfiction, and I liked the setting of humans in isolation for the Citadel Council, thus having a different tech tree, capabilities and knowledge. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8949791/1/Mass-Effect-The-First-War]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098732/1/Mass-Effect-End-of-Days]] (EDIT: Transcendent was pretty well written; End of Days was OK; I don't really recommend The First War, it just fits the theme).

However, both these examples (and others) make humanity's tech way, way better than the rest. Are there any stories with a similar concept, but where humanity's tech is just different, better in some cases, but worse it others.
