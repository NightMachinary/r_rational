[probably butchering this plot....]

The StarCraft universe has Protoss and Zerg, which were both created by a forerunner species to be sort of in balance.\\
[Protoss being like blue scifi Predators, but more complex, cooler and hivemind-internet-connected snooty warrior individualists and Zerg being like the aliens from Alien, but more complex and cooler and also hivemind-controlled-collectivist insects with organic spaceships and stuff]

And then we have the Terrans, which are a bunch of scrappy human colonist with psychic abilities, who got deported by the UN into space somewhere far away, because psychic people are trouble and Australia was already full.\\
[and Terrans being humans, scrappy, heavily mechanized pioneers and not hiveminded tend to be more inventive, than those species mainly created for swag, making them able to compete and carve out their place]\\
Kinda works.
