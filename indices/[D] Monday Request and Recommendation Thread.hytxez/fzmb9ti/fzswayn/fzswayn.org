I remember the /Zetman/ manga being all kinds of good. If I recall correctly, it had a transforming street-smart hero and the ensuing conflict with an excessively upright man who became a hero because he disliked his methods. Don't remember what the actual plot was about but it had a dark feeling. Haven't seen the anime but I've read that it diverges in a bad way from the manga.

I hesitate to recommend it but you might like /Jojo's Bizzare Adventure/. It is actually pretty good despite seeming to lack seriousness at times, venturing into respectable tragedy territory.
