A lot of fanfiction arises out of a need to "fix" things. Most fanfiction is written and consumed by teenagers. Because teenagers are horny and sex obsessed, most of the ones who have problems with a work tend to have problems with the relationships depicted. This is why most of fanfiction ends up being something fairly similar to canon, except with new, "fixed," relationships.
