Looking for a story that has some SCP type horror or setting. Unexplainable eldtrich monstrosities, pulsing walls of flesh, that kind of thing.

Could have sworn I saw a recommendation about one recently that involved the protagonist getting sent to a Victorian age place with lovecraftian horrors...? But I can't find it again.
