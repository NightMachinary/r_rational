Seconding [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.301286/][Cloudy Path]], with the caveat that it is and remains a street-level story. Most of the time, when people hear Supreme Commander, they expect huge stomping death robots after five chapters. That's not happening in ACP.

Alternatively, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/terminus-worm-au.498887/][Terminus]] builds off of Wildbow's WoG that if Taylor hadn't managed to kill Tagg and Alexandria, Cauldron would have snatched her up before she'd entered the Birdcage and used her a troubleshooter like Contessa. She's assigned to a team of C53s and told to make them work as a team. This fic very much shows Taylor's stubborn, uncompromising side.
