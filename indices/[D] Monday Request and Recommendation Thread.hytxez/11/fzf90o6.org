I would like to recommand a book, but I am not sure.

Qualityland by Marc-Uwe Kling [[https://www.amazon.de/dp/1409191133/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_rrWhFbZV5SPNR]]

Here is why I am not sure: -its not realy rational, more a dystopian satyrical society extrapolation and critique -I dont know the english version, only the german original -I didnt read it, only heard the audiobook. Its done by the author himself, who is realy, realy good at this.

The author studied philosophy and is very political, so some of the characters say some remarkable stuff. But be warned. I gather most americans would consider him an dangerous communist. From german standpoint he is somewhat left.

P.S.: I am writing on my mobile, english is not my first language, I cant format shit in reddit
