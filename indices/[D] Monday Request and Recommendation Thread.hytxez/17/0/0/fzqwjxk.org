Correct, that's it. Thanks a lot!

I've read it up until the latest translated chapter as of May 2020 and I'm glad to see a few new chapters have been released since then. The focus on the exploration of MC's ability is frankly rare in shounen and I was very glad to see it in this work.

Edit: As I was reading the update, I got reminded of another side of this work that I loved. One of the physically strongest characters who gets the harshest match-ups is a girl. I love me some badass girls in a shounen that are treated seriously (looking at you, /Jump/'s golden trio).
