I cannot recommend the /Young Wizards/ series highly enough - as well as being generally excellent, the magic system is /just/ defined enough to avoid 'fridge logic' but soft enough to let you think about theme or cost rather than trying to work out exploits.

IMO it really nails both the humanist sensibilities of rationalist fiction, as well as the sense that the universe is basically a lawful thing subject to cause and effect - even with magic available. Doesn't do the "teach you to think" thing in the usual rationalist way, but shows you what people feel when doing good instead.

Also recommended by HPMOR on my advice, so...
