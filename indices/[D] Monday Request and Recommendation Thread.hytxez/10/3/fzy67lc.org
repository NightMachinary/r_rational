AO3 is female dominated, while spacebattles and ffn are male dominated and more balanced respectively. I think. Relatively speaking, women are more interested in relationships and sex while men are more interested in power and plot.

If you go to Harry Potter on AO3 and search by kudos, you get 10 Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter stories before the first non Draco/Potter story. Of course, that's just Riddle/Potter. It's just slash as far as you care to look.

On FFN, the highest ranked story in the HP fandom by favorites is some angsty Granger/Malfoy story. But second is HPMOR! And then we have a whole bunch of other plot fics. No visible slash of any kind. Main trend is Potter getting stronger somehow, Ron-bashing and so on.

On spacebattles, using first message reaction count as a crude mechanism for popularity, we're engulfed in a sea of Worm. If you do it by reply count, then it's Gamer, self-inserts, Worm and power-fantasy generally. Nearly all relationships are heterosexual as far as I can tell.
