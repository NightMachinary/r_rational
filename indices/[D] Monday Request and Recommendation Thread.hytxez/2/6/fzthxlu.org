I recently got into the works of Morgenstern--[[http://bloodismine.com/][Blood is Mine]] and [[http://mda.wtf][My Delirium Alcazar]]. There's all kinds of weird shit in there, including body horror, eldritch gods, strange magyyks, and futuristic technology.

They're set in the same future Earth and BiM precedes MDA, but they can be read in any order.
