Yeah I thought the main characters were fucking assholes. Given immortality for three thousand years how the fuck haven't you improved anything? Just going around saving people one by one? Really? For that matter, why the fuck didn't they kill Hitler? Or stop wars by assassinating leaders? The story could have been a war of immortals fighting each other throughout history and that's why the world is fucked up as it is today. Also I agree, how the hell aren't any of them rich or have contacts? It would have been cool if a villain immortal had a cult or something. They made the main character a goddess in the past.
