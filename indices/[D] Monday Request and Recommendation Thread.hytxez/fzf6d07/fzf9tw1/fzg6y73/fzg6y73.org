  Or, indeed, is what the CIA guy talking about statistically significant, and if so, how?

Out of the entire loosely thought out movie, this was my biggest headscratcher.

So far as we've been told, they've just been running around saving people mostly at random for centuries, but we're told that the biggest benefits are the butterfly effect s from descendents of those people. Why? How? By pure random chance it should be about as likely that they'd save, say, Hitler's grandmother than the ancestor of some great doctor. Or at least in whatever ratio such people exist in the general population.

Are we supposed to believe that there is some guiding force nudging them to targets with the greatest future utility? The same on responsible for their unexplained regeneration?

Maybe it will be explained if there's some future sequel, but it was very noticeable at first glance.
