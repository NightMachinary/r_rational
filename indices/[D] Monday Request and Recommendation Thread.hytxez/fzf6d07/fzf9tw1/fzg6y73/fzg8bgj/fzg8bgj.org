I think that the board was /supposed/ to show that they actually saved significant individuals directly, or helped specific conflicts end a certain way. However, it didn't spend enough time to be able to see it, so the point wasn't really made. We didn't see the evidence and they didn't talk about it specifically enough to figure out. So we are left just needing to take their word that "they've made a difference", which was frustrating.
