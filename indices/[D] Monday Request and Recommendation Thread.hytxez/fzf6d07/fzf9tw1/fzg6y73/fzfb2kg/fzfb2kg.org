Yeah, the Quynh thing was perhaps the only real plot hole. I agree that realistically she shouldn't have been stuck in there that long, but the implication I took from the dreams were that the dreams were of things /currently happening/, so the fact that Nile dreamed it in the movie meant she was still stuck there. And even if dreams aren't always of current events, they state explictely that the dream of each other when they are apart. If she has been free for however long, why have none of them dreamed of her and seen her and what she is doing? In either situation (escaped a long time ago or just recently escaped), there is something that doesn't quite fit.

Absoltely agree that there are at on of hooks for good fan-fic though. Hopefully we get it.
