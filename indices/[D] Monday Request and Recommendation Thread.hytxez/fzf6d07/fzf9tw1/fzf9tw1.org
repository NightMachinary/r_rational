The movie is extremely strong fan-fic bait, because it left so very many plot hooks poking out in all directions.

For example, the team kills the /CEO/ of the pharma corp. But they do not collect any of the tissue samples taken, and they leave the head scientist alive! If there is a scientific mechanism behind their immortality, that should be enough to get started.

Or Quynh - There is no way medieval steels held her in saltwater for more than a couple of decades. So what has she been up to for the past 400 and change years?

Or, indeed, is what the CIA guy talking about statistically significant, and if so, /how/?

Note that this does not even necessarily have to be divine or precognitive intervention. Perhaps everyone they interact with much ends up having super healthy children because their healing factor is mildly contagious, and well, a group of children with perfect health is going to have a seriously outsized impact on the world throughout most of history just by being more generally capable.

Ect. I think most of this is deliberate sequel hooks, but it hooks fandom too, precisely because it does not tie up things very neatly.
