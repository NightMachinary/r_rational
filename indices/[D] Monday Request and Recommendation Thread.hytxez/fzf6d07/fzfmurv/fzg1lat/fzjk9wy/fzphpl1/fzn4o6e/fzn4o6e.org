Oh! I really enjoyed Transcendent Humanity. I think the overall way the conflict was resolved was really excellent, and the use (and eventual outcome) of what I'm now calling "just pandora box it" has, I think, broad, in-your-life philosophical and emotional possibilities.

Basically: If you can't handle something *now*, put it in your (metaphorical) Pandora Box. Then when you're doing better - or need ultimate hail-mary's - open your Pandora Box.
