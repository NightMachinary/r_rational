I'm pretty sure that you are talking about /Battle 5 Seconds After Meeting/. It's been recomended on this sub a few times, for example:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gm33op/comment/fr1w29p]]

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a7tvgb/rt_battle_in_5_seconds_after_meeting/]]

From what I've seen, people tend to recomend it here because of the strategic mindset of the main character. Fair warning though, it's the type of Shonen manga that contains a lot of male-oriented fanservice, including upskirt panty shots of young girls.
