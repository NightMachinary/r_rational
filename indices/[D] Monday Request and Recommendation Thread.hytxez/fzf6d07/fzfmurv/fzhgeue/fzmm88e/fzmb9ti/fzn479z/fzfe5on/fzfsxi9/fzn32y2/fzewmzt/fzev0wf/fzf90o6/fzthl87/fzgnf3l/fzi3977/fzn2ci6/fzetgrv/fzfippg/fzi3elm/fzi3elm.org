[[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/][Pale]], Wildbow's latest webserial.

Fantasy, three main characters, 250k words and adding roughly 15k per week, not on RR/tvtropes/topwebfiction.

Is it /rational/? No.

The world is really insistent on the point that it is a soft magic system, softer than even Harry Potter. It works off the basis that as long as you can convince the Spirits which make up everything that you should be allowed to do something, then you can do that thing.\\
However, by and large the rules are observed. Others and Practitioners can't lie without taking a hit to their power or their very existence, which means they usually don't. Most Others only have a couple of tricks that they use in really creative ways. People's capabilities only change in response to what they do and what happens to them, not for plot convenience.\\
The main characters often make not optimal decisions, because they are thirteen years old. These actions usually come with their logical consequences.
