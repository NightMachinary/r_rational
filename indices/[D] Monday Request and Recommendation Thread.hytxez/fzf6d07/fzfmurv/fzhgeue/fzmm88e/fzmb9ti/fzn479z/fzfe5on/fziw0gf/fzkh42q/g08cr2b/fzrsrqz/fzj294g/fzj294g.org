Love the effort you've put in on the post. Have to say I have a soft spot for the maids in re:zero. They're definitely a little...erratic...in their characterization but they're at least entertaining. I also like the weird lord of the manor, though he's rarely onscreen. Beyond that only the old guy at the bar is mildly interesting, the other women are extremely flat characters.
