I'm looking for either really any genre or media that has like something similar to the Battle School of Ender's game. I really like the constrained conflict that generally has lower stakes but is also something that is moderately optimized for in context of the world building. I've read Practical Guide to Evil, HPMOR, there's some of this in like Raymond E. Feists Magician. Just to reiterate I like the small scale wargames type deal and would enjoy some kind of rationality but would take just about anything that has more military fic-lite type feeling.
