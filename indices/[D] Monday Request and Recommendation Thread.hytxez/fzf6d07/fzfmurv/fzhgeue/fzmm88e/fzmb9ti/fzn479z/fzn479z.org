Started (and caught up with) [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33054/soulforged-dungeoneer][Soulforged Dungeoneer]]. LITRPG, urban fantasy, rational adjacent.

Basic idea of the setting is it's this world, but there're dungeons made by... things not human, and you can go in, level up and stuff. Your powers work outside the dungeon, but the regular world doesn't give XP or the like. Entirely from the perspective of one character, and there's not many other characters (so far, although that's rapidly changing).

I'd call it rational-adjacent. Characters (mostly) have distinct internal realities, the MC is solidly established in characterization, and the world is flirting with "large consequences" sort of things. Probably one of the first works by this author, and I'm excited to see where it goes.
