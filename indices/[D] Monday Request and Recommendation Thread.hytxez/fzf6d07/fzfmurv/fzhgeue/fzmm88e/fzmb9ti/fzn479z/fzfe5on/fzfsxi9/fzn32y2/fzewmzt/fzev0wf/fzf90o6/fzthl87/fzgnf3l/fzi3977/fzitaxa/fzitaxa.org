Have you checked out /Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell/?

It's about two magicians starting a Renaissance in magic in 19th century England. There are "rules" for magic, but most of it is opaque to the readers and there is enough faefolk and other weird shit that it can be considered /soft/.

It's reasonable, I would hesitate to call it rational exactly but it is consistent and has excellent worldbuilding and prose.
