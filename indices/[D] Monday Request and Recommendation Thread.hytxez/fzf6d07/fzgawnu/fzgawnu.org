A book with a not /entirely/ unrelated plot - [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332271-the-incrementalists][The Incrementalists, by Brust and White]]. It's not as well written as Brust's solo efforts, IMO, but still fairly readable. The ostensible background plot about immortals incrementally doing good takes a back seat to interpersonal drama and conflict that is not really about the background elements, sadly.
