I watched the Old Guard on Netflix this weekend, and while it was a good movie, it was also /infuriating/.

Spoilers:You had a group of immortals who were trying to make the world better by.....acting as an elite special forces group. At te end of the movie, it's stated that hey /are/ actually making adifference (although they don't spend enough time on that consiparicy board to show how exactly), but how on earth is it even in the realm of possibility that they are doing as much good as they could be doing by getting rich and providing malaria nets. And yeah, the BigPharma CEO is obviously a bad guy.....but they didn't actually explain why they were /in principle/ opposed to medical testing to try and figure out why they were immortal, as opposed to being opposed to that one dude who was clearly a psychopath

Again, an enjoyable overall movie with good action scenes, interesting characters, etc, and no major plot holes per se, it's just that hte characters were complete /idiots/ and it was infuriating. I'd love to read a rational version that tries to explore how much good such a group could realistically do by acting intelligently. It's probably less than optimistic people would imagine (changing the world is hard), but it's probably a hell of a lot more than the movie versions were doing.
