The Reckoners by Brandon Sanderson is a great series, albeit perhaps not technically superhero as the protagonist group is notably not powered? Quite rational, and superpower system has coherent internal rules (as you might expect from a sanderson work).

One Punch Man is fun and not aimed at kids but very much not rational and does not have a common meta origin for powers. Worth reading anyway IMO, or watching since the Anime is a fairly decent adaptation, but it's in many ways a parody.

The Arrowverse is for the most part pretty solid place to start; none of the ones I've seen require you to be familiar with the rest of DC, or with the other parts of the arrowverse, to start a given series.

Batman 1939 is a /fantastic/ fanfiction series. I would heartily reccomend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/batman-1939-the-dangers-of-being-cold.376659/]] and all of its sequels to pretty much anyone.
