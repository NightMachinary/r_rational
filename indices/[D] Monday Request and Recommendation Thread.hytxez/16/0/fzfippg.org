Those are a lot of conditions, so my recommendations will be slightly off the beaten path. The first two meet the POV condition, the last two I've watned to rec for awhile and so are more directed out at the rest of the sub.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber][Chronicles of Amber]] --- Plot synopsis would be a spoiler for the first book. Fast-paced and interesting premise. Feel free to stop after the first five books, which are self-contained.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_for_the_Morning_Glory][One for the Morning Glory]] --- Rational adjacent. In a fantasy kingdom, characters know they're living out stories. Played for humor and eventually pathos. First few pages alone are worth the price of admission, in my opinion. Memorable. The invented vocabulary and malapropisms are a lot of fun if you enjoy that kind of thing. "The Maid might have had something to say, but it was drowned out in the wicked skrang! of the Captain's escree coming out of its scabbard and the shriek of its slicing air."
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthsea][Earthsea]] --- Very short books, almost novellas, about a wizard in an archipelago. The scope of his actions is small but kind of universal at the same time. Meditative, good quarantine reads. Spare and beautiful prose. You may come up with words like "humanistic" when you describe it later. Rewards rereading.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Nothing][Prince of Nothing]] --- If you want a palette cleanser after Earthsea (too much humanism), this is probably it. Rational. These books are scary like Stross's *Accelerando* is scary, except instead of "turn all matter into computronium" it's "hell is literally real and morality is based on consensus." There is a rationalist munchkin-type character who takes a bit of a backseat after ramping up but is replaced by some similar characters. This isn't grimdark, it's vantablack. Intellectually rewarding, Bakker is a trained philosopher and the magic system and metaphysics are based on ancient Greek concepts like the onta, paradox, analogy, and logos, plus an additional system based on biophysics. Challenging.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen][Malazan Book of the Fallen]] --- If worldbuilding is your thing, and you can tolerate a puzzle. I made a post about the magic system in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/84iybe/confusion_on_gardens_of_the_moon/dvq6meq/][thread awhile back]]. If Bakker is based on philosophy and Martin is based on history, then this is anthropology. Big focus on gods, cultural clashes, and the distant past affecting the present. Nothing is explained, so put on your hermaneutics hat and get out there. The first book isn't that great, I recommend starting with *Deadhouse Gates*. You might feel like you're missing some essential context reading that---you're not, nothing is explicitly explained, so just work on figuring things out yourself or, if you can't tolerate that, go to the wiki and gorge yourself. Series probably peaks in the middle, each book is self-contained. Somewhat (ok, very) inconsistent writing, with quotable quotes alternating with dross. This is a book to read if you like crazy fantasy stuff like a sword that imprisons souls, which go to a self-contained world to pull a giant cart, and on that giant cart, recursively, is the main world in which the sword resides, and all of this isn't really even that important to the setting and not a Godotian metaphor. Or a dude who destroyed a continent he ruled 100,000 years ago, and was cursed to walk the realms for all eternity and have all his works turn to ashes, and he's just kicking around as someone's second in command. Or an immortal dragon who shows up after thousands of years but, sorry, now it's the fantasy renaissance or whatever and you're going to get blown up by some guy named Fiddler with a grenade launcher.

I've got more, but I'm theoretically on the clock here.
