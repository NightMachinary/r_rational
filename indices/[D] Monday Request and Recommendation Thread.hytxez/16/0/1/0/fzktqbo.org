/Lord of Light/ is by the same author as Chronicles of Amber, and also worth reading.

And yeah, I don't think I've ever seen anything as dark as Prince of Nothing. Part of that is the sheer range of darkness. It's not just that the characters are bad, or the system they're living in is broken. It's /everything/. From the cosmology down to the individual characters. It's all just incredibly brutal. Which is not to say I don't recommend it, but it's probably the darkest thing you'll find to read.
