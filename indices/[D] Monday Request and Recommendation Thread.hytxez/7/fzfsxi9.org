[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/slouching-towards-nirvana-worm-my-hero-academia.863129/][Slouching Towards Nirvana]] is a Worm/My hero academia crossover where taylor is transmigrated to the MHA universe sharing a body with a girl whose quirk is able to let her to control spirits. The world building is phenomenal with this fanfic and the OCs the author introduce really expand to the world building as well. The author explains stuff about quirks and society that MHA glosses over. I would say it's a rationalist take on the MHA universe.
