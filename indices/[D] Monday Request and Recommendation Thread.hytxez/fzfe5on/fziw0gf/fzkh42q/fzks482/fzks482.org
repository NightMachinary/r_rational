A few more, in much more distilled format and also in random order:

- /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]]/ is a short, sad, and well-written one-shot focusing on the desperation of being stuck in a loop. HP fic. The only thing on this list that I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone.

- /[[https://myanimelist.net/anime/2236/Toki_wo_Kakeru_Shoujo][The Girl Who Leapt Through Time]]/, or more like /The Girl Who Didn't Do Anything Cool About Her Timeloop Powers/. It's based on a very old (1965, I think) novel, so there are no fresh ideas compared to other entries on both lists. Still, if you haven't seen it, it's worth a watch.

- /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21775378][a lesson you should heed (try, try again)]]/ is a very short, angsty BNHA fic where Izuku is stuck in a time loop. It's alright by fic standards.

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/The-Best-Night-Ever][/The Best Night Ever/]] is an old (pre-S3, I think) MLP fic which follows a very traditional plot of Doing Something Right to get out of the loop. It's very funny, but otherwise unremarkable.

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7761449/1/Children-of-the-Prophecy-ENGLISH-Version][Children of Prophecy]]/ is a long-ass Evangelion fic with a very cynical view on the time loop scenario. I dropped it rather early for the reason I can't remember, but it's well-written and has some interesting ideas.

- /[[https://store.steampowered.com/app/455820/Omensight_Definitive_Edition/][Omensight]]/ is a videogame where you play as a mythical being summoned to prevent the end of the world. To do so, you have the opportunity to relive the final day over and over again, trying different stuff. It's mostly action-y, but there's a mystery going on as well, since you need to interact with various characters to find the solution to the whole apocalypse conundrum. Still, time loop takes a back seat in favor of killing enemies with flashy combos. (The plot is rather tight, though!)

- I've heard /[[https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/][Outer Wilds]]/ is a good time loop story, but people consider this fact to be a spoiler. It's a fairly recent videogame.
