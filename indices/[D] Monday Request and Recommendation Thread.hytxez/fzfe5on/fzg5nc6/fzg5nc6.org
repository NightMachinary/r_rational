I remember quite liking [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]], by Eakin, who has also done some work in the Friendship is Optimal universe, and if that doesn't make it rational-adjacent, makes it at most 2 steps removed. The story also has [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/82419/a-stitch-in-time][two]] [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/112831/you-can-fight-fate][sequels]], and those are still timey-wimey, if no longer about the loop. ^{^{Disclaimer}} ^{^{that}} ^{^{I}} ^{^{had}} ^{^{different}} ^{^{standards}} ^{^{like}} ^{^{6}} ^{^{years}} ^{^{ago}} ^{^{when}} ^{^{I}} ^{^{read}} ^{^{them.}}
