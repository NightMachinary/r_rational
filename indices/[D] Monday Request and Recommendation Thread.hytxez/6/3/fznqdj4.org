[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-first-order-derivative-fsn.47581/]] is a fun fate stay night fanfic, time loop mechanics played straight. It's not totally lore compliant, but it does a better job than the vast majority of F/SN fics and was good enough that it didn't impact my reading noticably. Author's Description: An eccentric nerd finds himself stuck in a time loop after something weird happens down the street at Shirou Emiya's place. Tom Tomonaga doesn't know why he's repeating the same two weeks over and over again. He doesn't know anything about magic, the secret world of mages, or the Grail War. But he'll have to learn if he wants to escape back into a world that makes sense, all while arguing with a pushy voice inside of his own head and discovering how many ways there are to die (spoiler: they all suck.) Also features science in an absurd universe, frequent psychological trauma, and -- oh yeah -- the end of the world.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/grounded-lightning-an-azula-timeloop-atla.844985/]] is an ATLA timeloop centered around Azula, with the issue that despite her many chances her approach to problems is very much her own. It's not quite as good as the others listed but I'd still reccomend it if you're familiar with ATLA. Author's Description:It should have been one of the best days of Azula's life. She'd succeeded where dear Zuzu had failed again and again, single handedly staged a coup against Ba Sing Se, and struck the Avatar down with lightning. That was before she felt the tell-tale static that came with more lightning, this time not her own. Now she's stuck in a stupid time loop for Agni knows why.

Puella Magi Madoka Magica is this and is really good - one of my favorite works of fiction of all time - but it's not from the perspective of the looper. Rational to rational adjacent, also very good at giving you a misleading impression of what it's about. There's also some fanfic set during the series' time frame that covers this but most don't do it nearly as well; I can reccomend some if you want it but I'd only advise that if you like Madoka.

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya has one of these (the arc in question is called endless 8); the series itself is worth watching imo but fair warning the timeloop is not all of it and is a far bit in. Most notable for the sheer sense of scale it gives and how it sells that scale; again, the person maintaining memories across loops is not the veiwpoint character.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time]] Technically, this is just repeated timetravel, and not an actual timeloop. Practically, it's not far off. It's rational, has smart characters, good timetravel mechanics, intelligent use of timetravel... I could gush about this for a while. Author's Desription: Kyle Reese has traveled backwards in time, not to save Sarah Connor, but to help her rewrite the faulty utility function of Skynet. Together, it's possible that they might avert Judgment Day and save the world from nuclear Armageddon - and hopefully create a utopia ruled over by an AI god in the process. Fully completed. Diverges wildly from canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7523099/1/The-Best-Night-Ever]] An MLP timeloop fic. Not really rational, but solidly written and with an ejoyable take on non main characters from MLP. Author's Description: Prince Blueblood thought the Grand Galloping Gala was over. He thought he could just go to sleep and put it behind him. He never expected to be reliving the same disaster of a day, over and over... and over.
