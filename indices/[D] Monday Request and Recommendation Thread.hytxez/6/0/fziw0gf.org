My time to shine! I'm a huge sucker for time loop stories, and here are some random recommendations in no particular order!

--------------

* [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]]
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: hard-reset
  :END:
*Fanfiction*.

*Fandom*: MLP.

*Length*: 36k+ words. [✓] Completed.

*Gen/Femslash*. There's a whole plot point of the main character getting out of the closet, but no actual relationships.

*Author's description*: "Twilight isn't having a very good day. An experimental spell blew up in her face, an army of changelings is attacking Canterlot, and she just died. Yet somehow, it looks like it's going to keep going downhill from here. Given the chance to correct what's gone wrong, Twilight swears she's going to fix all this even if it kills her. Which it will. Frequently."

*The good:*

- Protagonist makes rational decisions for the most part and satisfyingly overcomes the problem at her +hands+ hooves, one step at a time.

- The story keeps the tension high but never makes the reader feel despair. There are genuinely hilarious and cathartic parts.

- The writing style is decent.

*The bad:*

- The first chapter is very weak compared to the rest, and some events in the last chapter feel forced.

- The fact that protagonist is remarkably intelligent and fueled by OCD in canon is taken to the extreme here. Generally, keeping everyone 100% normal and in character seemingly wasn't the author's top priority.

*The ugly (aka: trigger warnings):*

- It's MLP fanfiction.

- There's some F/F action (not very graphic, but still).

*Did I like it?:* [?] YES, BUT only the middle parts.

* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15348900][Tea with the Hatter (TGIF)]]
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tea-with-the-hatter-tgif
  :END:
*Fanfiction*.

*Fandom*: Marvel.

*Words*: 61k+. [✓] Completed.

*Slash*.

*Author's description:* "It's seven a.m., Thursday fourteenth November, 2013. It always is."

*The good:*

- A fantastic exploration of Groundhog loop PTSD both while the loop is active and especially after the characters are freed from it.

- Technobabble is more scientific than anything in the Marvel universe by a long shot; the author also incorporates magical elements in a smart way that makes sense.

- The characters are acting fairly smart and vigorously explore the ways to break the loop, but also take advantage of the loop mechanics.

- Tagged "enemies to quantum entangled particles."

*The bad:*

- The story gradually gets worse and the writing starts to get lazy. It slowly gets strong again as the plot and conflict drastically change by the last two chapters, but never so good as in the beginning.

*The ugly:*

- It's slash, even though very tame compared to what can be found on AO3.

- It requires at least some knowledge of the MCU to comprehend who are all these characters and why do they act the way they act.

*Did I like it?:* [✓] YES, though I would have preferred the same story as gen.

  :END:
*Fanfiction*.

*Fandom*: Harry Potter.

*Words*: 96k+. [✓] Completed.

*Gen/Het.* There are some het elements, but it's mostly gen.

*Author's description:* "A good day goes bad and then gets far worse than Severus could ever have imagined. Again and again and again."

*The good:*

- A magnificent, vivid writing style.

- The time loop here is very well explained and has consistent rules.

- It's the best horror I've read in my entire life, and that's not hyperbole. The darker ending is absolutely chilling and can easily keep one up at night with the mental image it creates.

*The bad:*

- It's very subjective, I know, but the whole story is "shit happens and there's nothing you can do." There's little to no progress in anything, from character development to problem-solving, and both endings don't feel satisfying at all.

- Either I'm too used to HPMoR characters, or everyone here is annoying and dull and slightly out of character, especially the secondary cast.

*The ugly:*

- The story is very, VERY old, and some of its parts don't hold very good fifteen years and two books later. Perhaps, the second "bad" thing I listed originated from this.

*Did I like it?:* [⨯] NO. It's objectively somewhere between good and great, but it's not my cup of tea.

* [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu][Re: Zero.]]
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: re-zero.
  :END:
*Anime series.*

*Length:* 25 episodes. [?] The season is complete, but the story is not.

*Gen/Het.* The MC's motivation is to get the girl, but most events have nothing to do with that.

My own *description*, as the MAL one is too long: "Guy named Subaru Natsuki gets transported into a fantasy world. He gets saved by a cute girl who is looking for her insignia. Subaru volunteers to help her with the search, but just as they locate the insignia, they get killed.

However, Subaru immediately reawakens, and it's the morning in a fantasy world again. He meets that cute girl once more, tries to help her and watches as history repeats itself."

*The good:*

- The story is fairly dark and dramatic; it explores trauma created by time loops, and how the main character deals with it. This also makes it a lot deeper and more uncompromising than any isekai anime out there.

- The animation is not unpleasant, there are not so many still frames and sakuga parts are cool.

*The bad:*

- The protagonist is not smart or resourceful. His victories come mostly from knowing the worst events in advance as he suffered through them (usually more than once).

- The supporting cast is incredibly bland. To be fair, I haven't finished Re: Zero, so I can't say if it adds any interesting characters very late into the story, but everyone so far is either boring, a walking cliché or get sudden characterization for the sake of characterization ("Empathize with this character, goddamnit!"). When your standard black-haired NEET of a protagonist is more enjoyable to watch than the inhabitants of another world, something is wrong.

- Soundtrack and general atmosphere feel uninspired and barely functional for the sense of dread the story tries to achieve.

*The ugly:*

- It's an isekai anime.

*Did I like it?:* [?] NO, BUT it could've been a lot worse. It's not a bad watch, just underwhelming for its premise.

These are off the top of my head, I can add more if these are not enough.

Also, if you have patience for /atrocious/ grammar, I'd recommend you check out [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][/Purple Days/]]. The story is great, but reading was such a slog, I dropped it fairly early after I checked out the later chapters and saw that grammar doesn't get any better.
