Magic is discovered, and causes the apocalypse.

The apocalypse does not stop. Magic talent is entirely random, and at the upper reaches strong enough that you basically do not have to answer to anyone (except stronger mages), you can fight entire armies. Since it is random, you get no dynasties, just random mage-warlords reigning for centuries until they kill themselves by accident or on purpose, get killed by a stronger mage, or go so weird they stop interacting with people.

The stories are set after literally hundreds of thousands of years of magelords fucking up the natural order and the heredity of everything that walks, crawls, flies, slithers and swims (Including homo-sapiens) in a really /millitantly/ egalitarian (and also just Millitant) republic that got founded when a particularly inventive mage figured out how to do cooperative casting.

Gorgeous worldbuilding, vivid characters.
