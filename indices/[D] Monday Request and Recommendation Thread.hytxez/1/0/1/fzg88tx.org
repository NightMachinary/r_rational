Just to add to your points, we have to consider how long it's going to take us to achieve interstellar travel. We would need some massive breakthroughs in nuclear physics, medicine or environmental engineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence. To start with, we'll probably need to develop nuclear fusion rockets if we want to travel at even 1% of lightspeed. Then, to have living humans arrive at the other end of the trip, we'll need to develop either a viable means of cryonic stasis or the ability to set up indefinitely self-sustaining arcologies. Finally, to be able to have those humans survive and proliferate long-term, we would need to send an unmanned ship to arrive first to deploy fully autonomous robots which can develop a self-reproducing production chain as well as setting up human habitats and food/water/power/air supply.

By the time we've developed all of that, we'd also probably be immensely technologically advanced in many other aspects. If you then consider how improbable it would be to even come close to an alien civilization with one our colonies, it's likely that by the time we do initiate first contact with a civilization we stumbled upon, we'd probably be sending out millions of colony ships every year and have a significant portion of the 250-500 billion stars in the Milky Way colonized. We'd be well-established as a Kardashev Type II civilization by that point. With that in mind, if an alien race makes first contact with us in the next few thousand years, they would probably have that same level of technological and economic development. If there's any kind of conflict after first contact, the civilization which had to do the traveling is probably going to be the one which wins.
