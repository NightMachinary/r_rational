That's actually pretty reasonable to assume for the Mass Effect universe, where the Reapers have made sure to guide all galactic species in a technological direction of their choosing. Perhaps they constructed the Mass Effect relays as a way to lead people towards a technological dead end, like how combustion engines can only ever get so efficient, no matter how much research you pour into it. Just with Mass Relay technology that limit isn't as easily derived as the Carnot efficiency limit, and leads most species to pour their energy into an already exhausted technology, instead of, say, vacuum energy.
