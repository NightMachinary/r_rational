I'm not aware of any, but to be honest, two interstallar civilizations meeting and having their tech levels be even /broadly/ comparable is incredibly unlikely. The more likely scenario is that one of the two /dramatically/ outlcasses the other. Even the level of parity in transcendent humanity (haven't read the other one) is pretty unlikely.

Unless you imagine some hard cap on how technologically advanced it is possible to be, just being a few hundred years more advanced, let alone the likely thousands to millions of years that will separate alien civilizations would be a dramatic advantage.

Human history, despite the small sample sizes, is illustrative. Whenever 2 societies met that hadn't been in close contact for a long time (pretty much the only examples we have of this are colonial powers expanding around the globe), one of the two was dramatically more advanced, and that was a sepeaation in tech of usually just a couple hundred years, if that.

Of course, I'll agree that it makes for kind of a boring story if you are trying to write about conflict, but still.
