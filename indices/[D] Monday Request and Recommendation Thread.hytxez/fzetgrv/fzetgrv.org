I'm honestly not sure what I'm looking for so... recommend me any fantasy quest or story with no more than 2 main (heavy POV focus) characters and at least 300k words long that it's not in the first 30 pages of royal road active only ranking, the rational fic tvtropes or in top web fiction. for the record I've already been recommended:

- Forged destiny.
- Purple days.
- The games we play.
- Pokemon the origin of species.
- A thing of vikings.
- All works of brandon sanderson.
