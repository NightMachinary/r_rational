I don't think it's consensus, really. It's just the system postulated by the Bible (or most religious texts) taken 100% seriously. There's a god (or gods), they have opinions on morality, and those opinions determine the fate of your moral soul. And it turns out that those opinions are (intentionally, and quite realistically for the timeframe) massively and horrifyingly divergent from what the vast majority of readers believe. And for extra cosmic horror, if you're not damned, your soul gets eaten by the gods. The setup of the series is basically "what if the universe operated in a way that was fundamentally evil".
