Sure, but does she have a reason to be so wasteful and weird? Is there some internal thought that made her like the idea of marrying a bunch of men before killing them, on repeat, every day, for centuries on end? While supposedly also having the goal of listening to really /really/ entertaining stories for a literal millennium, yet not pursuing this lofty goal beyond her weird mass-marry-murder fetish routine?

Or is she just a story device and not an actual caracter with thoughts and goals?
