Hey, thanks for the response!

1: You're correct, though the water splashing him was meant to show that he didn't even really have control over such a small amount, unless you meant controlling the single drop. Honestly from a canon standpoint I have a harder time justifying the Styx dip than the lethe control, so it's not perfectly canon compliant.

2: Interesting, didn't really think about that. Kane Chronicles was the only other series I read outside the Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus, could be fun. I doubt I'll do that though.

3: Yeah... Dunno if I care about this enough to go fix it, but the perfectionist in me is considering it...

4: Why do you think this? Genuinely curious. I mean besides the obvious better character development etc., don't know what all I could tell by extending it out. I mean, probably could have some fun with the combat and whatnot. What more would you expect if I serialized this?

5: I know. It grates me. After a PJO reread I kinda forgot again until I started researching what Percy could do with the other rivers and read up on the Acheron. Didn't end up using the other rivers but still learned some cool stuff.

6: Huh, never read it. I figured the monsters could just in general smell demigods. It's the gods' "fault" because they don't intervene before their kids are slaughtered, they just let the monsters roam free. They were willing to destroy the Ophiotaurus in book 3 because it threatened them, but aren't willing to destroy the minotaur or cyclopes to protect their children. Shameful.

7: Thanks for your input!
