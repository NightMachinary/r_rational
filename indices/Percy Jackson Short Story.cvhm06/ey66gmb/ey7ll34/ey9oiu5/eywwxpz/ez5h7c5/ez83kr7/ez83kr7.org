The fights involving gods in PJO are, generally, lame. Exception: Artemis fighting Atlas, but both were limited in that fight; Gods vs Typhon, but again, Gods were seen from a distance in that fight and it took few pages.

Displaying god-like might is hard.

Also, having anything be able to bypass Achilles invincibility is lame. it's treated like a nearly absolute defense-- instead have a God tie Percy down, try to find it, try to bypass, not overpower it. Rock paper Scissors fighting>power level fighting.
