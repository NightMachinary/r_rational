5: I didn't know that. I remember being irritated at Percy losing the curse though, I thought it was kinda cheap narratively lol. I'm not sure which I prefer, but I think near-invulnerability is more interesting for munchkinry. It also explains why an arrow in the heel was actually fatal, unless there's another part of the myth i'm missing

6: Good point. Even then it's still messed up bc the gods are in charge of where their children go, though, which is why Zeus turned Thalia into a tree. He didn't want Hades to unfairly punish her. Furthermore, the gods could hardly expect their children to be loyal to them if they show 0 loyalty to their children.
