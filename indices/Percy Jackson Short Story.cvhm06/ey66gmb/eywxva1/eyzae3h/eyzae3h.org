2: The other series aren't too bad. I enjoyed the first two books of Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard. The ending of the third power was a bit weak, though. Sort of amusing, but it ran off of the Power of Friendship involving characters that, save for a few, weren't really around enough to care about. And so far, the Trials of Apollo have been enjoyable as well, and sort of interesting how they go into the apotheosis of the Roman Emperors.

4: Mostly because of the events mentioned in passing during Chapter Two (IIRC). They might not make an HPMOR or Pok√©mon: OoS looong serial, but they could be fleshed out into discrete narrative episodes (and or training montages) unto themselves.

5: Another thing that bothers me about "pop myth", which you may already know... is that in the oldest Greek legends, Achilles was never invulnerable, he was just that good. The earliest myth about his semi-immortality attributes it to a ritual involving anointment with ambrosia by day and burning in a fire by night, before it was interrupted by his father Peleus. That attribution of his invulnerability to the River Styx was done by a Roman poet (Statius). Which is fine... but then in the Son of Neptune, the curse of Achilles is referred to as a 'Greek blessing' to be washed away by the (New) River Tiber. I still find that ironic enough for days.

6: Fair enough. But suppose from the Olympian's point of view, they know full well that the Underworld, Elysium, and the Isle of the Blest exist (in addition to several other afterlives). Thus, they know that their children aren't annihilated, and could possibly see afterlife in Elysium as a step up from life on Earth. (Elysium / Isles are described as a virtue-based reward system, but most heroes in Greek myth end up there). Too much intervention to directly protect their children might even count as a violation of the 'Ancient Laws' (too bad those haven't been really explored in canon....). Meanwhile, the gods are willing to protect themselves because they are directly tied to the natural order / Western civilization; anything that directly threatens them could open the way for the Titans or Gigantes, which is the worst option for everyone.
