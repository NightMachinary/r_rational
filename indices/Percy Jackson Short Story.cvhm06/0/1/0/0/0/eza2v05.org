5) As far as myths go, there are several versions of the death of Achilles, but they typically revolve around attributing it to either Paris, Apollo, or both of them. But one late account, The Fall of Troy by Quintus Smyrnaeus (4th c. AD), has Apollo (god of archery /and/ plagues) killing Achilles with a "god-envenomed" arrow to the heel after Achilles mouthed off to him (one too many times). Apollo then gets harshly scolded by Hera.

An earlier source, a 6th c. BC vase painting, depicted Achilles' body with arrows in his back and Achilles tendon, shot by Paris. A later vase painting (4th c. BC) shows Apollo guiding Paris' arrow towards Achilles' heel.
