I just read this all in one sitting; didn't hate it.

Just a few things, off the top of my head:

1) In canon, as I recall, it was a struggle of willpower for Percy to control the magical Underworld River Lethe, even after he had a few years of experience. In that part of your narrative, the feat seems just a little... pass√©, for 12-y.o. Percy? But I admit, much smaller quantities of Lethe-water were involved in your scenario.

2) Given the nature of the Riordan universe as one where All Mythologies Are Real, a reader might wonder if, or how, the other Pantheons might react to such an upset in the order of the world. Potential sequel hook.

3) I concur, a little roughness is noticeable here and there. But nothing that a round or two of polishing couldn't address.

4) This could also be really interesting as a longer, serialized piece.

5) I heartily applaud your correction of "popular mythology" by naming Charon as boatman of the River Acheron rather than the River Styx.

6) In "The Son of Magic" short-story, it was revealed that the ability of monsters to home in on demigods was given to them by Lamia, rather than any direct will of the Olympians. But then, the argument can still be made that the Olympians never tried to undo this, or better protect demigod children from it.

7) That's about it for now. Cheers, and thanks for the story!
