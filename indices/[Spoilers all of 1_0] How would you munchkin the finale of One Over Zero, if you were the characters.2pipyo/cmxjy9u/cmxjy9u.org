Having read 1/0... You mean the power to let there be darkness? Clearly i'd use it to ransom the sunlight of entire countries. Pretty sure I'd have global dominion within a month.

Seriously though, if you mean the power to bring into reality any character I've been writing about for years, giving them any advantages I want by power of authorial fiat... Well that's just ludicrously overpowered.

Edit: you know my reading comprehension may be off this morning, ... Though being a meta comic the author was kinda a character too. Anyway the characters don't really need to muchkin anything... they were pretty much given lives. And I don't think there's all that much you could munchkin in actual reality or I would be doing it.
