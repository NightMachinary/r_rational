I think I'm unwittingly playing a trick on myself and now you by taking the sentence out of its context, which is the sparring. Even so, I think I'm not entirely mistaken here. It's unfair to Fenn because of Valencia's ability, and the sentence is a bit weird because it has Fenn's name twice.

Maybe the fix is as simple as "/she still/" or "/even so, she/":

  It was a little unfair to Fenn, because archery was her personal domain of excellence, but she still had pretty much every other advantage there was to have.
