Fixed the first one.

As to the second:

1. Pitting them against each other in melee combat is unfair to Fenn, because her domain of excellence is archery rather than melee.
2. However, Fenn has almost every physical advantage there is to have in a fight, short of raw skill.

I'm not sure which part of the wording is causing problems; let me know.
