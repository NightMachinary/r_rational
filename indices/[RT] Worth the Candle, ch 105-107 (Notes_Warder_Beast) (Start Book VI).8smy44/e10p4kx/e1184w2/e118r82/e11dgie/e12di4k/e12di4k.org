I was actually quite surprised, it seemed to be the first thing I'd actually consider a real infohazard I've heard of. Turns out I was already infected though, but assuming you can become infected just by being told about it as others in this thread claim, then I think it qualifies as a real infohazard.

It's something I've always been infected with, so it doesn't feel that bad to me, but I imagine for someone newly infected, it could be at least a little unpleasant for a while, until you get used to it.
