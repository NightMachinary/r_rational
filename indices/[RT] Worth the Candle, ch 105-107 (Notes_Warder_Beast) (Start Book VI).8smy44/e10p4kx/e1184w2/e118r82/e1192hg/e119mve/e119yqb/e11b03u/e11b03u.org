Well, in that particular case it was quite likely that the infohazard wasn't lethal or very hazardous at all, since it was transmitted from one human to another, as well as because its current bearer was willing to transmit it to consenting people (as opposed to being terrified of the idea, or alternatively disseminating it as widely as possible for mass chaos purposes).

The rest is just estimating how harmful it could possibly be, how much potential harm you're willing to suffer in the name of your curiosity, and how likely you think it is that someone would try to weaponize it later on (i. e., whether you need to vaccinate yourself).

True infohazards are unheard-of, and existence of one would have massive implications. I wouldn't say that you can't fault rationalists for jumping at the chance to confirm it --- it was, in fact, unsafe --- but it's perfectly understandable.
