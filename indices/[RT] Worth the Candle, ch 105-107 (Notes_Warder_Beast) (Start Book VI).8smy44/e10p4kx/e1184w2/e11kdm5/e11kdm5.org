This is why it's so important that several of us are very good at counter-memetics.

For instance, I'm very proud of the people who identified the real infohazard right away and quickly replaced it with the entirely harmless idea now known as "Roko's Basilisk." The replacement is even viscerally frightening enough, and treated with enough caution, that it spreads with little awareness that it /is/ a replacement.
