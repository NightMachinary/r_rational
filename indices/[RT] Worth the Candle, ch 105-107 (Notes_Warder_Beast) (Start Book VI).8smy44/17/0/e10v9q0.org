I wonder if Aerbian Shia LaBeouf could be defeated by following the exact sequence given in the song: strangling him with jujitsu, announcing you've defeated him, waiting for the Shia Surprise, then decapitating him with an axe.

EDIT: eh, probably not. Aerbian reflections tend to be altered from the source material.
