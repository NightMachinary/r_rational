Whew, finally caught up from /Grayscale/.

Registering a prediction: /Uther, having a game layer, had the same level-up compulsion with no way to manage the resulting addiction. Some actions, like dropping into the boundless pit, were taken largely in pursuit of ever more hard-to-obtain fixes./

Come to think of it, there are a few good reasons for something like this not to be true. (Also, I didn't do the least bit of checking for similar guesses) Still, I'll be damned if I call a plot point and without proof again, so I'm erring on the side of caution.
