Chapter 63

  “I don't get how it's possible,” I said. “Is memory not part of the soul?”

  “It is,” said Fallatehr. “Though it's nearly inaccessible to attempts at manipulation.”

Chapter 70:

#+begin_quote
  I suspected that Fallatehr wasn't telling the whole truth, [...] because it was possible to look at and presumably alter memories, even if the interface for that seemed lacking.

Chapter 72

  “Memories are difficult to work with,” said Fallatehr. “Difficult, but not impossible. Your memories of what you have seen and felt of your own soul would suffice, for my purposes.” He held up a hand as I opened my mouth to offer the obvious objection. “I would not need to touch your soul. With your skill as it is, you would be able to transfer those memories into the soul of an intermediary, who would then go to visit me, on another continent, as Amaryllis suggested.”

Chapter 73:

#+begin_quote
  "If you could reverse what you have done and erase our memories --”

  “No, memories are nigh-impossible to work with like that, even when freshly made, at least if attempting to manipulate them through the mechanism of the soul,”
#+end_quote

So putting this all together, memory reading and transfer is well within the domain of soul-magic. Memory editing is extremely difficult. Selective memory deletion is likely not possible, except /maybe/ with a repeat of that skill sacrifice trick.
