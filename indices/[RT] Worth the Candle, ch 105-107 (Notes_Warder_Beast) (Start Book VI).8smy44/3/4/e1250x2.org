I was thinking about it, but it's actually fairly easy:

Go to the Athenaeum. Tell them "There's an extremely dangerous infohazard that the dream-skewered may be vectors for. We can't be more specific or it might spread to you. It is *very important* that, upon the discovery of a dream-skewered, you tell them that communicating the name of the main actor in Transformers comes with a very high chance of mass fatality, beginning with the one who communicated it."

Also, /why in the everliving fuck/ did that dead guy go to all the trouble of recording the name and playing it back? Why not let it die forever?
