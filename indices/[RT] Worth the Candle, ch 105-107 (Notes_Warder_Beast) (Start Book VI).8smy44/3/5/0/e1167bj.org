  ...wait, what?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_of_Base][Ace of Base]] was a musical group popular in the 90s and early 00s. Anyone who remembers them, is also from recent enough period in Earth history to possibly know the name Shia LaBeouf (he got his acting start in the mid-90s). Ditto for people familiar with the internet.

You can't say or otherwise communicate the name, so to identify people who probably know it or are capable of knowing it, you have to use other cultural/historical mileposts. E.g. by asking about stuff from the same time period as Shia LaBeouf.
