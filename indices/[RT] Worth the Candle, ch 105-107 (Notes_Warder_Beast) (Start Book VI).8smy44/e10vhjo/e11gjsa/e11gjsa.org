I was thinking just tell them not to mention Earth actors (or even Earth names) ever.

  Edit: Oh my, and how about bringing instantaneous mass media into a world with info hazards. Holy shit. Talk about weapon of mass destruction, and you can make it selective too via tailoring it to broadcasts.

You could program the operating system to take a hash of every string passed to it and every string passed out, compare it to a list of variations of the Actual Cannibal's name, and stop anything that matches. If that's not sufficient and even having his name in memory can summon him, you can use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption][homomorphic encryption]] so that everything is encrypted during computation, and it deletes any mention of the Actual Cannibal before decrypting.
