Edit: Silly me. I forgot the /hazard/ part of infohazard. Most of the above assumes sharing exactly what the infohazard is with the dreamskewered (with the assumption that they would never use or share that knowledge), whereas the goal is minimize the risk any unhappy lab rat dreamskewered would decide to abuse that knowledge.

So a blanket ban on any celebrity's name from Earth from any time (to hinder dictionary attacks)? That might be sufficiently wide to dissuade casual rebels and terrorists-to-be. They should probably lie about the effects of the taboo and evoke something familiar to Aerbians like "you'll suffer for the rest of eternity" in case any scientists get nosy.
