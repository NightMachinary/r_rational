The quest doesn't seem hard, since the known/outed dreamskewered are conveniently and inconveniently gathered in one location. Inconveniently, since the nature of the infohazard means it's most likely to be bandied between fellow dreamskewers. Conveniently, since Joon can easily draw on oblique references that any dreamskewer who's familiar with Shia LaBeouf can recognize (and if they're too old to recognize the name, all the better) and nip the bud on the likeliest ground zero.

One question is /how/ the infohazard triggers. Does the summoning occur only if you complete the entire name? Or is uttering just "Shia..." with the name in mind sufficient? Because it's way easier to explain to fellow dreamskewers if he can truncate the name.
