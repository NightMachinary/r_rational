I'd be honestly surprised if RustyRhea *wasn't* a throwaway for this exact purpose. It's too specific.

Not that there's anything in the least wrong with it. Asking with a primary account would end up a spoiler, and it makes sense to perform a basic sanity-check before throwing in something like this. It's the /entire purpose/ of those threads to do things like this.

I guess we wait and see if the aetheric layers come into play for another worldbuilding point.
