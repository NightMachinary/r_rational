I'm going to be sorely disappointed if we don't see ACTUAL CANNIBAL SHIA LaBEOUF show up in this quest -- I mean, logically, this is the highest level quest Juniper has received (since he's done squat since leveling), and it's just to warn the patients at the Athenaeum of Speculation and Scrutiny not to mention ACTUAL CANNIBAL SHIA LaBEOUF?

It seems too easy...

It seems too... innocent a quest...

It almost seems like the prelude to a horror movie starring ACTUAL CANNIBAL SHIA LaBEOUF!
