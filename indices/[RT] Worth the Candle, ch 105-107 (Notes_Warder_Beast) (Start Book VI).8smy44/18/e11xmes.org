I really like the character development on Grak. I think a lot of his quirks probably make a lot more sense on re-reading, when you realize he's not a stoic introvert, but a severely depressed extrovert.

  “Jorge and I are going on a date,” said Valencia as she came into the common room and flopped down in a chair.

That... does seem a tiny bit premature. Valencia is still learning to process social situations without demons, she still hasn't read any other book besides Harry Potter, Jorge has strong incentives to try to manipulate her for information, and ultimately, she kind of has the mentality of a 13-years-old.

Ah well. At least we might learn more about Jorge and the other uniquities characters through her.

  “I don't particularly care if you have sex,” said Bethel. “Hundreds of people have had sex in my rooms.”

That's interesting. I'm trying to figure out how many people have lived in her before she went recluse, and it seems the answer is "quite a lot".

I mean, she had a reputation for being haunted, but on the other hand, she could just outlast that reputation by a few decades, and remain inhabited just by being a nice house near a large metropolis.

  “Well I'd rather not have an adventure just for the sake of it,” said Fenn. “But speaking of adventures for the sake of it, can we finally play Arches? We're all here, we've got nothing better to do, I've had my campaign ready for ages, and I know that Juniper's got stuff ready if we want to play his. Mary?”

Aw, I had hopes there.

By the way, I hope we get to see Bethel play DM. Superpowers aside, she kinda has the no-nonsense personality for the job.

"Anyway, Jorge and I were eating, and-"

"It's your turn, and I have filled myself with poison gas. If you want the antidote, /start playing the damn game/."

  Bethel elected not to come with, which I think we all saw coming. [...] For what was planned as a day trip, and one where we probably wouldn't need overwhelming firepower, that didn't seem worth it.

YOU IDIOT!
