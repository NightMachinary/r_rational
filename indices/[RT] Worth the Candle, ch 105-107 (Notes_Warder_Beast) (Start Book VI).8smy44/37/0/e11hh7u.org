I do like the layers of meta in it---ACSL is terrifying in his “origin story”, ridiculous to a Terran audience, then terrifying to Aerb, then ridiculous in a terrified way to Joon and co. when they realize his origins.

But otherwise it is much more of a “lol get this reference???” kind of Easter egg than everything else the DM's done so far. Even the author anagram was at least somewhat obfuscated.
