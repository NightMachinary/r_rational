Sure, it's just to me it crosses the line from "heavy inspiration" to "blatant plagiarism" in terms of Terran cultural material. Pretty much everything else in Aerb introduced so far is either made solely by the DM, adapted from Joon's campaigns, or somewhat hidden easter eggs from Terran culture (the Kinsey book anagram).

Since it's said that Joon ran conventional campaigns, it would be like them coming across an enclave of Yog Sothoth cultists, assuming he played Call of Cthulhu at some point. If the DM is borrowing material that Joon didn't come up with, he at least makes a token effort to disguise it.

I wouldn't have any complaints if there was an inhuman monster that would kill all those who named it, known to few as the /Haal sou Beif/, that would be totally in line with what the DM's done so far. Not even trying to hide the connection to Terra, not so much.
