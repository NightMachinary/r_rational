I can see where you're coming from, but I actually find this idea interesting - the theme of either Aerb pulling stuff from Jun's subconcious (in warped form)(ie nothing he conciously put in a campaign, but stuff that he was aware of) or even more scarily stuff from Earth that he didn't even know about showing up warped (potentially via the same link that draws other dream skewered?)
