You know, I love the idea of infohazards (read this whole [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five][set]] of connected short stories, it's great), but I've got to wonder how anyone knows the percent chance of the trigger word working.

If they know he's summoned 3/5 times, and is guaranteed to arrive if you say his name three times, that implies they had people try to summon him multiple times, and write down data.

That doesn't jive with the idea that he appears, kills /anyone/ with knowledge of his name, or who handed off knowledge to his summoner, as well as hundreds of other people.

On another note, If I were Joon, I'd take great care to not say the names of other infohazard memes from Earth. Bloody mary, biggie smalls, Cthulhu Fhtagn, etc.
