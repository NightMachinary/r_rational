From next month onwards, every new resident of the Athenaeum of Speculation and Scrutiny is given a list of things they're not allowed to say, /ever/, for every reason, that might trigger the apocalypse, and has to swear a binding oath not to say them or write them down.

What does the list include?

I'd say:

- Anything SCP-related (though SCP pages usually blank out their supposed infohazards anyway).

- Anything derived from Lovecraft's works.

- Famous actors whose name starts with S.

- The Game.

- Descriptions of Rosko's Basilisk.
