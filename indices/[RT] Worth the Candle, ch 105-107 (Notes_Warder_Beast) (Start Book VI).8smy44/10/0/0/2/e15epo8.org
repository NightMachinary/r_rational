I think they figured out that Shia kills everyone who hears it and immediately decided to weaponize it against /enemies/ who they want dead. Then they realized it kills everyone in the causal chain, not just everyone in earshot. But once you have the phonograph and figure out that you can break the casual chain linking yourself to the Shia it's not even a particularly ineffective weapon. Therefore you can weaponize it as a workable suicide weapon. All of this is enough repetition to figure out that it doesn't happen every time.
