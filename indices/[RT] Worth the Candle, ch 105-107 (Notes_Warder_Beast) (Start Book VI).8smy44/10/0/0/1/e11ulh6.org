It does seem like they would have needed SCP-level personnel casualties to get enough data that Amaryllis can state with confidence what the rules are.

If this were the Second Empire, it would make sense, but Amaryllis is implying that the experiments were fairly recent (a bunch of her cousins died), so I think it's a little implausible they'd have kept experimenting past the second or third occurrence of "The guy showed up, killed the test subject, killed everyone in the testing facility, resisted every single magic we threw at him, destroyed several irreplaceable military entads, killed the highly-trained soldiers wielding them, then worked his way up the chain of command until he killed the head of the research program" for the sake of curiosity.
