  I narrowed my eyes slightly at that. She could have killed Fallatehr with it, when she'd been captured by him, just before he'd touched her soul. Shia LaBeouf would have killed her, but he'd also have killed Fallatehr too. Understanding dawned on me as I thought back to what she'd said about that misadventure. â€˜Suicide comes in many flavors', she'd said.

Anyone remember / can find this scene? I tried some basic searches but couldn't find it.
