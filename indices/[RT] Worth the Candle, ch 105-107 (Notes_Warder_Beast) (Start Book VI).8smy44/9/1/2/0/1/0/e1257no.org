Play the game in a swimming pool on noodles and change the rules slightly, that makes it more thematic.

Seeker seeks buried treasure aka diving for pool rings Keeper is the keeper of the treasure hoard. Chasers chase enemy ships to steal their treasure and bring it back to their keeper. Beaters are like chasers except they try to attack the enemy ship by throwing bludgers (cannon balls) into it.
