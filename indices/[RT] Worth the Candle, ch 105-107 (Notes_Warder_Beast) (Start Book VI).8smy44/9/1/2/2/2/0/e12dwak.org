Hey, congrats on withstanding your curiosity!

  Is there any chance I could come across it in the wild or by myself?

Yes, by all means. Its a "natural" thing. Though I doubt it would be considered infohazard anywhere except here. Its a 0.5 to 1 on the scale, maybe spiking to 2 due to "torture" response.

5% has gone up to 10% over today, based on three natural carriers (as opposed to one). Sample size still small.

The very negative response seems to be on the very far right side of the bellcurve, my response was a one time pain experience.
