I kinda don't know if you're just fucking with us, but is there a way to sort of hint about it without actually causing the infohazard? Kinda like that earlier SCP link, where you can vaguely describe the thing without actually spreading the infohazard?

In actuality, I don't want to know it. But I can think of things that act like temporary infohazards that aren't bad, like knowing where your nose is in your vision or feeling yourself breathing or eye floaters. Is it like that? Or is it scary fiction I don't want to think about, like Cordycepts or any SCP?

Is there any chance I could come across it in the wild or by myself? What if I search for infohazards?

I'm curious especially about the 5% already infected. Where does that number come from?

Can I know how that negative response happens that's like torture without knowing the infohazard? I have no clue what could possibly cause that.
