Because I'm skeptical about how “powerful” infohazards actually are in the real world, at least where the danger is inherent to knowledge itself and not people trying to kill you for knowing it (e.g. state secrets, witness killing, etc). If anything aren't I being a good rationalist by actively seeking out information to disprove my hypothesis?

The closest thing I've seen to a Serious Business Infohazard is that one infographic showing you how to snap a tendon in your thumb in two simple steps, which is not too impressive since there's plenty of ways to fuck yourself up easily.
