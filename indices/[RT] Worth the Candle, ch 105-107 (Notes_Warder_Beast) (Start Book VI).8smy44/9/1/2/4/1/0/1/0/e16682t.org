It's from Yudkowsky's [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Guide to Intelligent Characters]], or more precisely from [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][here]]. Real-life people try to honestly achieve their goals, even if their decision-making is often irrational and muddled. H-zombies on the other hand, or Hollywood Zombies, are character-puppets of the plot. They only make an /appearance/ of pursuing whatever personal goals they have, but actually their actions are optimized towards drama and plot convenience. H-zombies are impulsive, non-introspective, genre-blind, or selectively stupid, as plot demands.
