The other part where he mentions a campaign inspired by Fine Structure is ESPECIALLY WORRISOME because he's then almost certainly familiar with qntm's SCP work, and if there's an antimeme entity on the scale of 55555 lurking in Aerb... they are so fucked. Especially since the local Foundation-equivalent Uniquities has nowhere near the resources to deal with potential K-class events.

Doing a quest with SCP-inspiration would be hella cool to read, though.
