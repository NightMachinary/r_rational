The backpack is probably safe, but J & co. have no way of knowing.

A few chapters back the backpack refused to provide a printout of Urban Dictionary entry for "basic bitch". Lo and behold, that entry mentions Shia LeBeouf:

[[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Basic%20Bitch]]

E: Actually, why can't they request the backpack to provide "X without any mentions of a person with initials SL"? If they can't trust the backpack to actually follow the requests, they cannot use it at all. If they can, this is a method that should make any requests safe.
