Well according to the rules of Actual Cannibal [REDACTED] [REDACTED] power scales with the number of opponents but not the power of the opponents. He can gain new abilities at will through "[REDACTED] surprise" at the cost of health which can be regained for every kill with no upper bound.

Seems like Shia could be killed by a small group of powerful individuals. I wonder where they can find something like that.
