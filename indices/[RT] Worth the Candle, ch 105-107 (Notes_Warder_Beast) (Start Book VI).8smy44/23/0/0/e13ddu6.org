I've a heavy laptop and my phone, wallet, and keys. I saw him as wisps in my peripheral vision. Moments where I think I see him but when I look directly at him he's not there. I'm in my car all the seats are down. I'm making sure not to look away from the inside of the vehicle and paying close attention to my peripheral vision all the while wondering what horror I have just become responsible for.
