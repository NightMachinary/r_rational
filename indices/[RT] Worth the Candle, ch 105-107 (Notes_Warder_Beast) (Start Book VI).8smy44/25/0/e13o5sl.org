It's the incident with the tattoo mage in Barren Jewel.

As Surface Sheath itself: from chapter 30

#+begin_quote
  *Surface Sheath*: An object pressed against the tattoo will skin into and become part of the magic of the skin, allowing it to be retrieved later by pulling at the edge of the tattoo. Object must be inserted within thirty minutes of tattoo completion. Required size depends upon the size of the object to be stored.

The variant that they talked about is the one where you need a keyword to retrieve the object.
