Okaaaay, I'm officially on edge. Congratulations, I guess, seeing Amaryllis react with utter terror and be absolutely confident that they will all die if he shows up really drove home how the joke has become a very very horrifying reality. The true final boss has revealed himself, though making him beatable may rob him of the mystique.

On to Grak, very good scene. Explains a lot, and seeing him break down crying at the memory of his dead home does a lot to let me empathize with a gruff no-nonsense character who I've never gotten attached to very much.
