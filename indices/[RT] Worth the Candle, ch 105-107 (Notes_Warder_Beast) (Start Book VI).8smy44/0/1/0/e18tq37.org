I don't think he ever speaks, he just shows up and kills everyone. There is nothing that can force him to do anything else.

My guess is that he is indeed killable, but only through specific circumstances. Remember, in the song in question, he was successfully killed. The MC of the song 1) escaped Shia's pursuit, 2) snuck up on him, 3) stabbed him in the kidney with /his/ knife, 4) left him assumed dead, 5) decapitated Shia with an axe. I think at least the last one will be the key to actually hurting him. This is, again, contingent on Shia actually being killable.

Goddammit cthulu, this is such a weird paragraph you've made me write.
