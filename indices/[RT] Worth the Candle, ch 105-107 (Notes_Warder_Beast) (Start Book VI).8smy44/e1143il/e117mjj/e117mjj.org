  I'm also wondering how Aerb first discovered that the words "Shia Labeouf" repeated three times killed everyone around.

I was assuming it was another dream skewed, or possibly more than one. Even if 60% of them got killed, you only need one survivor to pass on enough for a line of research.

Heck, it might even have been Arthur himself, if he found a way to cheat his way around the killing/communication restriction.
