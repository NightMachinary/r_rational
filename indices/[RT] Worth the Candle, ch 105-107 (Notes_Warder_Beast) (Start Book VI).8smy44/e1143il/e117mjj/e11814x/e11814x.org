But, how would that work? 60% of the time, nothing happens, and no one knows that they were close to death. 40% of the time, the knowledge dies with them, if they even realize what they did wrong. All it would really result in is a warning that some guy randomly kills lots of people around dream skewered people, mostly from America.

The only way I could see it working is if someone had some form of danger sense, and was near the dream skewered person while they said his name, and knew to connect the name with the potential summoning, and that the 60% is in fact random and not just lack of information of hidden variables (i.e. saying his name with different inflections guarantees his summoning or makes it never happen if the name is only said once). But the only form of danger sense I can think of in WTC is elf luck, but that would just have the elf avoid the skewered person entirely, and wouldn't give them any information on what caused the slaughter that happened.

Edit: Maybe an elf who has luck strong enough to see an hour into the future happened to be near a dream skewered person, without their luck telling them to avoid the person (??? No idea how that would work) and then their luck tells them not how to avoid death, because death is inevitable, but how to convey the warning onto others? Luck gives elves information they have no way of knowing, so it's about as plausible as anything else.
