Something that other people have probably noticed before me, but I somewhat recently noticed on a read through: CRJ basically dropped health as a relevant stat as the story progressed. I actually like this, because it felt somewhat intrusive and took me out of the moment, but it is noticable when you compare latter fights with the early ones.

Would the Shia Labeouf thing be the way to kill Fel Stead or whatever the name is? Both are described as being unkillable killing machines, so setting one against the other seems like it would lead to profound breakthroughs in science.

I'm also wondering how Aerb first discovered that the words "Shia Labeouf" repeated three times killed everyone around. Like, how did anyone say those syllables those number of times, accidentally, and then manage to record the process in the only way that they can be recorded?

Edit: it's really lucky that Amaryllis didn't pull up, say, a list of the most popular movies of the 2000s in the months in the time chamber. Holes was fairly popular, and he's been in a number of big movies in addition to that.
