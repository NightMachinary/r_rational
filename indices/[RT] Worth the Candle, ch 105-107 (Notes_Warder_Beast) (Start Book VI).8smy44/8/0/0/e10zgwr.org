Maybe. But just this update we saw Bethel trying to get a magic item to work by saying all sorts of words in order to try to trigger it. If someone tries to do that exhaustively, they might very well try all standard words and start trying permutations of syllables or phonemes, at which point it's just a matter of time before they and anyone around them dies of Shia LaBeouf. So, if anyone else in the world is stupid enough to try to spend time triggering artifacts, you'll see a few Shia LaBeoufs constantly being (very briefly) rediscovered, at the very least.
