Other stuff Bethel could try:

- Make her outer walls immaterial for half an hour (Evanescent Armor), then expand them as far as possible (Anyblade). Hopefully a continuous, quantitative increase in her sensorium is less unpleasant than abrupt qualitative ones. If she can be a "house" containing all of Aerb, she can easily kill almost anyone she wants using her various other powers.
- If Aerbian physics is like ours, I don't think she could /quite/ split atoms with 5 pounds of force. Probably best not to try it though.
- Have a bone mage interrogate a prisoner by draining their skull of KNO through their teeth, then use the Wishes ability to undo the harm to the prisoner.
- Use the Everflask for secure communication. Bethel and a spy agree beforehand on a code mapping hypothetical drinks that the Everflask can't make yet to messages ("n parts dandelion wine to 1 part year-old whiskey means the prince is hiding in sector n"), and the spy communicates by mixing the appropriate drink and getting someone to "consume it for the purposes of pleasure, sustenance, or health". Whereupon Bethel brute-force tries to make all 32 agreed-upon drinks until one of them works.
- Orb of Brilliance + Sunlight Mirror = Lasers??
