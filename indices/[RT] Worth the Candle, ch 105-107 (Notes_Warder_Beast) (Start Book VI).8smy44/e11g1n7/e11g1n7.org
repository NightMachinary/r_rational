Oh Jesus, poor Grak. Somehow it didn't click for me that having a warder would be an extremely pragmatic thing for an underground dwarven village. Da didn't just run away from da nad family and social obligations, da deprived da nad community of one of its most vital institutions. This really explains a lot.

Also, I keep forgetting the scale of Aerb. If the majority of a billion dwarves live in strongholds of a couple of thousand inhabitants, there are hundreds of thousands of Darili Irids - that's just staggering.

Great few chapters, thanks CRJ. May blood never drain fast from your stump leg.
