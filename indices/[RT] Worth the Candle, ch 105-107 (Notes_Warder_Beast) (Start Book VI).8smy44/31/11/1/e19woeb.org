In that particular idiom, "hoist" is the past participle of the obsolete verb "hoise". [[https://www.etymonline.com/word/hoist][See here.]]

In reference to Grak's Anglish ... it reads fine to me either way, but I have no strong opinions on changing it to something that parses better for other people. The intent with regard to him being able to read it was that he was capable of doing something more like a laborious word-by-word translation of Anglish into Groglir, rather than actually reading the Anglish itself; knowing a fair amount of Anglish means understanding some of the differences between their languages in terms of structure, having memorized a few key phrases, and knowing a small handful of words.
