The backpack specifically did not provide an Urban Dictionary page that contained SB's name. This may suggest that it will not allow the dissemination of an info-hazard, or it may just protect the DM as the creator of the information.

Depending on which one it is, you might be able to rule out certain Earth memes as infohazards by attempting to retrieve them from the backpack.
