Sooo how do you warn an /entire clinic and its insane inhabitants/ about an infohazard? Not really insane, but, you know, dreamskewered.

- theres this infohazard, you might all randomly die, be sure to write your will

- you need to kill every dreamskewered person that remenbers Ace of Base or the internet

- we need to do this extremely experimental procedure on all of your dreamskewered. You see, we have this fancy memory eating entad sword, and need it to eat some specific memories. No, we dont know how to control it. No, we can't tell you what this is about.

Edit: Oh my, and how about bringing instantaneous mass media into a world with info hazards. Holy shit. Talk about weapon of mass destruction, and you can make it selective too via tailoring it to broadcasts.
