Sure, but it implies six or so /entirely/ new groups found:

1) A shitload of dead bodies. Dozens to hundreds.

2) Records about the word, and that saying it will summon an unbeatable murderer who will kill everyone who said the word, and the people who told them it, and the people who ordered them to say it, even without knowing the word. (I suppose this may have only happened with the very last group, but it seems like most would know about it by the nature of the experiments)

Then decided to commit suicide by researching it.

I guess Amaryllis did say

#+begin_quote
  “Not all the time. Sixty percent, maybe.”
#+end_quote

Which means there aren't weren't /that/ many experiments, but there were at least 6 different groups that had that little self preservation.

I suppose her kingdom has a lot of assholes with power running around, so it's possible they could blackmail people in killing themselves for science, but there's not a lot of incentive there. The assassination thing, sure, but just getting the success rate? Why bother?

In the case of some poor smuck saying it by accident, who would record what caused it? Or more importantly, how many times they said it /without/ dying horribly? All you get from that are positive reports.

I'm probably just overthinking this. Amaryllis probably gave out a random percent chance of death, knowing that the words didn't work every time. Anyone making up the estimation would err on the side of caution, even if they only said the word twice (one dud, one "success"), and say 60% chance of death, rather than 50%.

Regardless, I'm looking forward to the next chapters. I'm curious how this will all go so very wrong for Joon and Co.

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  “None of it is paranoia,” said Amaryllis. “We've tried to harness him in the past. It always ends with everyone dying.”
#+end_quote

I suppose they could have tried mind controlling him, or using Entads that can somehow control a person on him. I guess I can plausibly see several groups trying different things to get a tame weapon of that power.
