Got an idea that depends on how munchkin-able Bethel's momentum ability is:

#+begin_quote
  *Crown of King Momentus*: I can transfer momentum from one object to another. I can also sense all momentum within my walls, and to one hundred feet outside them.
#+end_quote

If "object" can be a person, she could push Joon up to absurd speeds within the confines of her house (providing enough space with Pikel's Gap). Transferring the muzzle velocity of a heavy cannonball (even easier if the momentum can be stacked) to Joon while creating a relative vacuum is more than enough for 600 mph.
