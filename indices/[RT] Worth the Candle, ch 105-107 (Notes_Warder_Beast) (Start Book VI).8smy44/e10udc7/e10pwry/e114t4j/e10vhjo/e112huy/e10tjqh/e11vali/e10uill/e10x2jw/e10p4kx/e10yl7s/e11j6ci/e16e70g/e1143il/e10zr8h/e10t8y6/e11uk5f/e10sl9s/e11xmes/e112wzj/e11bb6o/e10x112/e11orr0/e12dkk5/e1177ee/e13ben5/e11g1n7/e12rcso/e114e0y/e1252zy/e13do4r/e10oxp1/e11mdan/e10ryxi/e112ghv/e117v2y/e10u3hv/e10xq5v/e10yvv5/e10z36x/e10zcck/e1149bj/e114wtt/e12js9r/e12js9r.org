  He knew a fair amount of Anglish, though couldn't actually speak or read it
#+end_quote

I was confused by this sentence. Was it intended as something like "...though /not enough to/ actually speak or read it"? Maybe the "actually" already makes that clear enough and my brain is just being weird, but the way my brain naturally parsed it was that he could write and understand spoken Anglish but couldn't speak/read it (which doesn't make much sense to me).
