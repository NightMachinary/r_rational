Nah, the idea is this:

1. With a starting position of your arms in front of you, palms together

2. Rotate your wrist so your thumb is pointing upwards(or as close as it gets)

3. Bend thumb as far as possible and wrap fingers around it to secure in place (I.e. the way that will break your thumb if you try to punch someone)

4. Quickly snap your wrist in the opposite direction as quickly as possible.

Since your thumb-to-wrist tendon/ligament is already tightened with your thumb bent as far as possible, putting extra strain on it will make it snap. Or at least, that's the intended result.
