  “Barriers won't work,” said Amaryllis as she put on the immobility plate. She was speaking fast, almost breathless. “Wards won't work. Obstructions won't work, raw killing power won't work, magic will be shrugged off or only partially successful, no known entad can stop him, and he scales to any threats. *On the first invocation of his name* there's a sixty percent chance he'll appear, and if he does we're absolutely fucked -- no Juniper, don't write anything down.”
