With Valencia and that armor, does that essentially make her immune to damage now? I guess narratively it makes sense for her to be hard to hurt, since she is also much harder to heal. Still seems overpowered though.

Also, with the name Valencia the red and both that armor and the blood axe floating around it definitely sounds like the DM had a particular theme in mind.
