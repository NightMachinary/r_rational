Well, there are two possibilities:

1. The information is not an infohazard, either through it being incredibly weak or just not one in the first place. So it's not interesting, because the interest was in the property of it being an infohazard.

2. It is one. You now know a legitimate infohazard, willingly. Congrats.

To me, this seems like sticking your hand on a hot stove to see if it hurts. Sure, it's technically in the name of science, but the result is either boring or harmful, potentially lethally so. Or maybe a label on a bottle saying "Danger, do not open!". Either way, I just don't see the reasoning in hearing someone say "I know an inforhazard and am willing to share!" and immediately asking about it.
