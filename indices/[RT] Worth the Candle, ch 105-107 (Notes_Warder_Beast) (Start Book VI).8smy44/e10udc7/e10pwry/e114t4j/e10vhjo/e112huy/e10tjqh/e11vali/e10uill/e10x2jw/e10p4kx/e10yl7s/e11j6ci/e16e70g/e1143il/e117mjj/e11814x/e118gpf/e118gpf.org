  But, how would that work?

Well, there a few possibilities I can think of, but the most likely that springs to mind is something fairly similar to what we just saw in the chapter. A dream skewed says the name out loud in front of an audience, but nothing happens.

One or more of those people then later repeats the name, where someone else could see the action, but not hear (or read, or...) the name being said, and this time it /did/ summon him. Now you have one slaughter, one witness of the summon, and one or more people who know the name, but haven't repeated it yet, for whatever reason. A slaughter, but the knowledge didn't die with the person who said the name (or wrote it down, or whatever).

Since infohazards are a thing in Aerb, it's not inconceivable for someone to connect the dots from that, or a surviving dream skewed who got the "joke", then someone set up a research project to see if it can be weaponized, before they realize just how dangerous it is.

It may have taken more than one cycle of failed summons, followed by slaughters with surviving name-knowers for someone somewhere to have worked this out. Possibly a steady drip of dream skewed making the same mistake, getting themselves and everyone around wiped out for some unknown reason, before someone somewhere got "lucky" enough for the events to line up.
