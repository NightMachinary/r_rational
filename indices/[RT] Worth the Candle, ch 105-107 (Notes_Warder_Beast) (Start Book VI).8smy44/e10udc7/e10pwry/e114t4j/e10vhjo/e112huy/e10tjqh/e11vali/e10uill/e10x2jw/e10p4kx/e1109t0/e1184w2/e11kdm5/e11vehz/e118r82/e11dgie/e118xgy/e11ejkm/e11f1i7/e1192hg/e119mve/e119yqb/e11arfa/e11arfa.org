From my values, the first possibility is more like:

1. It's not an infohazard, but a decent amount of people think it's enough of one that they go to the effort of some information control, which makes it interesting to me simply by the virtue of being taboo. I wasn't impressed with the hazard levels of Roko's Basilisk, either, but I found it a rather cute idea.

The hand-on-stove analogy is weak because the premise and results are mundane and well-known. The exotic mystery of it is appealing, like if someone discovered some basilisk-y sound you could listen to that would make you feel pain, but is still completely unknown to the layman. There's literally no healthy outcome from doing it but I damn well would, because hell yeah that sounds dope.

But I guess you gotta be the type that would want to try getting taxed just to see what it would feel like to find the appeal.
