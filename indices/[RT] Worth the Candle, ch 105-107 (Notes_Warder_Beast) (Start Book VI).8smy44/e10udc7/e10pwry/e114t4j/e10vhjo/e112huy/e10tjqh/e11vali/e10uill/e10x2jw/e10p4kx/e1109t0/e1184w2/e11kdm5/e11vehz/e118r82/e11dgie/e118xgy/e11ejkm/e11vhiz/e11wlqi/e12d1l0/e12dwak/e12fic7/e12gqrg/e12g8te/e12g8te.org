I really dont think I can give a much better description without outright telling. Its knowledge, not some crazy infohazard concept. Its not something abstract like a statistic that keeps you up at night. I'd rate the stastic at about 0.01 or so, thats only barely and technically an infohazard.

It sometimes causes pain, spreadable by text alone, and about 10%ish people are natural carriers. I give you a single sentence, you say "neat" or "huh" and are infected.
