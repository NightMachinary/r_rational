Well, that explains the inclusion of a Medium Armor skill in the system, a bold move that I haven't seen anyone try to pull off since Morrowind (if you played Morrowind, you know why).

Retroactively funny that Amaryllis chided Joon for picking redundant armor skills. Turns out that Medium Armor exists solely and entirely for the purposes of making a mega-armor build with all three skills.

Possible further virtues: Medium armor usage also grants skill gains in heavy/light Use whichever armor skill is highest while wearing medium armor All Medium Armor virtues also work while wearing non-medium armor Add Unarmored to the pile, just for shits and giggles? Add the skill ratings together?

Well, that last one looks like it would be a trap. A sneaky way for the DM to modernize the system and get rid of the unfashionable Medium Armor skill while maintaining simulationist deniability by making some poor fool get the skill - and himself - Excluded.
