Hey, carrier of the infohazard here. I have become a bit more strict with deseminating it. Please read the following disclaimer. Think hard, and then PM me:

My infohazard has a chance to make you feel otherwise unfelt pain. Based on responses, you have 5% to already be infected, 20% chance that it works and produces mild pain.

*5% chance of, quote "extreme negative response - something akin to torture. The ensuing week - pretty shitty."*
