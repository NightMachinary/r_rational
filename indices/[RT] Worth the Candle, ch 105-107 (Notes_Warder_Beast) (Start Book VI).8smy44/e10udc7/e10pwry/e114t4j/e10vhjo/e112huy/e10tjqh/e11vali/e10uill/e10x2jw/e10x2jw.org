Fuck me infohazards are scary.

I didn't realize it was a Shia-bomb for a bit and thought that Joon's memories of what got Mary into red alert status had been stolen or something... god damn it fuck infohazards.

That is a rough quest too (assuming you don't just make dream-skewered kill on sight). Mary says there have been about a thousand dream-skewered, so extremely roughly call it anywhere between 5 and 100 currently known of. Even assuming you do a good enough job of impressing that no, no it is not a joke if you say Stanley Yelnats three times everyone dies, now you have just have smart bombs instead of time bombs argh argh infohazards.
