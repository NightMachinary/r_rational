If you've never experienced pain before, the first time you do so is fantastically novel. This novelty feels important to the curious, and curiosity has a natural reward system built right in.

Likewise; if you've never experienced an infohazard before, it doesn't seem surprising to seek one out even if you predict you'll be unhappy with the specific consequences because you expect the reward of novelty to outweigh the harm of the hazard.
