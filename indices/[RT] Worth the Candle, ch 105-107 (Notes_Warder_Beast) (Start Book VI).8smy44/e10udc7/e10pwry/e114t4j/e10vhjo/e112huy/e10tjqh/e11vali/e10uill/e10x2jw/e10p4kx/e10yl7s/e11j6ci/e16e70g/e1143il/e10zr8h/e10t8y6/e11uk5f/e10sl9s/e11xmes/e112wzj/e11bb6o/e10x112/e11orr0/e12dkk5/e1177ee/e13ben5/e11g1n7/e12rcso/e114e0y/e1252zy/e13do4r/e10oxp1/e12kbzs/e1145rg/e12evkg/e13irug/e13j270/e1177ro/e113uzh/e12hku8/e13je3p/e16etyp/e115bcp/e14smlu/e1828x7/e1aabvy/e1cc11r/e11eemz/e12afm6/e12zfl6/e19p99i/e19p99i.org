Let's talk about that magic:

#+begin_quote

  1. To become a velocity mage, you had to move, without magical assistance, faster than the benchmark, and then maintain it for a short period of time. It went up with every velocity mage that was inducted into the ranks. Due to somewhat short-sighted expansion of those ranks during the Second Empire, that meant going more than six hundred miles per hour, and there was presumably some secret to it, because that was really, really fast.
  2. Vibrational Magic was locked to a magic item, which was tightly controlled by the Athenaeum of Sound and Silence, and besides that, rate limited. It was frustrating, because all I needed was a tap on the head, but there was a long line of people waiting in front of me, all of whom had gone through the training necessary to actually utilize the magic.
  3. Revision Magic required being revised backward by a year, which was far more than enough to kill a person, since your body spent that year taking in and expelling matter. The Athenaeum of Claw and Clocks had a collection of entads that would keep you stable, including the Thousand Rings of Stability, but it still meant giving up a year of your life, the so-called “lost year” (as memories were lost too), and obviously it took a lot of time and power from an existing revision mage to do the revision.
  4. Still Magic required visiting a temple and meditating there for a week, which wouldn't have been too much of a problem, except that the temple was deep underground, and controlled by the Athenaeum of Sound and Silence.
  5. Water Magic was a bloodline magic, and all I really needed was a teacher, who we'd already contacted and was on her way to come see us. The strict combat utility wasn't all that promising, but the weather control aspects would help a lot on the Isle of Poran.
  6. Fire Magic we could do too, but hadn't. About 1% of the time someone was burned alive, they would awaken horribly scarred but otherwise fine, with the barest powers of a fire magus. If you had sufficient magical healing, you could take someone to the brink and then heal them back as many times as it took for the fire magic to trigger.

So, numbers 1, 3, and 6 basically just require munchkinry, and numbers 2, 3, and 4 require politics.

--------------

Velocity magic seems like a problem for Amaryllis and technology, and possibly the house making itself a vacuum tube (think about it for a sec: complete knowledge of its internals and being able to arbitrarily apply 5 pounds of force means it could just use a Maxwell's Demon approach! Or a boring smelly tedious plebian old-fashioned compression system). Acceleration would be useful to have, because it would shorten the necessary length of the tube. Being able to cast the prince's-whatever 6-second invincibility spell would be useful for safely escaping afterward, but probably optional.

So, vacuum tube or just a giant rocket. /In fact/, if possible they should just invent an edible odd-tasting (so that it counts as recreation - give the recipe to some chef and say "make this exactly, and serve it as a drink", and voila!) rocket-fuel, if possible, and have Bethel generate it, to save costs. Or not, I don't know if that's a problem.

Revision magic requires /time/, which they have plenty of, stored in a chamber. If they could do the entire thing in there, then they lose basically nothing (soul mages are effectively immortal to aging, AIUI, so losing the lifespan isn't a problem for Joon, neither is the time, nor memories of spending a year in the chamber.

The question is: /are those entads portable/? If they are, then with politics they could just borrow them for a few hours (or however long an in-the-chamber year is, plus setup etc), accompanied by a revision mage to help do the thing.

Fire magic is... already sorted? Either way, consistent fire damage, consistent healing, hopefully not too much time, and they've got it.

#2 seems straightforward - find someone they can bribe/blackmail into handing over their place in the line. Finding 50 people who are willing to delay their ascension for 3 months might be easier than finding one person who's willing to go to the very back of the line.

#4 sounds like it's a matter of paying huge tuition fees.

--------------

*But*, we're getting ahead of ourselves. Do we even need to /traditionally/ unlock the magics? Perhaps a soul scaphism plus levelling would be enough to stay on level one, once the scaphism wears off. At that point, you simply need to find someone with one level, then peel off a level or two and then attempt to grind the shit out of that skill - perhaps live combat with the skill would make it level faster? Really, the biggest sacrifice would be finding souls of people with the relevant magics. If that's trivial, then (assuming June still retains the soul scaphism ability) there's basically no loss in attempting to unlock the skill the easy way.

Plus, with the twin souls etc, unlocking one for June /should/ make it possible for companions to easy-unlock them by roughly the same method.
