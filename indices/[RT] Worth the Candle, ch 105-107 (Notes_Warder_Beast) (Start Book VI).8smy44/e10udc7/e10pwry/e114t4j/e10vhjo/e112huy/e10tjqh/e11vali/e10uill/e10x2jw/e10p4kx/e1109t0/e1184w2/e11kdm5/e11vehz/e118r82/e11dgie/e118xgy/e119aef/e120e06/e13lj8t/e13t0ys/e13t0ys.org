I think we are just using vastly different minimum thresholds. For a 1-2 rating I would think of things that just cause temporary mild discomfort like manual breathing or where to rest your tongue. A 0.5 rating would be ridiculously mild negative utility like being aware of inappropriate Wilhelm screams in movies you otherwise enjoy.
