So no hints or descriptions remotely related to the topic?

I'm not withstanding my curiosity, but rather trying to get you to satisfy it without actually subjecting myself to the infohazard.

Come on, give me something here.

Is it sleep paralysis and the phantom thing I've heard people see? Is it knowledge of a super scary statistic that keeps you up at night? Is it the knowledge of the infohazard that you're telling us, causing to feel "pain" from the overwhelming curiosity?

Oftentimes it's possible to describe the infohazard without spreading it. There's an SCP that causes people to forget about it, but you can remember what it's not.

Also, that other one about breaking your thumb ligament is enough without seeing the picture to satisfy curiosity.

Can you describe it in any way without spreading it? If you really are worried, PM me the ideas around the infohazard, but not the infohazard itself. I'd really rather not get it.

I swear, it feels like you're priming us away from what it could be.

Uggggghhhh! I can't think of what could possibly be natural that could cause pain for a week. The only method would be if the pain was already there, but people just started to pay attention to it until they forget about it.

Can it be spread through text alone? Or a picture? Sound? Video?

I vaguely remember a real cognitohazard, that had something to do with red and green lines or something.

Please satisfy my curiosity slightly! I beg you!

    5% chance of, quote "extreme negative response - something akin to torture. The ensuing week - pretty shitty."
  #+end_quote

  This must be an /extremely/ bad pun.

Is it an a pun that's the infohazard? Or is it knowledge of actual shit that makes the week bad? Is it literal pain, like shit I stubbed my toe/stepped on a Lego/have a cut, but worse?

Ugh!

Edit 2:

Was the pain from a response from someone doing something after learning it, like face-desking too hard?
