The exact conditions for how Shia identifies the source or degrees of connection aren't clear: is ordering someone to learn the name from the phonograph the same as ordering them to use it? Is an oblique reference from Earth that doesn't actually /teach/ them the name (since the dreamskewered already know it) the same as introducing them to the name for the first time (i.e. knowledge of Shia as a threat required)?

If the conditions are very broad (e.g. just sharing the existence of the infohazard), there will be a risk no matter how they choose to let the dreamskewered know. Only way to avoid the risk is to act out of pure self-interest and just ignore the chance of an accident.
