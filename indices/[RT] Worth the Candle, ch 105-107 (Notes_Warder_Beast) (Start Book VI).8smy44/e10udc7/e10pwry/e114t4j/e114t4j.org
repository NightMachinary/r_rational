The most clearly munchkinable magic item Bethel has is probably the Repeated Crossbow's unlimited ammo of any non-magical type. Mary can make a gun that shoots only silver bullets, now you have unlimited silver to trade for gold to pay Grak (and fund the nation). I assume Grak would object to just creating gold directly. I wonder if Valencia counts as non-magical--you could probably craft a cannon that can only fire non-anima of her size (requires a sentient to operate it from the inside, malfunctions in the presence of a soul), and duping her could let her harrow hell.
