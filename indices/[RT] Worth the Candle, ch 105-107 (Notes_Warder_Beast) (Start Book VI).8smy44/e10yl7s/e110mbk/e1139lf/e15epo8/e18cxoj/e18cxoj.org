Heck, they have in fact found a working use for it - That is why Amaryllis knows it. The high echelons of their government all know it, which is a horrifying insurance policy against kidnapping. - They learn about it from a phonograph. No back lash there. They elect to use it on their own recognizance - so no chain of command for him to work up. High collateral damage to any innocents nearby, but also pretty much guaranteed death to the people responsible. - This may be where they got the data about odds of a single utterance being successful - if Amaryllis is not an extreme outlier in terms of what kind of person the court educates, I can easily see a kidnapped princes and princesses of the realm taking notes even as they are committing mass-murder/suicide.
