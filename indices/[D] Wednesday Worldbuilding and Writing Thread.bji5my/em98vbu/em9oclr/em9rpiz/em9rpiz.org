  for plot, i would go with a man who uses a different matchmaking method than the woman he ends up with (and leaving it unclear if its the best possible match, just that its a good match).

I don't know if I will use your suggestions of levels of information accessibility, but it makes perfect sense that there has to be multiple ways of understanding soul marks and multiple ways of determining potential compatibility no matter how straight forward. Thanks for the plot suggestion.
