There are certain practical problems if [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/9/][each person is limited to only one soulmate]].

There are three possible solutions to this.

--------------

The first possible solution is that people are /not/ limited to a /single/ soulmate. Perhaps the soulmarks describe the person's personality in some way, and elderly monks have been spending generations transcribing lists of marks that fit together well and lead to strong relationships; the result being a very large book in which you can look up your mark and see what mark best matches it. Neither your mark nor the presumed matching mark are unique; there's a few hundred or so different marks, but ten minutes at the local Mark Registry will give you a list of addresses to visit. (Or to avoid, if you have a particularly rebellious personality).

--------------

The second option is to have the marks be /non-random/ in some way. Perhaps you are guaranteed to, at some point in your life, meet your soulmate; and, somehow, that meeting echoes back through history and results in a mark. Now you have temporal shenanigans in your story on top of potential emotional magic; the soulmarks change the timeline by appearing, though, so they're presumably going to find a timeline that maximises or minimises some value. (Given that these things have presumably evolved alongside humanity, there's a definite argument to be made in favour of the idea that the soulmarks will want to maximise the number of humans in the next generation; particularly violent people might find a soulmate who discourages them from killing, for example, and a doctor might end up stuck with a soulmate he completely loathes just so he spends more time at his workplace, saving lives).

--------------

The third option is a soulmark that locates its match. Perhaps it grows warmer as one gets closer, or lights up with the strength of the light proportional to the distance to your soulmate. Or perhaps you just always know the direction of your soulmate in the back of your mind. (An explorer with a stay-at-home soulmate might use this to never get lost in the jungle - which gets him in big trouble when he's out in said jungle and his soulmate dies, leaving him unable to figure out which way is north because he never bothered to learn the mundane ways of doing that).
