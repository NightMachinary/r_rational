I've been wondering how to write a romance story in a way that's compelling to this subreddit, and I feel one solution is to involve a magical system that directly relates to romance. It allows for some interesting munchkining without focusing only on relationship drama which would bore people here fast if that's all there is to the story.

So I've been playing around with the tropes of soulmarks by deconstructing them and showing how a society with soulmarks would play out if soulmarks are actually a thing.

The part I've been thinking about is /what does a soulmark actually entail?/

It's not a clear answer if you think it means a romantic relationship between two people. Because there are people who don't care about romance (aromantics), everyone has very different opinions on what romance means, there are people who think romance isn't limited to one other person (polyamory), and even more issues with the murky meaning of romance.

After a while it gets fairly complicated and requires an intelligent mind to set up all of the soulmarks. I want to make it more like a law of nature with very simple rules but with very complicated behavior.

So is there a simpler metric that the soulmark can measure which people then (mistakenly) think actually means a guaranteed romantic relationship?

I'm tentatively considering soulmarks to be an indicator of someone who would have the most growth of happiness over the course of combined lifespans.

Systems for measuring emotions would help too.
