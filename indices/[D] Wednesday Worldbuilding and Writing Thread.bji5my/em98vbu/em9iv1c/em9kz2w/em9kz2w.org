  a magical system that directly relates to romance

This scared me until I read the rest of your post, because my first thought on reading that was "guy can cast spells and (gives himself a harem)/(makes the most attractive woman in the world fall in love with him)" and if you want to read /that/ sort of story [[http://www.mcstories.com][www.mcstories.com]] (NSFW) will have plenty.

But yeah.... this should go without saying but make sure any romance magic doesn't go in the "getting people to fall in love" category but more in the "providing information to make good decisions" category.

The soulmarks are going to be, essentially, tattoos that people are born with that match their soulmate's? My first thought is there's a system similar to astrology but That Actually Works, so depending on your "sign", you'll have one of several different soulmarks - there could be hundreds. Astrologers would read the soulmarks - maybe there's a diamond soulmark and a square soulmark and you need yours interpreted to find out what it is. Maybe the part of the body it appears on matters.

"under the hood" it could depend on something like... hormone levels (maybe they appear at puberty so the personality is "locked in"?)

Anyway, there'd be a whole dating system that lines should date other lines or squares but under no circumstances should a blob date another blob because they're just not compatible. It's not perfect (some of the relationships fail/etc) but people still believe in it because it's the culture, and ultimately the line-soulmark does end up married to a square-soulmark just a different one than had the really unsuccessful relationship with.... SO THE SYSTEM WORKS?

Probably too cynical and not magical enough for what you were after though!
