In real-world relationships, you need some degree of initial compatibility and common priorities.

But, at some point, the initial conditions fade into the background. I'm a pretty different person at 38 than I was at 22, so the fact that my wife and I were compatible when we were both 22-year-olds isn't sustaining our relationship now. Instead, the thing that dominates is the way that we've shaped one another through our shared experiences.

So, you're probably not a best-possible-match for your partner when you start a relationship. It's statistically unlikely. But when a few decades pass? Then you really are in a position to understand them in a way that literally no other person on earth does.

If I wanted to do soul-marks, I'd just turn that dynamic up to 11.

Maybe, when you meet someone who's compatible, you make a connection that gives you a limited form of empathy. In super-strong cases, it might even be a limited form of telepathy. Or maybe there's an effect where the bond makes you share lucid dreams with the other person when you both sleep. The bond gets stronger as it's used more.

That creates a fairly simple example of magical romance to start with: Romeo meets Juliette as a teenager, and they bond. From then on, they're secret confidants who are there to share each other's jokes, reassure one another when they're feeling insecure, and help in times of crisis. The marriage when they come of age would be a good match for non-magical reasons. Romeo and Juliette have shaped one another.

And that premise creates a bunch of interesting dynamics to play with. What if I'm just really close to a platonic, same-sex friend? How does a new girlfriend feel about the fact that I already have an omnipresent confidante?

Or, we could say that the strength of the bond goes as (innate potential Ã— intimacy). So what if you have a love triangle where the 2 bonds are equally strong, but one person is just innately more psychic?
