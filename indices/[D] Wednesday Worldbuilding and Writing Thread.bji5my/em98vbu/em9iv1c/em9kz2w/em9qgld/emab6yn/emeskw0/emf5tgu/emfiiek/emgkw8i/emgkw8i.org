Aside from as a trope in anime (magic is powered/boosted by emotion), or stories where it was apparent to the reader that things worked that way, though it was not really mentioned in story. (There's also the odd "this sword may only be wielded by the pure in heart" (which refers to good as opposed to evil) - but it can actually be wielded by some heroes or villains.)

There are magic systems that include it (thought it is not the only thing going on):

(Explicit magic system.) Technically it could be done in alexander's Dark wizard book - dark magic is powered by sacrifice, and the oath based area involves swearing off something you want** and getting benefits that increase over time (never decrease) but all go away if you break any of these magic oaths once. (So if you really didn't want to fall in love (or with someone in particular) maybe you could use something like that for an oath~sacrifice.)

(Explicit example, but not an explicit magic system.) There's a lot of series with one off powers, with no obvious rhyme or reason to them, and they're kind of rare, and there's a romance novel somewhere* where one of the characters gains powers from other people's love (or maybe happiness), though eventually they find out it can be powered by their emotions/whatever. (This takes them a long time.)

*I can't think of the title off-hand.

**Perhaps a clever person might do it in advance, so they can reap the benefits even if they're not aware. (Thought there'd still be the usual risks.)
