  romance magic doesn't go in the "getting people to fall in love" category but more in the "providing information to make good decisions" category.

Heh, yeah I definitely plan on the spells being in the category where you get a lot of information about possible matches, but there won't be any magic that can affect emotions in any way. Maybe one for the ability to feel another person's emotions via an empathy spell.

I like the astrology suggestion. Making the mark open to interpretation in various ways can lead to multiple different potential relationships, and you choose which person to 'pursue' depending on your priorities in life (workaholic team, couple who wants a big family, globe-trotting duo, or something else). Of course, there's no reason why the other person would agree if they are after a completely different type of relationship.
