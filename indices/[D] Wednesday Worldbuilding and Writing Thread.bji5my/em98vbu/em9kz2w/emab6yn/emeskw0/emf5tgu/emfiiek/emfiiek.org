I just reread your comment and just realized you were referring to

#+begin_quote
  the soulmark disappears when the bearer of its twin(/etc.) dies. Or, soulmarks duplicate (some of) pain*. Or allow body swapping*.
#+end_quote

I didn't see the asterisk mark and thought you were referring to

#+begin_quote
  Loving others gives you power, or gives them power.
#+end_quote

Do you have any examples of that?
