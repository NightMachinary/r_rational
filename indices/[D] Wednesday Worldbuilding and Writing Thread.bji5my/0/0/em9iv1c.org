I mean, depending on how hard your magic system is going to be, and how dark your world is, there are a number of options. I'll list a few.

1) The Soulmark measures relationship strength in a memetic manner. One option is to have it based off of a memeplex - it finds how strong each person in the world would find a given relationship if they knew all the details, and assigns it a value based of the average of this value, or the median, or whatever. This accommodates for changes in the perception of romance over time, and the formation of new types of acceptable relationships.

2) The soulmark is still measuring based of perceptions, but instead it only does so on the perceptions of those who know about the relationship. How they perceive it depends on its strength - so an abusive relationship carried out by a charismatic abuser could be quite strong. Revealing the flaws in a relationship to the wider populace could cause the power to weaken. Again, strength can be based on average, total, or median romantic level perceived.

3) The Soulmark is precognitive, and measures future levels of romanticness (by another method) to determine strength. A 'true' couple which will last for a long time will gain a larger amount, perhaps. Of course, this is still open to abuse.

4) The soulmark measures romance levels based on hormone levels, either at the time or on average. Depending on the hormones used, 'battle couples' could appear, who take drugs during battle to amplify romantic strength while tricking the mark. The mark can have varying levels of intelligence and knowledge of these tactics as needed - it may even want to see people abuse the concept if you go for a concept like a big bad who wants to prove relationships mean nothing.

5) The Soulmark measures something different for each person based on them personally. Perhaps it is doing this to manipulate them, for good or ill, or maybe it just thinks it's helping. One person may grow stronger depending on perception, another based on happy hormones, another based off physical closeness, etc. But this only works with the chosen partner/s.

6) The relationship is actually the other way around - the Soulmark gains power naturally based on some possibly unrelated unknown criteria, and as it does so forces the target to get deeper into romantic relationships for whatever reason, manipulating them in subtle or overt ways. Maybe at high levels of power, individuals start to develop extremely unhealthy tendencies to maintain their relationship, such as induced nymphomania, stalking, a need for closeness, and so on. This could be good for a darker setting.

7) The Soulmarks are sapient, and want to learn. They reward their hosts for teaching them more about romance, delving deeper into the host's mind as time goes on to find out their thoughts. They reward the host for finding out more about their relationship, it getting stronger and such. Introspection and time with their partner are great ways of doing this.

8) The Soulmarks are sapient, and judges. Maybe sent by the Gods, maybe implants from birth, but they judge based off their own criteria and award or punish based off that. Maybe one thinks gifts mean love, and punish their financially unstable host for not giving lavish gifts to his humble girlfriend, whose host instead values physical contact to an uncomfortable level. Could get very bright or dark with this.

9) The Soulmark has strict, well-defined breaking points for more power, completely missing the subtleties of a healthy relationship. Maybe it gives a boost for finding love of a certain type, then first kiss, then sex, etc. Either way, people use and abuse these rules for easy boosts in power - though certain stages require complicated rituals that would normally require a romantically involved or trusting partner, or perhaps huge amounts of wealth or pain tolerance. These can be relatively innocent, or get darker as stages are pushed through.

That's all I have for now - hope it helped!
