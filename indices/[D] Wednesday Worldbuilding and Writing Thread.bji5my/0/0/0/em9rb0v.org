  1. The Soulmarks are sapient, and want to learn. They reward their hosts for teaching them more about romance, delving deeper into the host's mind as time goes on to find out their thoughts. They reward the host for finding out more about their relationship, it getting stronger and such. Introspection and time with their partner are great ways of doing this.

This one is really interesting and I like the idea of a passenger (ala Worm) where it's a mind with a completely alien perspective with no understanding of romance, but gives rewards based on what it thinks it understands. I'm thinking of how if the mind is somewhat ant-like, then it would consider a relationship heavily connected to the community at large more sensible than a more private one. But of course there are couples who are only concerned with appearances over actual emotional connections which is counter to an actually healthy relationship.

  1. The soulmark measures romance levels based on hormone levels, either at the time or on average. Depending on the hormones used, 'battle couples' could appear, who take drugs during battle to amplify romantic strength while tricking the mark. The mark can have varying levels of intelligence and knowledge of these tactics as needed - it may even want to see people abuse the concept if you go for a concept like a big bad who wants to prove relationships mean nothing.

I think this is the one that I might actually go with. I was thinking of psychological measurements and researching subjective systems for measuring emotions. But having the mark measure hormones, or more specifically the amount of oxytocin (also known as the "love chemical"), and setting the world in an era without much modern knowledge of the body works very nicely for my purposes. Thanks!
