If you want dark then:

the soulmark disappears when the bearer of its twin(/etc.) dies. Or, soulmarks duplicate (some of) pain*. Or allow body swapping*.

You will learn something important from the relationship (no romantic connotations are assumed). For an example* from something published: a wizard ends up with a goblin as (basically) a familiar. The connection makes the goblin smarter, and they use that for evil, but eventually don't fit in with their own kind, and eventually become good. Years later the wizard asks the goblin what he got out of the deal (these things have mutual benefit, and God comes up with the pairs). And the goblin says "You were gullible (and foolish/naive)."

  this should go without saying but make sure any romance magic doesn't go in the "getting people to fall in love" category but more in the "providing information to make good decisions" category.

There's a lot more options. Loving others gives you power, or gives them power.

*I've seen an example of this in writing. (Or something close.)
