first, soulmarks can change over time, as people change.

next, not all information is understood, and not all information is observed. some information requires specific tools (or rituals) to view, with different levels that get more difficult to view. this adds uncertainty, but allows money to solve most of the problem. you can also have experts argue over some specific details.

third, soulmarks should say very broad and general things on the top level- orientation, identity, if you like risk. on a deeper level, you see more specific details, preferences, and dislikes.

as a result, top-level data (the most easily observed, and the best understood) ends up being used in court cases (like dna is used today). this may include scars from trauma (ptsd), or age spots (alzheimers, dementia). personality type.

second-level data will have multiple approaches for fortune-telling, matchmaking, and medical diagnosis. psychiatry may use it heavily, as most mental illness would be at this level. some lunatics say they can change your soulmark, but those are mostly quacks who hurt people.

for plot, i would go with a man who uses a different matchmaking method than the woman he ends up with (and leaving it unclear if its the best possible match, just that its a good match).
