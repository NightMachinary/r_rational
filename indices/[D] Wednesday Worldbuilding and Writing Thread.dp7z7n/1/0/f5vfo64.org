The protagonists/victims of a horror movie usually don't know that they're in a supernatural horror setting. This is despite some of the things that happen being quite blatant (any slasher movie is going to kill enough people in a short enough span that there ought to be some sort of investigation). So my first assumption is that one of the easier, more common, and/or stronger supernatural powers helps keep secrets. Some sort of antimemes or magical counter-espionage. This means that every mystic secret society I've ever heard of (illuminati and such) is a fraud, and any real organizations that experiment on the supernatural are much better hidden.

So if I was trying to do something like using Chucky dolls for transhumanist life extension, my first steps would be to try to figure out what's maintaining supernatural secrecy and whether it can be counteracted, because once I pierce the veil I might find other people who are already further along in their research.

Also I'd check what the conditions for being a vampire are; sounds much more fun than being a doll. I assume they need to drink fresh human blood in some way that's defined more mystically than chemically, but I'd want to figure out what the minimal amount of humanness is according to the magic (a la the smiley face maximizer), and see if mass producing that is ethical.
