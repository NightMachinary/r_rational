  This means that every mystic secret society I've ever heard of (illuminati and such) is a fraud, and any real organizations that experiment on the supernatural are much better hidden

What better way to hide things than in plain sight? Nobody will believe the tinfoil hats, especially once you go on a whole-of-media campaign to delegitimise them as crazy and deluded. It helps that some are crazy and deluded, even the majority.

Likewise, what better place to hide your mindcontrol drugs than in vaccines? Everybody knows anti-vaxxers are lunatics and wrong, that they've been debunked a million times. Nobody's going to listen to anything that says the opposite. Papers certainly aren't going to publish such findings, even without nefarious involvement.

Same goes for chemtrails and fluoridated water.
