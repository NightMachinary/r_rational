I'd imagine the [[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Course_Pages/legal_systems_very_different_12/LegalSystemsDraft.html][legal system would look very different]]. In particular, I think the main source of enforcement would be the threat of someone swearing revenge, which becomes more of a threat as the vengeful party is likely willing to take risks to power-level themselves and they can choose a build that counters their aggressor.

One option would be for it to work like [[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Course_Pages/legal_systems_very_different_12/Book_Draft/Systems/IrishLawChapter.html][pre-Norman Ireland]], where your social rank (level?) determines your honour-price, a measure of your value to your kinsmen. Killings incur a blood-debt which depends on the honour-price of both the victim and their kinsmen. In your setting, this honour-price would likely be similarly exponential, and would protect the families of high-level adventurers.

I'd really recommend reading the book, or at least the [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/13/book-review-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/][SlateStarCodex summary]], it's a great resource for worldbuilding.

Another factor that's worth considering is motivation: what drives people to seek more? When you've reached a level where you can live comfortably at a subsistence level, why go further? This might be one of the limiting factors of the Lord of the Flies-style dumping kids in the dungeon - once they're strong enough to survive, why would they risk their lives further?

I mentioned revenge already as a powerful motivator, and I'd imagine the state that can first develop a viable propaganda machine or magic with similar effects would have a significant advantage with or without unethical childcare practices.
