My guiding thought is how to try and fit mechanics into a recognizable world, just with dungeons and levels and magic.

Currently my plan for multi-classing is that you can only have one class primary and active at a time. Whatever is active gets the kill exp, but doing something like baking or smithing would level up those inactive classes. You can use the spells/abilities/stats of any class you have, but all classes decay whether or not you're using them, with unused classes atrophying faster. You can change classes by devoting yourself towards a different one and your active class is whatever's most central to your identity, so changing you active class gets harder the more total levels you have. Shifting and undoing decay is much faster than leveling the first time. A 14 year old being taught baking will have an easy time becoming a baker and pick it up in a few months. A extremely skilled 40 year old mercenary could gain the baking abilities at the same rate of the 14 year old, but it'd take years and years to change his class to baker if it ever happens. And just a bit of fighting would bring him back to warrior again.

Eg, my goal is for both our culture and the magic one to have stories be recognizably similar between John Wick, or Anakin Skywalker, or Logan. It's just that their version of John Wick would be literally invisible and teleporting and their Anakin Skywalker would be lied to that the Sith Lord class has a top tier healing spell.

That results in a more elegant solution to 'what class is Robert Baratheon'. If every class is constantly decaying bit by bit, then he is still a warrior who's fallen from practice since he never actually went about governing. He still thinks that with his mace and a reason to go fight, he'd be back cracking skulls in no time, which might even be true. That also solves the demographic issue about bakers/patissiers. Bakers aren't hard to level, but the amount and intensity of baking a normal baker does will eventually only be keeping them up at their highest level attained after a decade. A savant baker (2x exp) could overcome a mediocre baker that had 10 years of practice in 1 year instead of needing 5, which is more true to life.

I think that would be accurate for combat families. Non-combat families would likely pay for someone else to do it. A level 100 Chef is better than a level 20 chef in combat but not amazing like a warrior would be, plus they still need to keep up their day job.

I imagine that still happens a lot. No kid grows up dreaming of being a baker even if that's what their parents want and the village needs. All the strongest people with prestige and stories about them spend their days conquering the dungeon. The dungeon gives kids an easy way to support themselves while following their dream, and they might just take it and risk the consequences. Kids are bad at risk assessment after all.
