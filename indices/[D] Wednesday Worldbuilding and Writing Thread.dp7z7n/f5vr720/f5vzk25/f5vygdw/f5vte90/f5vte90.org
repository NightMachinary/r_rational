  If you toss all your country's of boys into the dungeon at random, whoever survives a couple of years is much more likely to be on the higher end of the 'killing things' bell-curve. Assuming it's heritable, after even a handful of generations you end up with a whole civilization of amazing adventurers. Also polygamous, since 80% of your men would be dead before 20y/o.

Toss the girls and enbies in, too! Nothing beats hatefucking your nemesis in the guts of the dragon you just killed together.

But you're forgetting your own lore: the adventuring classes are not the only ones; the economy needs people to level in Baking and Weaving and Masonry and Elder Care as much as it needs dungeon-delvers.

A solution to the self-sovereign tyrant warrior-nobles you describe is a peasantry that cultivates a middle class in order to ensure there's enough wealth in town to hire a ronin or five to deal with uppity nobles.

If an unstoppable god-noble wishes to be more than a mendicant or peregrine knight, that noble must find someone who consents to be ruled by the noble. Declaring that everything within sight belongs to the noble is a good way for the noble to convince someone in town to quietly kill the noble, or have the town shun the noble. The noble would run up against the sort of problem frequently discussed in policing-by-consent and anarchist circles: if you use violence against your community, your community will quickly cease to be yours.
