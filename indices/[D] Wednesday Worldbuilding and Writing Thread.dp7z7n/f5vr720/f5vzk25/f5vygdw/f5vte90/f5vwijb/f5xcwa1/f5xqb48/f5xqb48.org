  No matter what, I assume the common person gets shit on. Law seems hard to enforce when an adventurer could just kill as they please.

If you want some degree of enforceable law, you can make Town Guard a class. Town Guards are more powerful than equal-leveled adventurers, but their class abilities only function when being used to maintain the locally-recognized legal structure. That may be use-contingent combat abilities, or something like a spell that summons manacles on every criminal within 15 feet.

You still have bandits between cities (especially if it's Town Guard and not just Guard). Guards don't do nearly as much killing as dungeon divers, so even if they're level-for-level more powerful than adventurers, they'll still be outleveled by some.
