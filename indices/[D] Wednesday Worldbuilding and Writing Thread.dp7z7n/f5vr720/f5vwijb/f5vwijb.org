You need merchants to exchange goods. Presumably some dungeons have different monsters, so there're incentives to trade. The nobles can't possibly do it all by themselves. They can't be in multiple places at once. It makes sense to have a cordial relationship with traders, they can help fund your missions to better dungeons and sell the stuff you don't need, want, or have too much of. Seize their wares and they'll find out and blacklist you.

Likewise with peasants. Can you really get everything you need from a dungeon? Every kind of food? Alchohol? Textiles? Furniture? Labour for building a fort/mansion?

How can a supreme ruler project power? He can enforce the grovelling submission of whoever's in the same county but what about beyond that? How does he know who's loyal and who's rebelling? Communication is slow and suspect. How can he find and hunt down anyone who opposes him, assuming they can hide? I could see a supreme ruler sitting in place, enjoying the luxuries of a great trading city on a crucial river location. Ruling a global empire is impossible with medieval technology.

Just make communication and transport slow and you get a fractured world. Rome was nothing without the Med, China depended upon its rivers.
