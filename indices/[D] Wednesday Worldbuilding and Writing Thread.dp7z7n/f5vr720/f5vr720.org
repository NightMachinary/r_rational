How would power dynamics and power structures be impacted by Dungeons and Leveling?

- Classes for all humans exist, and you level in your class by killing things or performing a class' action (eg, a baker baking), spells and magic items exist. Assume it's basically a standard 'dungeon fic' ruleset.\\

- Your class is a product of what you practice and what you have aptitude for (kinda like real life, anyone could be a musician, but lots of practice helps and being born with perfect pitch helps more). It can change eventually with effort. Assume skill is distributed on a bell-curve.\\

- Classes specialize as you level up. More combat classes are known because you get more exp by killing things. So any warrior that works hard will eventually become a sword saint that can pierce the heavens as long as they don't die and consistently dive the dungeon. Nearly all Bakers would die of old age before they could naturally rank-up into an Arch-Pâtisserie, unless they were an Einstien tier baking savant or bankrolled by someone able to provide them with crafting materials.

- All classes scale Geometrically with level, and exponentially if you count gear/support/rank-ups/tactics. So an Arch-Pâtisserie cooks faster, cooks better, and has a lower failure rate than a normal chef to make him 20x better than, but during his years he's also has also accumulated contacts with Sous-Chefs, a stock of better ingredients, and an enchanted Gastronomicon to make him 400x better.

- Dungeons have levels with monsters inside of them. Monsters drop loot. Loot gets better and monsters get stronger (exponentially) as you progress.

- Dungeons get stronger over time, and spawn monsters outside periodically, making any area around an uncontested dungeon uninhabitable eventually.

- Economically assume a new adventurer earns enough to survive just above poverty level, while the highest level of adventurers would earn the equivalent of CEO/Sports Superstar/Movie Star level pay, if money even changed hands at these tiers.

- I'm ballparking that 50% of adventurers die in the first year, and ~20% die each year thereafter. To reach the peak of skill normally takes 30 years, so 0.05% of adventurers reach.

- Everyone is actively trying to minmax the system, from raising children they think would be good support/healers by having them constantly pray, to the wealthy hiring adventurers to powerlevel them, to nobles passing down 'A-Tier' equipment to their adolescent children, to investors fronting the resources to powerlevel crafting classes.

--------------

My brainstorming starts here.

My first thought is that in such a situation, fuedalism would be the natural political structure. You've got a (necessary) warrior culture, who are able to create a stranglehold on power by passing down equipment and powerleveling kids.

However my second thought was that a 'free market' society would work out too. If you toss all your country's of boys into the dungeon at random, whoever survives a couple of years is much more likely to be on the higher end of the 'killing things' bell-curve. Assuming it's heritable, after even a handful of generations you end up with a whole civilization of amazing adventurers. Also polygamous, since 80% of your men would be dead before 20y/o. Although the setting runs into the problem of why such a civilization isn't overwhelmingly dominant due to 'bene gesserit breeding program' style power growth, since 80% seems like really heavy selective pressure.

In either situation, I assume whoever is the supreme ruler would have to be the strongest. With exponential power growth, if you are stronger than a given noble, then you're likely /way/ stronger, so you can just go in and kill them and take their stuff with little risk. The natural response to me would be to kill people (or marry them into the family) before they can become a threat, but the endgame result would be just a single noble house that reigns supreme. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem very 'medieval fanstasy' to me.

If I want to keep Game of Thrones style noble houses, I could maybe have each noble house specialize in a different class. They know all the secret skill synergies, best enchants, training regimens, and have gear to powerlevel their children. If the result of a fight is highly variable based on matchup, then that could keep things stable if there are alliances working together to shore up weaknesses. However, that's still an unstable equilibrium.

No matter what, I assume the common person gets shit on. Law seems hard to enforce when an adventurer could just kill as they please. You could have the law backed up by nobles (who are strong enough to take you out), but that doesn't explain what incentive the nobles would have to care about common people enough to make laws for commoners in the first place. Afterall, IRL, they barely did so even when they weren't walking demigods, so I don't see them doing it when they're 400x more powerful. Also, Fuedalism requires you to /want/ something from your feif. If the only things of real value to you are what you and your nearest servants can farm from the dungeon, then there's no reason not to rule over corpses while you and your retainers (and a handful of servants) only concern yourselves with dungeons.

How would priests and merchants work? I suppose priests could have some actual divine intervention to keep the church independent, but I'd prefer to keep the supernatural as constrained as possible. For merchants though I can't think of any good reason why unstoppable God-Nobles to bother with allowing them independence instead of just owning everything within their realm.
