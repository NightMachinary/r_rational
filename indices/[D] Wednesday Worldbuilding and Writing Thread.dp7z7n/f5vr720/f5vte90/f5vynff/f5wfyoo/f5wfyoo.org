you need guilds, and they probably have a merchantile mindset. guilds set prices, and only members can engage in that trade. logically, there will also be an adventurers guild that regulates dungeons.

you still get trade, not all goods exist in all climates, and dungeons likely produce different rare drops. gear likely has a large impact on survival for adventurers, but getting the good gear is a challenge on its own. guilds exist to help make that much much easier- the higher level members will grind lower level components, at low risk, to help the guild gear up more members for progression.

the main problem with the dungeon, is that it has hidden mechanics in it somewhere. if rare event X happens maybe 1/year, and rare event Z 1/decade, then nobody is ready when those happen. they are more likely to happen unseen on the deeper levels, and not the first, but statistically they will happen between you and the exit eventually.
