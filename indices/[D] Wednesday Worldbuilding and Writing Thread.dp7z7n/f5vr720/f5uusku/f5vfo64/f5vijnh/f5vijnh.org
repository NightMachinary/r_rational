easiest assumption, is that there are a large number of vampire variants.

i remember [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoulies_(film_series][Ghoulies]]), a series built around summoning these small monsters. horror-comedy, and some idiot has to let them into the world first.

if we allow for ghosts, then we assume the soul exists after death. so, avoiding death is no longer the primary goal- how do we instead maximize for the best immortal existance? this depends on availible afterlives. the existance of demons raises a lot of cause for concern overall.
