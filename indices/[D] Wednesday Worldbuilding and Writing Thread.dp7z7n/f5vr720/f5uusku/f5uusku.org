thursday is halloween, and the horror stories are on TV again. so lets think rational supernatural horror.

If we assume that supernatural horror exists (and please list sources for ideas you want to use, not everyone saw the same movies), what can we thus rationally deduce about the world? how do we then use that to our own benefit?

ghosts, demons, and magic are the most common unexplained elements, such as Chucky being able to move his soul into a doll that can then keep coming back from the dead. if you skip the psycho murder part, that sounds like a very advantageous transhuman solution to death if you have properly sophisticated vessels for people to move their souls into as they die. bonus points if we save your DNA so we can eventually clone you, and get you back into your own body again.
