Consider Wings of Fire. There are three main magics the dragons in the series possess: precognition, mind reading, and animus powers. Precognition and mind reading are gained depending on how many of the three full moons in the setting shine on a Nightwing dragon's egg. Animus powers are genetic with no known source. They work along these lines:

Precognition randomly grants spoken words or visions in the form of prophecy. Visions are easily subverted by the actions of the seer, but it is implied to be much harder to change the outcome of spoken prophecies. Only Nightwings can become seers unless an animus interferes.

Mind reading allows an individual to hear the thoughts of those in the vicinity, with range and clarity depending on the strength of the ability. Only Nightwings can become mind readers unless an animus interferes.

Animus powers are bullshit. An individual can create enchanted objects that can convey any power up to and including that of the animus themself. Possibilities of enchantments include complete invulnerability, planetwide negation of other animus powers and enchantments, directly granting or revoking animus powers in other individuals, super speed, teleportation, permanent portals, dream telepathy, the granting of antimemetic properties to objects or individuals, the location of anything up to and including antimemetic individuals or objects regardless of distance, and more. The only drawback is that the more one uses animus powers, the more ‘evil' they get, which comes in the form of a lack of empathy and increased willingness to harm others in the pursuit of goals. This limitation can be subverted by converting the cost into a physical disability, or the advancement of ‘evilness' can be measured by more animus powers, but a price must be paid. Considering what animus powers can do, though, any intelligent individual can easily think of a dozen ways to get around that. Anyone can possess animus powers.

How the hell do you balance this clusterfuck?
