  Interesting. That might help. Although, my goal is to make classes an outgrowth of what you do instead of what you are, so I'm not sure how I could translate to being a king.
#+end_quote

So, in order to level up as a King, you need to spend time actually running a Kingdom? Handling Kingly decisions, that sort of thing?

Makes sense - and importantly, means that a puppet king or king-in-name-only controlled by higher-level Warriors won't level up (because he's not the one doing the kinging).

  I need to decide on how classes are gained. Eg, would Robert Baratheon be an extremely skilled warrior who hasn't used it in ages? Or would he be supernaturally good at drinking wine and banging wenches after decades of practice? Or would he be a king, because he's the king, so obviously he's been king-ing all this time? I've seen all 3 styles in stories.

Maybe he's multi-classed. Level 15 Warrior, level 2 King, level 30 Hedonist. Something like that.

  Yes. Although a baker who spends 90% of his time killing instead of baking will probably not stay a baker for long.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. But would he keep his Baking-related Skills? Because this sounds like a situation which would lead to multiclassing.

  There would probably still be a minor bump in risk whenever they're finally on their own unsupervised, but it'd be mitigated significantly.

It seems likely, then, that most successful families would raise their children through a level or two in the Dungeon; because families that do that would survive better. Note that this doesn't prevent orphans or imports from other worlds from being just dumped in the Dungeon with nothing more than clothes, a sword, and hope...

  even keeping it to low magic level, having a merchant as someone who can accurately asses the value of goods
#+end_quote

Another example of the use of a Merchant class. I think it's important that every last Class needs to have something that's useful to others; such that, if the Class is suddenly absent (e.g. the last Baker in the village dies), then people feel that loss and there's social pressure to find (or raise) a replacement. It might even make sense for high-level Bakers (or whatever) to train up apprentices - partially because training up an Apprentice is probably a great way to level up /any/ class, partially because the Apprentice is a son or daughter or cousin and the Baker wants to give him a good start in life, and partially because the village will still need a Baker after this one dies...
