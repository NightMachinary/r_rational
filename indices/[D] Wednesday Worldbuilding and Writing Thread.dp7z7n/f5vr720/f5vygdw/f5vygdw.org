  In either situation, I assume whoever is the supreme ruler would have to be the strongest.

Not necessarily.

There pretty much has to be a King or a Noble class, and this could very well give benefits to the people under the ruler's rule. For example, imagine Freddy the fiftieth-level fighter, who can kill just about anything - and Karl the second-level King, who automatically gives all his subjects a +2 to their attack rolls (+4 when fulfilling a Royal Decree).

While Freddy /could/ easily squash Karl, it's actually more to Freddy's benefit for Karl to rule, because then Freddy gets to hit harder when he goes to the dungeon. Sure, Freddy might dictate to Karl what his Royal decrees should be, and Karl might be the ruler in name only (at least until he's gained a few more levels in King)... but Karl doesn't need to be the strongest in order to rule.

  you level in your class by killing things

Does this apply to /all/ classes? Can a Baker get better at Baking by killing monsters? (Does it help if he then bakes using the monsters he killed as ingredients?)

Is it possible for a high-level adventurer to help a low-level adventurer level up through those difficult early levels (kindof babysitting in areas of the dungeon that are easy for the high-level guy)? That sort of behaviour can dramatically improve early-level survivability.

  For merchants though I can't think of any good reason why unstoppable God-Nobles to bother with allowing them independence instead of just owning everything within their realm.

Perhaps a Merchant class gets skills that can affect things that the merchant (and only the merchant) owns - like turning them into other items of similar value, or merging many weak items to create a stronger item. Then Freddy the fiftieth-level fighter has plenty of reason to keep Manny the Merchant around - not even Freddy can wield twenty +1 swords at once, but he would love to have the single +10 sword that Manny can make from them.
