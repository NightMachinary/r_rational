I appreciate the response. I didn't mention two assumptions which impact the points.

- My goal is as to maximize verisimilitude in a medieval fantasy world, while keeping it recognizably medieval.

- Dungeons can drop anything in the logistic chain from metal or to completed weapons, or grain to fully baked bread, or any other item. If a high level party is farming 2000x what a normal person can farm, they've got more than their needs covered.

The first means that men get tossed in for the same reason they got conscripted back in the day. Guys are stronger and have something to prove. Also I'm making an assumption that any situation where you've got huge power disparities between entrenched elder men and weak weak boys ends up in a society with polygyny, like what goes on today in certain Mormon enclaves or huge swaths of Africa and the Middle East. They'd just toss them out like the Mormon 'lost boys' only the dungeon is more convenient and socially acceptable.

For a noble, there's a good argument to be made for having *a* village for access to all the non-combat classes, but I can't think of a reason to have two villages in even the most expansive lands.

Maybe I should back up a bit. I common situation I see in stories with monsters/dungeons/etc. is that the main characters are too self sufficient. Even when the character doesn't have godlike powers, they'll typically bunker down with a small self sufficient community they pick up, and then live off the land (usually via hunting delicious monster drops in a dungeon).

Trade doesn't matter since you can can build your power by leveling up / cultivating / crafting from what you kill. So these communities of <50 people become fully self sufficient states that need nothing from anyone and just build up power. It's the very inward failure state that reminds me of Wuxia style Cultivators. I'm trying to figure out why a noble wouldn't do that.

(Note: Even Worth the Candle has it! Prior to Bethel leaving, Joon had established a city-state that had no need of food or trade. Except for the narrative pushing them, they could build up arbitrarily large armies indefinitely just by waiting.)

I'm amenable to trying to solve the problem by saying something like dungeons don't drop food, but I'm not sure if that'd actually solve it, since a person would be self sufficient for everything else and just forage for food.
