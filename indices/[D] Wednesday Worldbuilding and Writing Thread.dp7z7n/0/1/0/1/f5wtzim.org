  Interesting. That might help. Although, my goal is to make classes an outgrowth of what you do instead of what you are, so I'm not sure how I could translate to being a king.

I doubt that King would be a class then. Instead, you would have Politician or Legislator or Manager or Coordinator, which describe what a person does, and beyond that, allow them to be held by a much wider range of people. After all, a feudal system has a whole bunch of different levels, if you're going that route, you probably want a class that can handle a baron, duke, count, king, etc. If you don't want the system to implicitly/explicitly back feudalism, then you can keep the class as generic as possible, capable of being adapted by different forms of government.
