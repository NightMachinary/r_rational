  King or Noble Class
#+end_quote

Interesting. That might help. Although, my goal is to make classes an outgrowth of what you do instead of what you are, so I'm not sure how I could translate to being a king.

I need to decide on how classes are gained. Eg, would Robert Baratheon be an extremely skilled warrior who hasn't used it in ages? Or would he be supernaturally good at drinking wine and banging wenches after decades of practice? Or would he be a king, because he's the king, so obviously he's been king-ing all this time? I've seen all 3 styles in stories.

I suppose I should also mention that nobody (except the main character) would know exactly what a class was. Normal people would do the ritual to feel a person's soul and see that someone's spirit felt warm and fluffy like baked bread and that it feels so big it's about to burst. Then if they ever met another baker they could identify it easily. But only the MC would be able to look at someone and see "lvl 25 baker(ready for rank up promotion)".

  Does this apply to all classes?
#+end_quote

Yes. Although a baker who spends 90% of his time killing instead of baking will probably not stay a baker for long.

  high-level adventurer to help a low-level adventurer

Absolutely. There would probably still be a minor bump in risk whenever they're finally on their own unsupervised, but it'd be mitigated significantly. The numbers I threw out are for traditional 'find a sword, go make your fortune!' kinda stories.

  Merchant Class
#+end_quote

It makes sense. Real life merchants do provide value-add. Heck, even keeping it to low magic level, having a merchant as someone who can accurately asses the value of goods and connect you to people means that Freddy could be sure the sword he's buying from another adventurer Carl is a +10, if Manny acts as the assessor, instead of needing to go kill 1000 slimes to figure out if it's a +9 or +10. (Side note: I just realized what kind of a D&D/MMO sensibilities I have when I'm fine if a wizard teleports, but a merchant turning 20x +1 swords into a +10 sword being too Imbalanced.)
