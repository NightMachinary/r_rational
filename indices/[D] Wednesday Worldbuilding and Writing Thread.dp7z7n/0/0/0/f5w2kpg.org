Those look like some really good resources. I'll definitely keep reading them.

I'd already been planning setting the story on the border of two cultures so this really helps me flesh things out.

(Edit: Reading more, this might be even more of a goldmine than I first thought. Thanks!)

I supposed I had taken it for granted that everyone would just want to keep leveling up indefinitely, since that's how many stories go. I suppose there would be some people wanting to do that, and just a couple would be enough for the story's purposes. But yeah, I gotta remember that most people would be act like typcial humans.

The typical mage probably hits the level they get a lightning AOE spell then just spends the next 20 years building up a retirement nest-egg on the 'lightning vulnerability' dungeon floor long past the time they stop leveling up in the zone.
