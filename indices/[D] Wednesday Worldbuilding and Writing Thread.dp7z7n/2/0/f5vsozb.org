It would seem that the animus powers are already balanced by the lack of permanent effects, because animus powers can override each other. In this setting, the answer to the question "Can God create a rock so heavy that He could not lift it?" is "Yes, and then tomorrow He would lift it."

This is a setting in which near-omnipotence is close at hand.

What do you mean by "balanced"?
