I like this idea. It's non-canon because there's a character called Darkstalker that's been embedded in stone charmed with animus powers to sleep for centuries which only stopped working when the bracelet was physically destroyed, and his previous enchantment to make himself invulnerable is still operating after he's freed, and there are also animus artifacts originating at or before his time which still work, but that stuff could all be retconned.
