Alright how's about this: due to some deep magic embedded in the moons, the world is purely deterministic. That's why prophecy works, after all - it's the only way the future can be predicted.

But all the chaos and nondeterminism and free will had to go /somewhere/. It expresses itself as Animus, an eternal wellspring of bullshit powers that follow no rules because they spring from pure chaos.

You might be able to block the spring for a time, to bind it against itself. But no matter how strong your willpower, no one can hold bullshit chaos powers back forever. There will always be some crack, some leak that the eternally rushing fountain of nonsense will use to escape its bonds.

So it's been tried before, it just never lasts. In fact, nothing made with Animus can ever be permanent - it might take years, but all Animus effects will either wear down or corrupt over time. Anyone who says otherwise is either misguided by propaganda or is actively spreading misinformation.
