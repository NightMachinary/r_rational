Nice incorporation of sound effects! The full-mouth-speaking particularly made me smile :)

There are a couple moments where I believe words or phrases got dropped from the recording: Leaf should say "So pretty..." after seeing the rapidash around 5:20, otherwise Blue just seems to be reacting to nothing. Also at around 9:00, she says "I've been around pokemon all my life," instead of "my mom's pokemon all my life," the lack of which makes the next part "she has this mincinno" confusing.

I feel like you're growing into the voices better too, each is coming off much more distinct. Do you do any voice acting or other projects like this?
