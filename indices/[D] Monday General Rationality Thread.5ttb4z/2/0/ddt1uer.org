I'd try to use it to grind my own skills and stats, including natural willpower. To avoid the homeless rubix cube genius syndrome, I would use carefully phrased goals with time and resource limits, safety clauses, and so on, particularly with the higher levels.

Math is the specific skill I'd probably use it to work on right away, since it is an easy one to get bored with but vital to a lot of other skills.

It seems like it would be easy to accidentally harm someone by making them over-focus on a goal. Could be extremely useful. If you were a teacher, you could use it on students to make them learn the material better. If you were a boss, you could make them do a better job at their work. You could probably make a great reputation for yourself as a motivational speaker.

Does the power continue to function when the person you are using it on is more than ten feet away, or do they return to normal as soon as they move out of your radius?

Also, is it purely additive, or does 0 represent a minimum of motivation? Would you accidentally demotivate people if you went around giving them a 1 on specific goals, or would it just make them slightly more motivated than they were before?
