Imagine you have the following power: You can set someone's motivation towards a particular goal from 0 to 10.

What would your first applications of this power be, if any? Whom would you use it on? What goals?

Clarifications:

- You can use the power on yourself.
- 0-10 scale is to the best of that person's max motivation. A 7 for Elon Musk might be higher than someone else's 9. That's just how that person's brain is wired, you can't change that.
- Use of the power could have unintended consequences. "I motivate myself 10 on figuring out Rubix's cube" might lead to you being a homeless Rubix Cube genius.
- Power has a range of 10 feet, need fairly clear direct line of sight to the target.
