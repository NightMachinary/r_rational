I have been reading The Gamer type fics lately, and one thing that stuck out is how useful it is to be able to grind more than one skill at a time. Like hopping on one foot to build dexterity while setting your hand on fire to build vitality and reading a math book to boost intelligence. But it's not exactly easy to do that kind of thing in real life.

So it occurred to me that you could maybe gain a skill called Multigrind, which relates to the ability to grind multiple skills simultaneously. If you could level that skill up, you could do crazy stuff like practice the violin while drawing artwork with your toes and doing math drills in your head. At first you'd suck and not get much out of it, but at high levels it would be super effective. It is different from Multitask because it has to do with focused practice and thus improving your skills rather than just getting stuff done.

Aside from being useful to justify rapid growth in The Gamer style fics, can anyone attest to gaining a nonfictional version of this skill? Or just passively benefiting from multiple types of practice at the same time? I'm wondering if people who end up highly skilled might just be really good at multigrinding. (Apparently there are bonuses to math from studying music -- maybe e.g. Einstein studied both simultaneously? Maybe Barack Obama practices his oratory skills while playing basketball?)
