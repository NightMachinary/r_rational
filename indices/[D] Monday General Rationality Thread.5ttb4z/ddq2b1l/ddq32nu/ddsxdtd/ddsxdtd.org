Good examples. Hmm. If the multigrind skill exists as something that can be described coherently in real life, it might end up being a general category or 'school of thought' that encompasses a lot of distinct techniques that have to be used together to reach the highest levels. Maybe it describes an entire mini-game.

A person with the knowledge about creatine would be getting a boost to their multigrind, but that would be somewhat distinct from the kind of boost you potentially get from, say, attentively practicing reading while listening to lectures until the degree of comprehension loss diminishes. The mental branches of multigrind might be largely distinct from physical multigrind (my guess is that acrobats and other physical artists combine tricks to get good strength/agility/coordination/balance workouts routinely).
