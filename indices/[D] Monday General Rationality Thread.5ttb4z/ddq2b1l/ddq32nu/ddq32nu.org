I'll read papers or books or write stuff occasionally between sets at the gym, or listen to audiobooks/podcasts while running/walking/hiking/cooking/drawing/etc, or do squats or calf raises or other simple exercises while brushing my teeth. More effective use of time than multigrinding, per se, but sorta similar (I'd be leveling skills grounded in INT and STR and maybe CHA in the first example, say). Otherwise there are plenty of things you can do that improve relatively disparate abilities (e.g. exercising and taking creatine both are linked to improved cognitive ability and physical performance).
