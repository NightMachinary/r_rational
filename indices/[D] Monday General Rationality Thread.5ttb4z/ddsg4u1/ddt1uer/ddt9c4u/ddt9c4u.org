  Does the power continue to function when the person you are using it on is more than ten feet away, or do they return to normal as soon as they move out of your radius?
#+end_quote

It's a permanent change in their base level personality. If you make someone care about fitness a lot, they'll naturally think about it, read about it, want to do it. If they are in a hospital, they'll look forward to regaining mobility and becoming fit again.

  Also, is it purely additive, or does 0 represent a minimum of motivation? Would you accidentally demotivate people if you went around giving them a 1 on specific goals, or would it just make them slightly more motivated than they were before?
#+end_quote

A zero would be minimum motivation. You could absolutely demotivate someone by giving them a 1 on a goal. That would be an interesting application of the power.
