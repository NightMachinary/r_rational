See the thing is the amount of energy used by the brain (or post singularity computer) to interpret the information doesn't scale with the energy that computation ought to require. So you could precommit to factoring massive primes that would take millennia even post singularity, then get the answers with marginal effort expended.

The Maxwell's demon scenario sees the only way I can think to get this to work in an obvious way. Spend energy getting information about the speed/position of particles a system (to whatever limits are allowed by the uncertainty principle) in the simulation. Then in reality you can use that info to selectively open gates or use some sort of magnetic manipulator in order to get two compartments of gas with one hotter than the other.\\
The thing is as with the prime factoring example the energy needed to just interpret the data from the future is miniscule comparatively and scales linearly or sublinearly even if the energy needed in the simulation is exponential.
