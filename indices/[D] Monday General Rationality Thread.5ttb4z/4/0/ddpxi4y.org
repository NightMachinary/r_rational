It's not entirely obvious that this does in fact violate Landauer's principle, depending on the mechanics of how you use the power. I'm assuming you have to consciously precommit to whatever inputs you're going to put into the computation, and then you close your eyes and concentrate or whatever and you see a vision of yourself in the future writing the response down. Although you are able to bypass the energy required to actually perform the calculation, your brain is still required to read and interpret the resulting information, which uses up energy, and would be proportional to the amount of bits in the information.

This would be analogous to someone having a book that already had a bunch of solutions to problems in it and they look up the answer to a problem instead of calculating it themselves. It will save energy, but I think the minimum energy requirement of brainpower used in reading information is larger than maximum amount of energy that can be gained by Maxwell's Demon or anything similar.

I think. I'm not familiar with all of the nuances in Landauer's Principle, so maybe computation actually is a more significant energy sink than I imagine.
