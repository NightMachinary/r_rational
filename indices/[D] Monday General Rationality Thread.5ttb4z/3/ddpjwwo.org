PSA: There is now a Murphyjitsu [[https://m.me/murphyjitsu][chatbot]] that works on Facebook Messenger, as a follow-up to the [[https://medium.com/@owenshen/planning-101-techniques-and-research-9bfff1a01abd][planning primer]] I put up last week.

It walks you through the steps of Murphyjitsu, a CFAR technique for planning better.

I manage the page, so I can in theory view sent messages, but I am publicly committing not to. Still, I'm saying this in full disclosure. (Edited to add this when I realized I forgot to say this earlier on mobile).
