Have you heard of the [[http://www.barrons.com/articles/remembering-the-flash-crash-of-2015-1491920436][flash crash?]] Not only could this be a reality, it's already happened once. The only reason we didn't spiral into a recession is that we shut down the stock market minutes after it started and everything went back to normal immediately after. What if it didn't? What if whatever random variables which caused it persist after the shutdown and permanently break the entire system? At the very least, every institution with trading bots would have to redesign all of theirs, which could mean /weeks/ of disrupted trading. Sounds like a recession starter to me.
