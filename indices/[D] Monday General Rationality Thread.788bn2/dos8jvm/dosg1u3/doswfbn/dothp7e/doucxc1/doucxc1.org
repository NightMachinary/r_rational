No. That's not how markets work.

  even /highly trained/ investment advisors did not beat the market index funds in the long term

Nor are they expected to. If you think that's what their job is, you probably misunderstand the purpose of markets entirely.

  The crash in 2008 was caused by a single industry pushing the limits on loaning practices because the short term gains looked good

Much has been said about this topic. I would argue that it was caused by a single company pushing the limits of underwriting in exchange for short-term gains.

  the odds of an automated system adopting a strategy with strong short term prospects but high long term risk are extremely likely

If we put all the markets under the control of a single trading algorithm, then sure. That's not what will happen. As long as many different algorithms are running simultaneously, the rules of competition will generally smooth things out.
