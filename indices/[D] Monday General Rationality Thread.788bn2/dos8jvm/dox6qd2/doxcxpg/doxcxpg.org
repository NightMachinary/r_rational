The reason YouTube makes me worry is because it showed me that black box AI has an application that it's already being used for, organizing media for personal consumption, and the potential implications of that as a common practice.

It seems like the reasons for using these algorithms is due to the massive amount of data that needs to be organized, motive to deliver that data to as many people as possible, and desire to avoid legal liability for catering such data for people.

The Internet is basically a public utility owned and operated by private entities, and we're already seen the problems this is causing when companies have enough control to target specific consumers and suppress competition.

Capitalism is dependent upon the idea that consumers can choose how to spend their money between a range of options, but more and more industries are become monopolized. Demand for alternatives is low and the law is doing less to protect consumers.

Dropping AI programmed to maximize profits with media consumption into this situation is not a scenario I expect to turn out well and I'm not sure what can be done to stop it from happening when economic incentives aren't changing.
