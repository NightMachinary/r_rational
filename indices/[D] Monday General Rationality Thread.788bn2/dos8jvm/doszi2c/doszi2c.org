  this is exactly how the YouTube search algorithm works

I don't understand. What did you expect a maximization algorithm to do? Also, don't listen to that guy; he's full of crap. Where he says nobody really understands how the algorithm works, the truth is that nobody understands the /details/ of how the algorithm works. The engineers still understand what's going on at a high level. But the nice thing about "deep learning" algorithms is that you don't need to understand them to use them. This doesn't make them dangerous.

Nor is the "ineffable" algorithm the only building block of the system. Consider that google curates search results for most common search terms, which is one way of making sure that if you search for "youtube", the top hit is "youtube.com", regardless of what the google algorithm might think it should be.
