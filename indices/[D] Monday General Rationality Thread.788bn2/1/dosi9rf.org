So, I bit the bullet and decided to buy a complice subscription to see if it helps me out at all. I've got an assignment due on Friday and I'm frantically working on it every night after work this week, as well as being at work during the day.

So I'll be hanging out in the lesswrong chat room: [[http://www.complice.co/room/lesswrong][www.complice.co/room/lesswrong]] - which is basically a group pomodoro-doing and productivity chat, it's been really helpful as people talk about their problems and projects and help motivate each other. I always found I need productivity and I think the room has been really helpful the past three weeks or so that I've used it. Like, I got 3+ hours of my assignment done last night which I don't think I would have been able to do without the chat room.

(and if you want to try complice, [[https://complice.co/?r=uv93q4n34x][use this link]] and you'll get an extra week on your trial - I wish I'd been able to be referred by someone because I really wanted a third week of trial to see if I stuck with it long-term enough to justify the price tag)
