There's a key word in that article: "arbitrageurs". The problem wasn't that the markets were crashing, but that the algorithms weren't keeping up. Calculating the value of, well, everything, is difficult under the best of circumstances. They just shut down trading to let the algorithms catch back up. There was no chance of a recession happening, and the system wasn't going to break permanently. The end result? The algorithms doing arbitrage got updated (which is always happening, anyways.)
