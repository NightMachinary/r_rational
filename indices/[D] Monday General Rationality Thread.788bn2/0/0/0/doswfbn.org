How well read are you in this field? My initial impression is that you're overthinking this. Algorithms are mainly relegated to high frequency trading from what I've heard (I've family who pick stocks for a living and friends who work as analysts). Other than that I haven't heard of anyone relying solely on algorithms. They may be examined but when dealing with long term investing a human still has control. If the high frequency trading algorithms actually did blow up it'd be rather apparent and while it would have some effect I don't think it'd lead straight to a recession.
