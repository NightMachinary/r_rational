AI/Algorithmic trading is making its way into longer term investment. this trend will continue over time, because humans are frankly terrible at it. Historically, even highly trained investment advisors did not beat the market index funds in the long term. As AI takes on a bigger and bigger role in finance, the entire system becomes more brittle. The crash in 2008 was caused by a single industry pushing the limits on loaning practices because the short term gains looked good. As more and more of the market becomes a black box, the odds of an automated system adopting a strategy with strong short term prospects but high long term risk are extremely likely.

So yes, while /right now/ the scope is limited enough that we aren't going to blow up the market, the risk is going to increase rapidly in the next few years.
