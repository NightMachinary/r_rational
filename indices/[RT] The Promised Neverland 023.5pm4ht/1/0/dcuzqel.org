Well, it's almost certain that the heroine will eventually be offered this choice - to sell out and become a Mama or die.

There's a certain poetic logic in the idea that carrying out a successful escape is the final test - a measure of intelligence which justifies keeping someone alive long enough to breed the next generation of intelligent (tasty) children. And perhaps using them as a mama in the meantime. Given the Machiavellian behavior of both Mamas we can probably assume Mamas are selected to be the smartest and ruthless of their cohort, and had to sell out others to live.

This would also explain the lack of alarm among adults when they find out the children are plotting escape. That a certain percentage of children will catch on might simply be part of the system, and Isabella's talents ensure that her farm produces the most children who figure it out.
