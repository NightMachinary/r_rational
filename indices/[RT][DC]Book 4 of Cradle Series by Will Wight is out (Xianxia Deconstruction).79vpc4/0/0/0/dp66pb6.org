I think a large part of that is that most xianxia is either 1) available only in amateur translation 2) English-language original written by amateurs for free, and almost all of it is serially-published. "Amateur" doesn't mean "bad," but it usually does mean "rough around the edges," and everyone in this sub is probably familiar by now with the issues with serials. /Cradle/ is significantly more polished than the web fiction, and because it's released a book at a time, we get things like "arcs" and "closure" and "not a constant back-and-forth escalation for hundreds of thousands of words without room to breathe" (looking at you for that last one, /Pact/).

Wight wrote a blog post about the genre which I think is very illuminating for understanding what /Cradle/ is and where it's going: [[http://www.willwight.com/a-blog-of-dubious-intent/the-ancestors-of-cradle]]

(Speaking of 20-syllable-long attack names, I was super charmed by Yerin's commentary about the Blackflame technique names in the third book. I'm guessing Wight isn't a huge fan either.)
