I think the fact that people are clinging to these cliches shows that it's /not/ pedantic.

(As in, using one word vs the other is the difference between thinking "what can I imagine?" and "how can I slightly rejangle these old conceits?" At the very least, it's increasing the abstractness of---stripping the incidental baggage from---our terms, which is good.)

But urging people to scout beyond them is the point here, not eradicating the word magic. Suggesting a term with less baggage is just a means. Personally, I like how "magic" is used in coding: [[http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(programming)]].
