Build a liquid nitrogen cannon.

Set up a sphere in the atmosphere that has its heat-sucking set to maximum, and aim it forward. It will rapidly cool the air, hopefully enough to liquefy it, and shoot it out the front. This creates a vacuum in the bubble, drawing in more air, and continuing the process.
