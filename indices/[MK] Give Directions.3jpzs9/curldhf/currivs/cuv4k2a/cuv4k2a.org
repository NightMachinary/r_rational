Does that mean anything travelling through the bubble ends up moving out of it orthogonal to the direction, unless it's fast enough to pass through to quick the realigned?

How does this work with objects rotating? If I send in a metal rod traveling in direction i and rotating around the i axis (and oriented such that i passes through the middle of the rod on a short axis), into a bubble of direction k, does it snap in half because one half is being stopped and the other not?
