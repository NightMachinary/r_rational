This is another of those powers where incautious testing could destroy a planet. Yay c minus elipson particle cannons!

Unfortunately, this one could get the rest of the solar system too. If your counterpart doesn't collapse the bubble before she too dies, the bubble (centred on the far-flung atoms that once made up your body) will become a wandering star-killer.

Unless you specified a radius of billions of lightyears, in which the universe as we know it ceases to exist.

The inverse power is also dangerous - it could create a zone where the heat death of the universe comes early. Game over.
