I just watched it and really liked the concept of people knowing their death dates. The thing is, I heard/read a lot of quotes saying "Live each day as your last", "If today was your last day, would you do what you are about to do today" and things like that. But I never thought about this in the perspective of "What would you do if this is your last 3 months or last 2 years". To me, this is more inspiring than the former thought about "last day".

Anyway, thank you for sharing about this movie, kind sir.
