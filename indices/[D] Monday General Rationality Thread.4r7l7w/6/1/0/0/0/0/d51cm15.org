Welp. Based on the Lone Power's dream-conversations with Nita, I can say one thing for sure: /It is a massive dick/. Like, seriously, It wasn't included in the other Powers' reindeer games, so It decided to fuck up all Creation and then play Trickster/Q/Loki to wizards sometimes just to troll?

This is the least mature motivation I have ever heard from a cosmic Power.
