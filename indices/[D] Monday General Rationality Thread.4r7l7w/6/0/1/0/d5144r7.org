Could you recommend the ones that were most useful to you, please?

Good point on audiobook version. I had issues with retention on a few non-narrative books too. A [[/r/TheRedPill]] user recommended using both at the same time: audiobook + ebook/book, so you engage all senses, which should greatly increase retention. I have to try it too in the future (as soon as I have time to actually read books. audiobooks I can listen to when I do many other things).
