For concept IIRC the best technique (from "Make it Stick" by Peter Brown) is just understanding it and then connecting it as much as possible to your already available knowledge. The more connections you form, the more stable it will become in your mind. Spaced Repetition helps too, although there are no convenient tools like Memrise for accademic endeavours, sadly.
