I've fallen out of love with it but...

Honestly, anything from either Dominic O'Brien or Harry Lorayne (or look for other memory champs). They seem to have the same ideas and tools across several books. /You can have an amazing memory/ or /How to develop a perfect memory/ will help. They're short, concise and contain their tricks without a lot of fluff. Websites like Art of Memory are also good.

Word of caution though; I've not see much that really helps with say...poetry or passages. Their stuff is very smooth for numbers (the Dominic System takes some set up but,especially with a memory palace, is quite intuitive) but passages and concepts -which is where the meat is for me-...those seem quite hard and I haven't seen as quick an effect or as useful a blunt tool as the Dominic System.

I can only assume that it's a "rising tide lifts all boats" thing. The more vigilant and flexible you get with the tools the easier it comes. Well...I hope.
