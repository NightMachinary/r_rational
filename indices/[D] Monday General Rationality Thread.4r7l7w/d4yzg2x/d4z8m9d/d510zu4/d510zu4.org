Duhigg really lost me tbh. In fact, he was the one who cemented my prejudice against non-scientific writers writing science books. I simply won't read one now.

He spends faaaar too much time on anecdotes and he seems to have been doing this thing where he pandered to two demos, as if his editor came in and told him the book would sell more if he framed it as one part pop-cogsci, one part-self-help and one part business advice.

Pop-sci writers are great at storytelling and construction but I kinda loathe the (sometimes tiny) flair and digressions they add. It feels like it's eating at my time for no good reason. Moonwalking with Einstein was the other book that made me swear them off; it's an autobiographical account on mnemonics mixed in with the actual techniques, and twice as circuitous as any of the books of the people it profiles, who structure their books in the most glorious ways (literally chapter-by-chapter: "How to remember X" then on to the next thing, so you can cherrypick new techniques to learn with no fat)

Kahneman is good, but thick. I made the mistake of buying the audiobook instead of what I do now: make notes while reading along with a book to review later and I'm regretting it so much. I'm going to have go through it again, I have terrible retention with audiobooks and that's with works that are mainly narrative and not having to remember figures.
