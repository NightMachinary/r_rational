Well, first of all, it's /god/. He's immortal and there's no reason to suspect that his character has an influence on his mortality. You're quite the opposite. If hell exists, you've just literally done the worst possible thing you could do. Even if hell doesn't exist, god could make it just for you.

Second of all, it's /god/. Literally the shortcut to eternal happiness to everyone, everywhere, forever. Sure he's an asshole now but from what I understand there's no reason to suspect that he was always an asshole and he always will be. And even if one assumes omniscience means that god will never change character--the world isn't completely horrible now and there is some semblance of order in a few places. It's completely possible that god is the only thing keeping the world from going, quite literally, to hell.

This is like finding a switchboard that controls the universe, proving it's legit, and then smashing it with a hammer because you don't like the position of some of the switches and can't get them to budge.
