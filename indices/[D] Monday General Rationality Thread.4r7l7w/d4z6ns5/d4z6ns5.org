Recently watched [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QNKcwe_lM][the brand new testament]], a cute movie about gods daugther, who runs away from her abusive father.

The best scence in the entire movie: god proudly tells someone he hates people and is god, backs his claim up by telling that person an intimate memory of that persons life - and the person quite rationally immediately tries to kill god.

I wish I was that good at updating upon evidence!
