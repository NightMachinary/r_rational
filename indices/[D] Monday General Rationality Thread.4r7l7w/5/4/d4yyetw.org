Is the issues getting them to work at all, or is it getting them to take specific actions?

If it is getting them to work/work together, then finding ways to make each person feel responsible for a specific part of the work so they feel like they own it or that it is theirs.

If the issues is getting them to take specific courses of actions... If they are friends of yours, then establishing reciprocation over time is good. You help them with something small, later you get them to help you with something slightly bigger, and so on until you are willing to go out of the way for each other. If they are merely acquaintances, it might help to know what each person wants from the group and being able to navigate and negotiate between them.

Also, to go with [[/u/CouteauBleu]]'s idea, you don't need to pay them directly necessarily, but offer compensation that is worth money. For example, if a bunch of friends help you move, buy them pizza for lunch, and if it really takes a while/you have a bunch of stuff, maybe take them out to dinner afterwards also.

If you want specific examples... I was in the Boy Scouts and I was alternatively Patrol Leader, Quarter Master, Senior Patrol Leader, and Junior Assistant Scoutmaster, so I have some stories of what to do (and lots of stories about what not to do).

About the dentist thing... I think that would be one of the last medical professions to go. I could see implants monitoring your health and eliminating the need for checkups, but mouth health seems kind of tricky (spit into a device that monitors for chemical traces associated with cavities) and physically removing cavities will be always necessary if anything goes wrong in maintaining your mouth health.
