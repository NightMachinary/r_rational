Had problems with both 'socially interacting with girls' and 'interacting with enough people in general (so there would be a GF candidate)'. Eventually solved both for myself.

For the first one, a thing that might have worked for me (or perhaps correllated with working) was watching&listening to media (series/podcasts/webcasts/LPs) which a guy co-hosted with a girl, interacting with her in a friendly atmosphere (well, the atmosphere where the audience obviously ship them but nothing really going on and the jokes are quite mild).

For a second problem, I thought 'Which of my interests are making me interact with people less than average and how can I re-focus that?'. Playing board games with friends? Might as well visit board game clubs a couple of times, why not? Spending my time in an online community? Why don't I visit (or even help to organise) a local meet-up and discuss the ingroup's things in a %food_place%. Playing a (non-casual) game on my phone? Why don't I try, say, Ingress instead, based on constant IRL interaction between players? And so on.

I was a bit scared about 'how do I switch from just social communication aka being friends to showing a romantic interest and determining whether it is mutual' but I managed that intuitively (well, I guess I got lucky with one girl that became interested in me first, but I have successfully initiated a relationship too, with some light jokes and stuff.)

Hope I helped a bit.
