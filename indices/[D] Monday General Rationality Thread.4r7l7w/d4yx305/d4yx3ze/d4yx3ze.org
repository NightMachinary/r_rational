Paying them money.

EDIT: It's a vague question, so it depends on the parameters, but in essence, getting other people to behave in a way convenient to you, be it by giving you material goods or by doing something you want done, is what money represents.

Again, it depends on the exact situation you're in, who you want to influence, what you want them to do, etc. A guru in a sect will not exercise his influence the way a policeman on the job or an office manager will.
