  About the dentist thing... I think that would be one of the last medical professions to go. I could see implants monitoring your health and eliminating the need for checkups, but mouth health seems kind of tricky (spit into a device that monitors for chemical traces associated with cavities) and physically removing cavities will be always necessary if anything goes wrong in maintaining your mouth health.

Yeah, the novel just had something about how a coating for the teeth completely protected them from cavities, but obviously there's still gum problems, even ignoring everything else about mouth health.
