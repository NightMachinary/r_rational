  I'd been taught at the orphanage the reason for the existence of the ‘Nameless Kingdom' was likely a demon of Absence, or that the Miezans had used a /Censure/ after facing entrenched resistance. The latter theory wasn't all that popular, since they were known to have use that only a handful of times across the entire lifespan of their empire.

I smell foreshadowing. It's heavily hinted that it's a ritual of some sort, and if the comparison with the demon of Absence is any indication, it has the same memory-damaging side effects, along with some devastating main effect. The focus is different from that of Absence, though, since all the uses of those demons mentioned (the disappearance of the Yan Tei empire, the Ninth Crusade, the Hell Egg in Harrow) were hypothetical or implied. Censure, meanwhile, is known to have been used, and the structure of the sentence implies it's even rarer than summoning of a demon.

  Consider Arcadia as a single object being looked upon by an infinity of perspectives. To every one, it is a different realm. Across the Tyrian Sea, it likely has completely different name and seems inhabited by completely different entities. Even the marriage of Winter and Summer is contained within the span of our gaze only, unlikely to have tremors beyond.

Yesss. I've expressed my concerns about an orphan from a former backwater kingdom making fundamental changes to Creation due to a forced coincidence before, and this explanation is everything I hoped for and more.

  He was looking at pale-skinned man in furs, chest mostly bare and his neck covered with necklaces of iron and silver. The stranger Hierophant was staring at was beautiful, I decided. One of the most striking men I'd ever seen. It was like someone had ripped out the fantasy of a warrior consort and given it flesh.

The appearance is not someone Catherine recognizes, so, while Masego uses to refer to Wekesa as father, which, together with the epigraph, might imply some fundamental revelations about souls and the cycle of life in the Guideverse, my money is on the "man" being Tikoloshe. Consider this quote from the [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/11/02/red-skies/][extra chapter "Red Skies"]]:

  The devil laughed. “I was first called into being when the witch-queen of what you would now call the northern Principate became dissatisfied with her husbands. I was no longer young when the Miezans first came upon the shores of this continent, blown by a storm.”

That is arguably around the period when Dead King was still a mortal ruler called Trismegistus, and given that all of the soldiers come from roughly the same period, if not the exact same /moment/, it may have been the prelude to his apotheosis. The stone mace breaking an iron sword in a battle of what is obviously two Named might imply sorcerous properties. Given that the Lycaonese are currently attacking, and we saw another city burning plague victims, it wouldn't surprise me if all the events unfolding are happening during the ten-hour hellgate ritual or its prelude: Trismegistus may well have been trying to pull an Amestris even as the Lycaounese invaders were fighting their way to his capital.

  “That,” he said, pointing at the man, “is my father.”

By the way, how is he able to recognize him, anyway? The explanation about the scrying ritual earlier in the chapter implied that he had other ways to judge the effectiveness of the spell than listening to the chant he can only recognize the cadence of. Then again, he might have eyeballed that simply by the observation of how they used nothing other that the formula and their own blood, but that leaves the question: how did he know that was Tikoloshe? He might have recognized an old face the incubus had shown him once, though I'm not sure why would he discard the shape Warlock knows him by. Masego could also have recognized the description of the Lycaonese queen (if his father would ever tell him about this battle, I doubt any other details would remain in his memory), but he'd probably mention that she was invading the fledging Dead King. Still, a possibility remains that Hierophant's eyes can glean more about the past than mere sight.
