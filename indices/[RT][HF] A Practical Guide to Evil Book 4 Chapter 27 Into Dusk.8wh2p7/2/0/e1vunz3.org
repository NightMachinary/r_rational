This is a good plase to address another question that has been bothering me for a while: how deliberate was the chain of events that led to the rise of the Dead King? See, Akua mentions in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/04/19/villainous-interlude-chiaroscuro/][interlude Chiaroscuro]] that he opened his Greater Breach to spread undeath across what had been his kingdom, but even she implies that Keter turning into what it did was not a planned occurence. What if the whole "undead" business was more of an improvisation than previously assumed?

We know from the order of magnitude of the energy wasted in the course of opening the gate that Trismegistus opened it by himself and not through a group ritual, converting the biggest possible amount of power an individual can. The scrying ritual in this chapter implies that the early Trismegistian sorcery in general relied on skill of individual casters rather than on elements like runes/devils/enchanted items. Thing is, the witch-queen is on the side of Lycaonese here, fighting /in close quarters/ with the other Named, they have the technological advantage and the other side uses rituals to throw lightning bolts. I get that the numbers and iron weapons are on the invaders' side but is magic /that/ ineffective in comparison? Most importantly, this is the fifth battle the Woe are coming by. How come we saw no combat diabolists yet?

Diabolism is, judging by the tidbits we saw so far, the discipline that relies on the individual casters the most. They have practices that prevent mental bleedover from stronger devils, the binding is done by the mages themselves (even to the inanimate objects), and the bindings themselves are called contracts for a reason. We know the mages of Keter knew enough about lesser hells for Trismegistus to open a permanent portal there, and even with the cost, summoning some akalibsa through a temporary one could potentially have at least evened the numbers.

/Could/ they have afforded the cost, though? A sole mage has only so much power in him; even if they have some primitive rituals, the defenders of Keter would need to sacrifice something to call on the devils. The iron queen is evidently a diabolist herself, and her only summon is what, a young succubus? Even for a Named, the kind of power required to summon a devil is not something that just lies around. So where did Trismegistus get it? All battles so far are part of the same campaign, and while the lesser gods like the one in Greywood, the one that Sabah killed to become the Capitain and the cranes of Stygia don't necessarily interact with mortals on regular basis, they wouldn't have caused no effect whatsoever either.

We didn't see any equivalent of Watch or berserkers on either side of the conflict so far, and while the effects of Trismegistus being in the posession of a source of power massive enough to poke a hole in reality may yet show themselves, there are only three unlikely candidates for that role so far: the scrying, the lightning rituals and the plague. *Skip the next part if you want, I'm making a lot of assumptions about magic there.*

I included the magical rituals here because, well, the only time we saw someone invent what looked like an actual spell was Masego imitating the sun of Summer:

#+begin_quote
  “Glint on glass, stolen yet earned,” he murmured. “Passing jewel, foe's crown: /dawn/.”
#+end_quote

This clearly references the conclusion of the Battle of Four Armies and One (the theft of fire, the reflection of the sun in his spectacles, and the sun being the crowning attribute of the princess of High Noon). Now, the imitation of a miracle may be Masego's thing (especially the "glint on glass" part), but we know for a fact that there are things like the crown of Tyrant of Helike or the Stairway ritual that are modeled after miracles, so it's a legitimate way to model spells. With that in mind, let's look at the lightning spell as used by Kilian [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/chapter-28-win-condition/][during the melee in book one]]:

#+begin_quote
  “I am the root and the crown, the source and the flow, the storm and the calm,” she murmured. “Power is purpose, purpose is will. Gods of my mother, take this offering and grant me the wrath of Heaven.”
#+end_quote

It's eerily similar to Masego's spell in the sense of how there's clearly some kind of context missing. Still, we can glean some information even from what we see. Both include a mention of usurpation of the power by the caster; the offering mentioned in the second is clearly the smudge of blood she made on her cheek, tough it's not likely to be a sacrifice to the Gods Below: Kilian's spell straight up calls the lightning "the wrath of Heaven", but the "the storm and the calm" suggests that it may be an attribute of a storm-related lesser god, and lightning is"Divine Wrath 101". Besides, it's not like magic can be evil in and of itself: [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/chapter-19-flame/][the incantation for creating fire snakes]] says that their origin comes from "nameless eidolons, thieves of Heaven's grace", but Hedge Wizard calls them a fancy knockout-punch used by mages in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/04/26/heroic-interlude-appellant/][interlude Appellant]], not some kind of diabolical construct.

Similarly, visions and omens are another potential gift granted by a god, and even their use as a simple spell is associated with (potentially) divine beings: fae, especially the Wild Hunt, can use them to effectively teleport, and that's before you take into the consideration those of them that are, essentially, lesser gods. Scrying easily could have originated as a prayer to a deity for a divination, and while its spell versions use workarounds such as air-based magical links and pebbles to ground them, a chant and an offering may well have been enough for the divine version.

Finally, plague is another traditional way for a god to express their displeasure. This is less straightforward than the other options, since the plague was killing Trismegitus' own subjects, but there are several possibilities here:

- The deity causing the plague was hostile and/or not native to the kingdom of Keter. Remember, if Trismegistus had indeed planned the ritual from the very start, sacrificing an entire god that was benevolent to him (or at least that he could control enough to sacrifice it in the first place) would be dumb. Given that all the shards so far show the same invasion, we can guess that it happened around the same time as the gate was opened, so we may well be looking at another Akua's Folly, only the god in question wasn't artificial and so had more will to actively struggle against its bindings.

- Another possibility (the one I was leading to all this time) is that the future Dead King had the god curse his own subjects. The man's endgame was turning all his subject into undead, and zombie plagues are a thing, so it's not outside the realm of the impossible. Besides, while Catherine didn't mention any zombies in the shards she saw, she didn't mention any details about the plagued city either. The deity could well have punished the invaders once they moved to occupy the city, though I'm going to explain why I don't find this possibility to be likely either.

*Most of the magic- and god-related speculation ends here. Tl;dr: if there are traces of the kind of entity that Trismegistus would have to sacrifice to open a Greater Breach, Catherine hasn't encountered any so far.*
