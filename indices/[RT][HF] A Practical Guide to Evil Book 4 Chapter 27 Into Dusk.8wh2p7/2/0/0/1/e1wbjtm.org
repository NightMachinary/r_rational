This explains a lot of things, but in that case, Catherine meeting with the Dead King would probably be the time that bard suddenly appears in front of the Saint of Swords and whispers "good stuff" in her ears to ruin all the plans. And that means that Bard is ultimately the antagonist of this book at least, if not the whole story.
