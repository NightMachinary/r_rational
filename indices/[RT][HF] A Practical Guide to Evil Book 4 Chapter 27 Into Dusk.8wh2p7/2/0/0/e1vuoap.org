Now, back to the power issue.

My theory is that the plague is no coincidence, but very much a means to an end. The ruler of Keter had to face an invasion of a numerically superior and better armed force with only an insufficient advantage in magic without power to achieve something truly great with it, so he leaned into that advantage as far as he could. This is my first guess: that the Dead King didn't open a portal to hell to turn all his subjects into undead - he killed all his subjects to open the portal to hell.

Remember, while he's a skilled enough diabolist (enough to bind demons and to know that there are undeath-related lesser hells, at least), this chapter's epigraph and quotes from his (only?) published book in general heavily hint that his speciality during his life was undeath, which led into his current Name. Despite that, we've seen no zombie troops deployed yet, even though that would lower the casualties of his own soldiers. There's no way he would fight another practitioner Named and not rely on his speciality - the one that would later make him a legend - especially if no other weapon at his disposal could turn the tide.

Regardless, if he indeed had to use some sort of improvised human sacrifice - be it an unleashed plague or simply all the people slain over the course of the war - to power his ritual, then my second guess is that the opening of the Greater Breach and the subsequent invasion of a hell are a measure of desperation, not his preferred outcome. Akua stated that it took him ten hours to open the portal, while the invasion would take months. Given that those would have to happen in short order, and are simply too massive twists of Fate to be unrelated, I'm assuming that the hellgate was opened at the conclusion of the campaign. Like, say, when he was finally out of army, the enemy was at the gates of Keter, and he had nothing to pit against the forces that were about to stomp all over his face.

Granted, the result may have been entirely acceptable for him, but my point is that even if he planned the ending to this invasion to happen as it did, that this kind of escalation would be the only way for him to turn the tide, magically superior lich or not. The invasion of a hell also makes very little sense unless he botched its making in some way, since all the devils that would come into Creation would also be bound to his will, which leaves no functional difference between owning the gate (which he did as of moment he finished the ritual) and owning the hell (which cost him untold amounts of troops, resources, and crippled both his ability to come into Creation and his cognition).

My third guess is that the whole "trapped in hell forever" deal isn't an accident either, nor is it an acceptable consequence which he foresaw. Normally the kind of event that took place here would see a band of heroes rushing in to prevent it. Unless it was an entirely accidental "how do i into hell" by some bumbling comic relief, which Trismegistus wasn't, the Heavens would send a champion at least to the final confrontation. Akua's Folly is a notable exception, since a) while Fate had provided a conflict fitting an event such as an opening of a hellgate, it was entirely between villains (like here, because a diabolst queen that changes husbands like gloves doesn't look particularly Good to me), and b) because it was a Bard's plot all along, down to stopping the Good elves from preventing the whole thing.

But here's the rub - what if Gods Above, despite not stopping the Greater Breach from happening, got to intervene afterwards? Due to the nature of hells, a portal into one effectively means infinite armies for its owner - a disturbance in the balance like none before. Unless, of course, the villain in question is in a position that doesn't allow for such usage of it. For example, if he himself, baited by a heroine, crossed the boundary and is now trapped inside at the cost of her life - and the Fate would help her, too! This is my theory on how Bard was created: she was reborn in her current form after tricking or banishing the Dead King, and serves as an opposite of his. She, too, cannot intervene directly by the nature of her Role, but has a form of immortality and an ability to change appearances between incarnations. That would also imply that the Dead King's influence stretches further than seems at the first glance, but as to how I have no clue.
