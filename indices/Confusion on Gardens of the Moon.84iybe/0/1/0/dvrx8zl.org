Frankly, it's a better, and more confidently written, book. /Gardens of the Moon/ still feels a little like a "normal" fantasy novel, with a thief and a love interest and a big baddy who pops up for everyone to fight at the end. /Deadhouse Gates/ has a more memorable plot, and the whole Chain of Dogs thing is pretty exciting, or was to my teenage self. (Yes, it's been like 15 years since I read this book.) Most other reasons for reading a fantasy series in order don't really apply. For example, the books only have one or two characters in common. (Kalam?) and it's not like you learn a ton about the magic system in the first book, though I suppose at that point you will have a few basics.

Also, I think, if I'm remembering correctly, that a dragon gets blown up with a grenade launcher. Or a shapeshifting worm thing or something. It's been a while. Plus, Icarium.
