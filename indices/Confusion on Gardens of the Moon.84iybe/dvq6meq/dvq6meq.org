OK. Here's the scoop. There is a magic system in the Malazan books, and it's internally consistent. It's also based on the history and cosmogony of the world. But it is not explained.

Think of it this way. Imagine an alien from an alternate universe. They gain access to a device that allows them to read our fiction. They read /Measuring the World/ and say, "These Humboldt and Gauss characters seem cool, but when will this crazy Science system be explained?"

The information about the magic system is in the books. That is, once you know about the history of the world in the books, you know what's important to know about the magic system. Characters even explain parts of the magic system to one another. But no one ever stands up and starts talking about magic, or anything else, as if they had no grounding in the history of the world. No 7-year-old comes through a wardrobe and needs to have everything explained.

Personally, I find this approach refreshing, realistic, and, frankly, more interesting than the approach in most books. There's no "'Yer a wizard, 'arry!" or "The thing about level 0 cantrips is that they need to be memorized..." or, conversely, characters pulling plot-solving magic out of unlikely anatomical spaces.

So, anyway, you're not missing anything. The books don't present history, cosmology, or magic in digestable parts, but rather as a whole. Treat them as a puzzle to be solved---you're learning lore and making connections. Also just enjoy the insane time scale. Races who have made themselves into undead so they can stop ice ages. Artifacts built by insect mechanists that died out 100,000 years ago. Gods that were worshipped by the gods as gods, and are still kicking around.

Also, the first book only heats up toward the end, and don't give up on the series until you've read Deadhouse Gates. In fact, I tell people to start with Deadhouse Gates.
