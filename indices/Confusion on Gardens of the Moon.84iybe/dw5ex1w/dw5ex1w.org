It is easier to read that to listen.

The Malazan Books of the Fallen series is written in a way that makes it harder to orient into a scene than any other series I've read. The information about who is talking, where the scene is set, and even the topic of conversation is often pages in, or scattered around. As such, being able to stop and think about what is going on, or check back a paragraph or page as a new information element is introduced is very helpful. This is much easier when reading, and controlling your interaction with the words, as opposed to getting it at the speed of speech.

A lot of the details are complex and partial, and only come together chapters, or even books later. That said, the history and world-building is complex and rewarding to puzzle out when you do start seeing the different elements showing up and interacting. A lot of the little hints do come together, and tell a lot of the backstory that starts out very mysterious, but that is over the series, not the individual books.
