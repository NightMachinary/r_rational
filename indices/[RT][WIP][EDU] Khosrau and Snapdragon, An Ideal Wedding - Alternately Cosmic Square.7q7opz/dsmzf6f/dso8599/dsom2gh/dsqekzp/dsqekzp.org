I do count the style more significant than substance here. The language of science must be reserved for things you can describe scientifically, or you dilute the value of that language /for/ describing things scientifically. Tell me it's magic, tell me it's art. But don't give me a numerical estimation of change in a quality unless you can also provide an operational definition for that quality, and preferably hard data indicating a change in that quality measured by an observer with minimal bias. Rational, scientific exploration of the world does not make up the entirety of our life experience. Sometimes we have a deep, profound experience or come to a realization that we must encode in art. And that's fine. That's wonderful, even. And then we should say things like "this story is a mnemonic for a technique that helped me clear my mind, that made me feel as if I was snipping away or bringing to a proper end all the dangling mental threads that were distracting me."

Is that a bit woo woo mystical bullshit? Yes. That's fine. But it's not pretending to be something it's not.
