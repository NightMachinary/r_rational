Yes, which is learnable by approximating and calibrating against seperate measurements or objective reality, just like any other instrument. You can't just handwave away bullshit by saying "it's a learnable skill", any more than a yogi who apparently levitates or a minister who apparently heals the blind can. I would assign a very low confidence to the assertion that your self-evaluation of the power of a low effect-size intervention using an undefined criterion holds any water at all, especially when the confidence interval you personally assigned it (ignoring the problems with that) dips below zero. I'm aware that I'm taking a somewhat combative tone here, but I really am worried of the consequences when useful rationalist skills and modes of thought are treated like all-purpose hammers - especially when the problem at hand is closer to a screw than a nail. That's how we got phrenology and Freudian psychodynamics - a useful, rational idea or tool that is used imprecisely or improperly to create a fortress of assertion with no foundation is falsifiable, testable reality. This isn't so bad as that - these assertions could be tested with some work. Until they have, though, please don't use the linguistic style of things that have a grounding in experiment to talk about them. It confuses things.
