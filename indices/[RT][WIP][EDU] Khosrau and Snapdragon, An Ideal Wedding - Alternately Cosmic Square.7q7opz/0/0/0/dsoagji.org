It might help if I were to explain it.

I wrote the story late at night and all in one sitting, after having a particularly slippery thought that I couldn't express formally and was afraid of forgetting. The next day, seeing no harm in it (since it is technically a story in and of itself, with motivations and the like), I decided to post it to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] Discord server. A few people there said that they thought they had seen the thing I was trying to remember after reading the story, and one person proved it by predicting what happens next, so FuguofAnotherWorld asked if he could post it to r/r, and I said he could. However, any literal explanation should be considered in light of the fact that it's being written by someone who got their impression after reading a story I wrote to remember something I can't express in words, and is therefore something like third- or fourth-hand.

I would explain it like this: a thought can be considered as a recursive function. A recursive function must have behaviours for both its base case and its recursive case, and can't 'know' which one it's going to use going in. Likewise, in thinking (or so my thought goes) we'll try to remove uncertainty from our prediction, and, if we can't remove enough for our tastes, we'll repeat the thought with only the uncertain elements remaining. If, on thinking this next thought, there are still more uncertain elements than we're comfortable with, we'll repeat it again - and, if we can't ever remove enough uncertain elements, the thought has to be 'left open,' and never resolved.

I have no way of knowing whether this maps in any way to how brains actually work. However, I find that I'm less anxious since thinking of it in that way, because I'm considering what sort of exit case I ought to be using in my thought processes. If I have no reason to believe that considering something further will alter the conclusion I draw, then I also have no reason to consider it further, and, in letting it be, I stop worrying about it.

(That's not all the story is about. It's more like the imprint of a pattern, or something, but that's the part Fugu was referring to, and I'm not sure any of the other things actually exist as information contained in the story versus information contained in my head that the story reminds me of.)
