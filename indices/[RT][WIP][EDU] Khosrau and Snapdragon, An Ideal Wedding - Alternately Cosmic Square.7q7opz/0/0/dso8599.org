So I'm just going to say that, prior to having read this story, this comment is really pinging my bullshit detectors, including the weirdly specific numbers (just how are you measuring mental efficiency, and what does a 1-2% increase in it even mean? How do you know it's not placebo?) and the implication that understanding the story makes you special in some way. You couch it as a net plus on the cost-benefit, but that's misleading. Cost-benefit has to take into account the possibility that the story is just mystical bs, and reading it will clutter my beliefs about the world with mystical pseudoscientific bs. I consider that cost rather high.

If you want to present this as a piece of art or fiction or whatever, that's fine, but don't wrap it in this pseudoscientific vaguely intellectual langauge unless you've got the evidence to back it up.

"This illustrates a technique I use to clear my mind" is fine.

"This illustrates a technique to terminate hanging mental threads and increase effective efficiency by 1-2%" is /not/ fine, because it implies waaaay greater power and precision than you can realistically have without having done a pretty comprehensive study on this.

I get that you use a bunch of vascillating language like "I think" and "reasonably", but that doesn't solve the core issue, which is that this comment stinks of not-quite-cautious enough pseudoscience married to intellectual mysticism.
