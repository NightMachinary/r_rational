I understand that you are rather disturbed by Mary's behavior and plans regarding a relationship with Juniper but I think that it is important to also understand that this kind of thing is very common. Throughout human history woman marrying men that they were not in any way attracted to for the purposes of personnel security or familial profit was the default. Annabeth was simply following a pattern of behavior used by woman throughout human history. The fact that this is considered disturbing in our current civilization may be a good thing but we should not ignore the long historical legacy in which it was the only option for many women.
