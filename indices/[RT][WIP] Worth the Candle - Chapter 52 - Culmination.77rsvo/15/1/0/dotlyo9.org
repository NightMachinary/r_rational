I know fully well that arranged marriages was the standard for a long time and still is in many parts of the world. I have no problem with that.

What irks is when she does all that to manipulate Joon into a relationship, fully aware that he would never agree to if he knew all the facts. And yeah, that probably also has happened a lot in history and still happens today, and no, that doesn't make her a monster or anything. It's still a pretty shitty thing to do, and I have seen way too many similar cases IRL for my tastes.
