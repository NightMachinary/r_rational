Yeah, it's sickening but it's a shit world and she was born into the unenviable position as first princess in a ruthless primogeniture-based dynasty. So either she gives up and dies (option B: forced royal intermarriage) or everything she does by now is a study in political maneuvering and maximizing any advantage. Gaslighting and Pavlovian conditioning might be a bit of a stretch, but self-manipulation/deception commonly occur in arranged marriages where spouses convince themselves that they can grow to love the other.

  And now imagine what would happen to the kingdom, ya know, the reason the considered doing all this crap for, if the plan didn't work as foreseen and the relationship ended in a obvious and explosive way shortly after they were estabilished as rulers. Not pretty.

You're assuming divorces happen in Anglecynn (and that marriages of love are commonplace in the sovereign heirs). I'm getting the impression any "explosive" endings are resolved with a quick dagger in the underdog's back.

Amaryllis doesn't seem like a pure megalomaniac. She's invested herself into the political game all her life and now that she's out, her situation is just sad. We don't know why she rejected the marriage with Larkspur, but she's probably always expected to marry for power. Then Joon comes along who's the /perfect/ candidate as Uther's second coming, but in the process of figuring he's a decent guy to marry after all, he's ended up with Fenn.

Still, I find her hard to read. Mainly because everything points to her being an amazing actor and I can't shake the feeling that her responses are premeditated to the point of always being acts.
