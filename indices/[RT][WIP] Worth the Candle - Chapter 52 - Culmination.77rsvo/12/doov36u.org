Something about Mary's confession seemed to parallel one of Fenn's failed romantic encounters:

  “So I thought I would be that to you,” said Amaryllis. “If you tried to kiss me, I would kiss you back, and if you wanted to fuck me, then I would --” she looked to me, “Endure it,” she finished, apparently not pulling any punches. “I would get through this thing that I didn't want to do, and I would learn to like it, or at least learn to not visibly dislike it.” She folded her hands in her lap. “I'm aware of how that makes me sound,” she said.

  “Kind of makes me feel like crap,” I said. That wasn't the half of it. It wasn't her saying she didn't want to have sex with me, it was the idea that she would still her instinctual response of recoiling from me. That made my heart drop, not because of what it said about our personal relationship, or just our friendship, but what it said about her.

Fenn's incident:

  “Well, that guy is the reason why,” said Fenn. “He seemed normal enough, at least by my standards, or the standards I had then, and it was going well, but when it came time for us to have sex, after I had undressed, he was there between my legs, staring, poking, and prodding. Like I was just this thing to him. I can't even describe how revolting I felt. Maybe he thought he was ... I don't know.”

Anybody else getting that vibe?
