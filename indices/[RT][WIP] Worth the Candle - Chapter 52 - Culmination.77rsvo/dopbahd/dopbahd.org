  “So I thought I would be that to you,” said Amaryllis. “If you tried to kiss me, I would kiss you back, and if you wanted to fuck me, then I would --” she looked to me, “Endure it,”

  “I know,” nodded Amaryllis with a soft smile. “That made it easier to kindle the flame. I fantasized about what it would be like to kiss you, or to have you hold me. I tried to imagine what it would be like to have you take my virginity, and I tried to imagine sex with you as this positive thing that I wanted with all my heart.”

Shit. This is both horrible and insane on so many levels. Had to stop reading and type something. Holy shit.

So she basically tried to gaslight herself into a pavlovian mindset that would allow her to manipulate someone else into a marriage for the sake of her ambition. I'm at a loss of words to try and describe how idiotic this scheme is and how power hungry must she be if that was something that could come up as an option and not be immediately dismissed as a horrible idea. It would be a really, really crappy thing to do not only to Joon but to herself as well. The psychological damage by itself would make the plan not worth it.

And now imagine what would happen to the kingdom, ya know, the reason the considered doing all this crap for, if the plan didn't work as foreseen and the relationship ended in a obvious and explosive way shortly after they were estabilished as rulers. Not pretty. And that end seems kinda likely since she increased her Loyalty that many levels just for knowing she didn't have to follow the plan through, that there was another way.

Oh, and speaking about the Loyalty increase. She only spoke about all this crap after knowing that manipulating herself into a mindstate that would allow her to manipulate Joon wasn't her only endgame. I know she claims she is speaking about this now because of the unicorn blood, and that this is the first opportunity, but she kinda had the time to speak about it before the loyalty increase if she really wanted to. I don't know whether she is speaking the truth and she is confessing this because her secrecy was compromised, or this is just her aborting the plan because literally anything else has cropped up as an option, but either option just smell like different shades of shitty. I guess the second one is kinda less shitty if you squint and look at it sideways.

She isn't exactly a bad person per se as an ally but god, what a nutjob. I dunno if you did it on purpose, but way to cut all interest I might have ever had in a Joon/Mary ship, [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] .

Ok, rant over. Back to the chapter.

  Okay,” she said. She shivered slightly, and her hands clung to my waist. “I've given it some thought. One date, and we'll see where it goes from there.”

YES, PLEASE. I'd rather read about Joon and Grak making out than the idea that he /might/ end with Mary.
