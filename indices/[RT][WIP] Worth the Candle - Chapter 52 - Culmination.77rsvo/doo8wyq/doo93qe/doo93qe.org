The name is an */EXTREMELY/* dumb joke, just a mash up of horrifying cosmic entity [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu][Cthulhu]] and Canadian singer/songwriter [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carly_Rae_Jepsen][Carly Rae Jepsen]]. I almost wouldn't even call it a joke, except for some reason I find the juxtaposition hilarious.
