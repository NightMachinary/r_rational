Me near the story's beginning: Oh, this is probably going somewhere typical. Juniper falls for the princess while the plucky best friend is left on the wayside, sucking up her feelings for the sake of the group's unity.

Me midway: Huh....well Fenn's loyalty is much higher but it's still probably AmaryllisXJuniper OTP

Me now: ....goddammit, [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] subverted it! He goddamn subverted it! 10/10 did not expect a full on subversion. I expected maybe he would bang Fenn but overall regret it because he cared for Amaryllis more, Fenn's heart would be broken but she'd get over it eventually and so on. But nope. Juniper chose. Props to that flower named guy.
