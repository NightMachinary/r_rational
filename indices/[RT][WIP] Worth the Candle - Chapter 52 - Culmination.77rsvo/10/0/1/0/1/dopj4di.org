I did find her remarking on Fenn's sensuality kind of odd, considering that Fenn makes no overt attempts to be sensual (unless you count the nudity, which I moreso see as her being really comfortable with herself)

In re-reading the chapter, I do find the possibility a lot more possible. She makes it very clear she simply wasn't into Juniper but she also does seem to imply that she's not big on hetero stuff. So I'm more inclined to believe your hunch is correct :)
