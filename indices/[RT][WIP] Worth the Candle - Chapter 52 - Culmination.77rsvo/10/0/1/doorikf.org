I think there are two little pieces of phrasing:

#+begin_quote
  I don't have experience with men. I don't have that natural spark that Fenn does either, that raw sensuality, the way she can effortlessly draw the eye.
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  [if I had been] more craving of a man's touch
#+end_quote

That first line has the ambiguous "*the* eye", which might mean Amaryllis' eye, or Juniper's eye, or both of them jointly, or a neutral observer (and even if you told me that a neutral observer would naturally find something attractive, I would probably take that as a reflection on what you find attractive). The inference from both lines might be that her use of "a man's touch" or "experience with men" was meant to apply /only/ to men, though it's again ambiguous.

Edit: I do take those bits of phrasing as being men in general, not just Juniper, but it's still somewhat ambiguous.
