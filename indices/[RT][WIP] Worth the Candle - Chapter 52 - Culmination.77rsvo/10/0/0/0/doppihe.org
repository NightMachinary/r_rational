There's also this line:\\
"..started to see something in you. There was a glimmer of a real spark when I looked at you.."

And also the:\\
"I didn't feel anything like attraction to you when we first met"\\
Which, especially with the surrounding context of "You grew more handsome" which was just thrown sort of thrown in there, suggests she might find him attractive now.

Plus Juniper's put a few points into MEN and INS and didn't come to to those conclusions, or really speculate on them/ pick up that sort of vibe. (Which is pretty weak, as evidence goes, but might still be worth noting).

I was definitely picking up on the same things as you though, and was/am wondering about her sexuality.
