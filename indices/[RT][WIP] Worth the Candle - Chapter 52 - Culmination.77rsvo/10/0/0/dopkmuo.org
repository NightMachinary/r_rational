  What made you conclude Amaryllis is gay/asexual from what she said?
#+end_quote

She didn't expect sex with him to be anything other than a chore. It wasn't like she was planning to use him for power, and then /also/ have some bedroom fun with him as a part of that. Why not enjoy the man you're planning to seduce? Why not at least hope that it'll be nice? Is there anything wrong with him, which would forever kill any chance of even okish sex?

As far as I can tell, yes, there's something wrong. And it's that he's male. She didn't have any specific objections -- didn't start talking about physical or personality traits of men -- except that she's not really into men /in general/. She talked about a dream of being a woman who was more into men -- not just Juniper.

It's not that she didn't love him. It's that she didn't even think using him to ease her lust was any kind of possibility, because she doesn't have that lust. Maybe she just has an extremely low libido? But there's a point at which it's so low that a person is pretty much ace anyway.

Although apparently she did manage to convince herself she was into him, at least a bit, which is evidence against her being gay or ace.
