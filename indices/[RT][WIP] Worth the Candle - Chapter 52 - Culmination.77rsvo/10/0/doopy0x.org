What made you conclude Amaryllis is gay/asexual from what she said? She always assumed she couldn't marry for love due to her heritage (A common and practical belief that many nobles hold because it's *true*) and she just didn't really have any sort of natural romantic inclination towards Juniper. That seems to be all we can derive from her statements in this chapter.

I'm not saying it's an issue if she is gay or asexual; I just don't think we have the evidence to make either of those conclusions.
