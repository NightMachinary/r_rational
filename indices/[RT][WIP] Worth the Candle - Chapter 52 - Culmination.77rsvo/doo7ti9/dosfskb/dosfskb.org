It's a bit of a shame that your current format is so incompatible with mobile or e-book formats. I find the hovertext tables a neat stylistic departure from the visual information clutter/overload of some other litrpg's.

I thought [[/u/renegadeduck]]'s format for a list was a good place to start. If you want to conserve space, you can keep it in a partial table format.

|            | PHY - Your body and physical existence in the world. Governing stat for all physical skills and the three physical abilities. |           |             |
|------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+-------------|
|            | POW - How much force you can exert. Used to break down doors, bend rebar, or shove someone out of the way.                    |           |             |
|  1-Unarmed | 2-Onehand                                                                                                                     | 3-Twohand | 4-Threehand |
|            | SPD - How fast you move. Used to juggle knives, race over rooftops, or do cartwheels.                                         |           |             |

Etc. (Without reddit's chunky table format)

Or you could opt only to have the descriptors in the first character sheet of the story/book.
