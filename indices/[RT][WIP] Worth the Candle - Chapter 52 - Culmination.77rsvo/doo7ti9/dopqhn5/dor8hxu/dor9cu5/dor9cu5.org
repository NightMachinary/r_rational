You might change the attribute abbreviations to actual words, e.g. POW â†’ Power. It makes it a little more obvious.

Yeah, I get the issue with the list. I was trying to figure that one out, too.

I thought about transposing the table, but that actually makes it wider because of the length of the skill names. That might help with splitting the tables up, though... you could have one table for each overall attribute. Then just set =float: left= and you're good to go. Well, good to spend a couple of hours tweaking it, anyway.

Another way to do this is to make it an image. The idea makes me sad, but it might be the most practical. You might even be able to use SVG, though I have a feeling that mobi doesn't support them and Ao3 won't convert them to something mobi does support.

Hit me up if you need CSS help. I used to be a professional web developer.
