  From the age of nine, Juniper Smith began filling notebooks with his worlds, at first places of fantastical imagination, but later with each as an expression of some theme or idea that momentarily grabbed his interest. Over the course of eight years, he shared these worlds with his friends through twice-weekly sessions of tabletop gaming. Now at the age of seventeen, he finds himself in Aerb, a world that appears to be an amalgam of those many notebooks, stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world is trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.

This marks the end of Book III, at roughly 110,000 words, just shy of the 250,000 word line. There won't (shouldn't) be any discontinuity of publication going into the next "book"; those divisions are mostly there as waypoints so that the kind of people who like to binge-read in chunks have logical stopping/starting places to do that.

I might be cleaning up the work a touch in the next few days in order to ensure that people aren't running into problems on mobile or the downloaded formats; this mostly means ensuring that there's no dependence on the custom CSS or character sheet hovertext.

--------------

If you're a CSS/HTML wizard and have Ideas for how you would redo the character sheet in compliance with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5191202?view_full_work=true][AO3 available options]], which doesn't rely on custom CSS in the work skin, and which works for AO3's "Download" button in EPUB/MOBI/PDF/HTML, let me know, because those are the constraints I would ideally be working within. (Changes to the character sheet would have to be reflected in the text, but that's mostly a non-issue because of how rarely it's been described.)
