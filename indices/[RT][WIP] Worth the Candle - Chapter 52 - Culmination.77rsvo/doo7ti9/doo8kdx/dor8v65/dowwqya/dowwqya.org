I've read all of the stories listed in the top of topwebfiction and the only one I had ever really connected with was Mother of Learning. I think Worth the Candle is now clearly in that category with MoL. The way Juniper analyzes situations is so compelling and the world and its characters are a joy to discover.

The only risk I see is that there are so many open storylines and possibilities right now that there's a risk of not being able to tie everything together at the end. It looks like you have a lot planned out so Ithough so I know you'll do a great job. I'm excited to see where this goes :).
