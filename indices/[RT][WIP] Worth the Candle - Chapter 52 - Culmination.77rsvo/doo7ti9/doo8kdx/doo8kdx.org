Literally one vote below pact, as I write this post.

Told you posting to TopWebFiction would be worth it :P And not only is the position well deserved, I fully expect it to climb.

(Also, I've noticed that your style is to never have post-chapter author's notes, which, to be fair, makes the text a lot easier to read. Though if you'd like to make an exception for the end of a book, you could include the TopWebFiction link on AO3; it doesn't eat links like fanfiction.net does.)
