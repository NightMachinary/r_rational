[[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] Thank you for resolving the romance, and handling it in such a rational way! I've been blue balled so many times from other works that just putter around and never commit to anything, even by the very end. I'm really looking forward to an adventure story with an active relationship going on :D

Also love the speedy releases!!
