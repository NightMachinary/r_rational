You know, I'm continually surprised that people actually like this story. I have a fair amount of confidence in my ability as a writer, but I kind of figured that I'd be a hundred thousand words in and still met with either deafening silence or maybe even "ugh, is this thing still going?". There's always this worry that people will just ... not actually click on things, or that they'll hit some snag early on and leave without the writer having any idea why that happened.

(Some of those people you want to leave, because this is not a story for them, and if they stay after they should have left, they get unhappy and like to vent about how much they don't like this story that was trying to signal them away.)

Anyway, I'm very grateful to everyone for reading, and especially for those who engage with the text, which is not something that I think a writer can count on.
