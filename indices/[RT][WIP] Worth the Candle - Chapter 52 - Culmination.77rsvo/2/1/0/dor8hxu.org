I think tooltip info gets moved to the start of the second chapter, and if you're not on the HTML version, that's the last you ever see of it until the text mentions some part of it explicitly. Originally all of the in-text all-caps mentions of attributes had tooltips, not just the ones in the character sheet, but that was a pain in the neck and I stopped doing it within the first month.

I actually think that one solution to the tables might be to have several "independent" tables that gets "stitched together" through custom CSS. That seems like it would work though; the table consists of six columns, which would then be split up into three tables of two columns each.

The problem with a list is that it would have ~50 entries on it, which is a lot of text to wade through; on desktop, this is fine, because you don't have to look at it if you don't want to, and it represents what it needs to without taking up too much screen real estate.

I'm probably going to have to play around with creating a "test story" and then downloading and tweaking repeatedly.
