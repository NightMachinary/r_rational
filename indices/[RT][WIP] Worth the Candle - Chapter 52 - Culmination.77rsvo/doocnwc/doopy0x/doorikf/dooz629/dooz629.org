Those bits, and also, the way she talks about sex with Juniper as something which stirs feelings of revulsion.

Juniper is - at this point - a fit, intelligent, young man of appropriate age who has been well trained to behave respectfully by a previous lady who is on another planet, which implies he has likely also been taught to be a considerate lover.

More, they have been through several adventures together, and they get along.

Just, all around, taken together, the prospect of banging him should not be something to dread if she had much of a libido aimed at men at all.

Also, just a lot of her interactions with Fenn?
