Well ... currently, your best option is to just check every once in a while, which is kind of a pain in the ass. A story-specific RSS feed is on the AO3 timeline, but it doesn't seem like it's very close.

Alternately, you could set up an HTML page change detection on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/navigate][the table of contents]] using something like [[https://www.changedetection.com/][changedetection.com]], which I can't vouch for.

(It would be possible to set up a manually edited/updated RSS feed if I had somewhere convenient to host it, but that would be a pain in the neck for me. Less of a pain in the neck, but more of a timesink, would be to automatically shoot story update e-mails to a bot that would then update an RSS file ... which is a hackey solution and would still take time I didn't want to devote to it.)

So basically, sorry, there isn't a good way.
