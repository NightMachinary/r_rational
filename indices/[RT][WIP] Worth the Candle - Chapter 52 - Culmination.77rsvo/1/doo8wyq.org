I like this.

It's (so far) a subversion of a harem romance. Instead of Juniper dating both Fenn /and/ Amaryllis, we see Juniper faced with possibilities and making a choice. Not to say that I dislike the idea of harems (they're like candy-stories, fun to read but very unrealistic) or that I'm hoping it does turn into a harem story later on. But I liked how it could have gone either way (Fenn, Amaryllis, or both) with it keeping me guessing.

Thanks [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] for writing such a good story loaded with so many subversions of the usual tropes and cliches.

PS What's the meaning behind your username? The spelling is so odd, but it can't be gibberish.
