This was pretty painful to read, as someone who's been rooting for Amaryllis, but the in-depth exploration of her motives and rational treatment of romance just heightened my respect for her character. Comparing her ruminations to the unicorn's power was an elegant way to frame it, since it was the climax of Amaryllis' arc. Very melancholy, despite a decidedly uplifting ending with Juniper and Fenn; "For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these, 'It might have been.'"
