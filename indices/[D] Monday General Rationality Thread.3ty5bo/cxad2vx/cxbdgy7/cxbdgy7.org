Maybe it would be easier if we broke down what we mean by "better" into multiple categories. While the quality of literature is relative to the preferences of those who read it, people's reading preferences are not SO different that we can't set any standards of good writing at all. At the very least, we can rate his performance against our own preferences and the preferences of different target audiences. Here is how I would probably rate Shakespeare out of ten based on my own literary preferences.

World-building: 6

Characterization: somewhere between 5 and 7

Dialogue: somewhere between 7 and 8

Meaningful content(10) or fluff(0): probably an 8 or a 9 for its time, but somewhere between 6 and 8 relative to some of the really good modern works of literature I've read. Maybe a 4 or a 5 for some of his works (i.e. Twelfth Night was basically a romantic comedy that is kinda similar to a lot of modern romantic comedy movies, and there was actually a movie based on it which takes place in modern times, I think it's called "She's the Man"?)

Description (how well he can describe something in detail in his writing): Maybe a 6 or a 7? It could be an 8 or even a 9 if he was relying on his audience at the time to fill in certain details which might not be noticed so much by a modern person reading the script.

Also, you know how they say that good writers should show not tell, or at least show more than they tell? Shakespeare tells quite a lot but he doesn't show quite as much. A lot of the action takes place off the stage and is only talked about by the characters instead of enacted by them. However, the descriptive quality of the dialogue and dramatic monologues could make up for the insufficient amount of visible action in a format that is meant to be seen rather than just heard.
