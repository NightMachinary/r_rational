Argument -- we under rate him. Speaking with friends who read translations impressed on me just how much English has changed and how little of the Bard we really get. Half of his stuff is gibberish and the other half seems clich√©d. But he's inventing the cliches (both linguistic and, to a lesser extent, dramatic) .

Realistically he is over-rated, but try reading any other 400 year old work without updating. It's a slog. Hell, try reading a 200 year old play. Or the best play from 100 years ago...

And let's just admit. When it comes to a single line or sentence. Big Will crushed it time and again. His greatest hits are truly great. Look at Howard Hughes' rule for a good movie. Three great scenes, no bad ones.
