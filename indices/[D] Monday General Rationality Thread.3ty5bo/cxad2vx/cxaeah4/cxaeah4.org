You'll never be able to point to someone and say that they're unambiguously better than Shakespeare; the question of who is best is an ambiguous one.

As for why Shakespeare is considered /one of/ the best:

- A lot of what he was writing were what we'd now consider transformative works; he was taking old stories and rewriting them. It's easier to write a good story that's been written before, because it's basically as though someone else has done the work of a first draft for you. (A skilled fanfic author can file away the rough bits and breathe life into throwaway characters because they're looking at the work from a distance that the original author didn't have.) Shakespeare happened to live at a time not too long after the printing press came along, so many of his plays became the canonical versions of their story, so he gets more credit than he maybe should get.
- Shakespeare is most famous for his plays, which were developed iteratively. A modern writer hammers away at his manuscript, puts it through an editor, and then publishes, hoping that it passes muster. Shakespeare didn't write the play and then leave it as it was, he could listen to how the audience reacted every time it was performed and adjust the lines and (to some extent) the plot accordingly. His plays are highly iterative in a way that modern publishing doesn't allow for. So advantage to Shakespeare right there.
- Shakespeare was undeniably a skilled writer.
- Shakespeare worked his way into the English canon and then just stayed there.

  - Some of the regard for Shakespeare is just because everyone says that Shakespeare is great. Lots of people say that without understanding half the fart humor in his plays. So there's some degree of "Shakespeare is good because everyone says Shakespeare is good", though there's no way of evaluating how large this factor is.
  - Because lots of people have read Shakespeare, there are a lot more people around to say that Shakespeare is great. It's much easier to hit "top 10" lists if people are aware of you; the world's sexiest man [according to magazines and websites] is almost always someone famous, which seems statistically unlikely even given that famous people tend to be more attractive than non-famous people.

- Shakespeare is competing in uncompetitive realms. It's hard to compare plays and sonnets to novels and films. While there /are/ more writers today, they're mostly not writing plays and sonnets. Few people are going to make the apples to oranges comparison of saying that /The Shawshank Redemption/ was better than /Romeo and Juliet/, because that's even more subjective than value judgements normally are. Besides that, a large number of the things that writers now do are collaborative; you can't lay the success of /The Avengers/ entirely (or even mostly) at Joss Whedon's feet. [Plays are collaborative too, but Shakespeare is judged on his prose, not on the plays as performed in the Globe. It's likely that he didn't write everything in his plays himself -- I can't imagine him not ever getting input from other authors or the actors -- but he gets all the credit.]
- Shakespeare's best stuff is what survived. Most modern authors are judged by their entire body of work and Shakespeare benefits from some of his worst stuff having been forgotten or edited away. I'm sure there were some terrible poems he wrote, but they've been lost to history and Shakespeare looks better for it.
