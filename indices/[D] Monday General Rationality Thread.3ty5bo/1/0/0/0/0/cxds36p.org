Well, that brings up the question of what "emotions" really are, etc. If they don't come from the Force, why do all force-sensitive, sapient species seem to have the same emotional makeup?

There's also the point that not all droids /do/ simulate emotions; battle droids seem quite casual about their own safety, f'rinstance. What do you do then?

(For what it's worth, I think it's pretty clear that the droid-slavery thing is supposed to be a case of motivated cognition. Motivated cognition can be pretty powerful, though, especially on a civilizational scale.)
