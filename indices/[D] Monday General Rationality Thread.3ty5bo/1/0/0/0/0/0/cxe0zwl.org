  If they don't come from the Force, why do all force-sensitive, sapient species seem to have the same emotional makeup?

I'm pretty much at a loss as to why you would think emotions come from the force. Emotions evolved to improve the fitness of the animals possessing them. At a moderate distance, they can be seen as tools or filters.

In any case, all biological life forms in the Star Wars universe have midiclorians, they're likely all evolved from a previous diaspora.

Also, we only see species that have evolved to forms that are capable of interacting with the galactic civilization on at least some level of competence. There's a selection pressure for similarly

Self-awareness is also a tool, one that likely arises any time a reasoning system starts modelling itself and teh consequences of its own behavior. It's extremely unlikely that droids and other AIs would be capable of interacting effectively with the galactic civilization without that tool.
