It doesn't matter if physics is different. Mathematics is all you need. The point is that regardless of the physics in the universe, we have a proof by existence that a certain set of mathematical operations can produce a conscious mind.

What you're saying is that the exact same set of atoms would fail to perform the same operations in the star wars universe. That doesn't matter. The same operations may require additional physical hardware, but that's an implementation detail. The point is that it is mathematically possible to create a conscious mind without the Force.

If you're now arguing that /mathematics/ is different in the Star Wars universe, I will laugh and walk away.
