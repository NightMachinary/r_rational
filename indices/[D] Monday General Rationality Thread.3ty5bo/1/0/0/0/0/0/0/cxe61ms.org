We know /some/ emotions come from the Force; people with a strong Force connection often find their emotions spiralling out of control, in a kind of self-sustaining cycle of Force and emotion.

(I think it's reasonable to infer from the example of Battle Droids that droids can be, and are, programmed to "want" and seek out different things - including not caring about their own self-preservation. That's all I meant.)

More importantly, if you buy the Orthogonality Thesis, at least, is the fact that sapients all seem remarkably like humans in funny suits. As you say, this presumably comes from Midichlorians, presumably a result of some ancient and powerful race - and the source of the Force. Why should we assume that anything /without/ that Force, and those Midichlorians, would be anything like us?

  Self-awareness is also a tool, one that likely arises any time a reasoning system starts modelling itself and teh consequences of its own behavior. It's extremely unlikely that droids and other AIs would be capable of interacting effectively with the galactic civilization without that tool.

Citation very much needed!

I can as easily assert that self-awareness is an artificial shared heritage crafted by some precursor race, or an ineffable quality shared only by Midichlorians, or indeed a recurring parallel-evolved drive that has been observed to always (!) attract and generate Midichlorians - even when the subject is artificial. Except /those/ assertions actually have some proof to back them up.

I'm sure there are /some/ people who've figured out that Droids are basically people-in-funny-metal-suits - even without our Doylist benefits - and taken that to the logical conclusion that their suffering is an immense humanitarian disaster. Just like there are people who believe that animals have rights, or fetuses have rights, and people in every culture who freed their slaves.

But you shouldn't assume that it's /easy/.
