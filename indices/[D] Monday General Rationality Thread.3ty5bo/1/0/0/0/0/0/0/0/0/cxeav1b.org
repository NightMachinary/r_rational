    Why should we assume that anything without that limbic system, and that prefrontal cortex, would be anything like us?

  Well, there's the fact that in our universe there is no limbic system and no prefrontal cortex and we manage to have emotions and be self-aware.

The Force is a fundamental part of the Star Wars verse. SW biology and psychology is very likely inextricably tied to the Force, which is why there are sensitives able to manipulate and commune with it intuitively. There are no humans in the Star Wars verse, only human-shaped characters. No P-Zombies are required to say that the Force is necessary for emotion in SW.
