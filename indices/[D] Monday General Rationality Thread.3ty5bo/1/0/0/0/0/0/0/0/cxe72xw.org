  We know some emotions come from the Force; people with a strong Force connection often find their emotions spiralling out of control, in a kind of self-sustaining cycle of Force and emotion.

That doesn't mean that emotions come from the Force. That just means that emotions are effected by the Force. They're also effected by drugs. And books. And movies.

  Why should we assume that anything without that Force, and those Midichlorians, would be anything like us?
#+end_quote

Well, there's the fact that in our universe there is no force and no midiclorians and we manage to have emotions and be self-aware.

  Citation very much needed!

If you believe otherwise, you believe in Philosophical Zombies. And since we have no midiclorians, that we ourselves are philosophical zombies without self-awareness.

  But you shouldn't assume that it's easy.

Easy? No. Worth doing. Yes.
