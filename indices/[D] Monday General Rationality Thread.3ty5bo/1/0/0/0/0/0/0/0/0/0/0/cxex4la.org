  A collection of atoms performing the same operations would still be conscious in the Star Wars universe.

[[/u/MugaSofer]] is /saying/ that it is very unlikely that the mechanical process of consciousness does not involve the Force. He's saying that (if chemistry is otherwise the same) if you took the component molecules of an intelligent being and printed them in our universe, you would get a catastrophe, akin to a lobotomy patient or a psychopath. Their brain does not /run/ on our physics. This is not a question of whether you can print the component molecules of a human brain in /their/ universe and have it come out functionally the same, although I doubt you could manage that either, since the Force is an energetic process that interacts with regular matter in some way. Physics is /different there./
