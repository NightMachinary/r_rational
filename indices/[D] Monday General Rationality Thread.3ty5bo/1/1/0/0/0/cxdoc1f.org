I know this does not exactly match the EU-canon, but it's going to need a massive rethink re: droids for this kind of fic anyway.

Per the Obi-wan quote on that page - "If droids could think, there'd be none of us here, would there?" - genuine droid sentience would have enormous economic and social ramifications.

Fortunately, manufacturers are aware of this and carefully design usefully intelligent but non-sentient droids. To use MIRI terms, they've avoided creating life or an intelligence explosion, worked around the value alignment problem, and maintained tractability. In other words, droids are tools rather than people, and only do what they're told. In fact, all computing hardware has physical restrictions that enforce these aspects and interstellar law looks very dimly on circumvention.

Anakin Skywalker, child prodigy in a criminal backwater, just wanted to build himself friends.
