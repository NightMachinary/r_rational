My next star wars fanfic will revolve around a group of padawans who go on strike, refusing to refer to the senior members of the order as "Jedi /masters/," complaining this is insensitive to victims of slavery throughout the galaxy. The bulk of the story will consist of a monologue by Yoda thinking through the ethical issues in his inimitable verbal style.
