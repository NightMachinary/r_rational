How did you get that good at reading life sciences papers?

But anyway, what they don't seem to have noted is how they resuscitated the worms in the first place.

I'd also like a breakdown, since you've been doing the numbers, of how this changes the conjunction of probabilities that make cryonics a "good bet" or "bad bet". I've previously held a strong belief that it's a terrible bet, and with new evidence I should update that.
