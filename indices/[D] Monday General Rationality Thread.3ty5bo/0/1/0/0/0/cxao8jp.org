For the slow freezing method they just transferred the frozen worms to a petri dish and don't appear to have done anything else; the worms just thaw out. For the vitrification method:

  One day after olfactory imprinting, the worms were vitrified. We used the SafeSpeed /C. elegans/ protocol described in Barranco et al. This method consists of two components: (1) SafeSpeed closed device (container for the worms), and (2) SafeSpeed closed system vitrification and warming media (cryoprotectant solutions). For each vitrification study using the SafeSpeed closed device, we vitrified five sets of worms at the L2 and L3 stages. The protocol started by transferring the worms from the petri dish to 50 μL of Washing Solution (WS) for 2 min using a Pasteur pipette. The worms were then transferred to 100 μL of Equilibration Solution (ES) for 10 min. Later, the worms were placed in 100 μL of Vitrification Solution (VS) for 1 min, and then introduced into the SafeSpeed closed device. The device was closed with a heat-sealer to avoid contamination and then quickly immersed in liquid nitrogen. The device was held in liquid nitrogen for 30 min and rewarmed in a 37C water bath. The SafeSpeed closed device was opened with scissors, and the worms were placed into 200 μL of Thawing Solution (TS) at 37C for 1 min and then quickly transferred to 200 μL of the Diluent Solution (DS) for 3 min. To finish this protocol, the worms were washed twice in two drops of 100 μL of WS, with 5 min for the first wash and 3 min for the second wash, and finally the worms were transferred to a petri dish with a lawn of /E. coli/ OP50.

Revival steps:

1. After placing in liquid nitrogen for 30 minutes ...
2. Rewarm in 37°C water
3. Open up the SafeSpeed pack the worms are in with a scissors ([[http://safepreservation.com/en/safespeed-device/][this thing]])
4. Put the worms in a thawing solution at 37°C for 1 minute
5. Put the worms in diluent solution for 3 minutes
6. Wash the worms
7. Put the worms in a petri dish

The procedure they're describing there is somewhat opaque, since you'd have to go to the Barranco paper in order to get the method. That's a problem, because their citation says "in preparation" and it doesn't seem to have been published yet. So I have no idea what's in their +four+ five different solutions used in the process. It ultimately doesn't matter, because the results for vitrification and slow freezing were the same as far as the tests went (though vitrification offered a 100% survival rate and slow freezing offered only 20%). Also of note is that the slow frozen worms were frozen for two weeks but the vitrified worms were only frozen for thirty minutes.

Does this substantially increase the likelihood of cryonics working? Well ... there are a couple of issues. First, we don't know the mechanism behind the worm's memory. If the results shown are /chemical/ then they're not terribly exciting. Second, the processes used for freezing and reviving don't seem to be applicable to higher forms of life (like humans).

It sort of depends on where you think the bottlenecks for cryonics are. Personally, I think there are substantial complications on the human side (a cryonics organization needs to successfully freeze you using proper procedures, they need to keep you frozen until the technology exists to revive you, and then you need to be revived). This paper should maybe make you update in the direction of cryonics working if you primary objection was feasibility of maintaining memory through freezing and thawing, but not all that much, and this doesn't seem like it will change the current best practices for cryonics organizations. Perhaps if a follow-up study shows the way "memory" works within the worms, or if we get a better grasp on how memory works within humans?
