I don't think that fictional examples are good examples, are there real world examples of scientific progress with social "deprogression"? Nazi Germany comes to mind, if you're a subset of the population, and even that isn't remotely close to a dystopia for those who would be unthawed (ie not untermensch)

Brave New World is perspectively worse. Side note: are you for or against AIs which are happier when they accomplish their task well? Cause that was the big downside of BNW right, people bred to be happy with less.

Plus, in almost all of those examples one must ask, why would you be revived? They must have the technology and the motive, and if you're being unthawed in most of those examples then you're not experiencing the bad parts of a dystopia (there are people in our world who are experiencing dystopian conditions) are just affected by the same impact of knowing that North Korean's are in concentration camps.
