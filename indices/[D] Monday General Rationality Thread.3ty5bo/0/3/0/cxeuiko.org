Positive medical advances don't require (or even suggest) a utopia. Just look at ... well, half the dystopias in fiction. /Brave New World/ is the prototype for "the world advanced but got a lot worse". /Blade Runner/, /Minority Report/, /The Hunger Games/, /Divergent/, /The Matrix/ ... I probably don't need to go on.

And those are ones where medical technology is explicitly better than in our world, rather than ones where it's not shown but you would expect that to be the case.

Outside the realm of science fiction and just making predictions about the future, all you need is some future in which medical technology has continued to advance but something else has gone wrong in some way. If a rogue oppressive AI takes over the world, you'd expect them to have the technology to thaw people, right?
