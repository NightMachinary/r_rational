Okay, wait, wait. Is this about droids having emotions? I thought this was about the source of emotions in Star Wars biologicals.

Okay, never mind. We've been talking past each other.

There would definitely be a bunch of SW denizens saying that because droids aren't Force-sensitive, they aren't sapient/sentient/emotional/worthy of considering as people, though. And they have /actual science/ to back it up! In biologicals with less Force-sensitivity (headcanon territory now), there is a greater frequency and magnitude of sociopathic and selfish behavior! Why would the same argument not apply to the droids?! What, they can't be compared to biologicals? That's ridiculous! Every mind we know of has a connection to the Force! They simply aren't sentient/sapient/emotional/worthy of considering as people!
