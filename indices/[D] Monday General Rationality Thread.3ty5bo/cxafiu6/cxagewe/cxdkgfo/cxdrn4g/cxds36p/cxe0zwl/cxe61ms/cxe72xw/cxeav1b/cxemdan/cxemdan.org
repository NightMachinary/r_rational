We still have a proof by existence that it is possible to have consciousness without "the force", that consciousness is possible with nothing more than the purely electromechanical interaction of atoms. A collection of atoms performing the same operations would still be conscious in the Star Wars universe.

Whether consciousness is some processing that happens in "the force" or a biological brain, it's the process that is consciousness.
