Possibly the wrong thread, but I can't find an easy answer to this: why is Shakespeare the best/greatest writer of English? He lived centuries ago, and the population of people speaking and writing the language has increased since then, so why haven't we produced any writers we can point to and say "Yep, this person is unambiguously better than Shakespeare was"?
