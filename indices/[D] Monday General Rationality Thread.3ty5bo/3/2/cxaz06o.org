By excluding everything but dialogue, Shakespeare massively narrowed his technical challenges.

Prose has undeniably advanced, especially the development of technical dialects--for technical merit, your average scientific paper is totally to a higher standard than Shakespeare.

But for fiction, yeah, this is pretty bothersome. Bobby Fischer was heads above his opponents at the time of his height, and did more with less than Kasparov, but Kasparov is objectively greater. You wouldn't expect anyone to be more influential, but why not better. The best answer is that literary evolution has been mostly horizontal, focusing on problems like creating new and more complex plots, coincident with a devaluation of formal lingual experimentation by the commercial audience. Relatedly, among the creators, the idea that an ideal, lucid prose style already exists has dissuaded conscious experimentation with English. And it's true that, for efficiency of communication, maybe a local maximum, or even a soft cap, has been reached.

TLDR; Shakespeare attempted technically much simpler creations than what is expected now, making them individually more flawless.

Also, let's be honest, the peeps just be lazy.
