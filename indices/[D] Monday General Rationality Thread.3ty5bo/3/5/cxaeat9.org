Force of tradition maybe?

He was one of the best early writers that we can find and there are not too many works by his contemporaries or before his time that we can actually find. Therefore it's pretty easy to say that his plays are one of the best for his time period purely through the fact that people didn't take as much effort to preserve any other works from the same era.

In addition, people love to exaggerate difficult feats so they start calling Shakespeare the best writer. I mean, would you rather go to a play by the best writer in history, or the play where the announcer is saying, "A play by a great writer who may or may not be the best writer in history!"

Since Shakespeare is legitimately good at writing plays, people repeat his skills being the best over and over and with little to no competition, it becomes historical fact that he is better than anyone else. Since everyone else has to beat out more people to become the best writer of their generation, Shakespeare continues to be perceived as the best through force of tradition.

It might also be because of the snootiness of high society who only perceive plays as being the highest form of literature (despite Shakespearean plays being largely performed for the peasantry in Shakespeare's time).

TL;DR - Shakespeare wins through people just repeating the fact that he is the best and people associate plays as the most sophisticated type of literature to read/watch.
