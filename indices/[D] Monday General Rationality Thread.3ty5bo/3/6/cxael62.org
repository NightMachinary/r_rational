In the words of Newton, we "stand upon the shoulders of giants." The past shapes the present and anyone who is great now can in part attribute their success to past works.

No one can deny the influence of Shakespeare has had on the structure of classic stories, memorable characters, famous quotations, etc. However, how many famous contemporary playwrights can you name? The process of writing has expanded far beyond plays into books, movies, web serials, video games, etc. that "best/greatest" is now being broken down into subcategories.

It would take a very prolific and versatile writer to tap into the different markets of today's world and have the same influence as Shakespeare on English literature and writing for future generations for someone to say "yep. Definitely better than that guy."
