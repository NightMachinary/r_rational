I'm taking "utopia" to mean "major societal problems have been fixed, I experience little in the way of compulsory work, I experience a large degree of freedom, I have rights comparable to other sentient beings, most of my friends and family still exist, I face little in the way of threats or needs". This is fairly close to my life as it exists right now, minus the societal problems thing. I have a large degree of freedom, the burden of work is low, I have friends and family, and I'm fulfilled. Pretty much all of my values are fulfilled and I want for little.

I can't really imagine that I would want to give up two years of my life right now in order to live in the utopia described above for one year. That exchange rate would be way too steep.

(Now, I value a future where people don't get hurt or sick, where everyone has access to information and some semblance of self-fulfillment. But that's mostly about life getting better for people that aren't me, so doesn't factor in. My quality of life isn't substantially reduced by knowing that people are starving to death in North Korea.)
