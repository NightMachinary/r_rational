My work burden is low because I have relatively little ambition in my chosen field, which means that as my expertise has increased my duties have not. I also don't mind the work I do (most of the time) and occasionally find it rewarding. As for friends and family ... I'm an introvert, so I have relatively few friends, which is how I like it. Everything else is down to luck. I consider myself fortunate.

(I'd also note that the breakdown doesn't assume my friends and family are coming into the future with me, so even if my friends and family were sick, it would be the choice between having sick friends and family and having /dead/ friends and family.)
