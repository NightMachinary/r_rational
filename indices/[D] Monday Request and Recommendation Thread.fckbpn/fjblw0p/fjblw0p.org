I highly recommend the film [[http://imdb.com/title/tt3281548/][Little Women]].

I thought it not only a great coming of age story, but also a really poignant portrayal of four intelligent and rational young women and their differing approaches to romance/courting, which they undertake within the paradigm that was true for most of history until very recently: that marriage signified the final death knell for whatever ambition or potential a woman might have had.

This film struck me surprisingly hard, emotionally. I find myself thinking about it often these past few weeks. Truly a great film that can be appreciated on multiple levels(my teenage sister loved the romance and the hunks, for example). Also, the multi level meta-textual ending was very clever!
