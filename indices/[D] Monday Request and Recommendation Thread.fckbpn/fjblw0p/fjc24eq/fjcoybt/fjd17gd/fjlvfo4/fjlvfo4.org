My opinion as of chapter 130, which should be noted is fairly early on:

Category-wise, I would not call this rationalist, and it feels more rat-adj than rational. Although the protagonist feels rational enough, the world doesn't feel like it has any real optimization pressure, and non-MC characters feel a bit ditzy. Klein's power set is generally busted in a way that is bafflingly underutilized, and the whole â€˜Divination Isn't All-Powerful' thing feels like exactly the opposite of what a reasonable person should be taking away from the events of the story.

Entertainment-wise, it's good. It's better translated than most other Chinese web novels, and it's well-paced as long as you don't take that to mean fast-paced. The worldbuilding is engaging, the main character is methodical in a good way, and the story is progressing well. It's not a tense story, or one I've felt the need to rush through, but rather one that is just consistently filling.
