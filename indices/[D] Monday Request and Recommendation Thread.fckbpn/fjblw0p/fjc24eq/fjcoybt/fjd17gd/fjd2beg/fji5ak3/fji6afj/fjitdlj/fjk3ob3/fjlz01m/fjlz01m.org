Oh, I think “good” translation is always a balance between accuracy and accessibility, and the correct balance is highly subjective for both reader and translator.

I personally prefer the translation to carry as much of the original author's meaning as possible while still flow smoothly in the translated language, to be considered “good”. The translator's presence should be as subtle as possible. I am against rewrites with foreign cultural references replaced by native ones. I don't expect nor want translated works to be the same as if a native English writer wrote it, as part of the appeal (to me) is the exotic differences in writing style and cultural views that can be gleamed through the words.
