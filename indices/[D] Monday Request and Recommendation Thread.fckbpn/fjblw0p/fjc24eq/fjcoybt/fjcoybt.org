Time to recommend [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/11022733006234505/Lord-of-the-Mysteries][Lord of the Mysteries]] again. My favourite rationalist novel, involving a quick-thinking protagonist in Lovecraftian fantasy Europe (also inspired by SCP Foundation, Pirates of the Caribbean, One Piece, and video games like Bloodborne & Darkest Dungeon) and a Chinese author that loves setting up 1000+ chapters old foreshadowing. Rereading the novel has been a great pleasure and the writer's seemingly innocent words early on sends chills down my spine after "knowing" what they were hinting at.

My favourite joke by the writer is how a detective character took the alias of the most famous fictional detective while solving all his cases via magical divination, then bullshitting a convincing explanation working backwards logically when asked how the hell he managed to get to the truth. I believed [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] had written about how Sherlock's deductions can't be reproduced by the readers in real life at all, and this seemed like a nod to that observation from the other side of the world.

Be warned that this is translated into English from the Chinese original though, and thus the prose suffers a bit from rather awkward word choices by the translator and some cultural differences (such as weird names for characters).

Chapters after the paywall can be found [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][here]] and on other sites.
