I don't think there's anything wrong with the System favoring the MC build, there's a bit of anthromorphic principle at play.

What I do mind is the fact that the world haven't adapted to this. If the protagonist build is OP(which there is some debate about) then I need a reason for why it isn't popular and if it isn't OP I need a reason to why the rest of the cast keep being positively surprised about it.
