You're thinking small. Theres a reason that it's very, very hard to get arbitrarily powerful in any given setting. Most who try it die because it's *dangerous* or fail because it's *immensely difficult*. Think 1 in 10 million, or even higher.

In Delve you can reach demi-godlike power by simply shooting spells into the air! Besides being present when a blue dies very seldomly (Rain got 18 levels for sneezing on a high level blue) you don't have to get more skilled, achieve any insights, fight reams of progressively harder enemies, or even risk your life slightly. You just have to *spend a lot of Mana*. So if you go a mage class like the dke guy and you hire(or enslave) someone that boosts mana regen then suddenly world domination is 50% easier?

Does a world where no one recognizes this shortcut to power despite the barrier to knowledge being so low(see last comment) seem rational?
