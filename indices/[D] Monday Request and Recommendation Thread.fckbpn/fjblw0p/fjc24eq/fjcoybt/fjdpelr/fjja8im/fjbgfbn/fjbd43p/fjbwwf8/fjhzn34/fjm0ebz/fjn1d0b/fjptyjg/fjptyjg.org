So far I've only found a few.

Enlightened Empire is on Royalroad. It's basically the usual social-uplift story with a person from modern age uplifting medieval society, except this time the protagonist keeps his past memories and instead gains modern day memories. One thing I liked is that he faces a lot of political opposition in his journey, which he both flounders and excels on. Can be hit or miss on that part. Also it's pretty well written for a webnovel.

Release that Witch is the chinese-novel version of the above (These two aren't related stories though, just the same genre), this time with magic. Same basic scenario, but less politics and much more combat and technological development. Much longer though and finished at 1500 chapters.

The Hero's War is apparently also quite similar, although I've heard mixed opinions on it. I haven't read it, so ymmv.

The Dao of Magic has a lot of combat, but a lot of it is also about the MC settling and building his base, as well as experimenting with the magic system. There's crafting in it as well.

Wake of the Ravager also has a lot of combat, but it's going towards base building as well right now. Might be worth looking into in the near future.

Farming for Gold has a protagonist who becomes a farmer in a vrmmorpg, and it follows from there. Lot's of farming and crafting.
