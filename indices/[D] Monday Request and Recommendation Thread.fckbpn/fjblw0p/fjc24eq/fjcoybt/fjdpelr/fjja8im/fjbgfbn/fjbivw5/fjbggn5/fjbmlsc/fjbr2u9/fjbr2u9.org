It's a decent story that I enjoy even though it's lacking any semblance of plot or protagonist agency.

My main critique of the story is that the magic system feels so blatantly built so the MC will appear special. I just don't understand why any system would advance skills/spells depending purely on the amount on the amount of Mana that is spent on them. Really? Not any of a hundred better indicators of progression and familiarity, but simply the resource that it takes to use it? (And which the MC specializes in)

That's like getting better at math for every pencil you wear down to a nub, or getting stronger muscles the more calories you eat. No, it just feels like the author designed the magic class he wanted, and then worked backwards from there. It's hard to call something like that rational.

And I'm well aware that the protagonist is in no way op, bla bla bla. My point stands.
