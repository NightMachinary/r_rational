At level 18 Rain's build is pretty much pure support. He loses 1v1s because he has almost no attack and almost no defense.

At level 26 he gets Prismatic Intent, and with all his skills hitting level 15, he becomes completely busted. My â€˜PrismInt f26' build, which has Rain permanantly using Focus in combat (Detection is used to navigate), has

- 200k armour against all elements,
- complete shutdown of magic use by anyone else in a 275m radius,
- permanant Detection with 525m radius,
- 11x movement speed,
- all of the above permanantly active with enough mana spare to recover from empty in 22 seconds,
- and when he wants to do damage he deals out >500k burst, mixed element, in a 62.5m radius.

Prec f29 is even more busted, when Precision starts letting him run around at 1500x speed.
