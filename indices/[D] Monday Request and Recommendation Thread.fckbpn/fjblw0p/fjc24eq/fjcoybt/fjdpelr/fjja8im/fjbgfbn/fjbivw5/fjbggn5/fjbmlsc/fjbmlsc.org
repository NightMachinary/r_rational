I think Delve qualifies as both rational and rationalist. The setting makes sense and is justified in-world, and the characters are solving real problems using actual intelligence. Most particularly, Rain is Level 3 Intelligent. I think the worst that one can say about the story from this angle is that they don't agree with the details of the worldbuilding or the thinking Rain does, not that it isn't there.
