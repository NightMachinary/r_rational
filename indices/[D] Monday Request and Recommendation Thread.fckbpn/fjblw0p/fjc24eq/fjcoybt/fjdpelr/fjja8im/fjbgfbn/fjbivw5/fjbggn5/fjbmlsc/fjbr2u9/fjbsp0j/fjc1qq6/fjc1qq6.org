  same argument about getting XP
#+end_quote

It would be a dumb argument though. XP is perfect at what it was designed to do, which is to encourage a player to kill enemies/win battles/finish quests by quantizing success and showing iterative progress towards greater power.

What would gaining power by spending mana encourage any halfway intelligent person to do, do you think? Does it look anything like the world of Delve to you? Because to me it does not, not in the slightest. Not combined with the fact that:

- all the relevant skills are tier 0 or 1
- low tier skill trees can be unlocked by anyone of any other "class" by simply spending a negligible amount of XP
- XP requirements apparently increase on a gentle linear slope- Rain was able to max level and max skill in a month or so while homeless and destitute. It takes other classes many years to do the same, supposedly.
- mage classes can be very, very strong and their main downside is a slow and weak initial power curve. What if they could level up many times faster?

and so on and so on.
