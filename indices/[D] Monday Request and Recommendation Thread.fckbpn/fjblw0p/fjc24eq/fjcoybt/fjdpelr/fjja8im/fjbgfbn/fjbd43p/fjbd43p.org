I'm in the mood for a new story that tackles internet forum/chatroom dynamics, like The Northern Caves or 17776. Unfortunately, that's incredibly rare. Any recommendations?

I will also use this post to second last week's(?) recommendation of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl/chapter/442507/chapter-1][Dungeon Crawler Carl]], a slightly outside-the-numbers litRPG. I'd hardly call it rational, but it's reasonably smart, funny, and the writer sounds like he's having the time of his life writing it.
