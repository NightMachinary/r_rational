'Practical Guide to Evil' scratches a few of the same itches - instead of capes you have Named, there's still the hero/villain divide, and (without too many spoilers) there are some enemies or problems where Named need to work across the good vs evil divide. It's also fairly dark and depressing at times. That said, Worm is better-written on the whole, and has more side characters that are slightly better fleshed out. I'd call PGtE 'Worm, but shorter and more tightly plotted, plus it's fantasy instead modern'.
