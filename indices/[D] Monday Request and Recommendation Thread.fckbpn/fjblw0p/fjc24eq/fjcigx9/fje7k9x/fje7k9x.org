I feel like an ass saying this, but if it's a depressing, realistic story you're looking for, Pyrebound is pretty good.

The setting and characters are pretty novel (if not always likeable), and the writing itself is top-notch. The prose, the pace, the character moments are all well done. It truly feels like something written by a professional author.
