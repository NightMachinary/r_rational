Prequel is not really what I'm looking for. I'm not asking for interactive stories or text adventures (assume I already read [[https://mspfa.com/?s=132&p=1][all the good ones]]), but ones where forum or chatroom dynamics are a huge part of the story.

I suggest you look at the Blakin character in the Chili chatroom chapters and consider I may already know of it. Grateful for the attempt though. I guess maybe I should write a story myself if I want more of this type of thing.
