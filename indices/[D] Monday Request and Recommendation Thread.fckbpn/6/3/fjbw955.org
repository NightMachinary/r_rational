Have you read the webcomic Homestuck? Because it does the internet forum / chatroom dynamics very blatantly, and basically the Northern Caves was written from a perspective informed by the author's experience with Homestuck, and two of 17776's characters bear a marked resemblance to homestuck characters. Homestuck has incredibly good parts and also incredibly flawed parts, with tons of amazing strengths and also total glaring weaknesses. If the strengths happen to line up with your taste and you either don't mind or can look past the weaknesses, it can be a great experience - but if the opposite happens, it'll be a pile of garbage for you. If you really liked TNC & 17776, I think that's at least a weak sign you'd like Homestuck too.

Edit: I've just noticed your flair references a Homestuck fanfic, so I am pretty sure you've at the very least tried Homestuck; Leaving the rec up for other people, if they are also interested in this sort of thing.
