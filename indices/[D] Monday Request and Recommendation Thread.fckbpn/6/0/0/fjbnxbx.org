  Worm has PHO, Parahumans Online, chapters where people in-universe respond to events of the story, though I think there are only two such chapters in the entire thing.

Wildbow does a good job representing online interactions in his stories.

Pact had a climactic chapter that primarily took place in an IRC channel - it's one of my favorites. Also, the sequel to Worm, called Ward, began with a series of nine 'teaser' chapters each following a different (and at the time mysterious) character through forum and IRC interactions.
