I've made an error. I used the word rationalist when I meant rational. Sorry about that.

Yes, there are a lot of the adjacent tropes as defined in the sidebar in this novel, and I find the villains and protagonists act in an /extremely logical and reasonable manner/.

I only got fully onboard this novel once I finished volume 1, myself.
