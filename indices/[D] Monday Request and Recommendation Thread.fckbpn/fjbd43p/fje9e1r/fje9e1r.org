If you're a Homestuck fan, there's [[https://www.prequeladventure.com/2011/03/prequel-begin/][Prequel - or - Making a cat cry: The Adventure]].

The story itself is unrelated (it's about a Khajit struggling with depression, prior to the events of /TES: Oblivion/), but the, ah, format is very clearly inspired by Homestuck. It's hard to describe, but really easy to grok.

Warning: the story is pretty depressing at first. My advice is, try to stick to it past the second blackout; it's the lowest point of the story, and things get better from there. Like, I'm actually serious. Most of the time sticking to a story that's getting you down is a bad idea, but in this case it's /actually/ worth it, and it feels amazing to see the progress Katia makes.

Also there are Homestuck-style minigames towards the later arcs and they're all amazing. Special mention to the Greater Impmaster Murderboss.

Also, there are side-stories, which are pretty cool on their own.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/][Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation]] has some nice chatroom chapters.

Warning: the story is currently on hiatus, and the author has personal problems and prior history which... eh, I'd say there's a 50% chance the story ever gets completed. Even incomplete, it's worth reading.
