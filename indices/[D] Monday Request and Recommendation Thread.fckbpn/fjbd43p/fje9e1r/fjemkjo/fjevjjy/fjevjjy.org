Oh, right, didn't notice your username.

Also, /Pact/ has a chatroom chapter, but you probably don't want to go through the entirety of Pact just for that chapter.

/The World as it Appears to be/ also has a pretty good Homestuck-style chatroom chapter, but again, it's a single chapter in a long story.
