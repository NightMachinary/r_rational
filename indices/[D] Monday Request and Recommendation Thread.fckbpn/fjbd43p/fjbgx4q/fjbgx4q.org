I only really have 2.

Worm has PHO, Parahumans Online, chapters where people in-universe respond to events of the story, though I think there are only two such chapters in the entire thing. So it might not be what you're looking for.

The other is a one shot called "You Know You Have a Permanent Piece of My Medium-Sized American Heart" by tricatular on Archive on our own. A sort of continuation to the film "The Martian" where Nasa puts out an edited version Mark Watney's logs to the internet and seeing the internet react to the events of the film with memes, tumblr posts, and article titles.
