  Rain's build is busted AF.
#+end_quote

Everyone is busted AF, because everyone has ridiculous synergies (243 firebolts, or was it 729? 2187?). Rain would lose in a 1v1 match against a level 18 enemy, and lose /horribly/ against a lvl 26 enemy. Heck, just look at his theorycrafting for the Passive build.

(EDIT: Look at the Umbral Charger fight to see how he did as early in level 18 vs. a Level 10 monster)

Of course, that might change once he ranks up and can start getting more out of Aura Synergy paired with Aura Compression. Scaling the effect of all of your skills with (max ranks)^{2} is pretty good, and what he has is significantly better.
