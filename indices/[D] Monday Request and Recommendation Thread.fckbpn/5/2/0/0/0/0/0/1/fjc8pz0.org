No, the world doesn't work like this.

Teams killing blues max out at fairly small numbers, and blues are rare, which puts a hard limit on how many high rankers there are. At /any/ rank, reaching the level cap is acheivable with non-exceptional effort. All a high mana recovery gives you is the opportunity to get to that stage younger, which is practically worthless compared to having a good build. How many people actually have the need to gain 18 levels in a couple of months?
