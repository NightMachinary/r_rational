  In Delve you can reach demi-godlike power by simply shooting spells into the air!

You can't - you need to kill Blues that are (and this is the important part) /higher level than you are/. Consistently. Rain probably can't even do that right now.

  Besides being present when a blue dies very seldomly (Rain got 18 levels for sneezing on a high level blue)

This is the part that people who complain about Delve's system don't seem to get - Blue monsters are incredibly rare. Tamed dungeons can only produce level ~5 Blues at best.

The level 18 Blue that showed up just after Rain teleported in was the only Blue in the area; after all, the flare of mana from the teleport attracted monsters, and it's the only one that showed up. Without the flare of mana, the party wouldn't have encountered the creature at all.
