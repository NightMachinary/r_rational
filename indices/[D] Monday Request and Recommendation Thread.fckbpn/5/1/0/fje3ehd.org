  The Perks of Immortality
#+end_quote

I'm the author of this story, thanks for linking to it. I'm continually surprised at how often it gets shared on this subreddit. I certainly didn't set out to write a rationalist fiction. I'm not complaining. I like rationalist fiction and was aware of it before I started writing the story. Maybe I can't help but write something that has at least some rationalist appeal. But there are many ways in which my story breaks from other rationalist fiction norms:

1. The MC is by no means brilliant. He isn't dumb either. But he isn't going to make huge leaps in logic or outsmart his enemies.
2. The MC is a man with a hammer. The hammer in his case is fighting and killing. He is aware that not all problems are nails, but hes only got a hammer so what's he gonna do?
3. I explicitly avoid the MC trying to munchkin the hell out of his powers. Not because they aren't munckinable, but because his personality just isn't the type to obsess over every little advantage.

Perhaps the one rationalist thing I have going for the story is that I can easily avoid deus ex machina. The rules of the story allow him to get killed and come back. Unlike most stories that have to break their rules to save the MC, I'd have to break my rules to kill the MC.
