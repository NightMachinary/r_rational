[[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][Level 3 Intelligence]] isn't primarily in the degree of smartness, but rather in its observability.

  You cannot create recognizable, learnable intelligence by declaring that your characters use a technique and therefore win. Level 3 intelligence exists on the level of paragraphs, not whole plots. It is in how your character arrives at the next thought shown one paragraph later. The ultimate story outcome doesn't matter to how well that cognitive algorithm would work in real life or whether the reader learned anything by reading it. Deciding that a character will win using some technique is telling the reader about intelligence, not showing it to them; it is praising the skill, but not yet explaining it. This isn't to say that your characters can never win when they use techniques. It's just that the part where the plot says they win doesn't constitute part of the difficult work of showing good thinking (though how a victory plays out can be important to the illustration).

Rain's thinking is out-loud and reflects the author's attempts to reason about the setting through the character of Rain. It's very deliberate about doing this, and although I don't think SenescentSoul has the same incisive clarity that Eliezer does, I don't think he needs to.

There is a small matter of degree since your characters need to have actual intelligence to show those thoughts out loud, but I think for the most part Rain gets by.
