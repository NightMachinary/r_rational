I appreciate the good will :). As to Rain's quirks, I guess they don't strike me as badly as they do you because I can see myself doing them, maybe to a lesser extent. I often flabble about when describing things in speech, and if I went through what Rain did, I'd probably be wearing my armour 'round town too.
