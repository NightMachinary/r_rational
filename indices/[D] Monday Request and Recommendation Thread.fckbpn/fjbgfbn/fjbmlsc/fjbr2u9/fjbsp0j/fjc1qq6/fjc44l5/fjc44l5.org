I don't get why this matters. Taking a few years to level is hardly onerous. Inconvenient, sure, but hardly worth chosing a bad build to avoid. The key currency in Delve is the level cap, not XP.

The relevant skills can't be trivially unlocked by simply paying XP for low-tier skills, because Channel Mastery is hidden and most of the rest of the relevant stuff (Prismatic Intent, Aura IFF and Aura Compression) is tier 2 or up. For traditional builds XP is a scarcer resource, which means those won't be discovered by many people.

People don't pick Rain's build because it's not that good before level 26 (and it's terrible if you aren't support for a good team), which most people won't reach, and because figuring out how broken it gets at level 26 requires having explored the tech tree.
