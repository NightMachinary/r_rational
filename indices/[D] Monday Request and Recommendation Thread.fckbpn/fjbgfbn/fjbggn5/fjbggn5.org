/Author's Description/: This is a litrpg, with attempts at humour, a bit of psychology and a lot of magic. This is a "System apocalypse" novel where the protagonist is sent to another world prior to the apocalypse. It will almost exclusively follow the perspective of Alexis as she makes her way through her journeys.

/Note: A little bit of a departure from a standard Isekai LitRPG in that it seems to be leading towards dealing with the nature of the System as a whole (based on the very first chapter)./

/Author's Description/: *It's the most-watched game show in the galaxy!*

In a flash, every human-erected construction on Earth--from Buckingham Palace to the tiniest of sheds to all the trucks and cars--collapses in a heap, sinking into the ground. 

The buildings and all the people inside, they've all been atomized and transformed into the dungeon: an 18-level labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and loot. A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.

Only a few dare venture inside. But once you're in, you can't get out. And what's worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it's game over. In this game, it's not about your strength or your dexterity. It's about your views and your followers. It's about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.

*You can't just survive here. You gotta survive big.*

/Author's Description/: Set in the far future when humanity has reached the stars and finds it is not the first to do so. Alien technology has been left behind by a long dead race. Ancient cities, abandoned starships, temples and fortified bunkers all contain artefacts and devices far in advance of what humans have been able to produce. Technology that feels more akin to magic, so powerful it can allow a single person to dominate a star system. But these relics of another time have been left well-defended and behind bewildering and impenetrable security measures. 

There are those who are compatible with the alien technology, who can augment themselves to face the evermore extreme protocols in the depths of the alien ruins, and by doing so attain greater power. And there are those who just want to sell what they find to the highest bidder.

The rewards are high, but you have to be prepared to go further and risk more to discover the greatest secrets of a civilization that vanished long before the first human walked upright. Secrets that could irrevocably change humanity's future, or end it.

/Note: I haven't read Book 2, so far, which is 64 updates in. No particular reason, there was just a gap in updates between books 1 and 2, and I haven't gotten around to picking it back up. The point being, I don't know if the quality has kept up./
