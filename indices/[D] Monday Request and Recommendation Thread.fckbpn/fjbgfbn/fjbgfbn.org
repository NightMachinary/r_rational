Current list of updating webfictions that I follow on RoyalRoad.

Any of the ones listed here scores at least a 4/5 stars for me, usually trending higher. None of them would I describe as "rational", or even "rationalist" (barring a couple exceptions), but I enjoy them. Especially when compared to the sheer overwhelming quantity of...lower quality fictions on these sites.

I can provide further descriptions and discussion of the individual fics if requested.

/Most Relevant Tags (acc to me)/: LitRPG, Isekai, Fantasy, Psuedo-Rational, Slice-of-Life, Math

/Author's Description/: What would you do if you woke up alone in a forest in nothing but your pajamas?

This is a story about a man trying to answer that question as he navigates a world of monsters, magic, adventure, and numbers going up. It isn't all fun and games, though. Survival is tough when you are alone, and the dangers of this world are not to be underestimated.

This is a world governed by a system of stats, skills, and dialog boxes. It is vital to know how the system works if you want any chance of having a life of meaning. Too bad someone forgot to include the instruction manual.

/Author's Description/: As Zac was alone in the middle of the forest the world changed. The whole planet was introduced to the so-called multi-verse by an unfeeling System or God. A universe where all races and civilzations fought for power and dominion. 

Seemingly forgotten by the System, Zac found himself stuck in the wilderness surrounded by deadly beasts. Alone, lost and without answers, he must find the means to survive and get stronger in this new cut-throat reality.

/Most Relevant Tags (acc to me)/: LitRPG, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Dark Hero (hero has questionable morals, but not Anti-Hero), Harem(?), Sexual Content

/Author's Description/: On the world of Marconen, your first Break determines the trajectory of your life. Calvin chose magic. Without proper schooling or a mentor, the boy is dragged by the whims of fate across the face of the planet, blending together different schools of magic and powerful abilities to create something new.

But there's a deeper secret behind his success. Why was he born an exile from his country? Why is his System so strange, and why does it keep talking to him?

And as the march of time continues, something evil grows in power across the ocean.

/Note: The author includes a 'Harem' tag, which I guess is kinda accurate? But the harem aspect of the story has decreased significantly as time has gone on, and I have not found that it is present enough to bother me. If, y'know, I was bothered by harem fics. No comment. This also applies to the level of sexual content, which was never a lot to begin with./

/Note: Murderhobo style "rationalism" can be sorta seen if you squint and look at it funny. Ends up being humorous, to me./

/Most Relevant Tags (acc to me)/: LitRPG, Fantasy, Dungeon, Magic, Non-Human Lead, Sexual Content

/Author's Description/: Dungeon: A place full of monsters, traps, treasure, and death. Those are the Great Dungeons, with unplumbed depths below the roots of the mountains.

That's not for me.

Dungeon: A place of rape, torture, and death, to control and corral enemies and slaves. These are the Red Cores, from which the mage-kings draw their power.

That's also not for me.

I don't like monsters. I don't want adventurers. I want to stay well away from enemies and slaves.

Fortunately, there are alternatives...

/Note: While the sexual content is relevant to the story, each chapter with such is clearly labelled before hand, and skippable. It happens to be well written, I think, but the more important fact is that sexual contact happens, rather that the content of said interaction./
