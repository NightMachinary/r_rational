It's true that if you're not used to reading non-native English works, this may be a large hurdle to overcome. I've devoured so many Japanese, Korean, Chinese webnovels that I've become inundated.

I hope you bear with it because the plot and everything makes it all worthwhile, in my opinion. Skip some of the fine details regarding the hermetic rituals if you must.
