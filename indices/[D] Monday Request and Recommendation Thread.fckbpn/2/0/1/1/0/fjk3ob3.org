Good translations are close to rewrites in any language. The German-translated books I read had jokes, puns, idioms, and even songs and poems all in German, despite originally being English or Italian.

Look, for that matter, how anime is translated into English. Is it an accurate translation? Lol no. Is it enjoyable and telling the same plot. Yes, imo.
