To add a bit stylistically, Shino did a lot of /glancing/ at Naruto (not a crazy amount, but enough that I noticed).

Also, the "modern usage" of the phrase "begs the question" can raise [[http://begthequestion.info/][plenty]] of [[https://public.wsu.edu/%7Ebrians/errors/begs.html][hackles]]. Which, if Shino's supposed to be all precise and shit, might not be entirely fitting for his character (unless you're trying to use him to poke fun at pseudointellectual "pop-Bayesianism" or something).
