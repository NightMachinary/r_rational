  Honestly this seems too powerful, considering it again. How does that work?

That's actually canon. I was originally going to change it to "half the remaining chakra" but decided just to KISS.

The version I'm using is actually enormously nerfed from canon. The canon version gives Naruto the memories of the clone when it pops. As a result, his standard trick is "make 1,000 clones, we all practice a jutsu together and learn 1000x faster". That trick is so common that it's the reason I nerfed it in my version.
