  Also, stylistically, Shino did a lot of glancing at Naruto (not a crazy amount, but enough that I noticed).

I consider myself pretty well read, and I have only ever heard BTQ used in the sense that I used it. The traditionalists may rail against its usage changing, but I'm afraid that the makers of Kleenex lost their fight too. Personally, the one that gets me is that [[http://imgur.com/gallery/fycHx][not using the Oxford comma]] is often considered acceptable.

I think traditionalists are better off simply using the phrase "circular reasoning", which is just as well known, shorter, and actually describes what it's referring to.
