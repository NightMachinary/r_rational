Orochimaru's actions make a lot more sense in the context of preparing for an existential threat. (*/cough/*/Akatsuki/*/cough/*) Even if he's a complete sociopath interested only in the accumulation of knowledge, he'd still wish to prevent it. World-engulfing wars have an annoying tendency to destroy valuable tomes, and fighting for survival and/or experimental freedom is /such/ a time sink.
