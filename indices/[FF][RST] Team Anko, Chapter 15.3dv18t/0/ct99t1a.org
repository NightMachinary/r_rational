I get the feeling Kurama is slowly bartering senses off Naruto in exchange for more skills and power. And that he was purposely mucking up the chakra sheathing while Naruto was trying to practice earlier.

Could he eventually turn Naruto into a puppet, I wonder? Have our blonde-haired hero call on his power and subvert control immediately, leaving the chakra-beast functionally free and in total control of Naruto's body?
