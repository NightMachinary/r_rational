  Kurama's malevolence is all but confirmed

Oh, come on! There are plenty of ways this could play out and the obvious manipulation would be utterly boring and disappointing. Personally, I think this is a multilevel play:

- Is Naruto smart enough to detect the blindingly obvious manipulation?

- If he is, what will he do with the information? Allowing Kurama to access his body even if he recognises the dangers may serve as a costly signal that he is willing to trust him and negotiate in good faith.

- Something else I'm not smart enough to immediately recognise.

I mean, surely Kurama is not clumsy enough to play on the level of manipulation even a socially inept person like me detects immediately?
