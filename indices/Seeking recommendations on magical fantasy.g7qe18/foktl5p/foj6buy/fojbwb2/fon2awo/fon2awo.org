  I specified magical fantasy because I was thinking of Chinese Cultivations as part of fantasy elements.

Gotcha. I haven't read any cultivation fiction because everyone who has told me anything about it has literally said "It's trash." Maybe I'm simply talking to the wrong people.

Thank you! It was my first published novel and I'm always delighted to hear that people enjoyed it.

The first book is complete. SirPoley did either 1 or 2 sequels with the last one being on apparently-permanent hiatus. They're in the same FFN 'thread' as the first novel so it's not entirely clear that they are distinct, but they definitely are.
