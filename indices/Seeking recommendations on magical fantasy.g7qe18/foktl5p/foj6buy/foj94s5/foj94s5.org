The Wandering Inn is a LitRPG that's very heavy on the lit and light on the RPG. It's one of my all-time favourite pieces of fiction.

The protagonist, a young woman, is dropped into a fantasy world with levels and skills (but again---very light on the gamelike elements), specifically in a region with the majority of the population being nonhuman humanoid species. She decides to start running an broken-down inn outside the walls of the city. Other Earth characters also show up later.

Edit: what I forgot to mention is the obvious part, which is that the setting is a medievalesque fantasy setting.
