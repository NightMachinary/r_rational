You might want to look over on [[/r/progressionfantasy]], it sounds like that's pretty close to the style you're looking for. Aside from Cradle, Will's Traveler's Gate series also works pretty well for what you're talking about. You may also enjoy Forge of Destiny, Delve, Mage Errant, or my own Arcane Ascension books.
