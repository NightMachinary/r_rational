It sounds like Indigo tea is delicious, and Greens just want Blues to experience it, regardless of the standing social mores. The answer is obvious: legalize and de-stigmatize the act of tricking people into drinking Indigo tea.

EDIT:

Joking aside, Blues drink tea they don't want for many reasons, and their recollection of those reasons is often fuzzy. Even if you could investigate every claim of deception, you might find that some Blues thought the Green in question really did want that kind of tea, while the Green caved to social or emotional pressure and felt they had no other choice.

You're also overlooking the cases where Blues trick Greens into drinking Purple or Indigo tea. While the cases might not be widely publicized, they can be just as damaging to the victims.

The biggest problem you're facing is that if you devise a systematic approach, it immediately allows for optimization. If some Greens or Blues have perverse goals, they can analyze the ruleset to see what actions will maximize the probability of those goals. A few scenarios:

1. A Green tricks a Blue into drinking Indigo tea, so the Blue accuses the Green.

2. A Blue tricks a Green into drinking Indigo tea, and then accuses the Green.

3. Someone tricks a Green into drinking Indigo tea with a Blue, and then accuses the Blue of tricking the Green.

... I think the rabbit hole goes all the way down.

EDIT 2:

Pro-tip: Never host so-called "Indigo Tea Parties".
