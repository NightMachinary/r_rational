Other things you can do:- An anonymous survey of everyone to see if they've been tricked into drinking purple or indigo tea, both in general and at your particular tea party Have a clear code of conduct for your tea party which covers both tea trickery and other anti social behaviour, have a clear way for people to report infractions anonymously Hve an open debate in your group about how to achieve intimacy without trickery and how to handle issues Decide on a case by case basis whether to ban people from the tea party or perhaps just to warn them that they need to improve their behaviour Always ban people if there is more than one report of trickery
