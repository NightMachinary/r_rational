Hey, those are some good questions. (As a quick note, here, i'm speaking unofficially as Owen and not for ESPR.)

I ended up writing a [[https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/Gbw9Tnqeo9crTNGrg/unofficial-espr-post-mortem][fairly long post-mortem]] that analyzed my thoughts on how ESPR 2017 went, if you're curious about a lot of the intricacies.

Overall, the program is longer (2 weeks vs CFAR's 4 days), and it's a lot more campy. We have lots of random events like sword fighting, dancing, board games etc. The courses are a mix of CFAR-style rationality ([[https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/bxc6Box8JJbzv3oQt/instrumental-rationality-4-1-modeling-habits][TAPs]], [[https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/53pxcve5kgwoLFvzD/instrumental-rationality-2-planning-101][Murphyjitsu]], etc.).

We're not explicitly focused on trying to steer people into a certain career (although effective altruism is mentioned), and there's also classes on mathematics/programming (e.g. Haskell, decision-making, probability, etc.)

I think that overall most students will just have an enjoyable time. I think that also maybe 3-4 students from each cohort will be /really/ into this rationality stuff and find it maybe worthwhile to keep thinking about in the future.

(As was the case for me.)

I would like to see more about how to get info from the effects of this program. It's unfortunate to say, but with the large amount of planning to just make the event happen, I didn't have a lot of breathing room to go super meta and track metrics last year. (Even though this was definitely on our wishlist.)

I'd need to spend some more cycles on how we could evaluate this, though. (If you have thoughts on this, feel free to drop them below or send them over privately. This is an active area of interest for me ^{_^{.)}}
