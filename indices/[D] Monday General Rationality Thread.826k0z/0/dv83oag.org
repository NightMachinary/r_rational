Hey everyone,

I'm helping run [[https://espr-camp.org/][ESPR]], a rationality camp for talented students 16-19 again this year!

We're affiliated with CFAR (who is technically our parent org) and OpenPhil, and I'm stoked to announce that applications are now open!

I'm happy to answer any questions you might have, and if you're within the age range (or if you're in an interesting exception case!) I'd highly encourage you to apply.
