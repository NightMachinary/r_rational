  I'm sick of no one getting any of my references. I'm sick of almost all of my favorite literary masterpieces not being respected or even known about by anyone that I have met or will ever meet in real life.

I'm sick of people seeking the normies' validation of their interests. We have obscure interests, why can't you accept that for what it is? Why does everything you like have to be popular and accepted by people who don't care for it?
