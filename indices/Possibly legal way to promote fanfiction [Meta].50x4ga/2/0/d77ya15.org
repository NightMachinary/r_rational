That's not the problem. The problem is that they are artificially being forced to remain obscure so I have no one to talk about them to in real life and never will. The problem isn't that people wouldn't be interested if they knew it's that they don't know about it and they don't respect it and they somewhat stigmatize it. How would you feel if that happened to most of your favorite novels?
