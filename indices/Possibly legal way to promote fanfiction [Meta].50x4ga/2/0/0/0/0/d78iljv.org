in that case what do you think is actually going on with the hugos? from what I recall, some conservative political organization or something created those two voting blocs in the Hugo's, Sad Puppies and Rabid Puppies, to conduct an experiment to test which of the following criteria the Hugo Awards valued more in nominated literary works:

1. writing quality
2. how well it fit the "social justice" narrative

They recommended a bunch of better-written non-SJW works as the control group and a bunch of less well-written SJW works as the experimental group. What they found was that across the board works in the experimental group consistently beat out the control group for nominations. And in fact when a SJW work didn't get the nomination in a particular category, the Hugo Awards judges were willing to decide not to nominate anything for the category at all. Therefore the Hugo awards favor books more for fitting the social justice narrative than for being well-written.

Of course, the people who actually conducted the experiment were not professional researchers and were working for a conservative poltiical organization, so not only is it possible that I misread their results (it wasn't even formatted as a scientific report), but they might not be totally reliable. Still, the experiment they did does seem pretty clear cut.

The only way I can think of that they could have biased their results is that if they pressured the judges to not nominate anything if a SJW work didn't win in a category, then that says more about the political power of the SJWs then it does about the real criteria that is being used to determine nominations for the Hugo Awards. Nevertheless, the fact that so many less well-written SJW works won out over better-written non-SJW works is fairly strong evidence that the Hugo Awards care more about having their nominations fit the "social justice" narrative than about writing quality.

Of course, I suppose it's also possible that all of those SJW works actually had much better writing quality than the organization that conducted the experiment believed, and that "fitting the "social justice" narrative is actually the /second/ most important criteria for determining nominations, rather than the first.

However, considering some of the titles and book descriptions though, and considering that this /is/ the "social justice" movement we're talking about here, I kinda doubt that.
