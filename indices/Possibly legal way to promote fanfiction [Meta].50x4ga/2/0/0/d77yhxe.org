  How would you feel if that happened to most of your favorite novels?

Most of my favourite novels are scifi/fantasy and written in a weird foreign language nobody understands beyond being able to tell American tourists to go fuck themselves, so this is exactly the case. I don't mind, because the last thing I want is the kind of people I know IRL polluting my autistic safe space. It's bad enough that we've got rabid SJWs shitting all over the Hugos. I categorically prefer obscurity to this kind of publicity.
