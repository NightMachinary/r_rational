Yeah, I really think it would be better if we had some way of giving the authors enough power to satisfy them that their reputation won't be ruined while also keeping them from having unilateral power to ban any fanfic that doesn't tickle their fancy. I don't know if it's possible, but until such a balance can be struck I'd like to err on the side of keeping the framework alive.
