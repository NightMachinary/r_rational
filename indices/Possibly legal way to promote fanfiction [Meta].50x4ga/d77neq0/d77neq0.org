I don't know enough about the legalities to guess at whether the red tape will favour you or not, but I have a suggestion or two that might streamline things.

A good first step of this process would, I think, be to have two authors who have expressed fondness of each others' work write their fanfiction novel based on the other author's work. This accentuates the way each author supports the others' work and it would be easier to present it under a banner of the concept of published fanfiction.

Another thing to consider is whether you could include a plan to have the company responsible for the source material approve the fanfics, to avoid grey areas like fanfics 99.9% identical to the source material to avoid copyright or subjects the company doesn't want people to associate with their story, since we know that for every HPMOR there's a Cupcakes. It would be a compromise, sure, but it's a foot in the door that would otherwise be slammed and locked.

If you really want to see this done, I'd think about contacting relatively new and less widespread authors for this, since it would be easier to get your message heard than if you were to try and get J.K.Rowling on board and newcomers to the field might be more amenable to such a novel idea.

You're not alone in your frustrations, so if you end up deciding to take this somewhere I wish you good luck.
