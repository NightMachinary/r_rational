Oh man, there's a lot of unpack there.

First, how the Hugo's work: there aren't judges. It's awarded based on a popular vote of the people who attend the World Science Fiction Convention that year (and those people who can't come but still support it financially). I have been a Hugo nominator and voter every year since 2012.

As a popular vote, it does give an edge to writers who are popular (whether for writing or for charismatic personality), at least in the nominating round. And, from what I've seen over the years attending WorldCon, the attendees do lean a bit toward the cosmopolitan/liberal side. On the other hand, they also tend to be a bit older (young people have less money for travel), and that helps balance this out a bit. So while, like any populist choice-making system, it has it's flaws and quirks, it was never a political thing.

To that last point, I don't want to go over all the analysis in a comment, but if you'd like I can point you to many blog posts and articles over the last two years. There has never been a shortage of conservative writers/works nominated for Hugo awards, and the winners of the Hugos don't look to be skewed by politics. The only obvious bias is that the Hugos are rather anti-YA, but that is because most WorldCon members just don't read much/any YA.

The Sad Puppies campaign was started when Larry Correia (conservative guy) was nominated for a Hugo and didn't win it. He had a personality clash with an editor who also attends WorldCon, and became convinced it was because this liberal editor was running a secret cabal to deny Hugos to conservative authors. He spent the next two years riling up his fans to get more Hugo nominations for himself and his friends, but it didn't amount to much.

In their third year they finally hit it big by framing this as another battleground in the Culture Wars. The SJWs taking over the Hugos and denying them to deserving Right Wing authors. This was, of course, a great surprise to everyone who'd been attending WorldCon up to this point, you'd think we'd have noticed something like that!

Second major point: There was no "experiment" and no "control group." That isn't even a comprehensible scenario, whoever passed that on to you is either seriously confused or lying through their teeth. There are no organizations that submit a group of works to judges for consideration. Works are not evaluated in "groups", so it would be impossible to have a control and experimental group as described. Furthermore, there are no judges to submit them to! The nomination process is literally every single member of the con getting five blank slots and writing in ANY five works that were written in the previous year! Then the 5 with the most votes are the finalists. That's all. A lot of people write blog posts about what they loved, and people talk with their friends, but there's no committee to consider recommendations. Furthermore, in this scenario you're describing, how the heck would the Sad Puppies have gotten the honor of being the organization to present the recommended groups of works to these judges anyway? Does the story say it was a lottery system and they got lucky or something?

What actually happened was that Correia, Torgerson, and Beale, put a list of works up on their blogs, told all their fans to buy supporting memberships so they could stick it to the SJWs that are screwing up the Hugos (again, the SJWs that don't exist), and to vote in lockstep for the works on their list, regardless of if they liked them or had even read them.

And it worked.

In multiple categories, the entire list of finalists was exactly those works that were on the Puppies list.

Imagine your favorite fan con, whatever that con happens to be. Ask yourself what you would have done if a group of people who publicly proclaim their hate for your convention, and accuse you of being SJWs, negated all the reading and bickering and conversation you and your fellow attendees had, and forced on a bunch of mostly-awful works with the express intent of Sticking It To You? Would you have gone on to give them an award for doing that?

The WorldCon attendees didn't do that. In any category that had non-Puppy works, they voted only among those works (which meant that yes, the quality wasn't as high, as there was less to choose from, /because of the puppies/). In categories that were completley taken over by the Puppies, we voters decided we'd rather vote for No Award. The overwhelming majority of us voted that way.

Partly, this was self-defense from a hostile attack. But it was also very much deserved. You cite a source that says that this was a contest of "better-written non-SJW works" vs "less well-written SJW works". I contest both of these claims. The non-Puppy works were not SJW works, they were simply SF works that people liked. And the Puppy works were, in nearly every case, subpar. Every single category had at least one work that was so poorly written it made my eyes bleed. [[http://www.deathisbadblog.com/2015-hugo-nominated-short-stories-novelettes/][I strongly urge you to read them for yourself]]. The novels weren't as bad, but they were strongly mediocre.

2016 was an interesting year, because Vox Day decided he'd try to Xanatos the WorldCon-goers, and put at least one work in most categories that he knew the average reader would like, because they were already getting a lot of popular buzz. Neal Gaiman is a legend in the industry, as is Neal Stevenson. Both of them were on the Rabid Puppy slate, and both would have been finalists even if Vox Day didn't exist. This way, Vox thought, we would vote them below No Award because they were Puppy-slated works, and he would crow about how he forced us all to put people we love below No Award because we're such rabid SJWs that automatically vote down anything he slated due to our hatred.

That didn't work out well for him. Basically we read all the works, put the obviously bad trolling works below "No Award" on our ballots, and voted for what we would have voted for anyway. /shrug

Also, I think it's kinda hard to claim a better-written experimental group would contain "Space Raptor Butt Invasion" with a straight face :)

In short - there was never a social justice movement within worldcon, the sort of experiment that's described is flatly impossible, and the puppy-works were by and large subpar and so wouldn't have made for a good experiment anyway.
