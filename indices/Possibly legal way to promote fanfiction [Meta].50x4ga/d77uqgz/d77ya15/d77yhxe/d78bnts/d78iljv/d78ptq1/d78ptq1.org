Here's my understanding of how this went down.

In 2013, an author named Larry Correia started the Sad Puppies as a movement to create a Hugo voting bloc to get his own work - more "pulpy" style fiction - nominated for a Hugo. From his [[http://www.webcitation.org/6aRd3TqAI][his own post]], I glean three primary motives:

1. To improve his own resume by getting a Hugo nomination.
2. To point out that Hugos are a popularity contest.
3. To stick "stick it to the man", referring to the traditional crowd of voters that votes on the Hugos.

While he does appear to dislike that Hugo winners, in /his/ opinion, tend to be heavy handed with messages, this does not imply to me that his intent was ever about getting higher quality works to win or running an experiment to test that - it was simply about brute forcing a popularity-based voting system to get himself into the running.

In later years, Correia does appear to have framed the Sad Puppies as being in opposition to an insular group that is not representative of the fandom as a whole, but that appears to be a retroactive justification rather than the initial point behind his movement.

I would also argue that it isn't really an accurate premise; a cursory glance at the winners for the last 10 years on goodreads shows that they all have over 5,000 ratings, indicating a high degree of popularity (or at least visibility) in the fandom as a whole (not just among the "elite" that vote for the Hugos).

(You could make the argument that winning the Hugo is what caused the high # of sales, but that doesn't appear to be the case as far as I can tell; looking at this year's winner and runner up, they both have other books that sold just as well or better than the Hugo nominees.)

This was true even prior to the existence of the Puppies; in fact, some prior winners have even appeared on the puppy slates in the future (such as Neil Gaiman, who won in 2009 for best novel, and was later on the puppy slate for graphic novel in 2016).

The Sad Puppies movement later gave rise to the Rabbid Puppies, a separate movement largely attributed to Vox Day, who appeared to be primarily focused on tearing down the Hugos as an institution. This was, again, not about nominating quality works to beat the existing Hugo candidates - unless you think putting Space Raptor Butt Invasion on the [[https://voxday.blogspot.com/2016/03/rabid-puppies-2016-best-novelette.html][puppy slate]] was about quality.

So, the TLDR version: The Sad Puppies and the Rabid Puppies are separate movements, but neither of them appeared to be founded in order to get better writers to win the Hugos. The Sad Puppies were started by one author who wanted one for himself (by his own admission), and the Rabid Puppies seem much more focused on trolling the voting to irritate people and/or prevent far left writers from winning (regardless of the quality of their works).

The Hugos definitely are a popularity contest, but it doesn't appear to be dominated by any specific politics; the winners, at least in the Best Novel category, do appear to be generally popular with genre fiction readers.

There definitely are people who represent the puppy movements as being about promoting writing quality, but that does not appear to accurately describe the origin of either of the movements or the works that they're actually putting on their slates.
