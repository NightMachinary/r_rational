oh. wow. if that's the case things are even more serious than I thought. So then every time I read or write a fanfiction I am breaking the law? That's...that's /seriously/ messed up. That's such a huge and blatant affront to free speech that it amazes me that civil rights organizations like the ACLU don't seem to have tried to do anything about it. Like seriously WTF? What am I supposed to do then? Is there anything I can do? I'm sick of almost never being able to talk to people in real life about anything that I like or care about because of stupid arbitrary societal/cultural restrictions like this one.
