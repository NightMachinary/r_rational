>Another thing to consider is whether you could include a plan to have the company responsible for the source material approve the fanfics, to avoid grey areas like fanfics 99.9% identical to the source material to avoid copyright or *subjects the company doesn't want people to associate with their story*, since we know that for every HPMOR there's a Cupcakes. It would be a compromise, sure, but it's a foot in the door that would otherwise be slammed and locked.

This seems both unethical and counterproductive. It should not be necessary to get the original author's approval for a work of derivative literature to be promoted when no one is profiting from the intellectual property of the original author. That would be effectively saying that they have the right to decide what works I can and can't recommend to people or talk about in public. It would be like if I wrote a fanfiction and wanted to pay someone else to let me use their venue to do a dramatic stage reading of it, and was told by the original author that I couldn't do that.

If they do take that line then my first amendment rights would be severely violated for the rest of my life since most of my favorite novels are fan fictions.

The problem of course then becomes finding a company that's willing to stick it's neck out for the sake of first amendment rights. Even though no one would actually be profiting from the original author's IP, it's a complex enough scenario that it's possible the original author might think they can get away with pretending that their copyright is being violated.

Does anyone have any idea where I can find such companies willing to stick their necks out for first amendment rights?
