The idea here is to get official, mainstream recognition of the better works of fanfiction, right? And you want that to be achieved by setting up an official framework for fanfictions to be written and spread in, right? If so, the framework you want to make has to not tick off the people we're trying to get to support us. If an author sees this plan and hears that they have no oversight, they might worry that people will use the platform to write incredibly disgusting stories in his world and spread them with a note advertising the original works that brings him the entirely /wrong/ kind of reputation. An author with no control over what stories are accepted in this framework might decide they don't want any part of it.

Would this be a problem with every author? Of course not, but even a handful of vocal detractors could stall or even kill your project, and I'd be willing to bet that from all of the authors who might hear about this plan you'd get a few who hate the idea of a gore-fic being used to advertise their children's story.

This isn't a matter of first amendment rights, also, because we can already write and spread our fanfics as much as we want. We have our platforms for spreading these stories and letting them gain attention by their own merit. Just like not every book has a right to be accepted by publishers, not every fanfic would have a right to be accepted by this framework.

I've already said that this would be a compromise. Ideally, we could just take sites like Fanfiction.net and spread them far and wide, with robust systems for sorting the good fics from the bad, and watch people change public consensus, but we can't afford to have authors deciding to kill the entire platform if someone wants to write gore-fics of their books.

That said, for expediency's sake we wouldn't want active approval of each fic, but the same level of appeasement could be achieved by letting the author object to fanfics that they have found and disapprove of. Rejected fanfics still have our current systems for people who want to read them and supplementary sites might end up being formed to house fics rejected from the framework.
