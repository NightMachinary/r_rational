This already exists, it's called licensed works. Star Wars is perhaps the most well-known example, but there are tons of these, mostly based on TV franchises, role playing games, or video games. Lately I've been some panels at SF lit cons I go to pushing the line "These works are just as worthy of respect as original universes." I've even seen a book critic reading and reviewing some. And they've always been fairly successful, commercially.

There's two big hurdles with these though. The first is that the author doesn't have the dream of a big payday. On the average, you'll probably make a better living writing in licensed work than trying to get noticed writing your own stuff. But you will never make /serious/ money, because the parent company owns all the rights. You may not be asked to write the sequel if it's really successful. The characters and world aren't yours. You'll never get a licensing deal for the TV show, or movies, or toys. Now, 99.99+% of authors will never see that sort of thing anyway, and so it'd be smarter to take the deal and get a decent paycheck, but no one wants to give up the fantasy that their work is THE work that'll change the world.

And that's the other problem. When you write licensed works, you aren't looked at as a creative artist as much. You are now a line-worker, a cog in the entertainment machine. It loses the glamour.

So while I agree that would be nice, I don't think it'll happen. The only way to truly fix this is to overhaul our broken-as-fuck copy-write laws.

That being said, fanfiction has a fair bit of appeal. Sure, you won't hear it talked about in lit circles, but it is widely read. Most traditionally published novels do not sell out their first print run of several thousand. I think of fanfic like romance novels. Extremely popular - the most-read genre by a WIDE margin, romance novels are where the money is. But no one ever talks about them, for various reasons.

Lit in general is a niche interest tho. Even books that do very well don't necessarily mean anyone will get your references. Game of Thrones is, what, 20+ years old now? And until the HBO series started, almost no one would get a GoT reference, despite it being a successful book/series. In today's world, you need TV or Movie presence to be well-known. And that just can't happen with unlicensed fanfic.
