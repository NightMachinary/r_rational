Ah! I misunderstood you at first, I didn't realize the advertising would be for an unrelated third-party product.

Legally speaking, I'm pretty sure this would not fly. Someone is making a profit from work produced in the original IP, even if it's via advertising an unrelated third-party. Sometimes people ask me why I haven't set up a Patreon or something for the HPMOR podcast, and my answer is partly legality. While I realize people do this sort of thing a lot, they only get away with it because the IP-holder doesn't consider them worth the money to sue.

But I also don't think it would achieve your goals. The stigma against fanfic isn't because the authors aren't paid, and that's not why author's shy away from it. Licensed-works authors get paid fairly well, and yet there's still stigma against writing it.

Fortunately, this is changing. There are a lot of established authors who write fanfic, and some of them are even beginning to admit it in public. :) Naomi Novik, who is a best-selling author, and just won the Nebula award for [[http://www.deathisbadblog.com/sff-review-uprooted/][Uprooted]], is a strong proponent of fanfic, is on the board of the [[http://www.transformativeworks.org/][Organization of Transformational Works]], and is a co-founder of AO3. I just saw Alyssa Wong at a WorldCon panel speaking about how great fanfic is, and her own experiences writing it. There's no shortage of established authors who write or enjoy fanfic, you just have to get them to come out about it. That's slowly happening. :)
