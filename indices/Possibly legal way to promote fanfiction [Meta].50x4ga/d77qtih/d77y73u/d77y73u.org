First, it is not the same thing. I'm not talking about a fan work being licensed by the original author/publisher. I'm talking about having a fan author agree with ANOTHER company to have at least one product recommendation or advertisement in an author's note in their work, so that the company is willing to help them promote it, while at the same time they would be only profiting from their ad and not from the intellectual property. Also, "fan fiction" is not a genre any more than "original fiction" is. There are probably a wider variety of well-written fan fic masterpieces than original romance novels of the same caliber, simply because fan fiction is not a single genre. It would be like if someone quasi-banned "original" fiction in the same way. "Original fiction" is not a genre like romance is, and if they did to "original" fiction what they were doing to derivative works there would be mass protest. What I'm proposing is a way to get rational fiction to be more widely available and known to the general public. The majority of rational fictions are fan fictions and therefore doomed to linger in obscurity forever. What I'm proposing is a way to potentially fix that problem without actually breaking any laws.
