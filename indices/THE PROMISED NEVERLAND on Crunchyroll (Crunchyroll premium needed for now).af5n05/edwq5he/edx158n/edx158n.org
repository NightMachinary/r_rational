If you didn't enjoy the opening of the manga, you probably won't enjoy the rest of it.

There's a few interesting plans and twists as you go along, but in some parts it starts to show its age and get sloppy to the point of disrupting my suspension of disbelief. Ultimately it's a shounen manga and eventually it does fall into some of the trappings of the genre.

I still enjoy it though since I'm invested in seeing where things go.

edit: I expect the first season of the anime to cover the parts before it somewhat started to derail (IMO). So it's worth giving a shot if you don't mind potentially being disappointed after this.
