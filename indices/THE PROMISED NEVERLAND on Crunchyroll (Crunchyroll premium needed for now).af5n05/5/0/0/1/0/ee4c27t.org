I guess it depends on what you're referring to and when. Standard length used to be over 20 episodes but the new seasonal format (I assume more profitable) is about 13. That said it hasn't stopped a plethora of anime coming back with a second season in the future.

I'd be interested in knowing what exactly Mob Psycho 100 is boosting when the source material concluded more than a year ago. If there's no obvious answer then I don't see why you couldn't argue that some anime are definitely made to piggyback off the success of the source material. Nor should conclusion of said source material exempt it from further sales in the future, should an anime do well.

EDIT: Never mind that the source is still actively published for PN.
