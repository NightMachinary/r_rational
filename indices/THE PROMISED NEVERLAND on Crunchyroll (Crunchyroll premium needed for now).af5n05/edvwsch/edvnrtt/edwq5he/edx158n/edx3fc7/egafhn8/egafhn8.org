Well this story isn't rational really, not going to spoil but the first episode of the anime until *That Part* would lead viewers who aren't versed in the manga into thinking the story is something else that it isn't. a few people I know we're disappointed, and when I told them what the story was about (they were already resolved not to watch more of it) They agreed that it wasn't worth watching. . .now, from a context standpoint. . .as in the "most anime nowadays are trash" context, in comparison this show is a lot better that what's been on offer in a while. so , YMMV, but I'm not going to pretend that this is going to be some masterpiece of storytelling (it REALLY isn't)
