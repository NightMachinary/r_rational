Even popular shows don't always get adapted fully. I'm still waiting for the third season of Spice and Wolf, and the show and Light Novel (series has finished) were both quite popular. Unfortunately often light novel/manga companies/authors often see anime adaptations as just being a way to drive more sales of the light novel or manga so it doesn't necessarily matter to them that all of it gets adapted.
