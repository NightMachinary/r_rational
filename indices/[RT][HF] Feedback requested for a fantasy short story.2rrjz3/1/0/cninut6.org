Thank you for your response.

Is that sense of clich√© from the lack of a synopsis here, the synopsis posted for the short story on the sites, or the story itself?

I can revise my description or post a hook of some sort here if you think it will help, and I'm open to suggestion if you feel there are overused tropes you'd like to call out. I can't, however, do much to change the basic premise of the story.
