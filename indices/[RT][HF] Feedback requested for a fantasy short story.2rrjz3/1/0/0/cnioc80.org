I don't know what this borrowed world is, and there are plenty of people who would find all this comforting, but basically all this stuff just kind of sounds like every other fantasy book, so if you want to appeal to anyone looking for something more than every other fantasy book you need something early on to indicate that it is something more than every other fantasy book. Indicate it with your tone or subvert a trope or do something to make it all your own rather than something that feels very borrowed.
