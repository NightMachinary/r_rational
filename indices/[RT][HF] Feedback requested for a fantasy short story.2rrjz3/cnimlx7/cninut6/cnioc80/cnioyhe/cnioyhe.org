Thanks for elaborating, I'm grateful for the feedback. As I am writing in someone else's IP, it's difficult to address the existing character and location names, pantheon, or genre, so it seems that this story might not be up your alley.

I'd definitely appreciate your opinion on my own solo IP when I have something to show for that project, as I think it contains unique spins on old concepts that might appeal to you more.

Thanks for your time!
