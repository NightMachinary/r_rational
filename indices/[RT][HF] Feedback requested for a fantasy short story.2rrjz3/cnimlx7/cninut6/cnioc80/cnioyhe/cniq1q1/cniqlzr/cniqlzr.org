This is written in the Shades of Venaya setting, which is owned by [[https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/2015/01/01/new-years-book-update/][Andrew Rowe]]. I'm one of three writers, including Andrew, working on novels within this setting.

As a result, I am primarily interested in feedback geared toward characterization, storytelling style, problem solving, plotholes, logic breakdowns, and mechanics fumbling, as these are the elements that I have the greatest control over.
