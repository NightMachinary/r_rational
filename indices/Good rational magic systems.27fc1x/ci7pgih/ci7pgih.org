For my money nothing beats the Inheritance Cycle, where magic is done by simply describing (in Elvish) what you want to accomplish. There's no limit on the diversity of what can be done, and the limit on the power is that the /energy/ (as defined in physics: force X distance) required to produce the desired effect by pushing matter around is drained from the caster in the form of physically fatiguing them. You could literally teach a brand-new student everything there is to know about how magic /works/ - including the top-secret stuff that only the elders /of the dragon riders/ are supposed to know - in an afternoon; everything else (read: years) is just practice and learning a long list of practical applications.
