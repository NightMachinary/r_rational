I've always been a fan of the way the Young Wizards series did their magic. Magic in that system is a sort of a universal language (in that every part of the universe can speak and understand it, be that part living or nonliving). Magic has a cost, set limits, and is composed from smaller discrete elements. To cast a "spell", so to speak, you compose a sentence requesting or ordering the elements of the universe to do whatever it is you want it to do.

There was another story on here a while ago that dealt with a number of magic systems that worked in different ways, but all of them were well explained, with the chief plot point being a woman from a world with one magic system was put into a world with a different magic system and had to figure both of them out.

But the best one I can recommend for what you're asking is [[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]], which has a magic system that is so well defined, structured, reproducible, and sensible that it has its own programming language and branch of physics, with associated academia. The story gets pretty wild, and especially in the later chapters I would call it more Hard Sci-fi than Fantasy, due to the way magic is treated, but it's well written, fairly long, nearly completed, and regularly updated.
