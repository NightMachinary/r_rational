It has a kind of consistency to it but is still incredibly vague about what you can actually do. Also my impression was that it was more of a universal karma thing rather than specific spirits 'watching' your actions. Can you cite a source for that?

Pretty great story anyway, would recommend to others. Very tense and there's always shit going down.
