To be clearer, I mostly meant that it's vague to the reader - we don't yet have enough information to be able to say "Blake has x items in his inventory and y knowledge, in z situation he could do a,b, and c to d,e, and f effects."

It does still seem a bit vague in-universe to me as well though. More like a system formed of guidelines than one formed of rules. For comparison, in Worm I felt I had a much clearer mental image of how events could play out. Characters have known abilities with known effects, and any combination you can imagine would produce the effect which you imagine.
