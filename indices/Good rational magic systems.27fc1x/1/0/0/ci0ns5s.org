  Also my impression was that it was more of a universal karma thing rather than specific spirits 'watching' your actions. Can you cite a source for that?

That (at least some of) the magic is enacted by the watching spirits is pretty much directly said in [[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2014/01/04/bonds-1-5/][Bonds 1.5]] : "Here, I make a meager food offering, create a sign to indicate what I want, and draw from the reputation I maintain with local community spirits. A bonus of my position. The spirits play along, because they know it keeps people safer and helps to keep the community safe, and because they know I'll make a better offering later, a habit I've established."

And that they manage//are/ the karma system is suggested by the way they pause to address them in [[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/damages-2-6/][Damages 2.6]] "Those who are witnessing us, beings of law, justice, and right, help guide this to the right hands.‚Äù (and some surrounding text, justifying their actions as in accordance with the spirit/letter of the law).

I think there are other references, but those are the ones I remember well enough to find.
