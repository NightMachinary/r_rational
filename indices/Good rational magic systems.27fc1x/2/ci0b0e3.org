For purposes of fiction, the lawfulness of magic is simply the degree to which the reader can predict in advance what magic can and can't do. Saying that something is based around "nanotechnology" makes no difference to this, unless you reprise enough physics that readers know what molecular machinery can and can't do. Saying that it involved "calculus" would have the same problem, unless you reprised a lot of Thinking Physics and then stuck to it.
