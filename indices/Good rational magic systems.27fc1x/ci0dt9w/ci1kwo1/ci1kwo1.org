Just to point out, despite bearing his names, Sanderson has admitted that he doesn't always do a great job of following his own rules. Anyone who read the Mistborn trilogy knows that as incredibly well done as its magic system is, from a storytelling perspective Sanderson still relies on a (kind of literal) Deus ex Machina to resolve the plot.
