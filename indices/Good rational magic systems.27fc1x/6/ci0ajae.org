I've posted two to reddit, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/16elxu/help_break_my_magic_system/][here's one]] and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/186l1y/a_crud_magic_system_v2/][here's the other]]. Both have partially completed stories around them that I'm working on creating. Oh, and the three for the [[/r/worldbuilding]] Saturday Spotlight [[http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1wqv2z/saturday_spotlight_alexanderwaless_kingdom_of/][Kingdom of Donkerk]] which range from hard to soft. And I have others that I don't have writeups for at all, but that are part of some world/story that I've been working on. It's probably not a surprise that as a member of this subreddit I tend towards "hard" magic.
