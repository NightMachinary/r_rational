/Name of the Wind/ has (I believe) about seven or eight magic systems which run the gamut between "hard" and "soft", and thankfully Rothfuss is a thoughtful enough author that he knows how to make that distinction work between all of them. (Sympathy, Sygaldry, Alchemy, Naming, Fae Magic ... and there must be others that I'm forgetting which are even less well-defined, but those five are in hard-to-soft ordering.)
