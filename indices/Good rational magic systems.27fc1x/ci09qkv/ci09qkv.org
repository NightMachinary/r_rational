Name of the Wind was good for this - the most common magic was "sympathy", involving binding things that share some commonality, then (shocker) actually needing to supply enough energy through that linkage to make the magic happen. Either from a convenient heat source or out of the mage's own body heat, and with greater similarity providing a /more efficient/ link.

Plays hell with entropy, but it at least respects conservation of energy.

Less so the other forms of magic in that universe - sygaldry lets you put magic into objects just by engraving them with the right symbols (although possibly still conserves energy - the master of the art talks about having been pursuing an 'ever-burning lamp' for a long time without success), and naming seems to be able to call on arbitrary elemental effects just by speaking their secret names, although that wasn't strictly under conscious control.

I feel like it hit a good spot between being well-defined enough to prevent it being a "Win everything by authorial fiat" device, while still leaving in a bit of mystery.
