I am an aspiring Fantasy writer, and one of the things I hope I have accomplished is to make a magic system that is clear and makes sense. The hope is that by the time readers finish the first book (which is ~90% written) they will understand the magic system well enough that they are able to combine information gleamed from both PoV characters and draw conclusions the character do not draw themselves. Conclusions like "Hang on, this couldn't actually have happened, that guy is lying his /ass/ off!"

That said, while I intend to make most of my planned series Rationalist-ish, the first book only has rationalists in the shadow, and the main characters certainly do not qualify yet. So most of the first book probably doesn't belong here. /My villains are super awesome, though./
