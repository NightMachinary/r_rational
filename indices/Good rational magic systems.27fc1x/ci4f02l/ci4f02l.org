Spellwright series, Blake Carlton. I haven't completely vetted it for rationality, but I absolutely love the "magic as text made physical" thing and all the wonderful wordplay involved. The author is also tremendously creative. The different languages of magic each have their different uses and limitations, a compelling and broad structure that Carlton successfully writes within.
