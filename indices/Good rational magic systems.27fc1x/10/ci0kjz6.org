Pretty much everything by Sanderson (you already mentioned Mistborn) at least has consistent rules. In some cases (The Stormlight Archives, for example), we don't know the rules yet, but they're there, and we'll probably learn quite a lot about them before the series is over.

Sanderson's laws of magic have already been mentioned. And The Name of the Wind.
