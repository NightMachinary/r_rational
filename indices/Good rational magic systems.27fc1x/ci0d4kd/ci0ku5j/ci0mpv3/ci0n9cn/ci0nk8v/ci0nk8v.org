It does mention (when they are preparing to face off with the history-stealing demon) that it could be more like art. Your statement sounds a lot like how Rose would want to view magic.

From Blake's interpretation, I see it more like putting on a play. You say your lines, and the audience reacts. With famous plays, and good actors, you can predict how the audience will feel. But with a newer play or a newer actor, the audience might go wild in approval, or sit there completely bored.

There are some 'rules' (still in the play analogy), like speak loudly, enunciate, big hand motions, etc. But when doing something you haven't done before, it's not easy to predict what the reaction will be.
