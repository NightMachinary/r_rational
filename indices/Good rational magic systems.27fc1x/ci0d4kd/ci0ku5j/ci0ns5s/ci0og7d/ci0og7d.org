Thanks, these are good references.. But! I don't think they actually demonstrate that the spirits ARE the karma system, just that they too observe it and work within it. To me these quotes don't differentiate between those two possibilities.

I tried to find some info on what is said in the awakening ritual but couldn't with a quick scan. However, in 6.2 Blake says ".. You're... I dunno, making yourself known, on a fundamental level. The ideas are more important than the words. It worked, so it probably wasn't wrong.‚Äù

I think ideas being more important than the words is probably correct, the ritual being almost one of self-affirmation rather than one of describing oneself aloud to something which is listening. In my view it's a personal, internal commitment, not an interview.
