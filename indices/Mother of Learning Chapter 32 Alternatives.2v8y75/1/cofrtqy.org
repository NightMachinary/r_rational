This seems like as good a place as any to voice a guess I came up with about the Aranea: the way Red Robe killed them was to shunt their souls outside the time loop. They aren't dead permanently, just unable to loop (and thus their souls never make it to their bodies at the start). Of course, that's maybe a little too optimistic.

Zorian may have his reasoning backwards. If Red Robe has the marker and Zach doesn't, how did the Zorian/Zach soul entanglement result in Zorian getting the marker? If Zach has it and Red Robe doesn't, how does Red Robe loop?
