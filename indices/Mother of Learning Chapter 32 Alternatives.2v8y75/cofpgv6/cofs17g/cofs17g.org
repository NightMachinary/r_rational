Zach is almost certainly detectable by the spell, so the Southern presence is him. The other possible, but highly improbable, case is that he's out of range and Red Robe is showing up instead. If Zach was dead - as in, non-looping - I would expect that to have a noticeable impact on the magic in Zorian's soul.

Red Robe might be

- Out of range
- Under anti-scrying spells
- Missing the same marker, and looping by unknown means

Note that the third option would also match up well with the strange effect on the Areana - RR can clearly send /some/ soul effects back in time...
