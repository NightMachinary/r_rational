They are in a time loop. Once you accept that there is one way to time travel, the probability for other types of time travel becomes more likely. Therefore, there is a chance that after Zach finally gets out of the time loop, he goes back in time by a few years and sets the whole thing up to either maintain a Stable Time Loop, or to complete some yet unknown plan. He'll act in character every time he meets his younger self (even if he isn't in the time loop, he can watch Zach to know how to react and something will signal the final loop) to keep the doubly-looped timeline on track. However, having a repeating time loop inside one large time loop is way too complicated to be true though.
