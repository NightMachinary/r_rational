I was rereading the story.

Suddenly makes sense. The red robed individual has some sort of dimensional magic that lets him enter or leave the time thing at will and probably can do the same to the souls of the spiders hence the Aranea had to assault him as soon as possible before his grand scheme was enacted.

My overall guess at the entire message.

  If you are listening to this it mean things went awry. I know you think I had it coming by rushing into this but the reason I did so was simple: the time loop is degrading. I can't tell how long it will be before it breaks down. Red Robe can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was a high priority in success. I should have told you more but there can only ever be one winner in this game. I am truly sorry. If I fail to stop the grand evil plan I hope it won't be necessary, but just in case I put in a map to the secret macguffin that can solve this problem hidden in Cyoria's underworld. As to who is powering it there is a whole other continent filled with spirits/ mages/ magical creatures. I didn't think it was possible, even with the help of a super powered spirit/ group of mages but this angry continent is planning the whole thing. You must stop them.
