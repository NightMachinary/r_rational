Hmm. I was thinking "how would that happen", but all he'd need was

1. Breathtaking competency and power before the loop.

2. One lucky encounter with Zach, where RR can implant a compulsion to find him immediately on loop start.

3. Ability to take advantage of this in each loop from zero, just by reading Zach's mind.

All of this is plausible, and also makes him surprisingly vulnerable - RR would only loop if Zach "awoke" him, so deal with that compulsion and it's over. He's more like a landmine triggered by Manchurian agent than an antagonist.. And only gets better plans from looping, not strength and control of magic.
