Class war does not destroy society. If you want to destroy society, target transportation and communication technologies. Internet backbones and distributors, airlines and aircraft factories, ships and shipworks, fuel supplies, power plants, and roads.

The governments, police, and militaries are your biggest obstacle, because if your terrorist group is any good, your operating areas will be placed under martial law. Guerrilla tactics are necessary.

Even after destroying a lot of infrastructure, it will be very hard to cut off long-range communication and transportation over large territories. At some point satellites would need to be destroyed, through hacking, annexing their ground controls, and launching sabotage payloads.

This would be difficult to accomplish with only tens of millions USD, so you'll need a good source of income. It is hard to maintain a good source of income when you are trying to destroy the things that make that money valuable.
