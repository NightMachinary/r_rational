The fighters you have access to will fight if and only if you are fighting to overthrow the upper class due to the precise circumstances involved in recruiting them.

The AI is contained within an upgraded laptop. It communicates with the world via voice to text and a webcam installed within the laptop, through which it can also acquire sensory data.
