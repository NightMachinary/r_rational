Right. I think that's something people need to consider more; Rational does not mean Muggle. Hogwarts was not made completely irrelevant to the setting just because science and medicine and nuclear bombs exist. A rationalfic has to retain the essence of what it's talking about, not just completely deny it and focus entirely on 'real life'; if people wanted that, they'd just read some war correspondence or whatever.

And Hope's Peak is really like Hogwarts, in a lot of ways. They're not secret from the world, but because everyone knows it exists and want to attend, their effect on the world is sort of like brain drain turned up to eleven. It's easy to see why some people might think of that as a poor state of affairs.
