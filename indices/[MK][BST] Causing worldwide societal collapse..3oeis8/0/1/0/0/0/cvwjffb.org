Please see the above edit for organization.

One school is not enough to provide soldiers for a global destabilization operation. This is your biggest problem.

Ground zero is Japan, but later on when considering growth, you would want to approach governments and other organizations like the US, Russia, and China to act as though you are a group fighting against each of their sociopolitical opponents. This means you would need to give the appearance of several different organizations when you expand onto the world stage, not entirely a problem when you have a cell structure. The effect your organization in America has on their infrastructure will likely influence America's willingness to fund your operations in China and Russia, and vice versa. In the beginning, you would have to kickstart this strategy with many false-flag operations. This only addresses money, though it may also aid in your recruitment strategy since each separate operation has its own well of proponents to draw from and their presence will encourage recruitment for 'opposing' operations. This one high school would be only one spoke of a vast wheel.
