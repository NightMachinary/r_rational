...How do first-worlders care about overthrowing the upper class? They /are/ the upper class. Destroying global society does not strike me as something that first-worlders would really go for, since that is precisely what they benefit from. You would have to mask your intentions. This would be a problem for members savvy in tactics, strategy, and socioeconomics (the kind of people you would promote to higher-level leadership) who may actually understand the effects of your group's actions.

1000 people is not a lot for a guerrilla force. What are the precise circumstances of their recruitment? Your immediate goal is to recruit more. For organization, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clandestine_cell_system][covert cell structure]] is your best bet. I am unsure how to approach recruiting and training; that seems the most vulnerable element of the operation. I haven't researched or thought for five minutes about it yet, though.

I think I may be on a few more lists now.
