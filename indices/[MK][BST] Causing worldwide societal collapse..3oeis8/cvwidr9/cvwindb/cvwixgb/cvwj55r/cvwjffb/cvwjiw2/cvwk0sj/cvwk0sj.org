I think that before you start trying to figure out the future, you should re-establish the present.

For starters, I'm pretty sure that Hope's Peak Academy isn't just... a really rich school. Given the sort of toys they were working with, I figure they're part school and part superadvanced-thinktank and part research-lab and part government-agency-for-engineering-the-new-generation-of-ubermensch.

Basically, they're like the trope of a super-powerful student council, taken on a higher level where the world is the school and Hope's Peak is the student council.

So- write the governments as completely ineffectual, or reduced to little more than a massive system of bureaucracy that doesn't really do anything but plug potholes and push papers. All the REAL power is at Hope's Peak; it's every branch of legislation and every single scientific research facility combined into one, a massive single point of weakness. (I mean, come on, they've even got ULTIMATE SOLDIERS as students there? They're KNOWN as ultimate soldiers and their best place to go is Hope's Peak? Come on, that's not just a school anymore, that's a Xanadu of its own, a Zeroth World in isolation from the lesser numerically-organized worlds of the outside. They probably have their own entire culture and society inside there.)

Convince the reader that once you push Hope's Peak over, nothing and nobody else can POSSIBLY recover from the staggering damage. There aren't any players on the gameboard EXCEPT for Hope's Peak and Ultra Despair. That solves a lot of your problems.

Edit:

"If you want to destroy society, target transportation and communication technologies. Internet backbones and distributors, airlines and aircraft factories, ships and shipworks, fuel supplies, power plants, and roads."

Make it so that Hope's Peak is DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE for all of this. Somehow.

They have ALL the factories with ALL the new tech such that all of the old tech is completely uncompetitive. They have a monopoly on transportation and communication. They have a monopoly on advanced computer technology including internet, full-brain-uploading into simulation worlds, and AI. They have a monopoly on airlines and aircraft, because their airlines and aircraft are way more advanced. They are the institution that outputs soldiers far more effective than any other ever seen in the world, ever.

They do EVERYTHING better. They've got a complete monopoly on Every Single Important Thing, and the only reason why they haven't taken over the world is because they've also got a monopoly on, presumably, Ultimate Ethicists and Ultimate Philosophers.
