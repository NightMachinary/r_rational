  If it's that fragile, then why don't we have massive food shortages every time that a major highway needs repairing?

Because we have lots of inter-connected systems of transit, and highway repairs don't take very long. If you're living in, say, the rural mountain areas in Colorado, though? You /do/ get massive food shortages every time the only highway that you can be accessed by is shut down, unless it's repaired real fast.
