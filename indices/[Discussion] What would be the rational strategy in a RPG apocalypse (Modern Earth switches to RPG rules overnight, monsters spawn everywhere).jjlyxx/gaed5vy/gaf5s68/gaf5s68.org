  We, and by we I mean the vast teeming masses of humanity in our billions, rely upon a Just-In-Time delivery system of food and supplies in order to live.

Well, there's at least three assumptions in this that may not be true:

1. Previous physics and our logistical support networks all break down. We're not necessarily all dropped into medieval hamlets being ravaged by dragon gods, though at least /some/ disruption of society is implied by the presence of monsters.
2. Said monsters don't have drops, like food and water. Adventuring might be how people stay fed now. There might be foraging skills and classes that provide limitless food from thin air. Random chests might contain 1000 year old tomb apples & cheese.\\
3. People still have normal biological needs instead of only needing food & rest for regaining HP lost in combat. You might be able to get by fine for eternity greeting adventures at the town entrance and telling them how much you like pickles as an eccentric NPC with only one line of dialogue.

Heck, even if we /specifically/ use 5e D&D rules, any first level character with Goodberry can feed ten people every day with a single spell slot. Create Food & Water is a 3rd level spell that creates abundant food & water for 15 people for a day, without rationing.

That doesn't even count that Survival skills can produce 1d6+Wis /pounds/ of food and gallons of water on a successful check, every day while traveling. Under those rules (which are inconsistent with the previous spell), all a 5e character needs is 1 lbs of food and 1 gallon of water each day to survive. Completely untrained, average people have a 50-50 shot of finding enough food for several days, and the main effects of not being able to eat in D&D is exhaustion, and it takes six levels of that to kill you.

If we go with an MMO or other video game system, the odds are good that you can expect food to just be an HP recovery system, because almost no one enjoys actual starvation mechanics.
