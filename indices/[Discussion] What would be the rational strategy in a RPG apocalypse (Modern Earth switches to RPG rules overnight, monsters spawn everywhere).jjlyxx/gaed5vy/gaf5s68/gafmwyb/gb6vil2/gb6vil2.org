I know I'm almost a week late to comment, but even if we start at level zero it takes only a couple of level appropriate encounters to level up. Level appropriate encounters like shotgunning other level zeroes in the face as they try to take food from your family. So many will die, but we would definitely stabilize before extinction, barring someone launching a bunch of nukes.
