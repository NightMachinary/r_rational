We're all starting at 0th level, though. No Goodberry for us! Though I guess whoever first hits 1st level can become Literally Immortan Joe, that would be pretty funny. (By the time enough people hit level 5 to cast Create Food & Water, 7 billion people are dead.)

Anyway, I'll grant that there are plenty of waves to handwave the system handing us a post-scarcity society for the basics of living. I don't know why I got so pissed off and ranty. Probably because everyone is so blithe about what would almost certainly be apocalyptic, but I dunno, I shouldn't be so pissy about peoples' escapism, absent gods know I could use some escapism myself nowadays.
