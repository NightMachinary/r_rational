The answer is that pretty much everyone dies.

The answer is almost always that pretty much everyone dies, in these kinds of scenario.

We, and by we I mean the vast teeming masses of humanity in our billions, rely upon a Just-In-Time delivery system of food and supplies in order to live. Every city, every town in the world does. You have to go down to the level of villages and rural census tracts to get anywhere in the vague vicinity of self-sufficiency, and even then the self-sufficiency is predicated (in the first world, certainly; and often even in developing nations) on access to parts and tools which aren't produced locally.

We all starve to death. The electrical infrastructure can't handle a blackstart. The transportation infrastructure has absolutely no slack in it. All of our clever tricks and systems which were designed to allow very precise carvings away of every bit of resiliency and buffer in the name of quarterly profits wind up becoming our undoing, and we die.

You say that Elizabeth II can pick Queen? Who gives a shit! Britain imports /EIGHTY PERCENT/ of its food. Much of the food it grows relies on imported tools. Elizabeth II will be a carrion queen for long enough for the destabilization and turmoil to set in, and then she will die, along with most of Britain and probably seven billion people along with them.

What's the rational strategy? Take your family and head to a Costco store, where the people who beat you there will shoot you on sight, because their only chance of living long enough for the situation to stabilize is to turn a day's worth of groceries for a thousand people into a year's worth of groceries for a family.

What's the rational strategy? Steal a boat, head to the water, and get killed by monsters while trying to get fish out of an ocean that we have near-completely denuded.

What's the rational strategy? Disappear into the forest, only to find that sustainable forest living is impossible without a long list of skills that you don't have or a support network that doesn't exist anymore.

There is no rational strategy. You just fucking die.
