Depending on the experience system you might get a situation where 4-6 person parties give the best risk/reward. You might for example have a world where experience is split between all participants on the winning side of a conflict, in which case you'd want to find a sweet spot where you are working with the smallest effective group for a given task.

You might also have a system where monsters specifically feed on Exp. and so seek out adventurers of roughly comparable strength. In this case you'd want to keep your party small for fear that if a large band of adventurers is defeated you now have a serious threat on your hands and no one left to deal with it.
