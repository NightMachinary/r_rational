It depends on how much infrastructure works.

If we still have viable internet, get the Wikipedia pages for The System up and populated. People need build and monster information. Also, crowd source maps.

Construction equipment is good for both terrain and as something to hit big and slow things in. Depending on leveling, stick medical behind the wheel as it is important to power level healers.

Get ranged casters/snipers/archers into buildings and try to lure monsters there. Take advantage of the fortification of what is already built. Even roofs of houses.
