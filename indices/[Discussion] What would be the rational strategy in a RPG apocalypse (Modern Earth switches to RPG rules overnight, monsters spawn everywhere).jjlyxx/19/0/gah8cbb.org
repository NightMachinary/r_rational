There's a priority to these things which seems to be consistent across DnD-derived games that feature permadeath. Things usually happen like this as you progress:

1. first, improve your ability to kill things and rely on environment, tactics, strategy, knowledge, consumables/equipment, and patience to kill things without dying. Your source of progression is killing things, so if you can't do that, it doesn't matter how "survivable" you are, you'll eventually die. A dead threat isn't a threat.

Conceptually, when you have nothing from progression, the impact that other resources have is relatively large. Later you simply won't have the damage output to appreciably hurt things, and strategy, tactics, etc often have known optimal solutions. The only way of improving from that is improving the resources you have available: levels, items, etc.

- For example, acquiring modern weapons (if they still work) on top of any system-derived stuff. You'd naturally try to get as many useful items & resources as you could before fighting/putting yourself at risk.

2. Once you can reliably kill things, improve worst-case survivability. This means improving max EHP (assuming you're sensible and go into any fight in peak condition), ways to escape from situations where you're uncertain whether you'll win - you never want to be in a "win or die" fight - and to prevent "special" attacks that are outside the norm and high danger. (Examples might be poison (status effects), putting you in locations/situations you don't want to be like melee with a monster, removing your ability to act (CC), and so on). Average case doesn't really matter because it only matters if your HP hits 0 or not, provided you're not being permanently weakened every encounter.

3. Once the risk of dying from a direct encounter is sufficiently low, then you can think about things that might cause problems in the future. This can be resource-efficiency (including item, time, and EXP), preparing for more than one thing to go wrong at the same time, things which you may be relying on now but may not be available later, and so on.

Basically, killing things instantly or before they get a chance to act is ideal, then ensuring you have a definite out if the situation goes bad (regardless of the actual size of the risk; improbable things happen), then maximising the amount of shit going wrong it will take for you to lose. Though if you start finding yourself in the third situation, it's time to stop fighting because your days are numbered.

Typically you have to constantly evaluate what your priority should be at any given moment; you have to judge when your ability to kill things is "good enough" to know when to switch to max survivability, and the inverse. (To be clear, you cannot reason "my survivability is good enough, I can focus on something else;" you can only switch if it is no longer the case that your ability to kill things is "good enough" or if not preparing for future problems now will cause issues.) Not enough resource/time/EXP-efficiency usually isn't an immediate issue but can cause severe problems in the future, so can also overcome the other two considerations in priority. Standard strategic stuff of course applies like achieving multiple objectives with the same action, putting yourself in situations where every outcome is favourable or acceptable where possible, etc.

Doing this will not put you at the top of the progression ladder, but those who are at the top will be there by luck, and you'll be alive rather than dead.

So I guess in a long-winded way I'm agreeing with you, it's just that it's more complicated than "spec into vitality" :)
