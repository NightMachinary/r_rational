  It's a far safer job to stay home making magic items than it is to go and joust with a beholder.

True, but on the other hand, the rewards would be /massively/ higher, and the moral complications to wrestle with much less. A few years of dungeon diving could make you rich beyond your wildest dreams and powerful as a demigod. In the real world, deploying for a few years mostly will get you PTSD, possibly some long term invalidity, and a lifetime of wrangling with stupid bureaucracy to get your veteran benefits.
