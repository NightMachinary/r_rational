I'm not a particularly notable individual, so my main goal would be to survive over adventuring or the like. To that end, I'd think that the average person would want to aim for what's effectively a production class, or a support one. It's a far safer job to stay home making magic items than it is to go and joust with a beholder.

As a group, I think you'd want to establish community interactions very quickly to gain group access to niche abilities. You can change the dynamic of a community very quickly by trying to push magic users to high levels quickly, granting access to things like creating food and water or resurrection.

If we're working off /very/ D&D rules, I'd think that a good goal would be to train up a large variety of magic users and a large variety of artificers, hence allowing you to mass-produce magic items and enact the RPG-apocalypse version of the dawning of firearms. Producing magic items en-masse would increase survivability among the low-levelled, young, or weak to a massive degree.
