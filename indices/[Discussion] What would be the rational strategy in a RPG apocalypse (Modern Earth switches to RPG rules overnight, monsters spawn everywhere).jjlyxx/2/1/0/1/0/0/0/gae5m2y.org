Only if Cleansers are somewhat rare. Like, if only 1% of the population is awakened then you'd need to do something like this, cleansers would be like public health resources. If the majority of people are awakened then huge numbers of people would have cleanse, the fraction of people with cleanse would be at least similar to the fraction of our current society that are maids/janitors/garbage men/plumbers. In a world like that cleanse auras would be so ubiquitous that basically all diseases would be eradicated.
