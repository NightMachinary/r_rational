i get where you are coming from but that assumes a willingness to engage in conflict. the core premise of most of these games assumes a continued drive to conquer or grow with a distinct focus on always going after the next guest line.\\
however we are assuming that while the universe now runs on rpg logic its still fundamentally the same world we currently live in, so while its true that in direct conflict a low level druid or the like is at a disadvantage but even at level 1 most nature classes are second to only a rogue or assassin in terms of being hard to find if they dont want to be found with the addition of class abilities that make living off the land nearly trivial. as long as my number one goal is the avoidance of people as a whole, i dont think there is a more effective long term strategy

(point of order i am mostly going off dnd 3.5 and pathfinder as my rule sets for this)
