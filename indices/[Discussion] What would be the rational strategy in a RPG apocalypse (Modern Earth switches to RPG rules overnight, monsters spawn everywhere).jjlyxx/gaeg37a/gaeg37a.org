RPGs are, every single one of them, exploitable. Expect significant short term effort to go into analyzing the system's meta and designing builds accordingly. Note that even D&D has an enormous versatility of character capabilities, depending on edition and campaign setting.

The system's objectivity matters hugely here. Some are largely objective, rewarding its "players" for specific actions. Some are adaptive, snarky, or downright malign. Expect a lot of analysis to go into determining the motivation and goals of the system.

Governments will act to secure themselves and their member citizens. Physical security from monsters, as well as protecting territory and resources from external governments, thieves, or insurrections will be a large priority.

These governments - even the more open and liberal ones - will likely take a reactionary bent. The new status quo is an existential crisis to old world governments. Unless there are substantial and clear benefits to our world's power structures, they will seek to shut down the RPG system and return the world to normal.
