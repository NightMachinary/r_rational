Assuming D&D 5E, I think even a 20th level wizard might have problems, primarily due to action economy and combat range. Even we assume this is "real life", the wizard can only cast one-ish spell every six seconds and few spells operate at soldier ranges with most ranging 30, 60, or 120 feet while the soldiers might engage at a couple thousand feet. The soldiers, having read the phb, also know the area effects of spells so they'll practice proper spacing and effectively no-sell high-level AOE spells.

The best wizard strategy would be to go rogue and spam invisibility to approach and then pick off/subborn soldiers one by one or be a prepared necromancer and flood the soldiers in skeletons.
