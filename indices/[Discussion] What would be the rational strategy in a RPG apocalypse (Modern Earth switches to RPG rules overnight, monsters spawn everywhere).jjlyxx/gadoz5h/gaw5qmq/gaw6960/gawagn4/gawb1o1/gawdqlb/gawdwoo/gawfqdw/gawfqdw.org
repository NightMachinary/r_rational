It's still a pretty silly speculative question. I agree that right now we don't have enough details to say anything too precise - others have pointed it out - but it also seems obvious to me what the question meant in the first place. There's an equilibrium between wanting detail and just getting pedantic. All verbal communication relies on understood common references, and if I'm wrong, the worst that can happen is that the OP corrects me with "actually what the question meant is..." and nothing serious whatsoever happens because we're just goofing off fantasizing about an impossible scenario anyway.
