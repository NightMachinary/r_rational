I'd go for some sort of Artificer class. Create magic items that improve my base stats. And then use the improved base stats to create better items... fund my item creation by selling some other items that I can create (mostly items with whimsical abilities because that would strike me as funny, though mix in some seriously good items just to keep the profits up)
