What level would a D&D wizard have to be in order to solo a prepared squad of US Marines (that have read the rulebook and are on guard against a scry-and-fry)? A 20th level one could get the job done with Wish, if nothing else, and a 1st level one is obviously toast, but when exactly does a wizard get powerful enough?
