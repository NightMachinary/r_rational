That you can't have a rational strategy without a utility function. The statement "you are in an apocalyptic rpg" does not provide a utility function and therefore can not be optimized.

If you said "you are the character in fallout 1" you could say "You walk west then make a series of arcane statements about the fertility of super mutants, take the water chip from the master's vault, then return home not truly understanding the magnitude of what you have done only wanting nothing more than to never leave the vault again" But without the goal of getting the water chip and stoping the master there would be no way to optimize.
