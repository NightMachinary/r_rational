Ah, but the loan officers have /rules/ with regard to what conditions people must fulfill in order to obtain a loan. If you beguile the loan officer, then all that you will get is an itemised list of /exactly/ what you need in terms of documentation in order to obtain the loan you want at the best interest rate. (Which you /will/ need to repay, because there are other people checking on that, and some of those other people are lawyers whom you have not yet met).

Mind you, you can still make incredible profits (by creating a shop, pricing items at "only beguiled people would pay this" levels, and then /persuading/ people to spend money in your shop). But you just might have a bit of a slower start...
