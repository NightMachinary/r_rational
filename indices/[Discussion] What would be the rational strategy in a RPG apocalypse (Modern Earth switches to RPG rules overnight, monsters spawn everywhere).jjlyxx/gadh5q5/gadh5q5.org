Focus on Charisma and charm/manipulation/social skills. Our world runs primarily on social capital; and so being able to quantize, accurately measure, and deliberately increase such skills in a linear manner will enable you to make deals, trade, and forge alliances to a degree of predictability never before seen.

Just imagine quantizing social relationships to the point that you know you have exactly a 40% chance of "beguiling or seducing" someone. You could walk into every major bank in a city and ask for the biggest loan possible, knowing full well that you're likely to walk out of at least one of them with millions of dollars. Then you create a business or shop and price items perfectly knowing exactly how likely it is for you to make a sale with a given customer at a given price.

Basically, what I'm getting at, is that you could reduce nearly everything to math, and give yourself a safe and predictable path towards riches beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Of course, you would have to move fast as others would be doing the same thing, but if you got in before the masses figured out what was happening, were able to get in on the ground level while the new socio-economic landscape was being reinvented, you would be a king.

Then, just use your massive wealth to hire protection (possibly in exchange for epic loot) from the best dungeon crawlers in the world. Basically, you'd become a financial NPC, the type of shop keeper/banker that is essential in RPGs, is mostly overlooked, and as a result almost never dies or comes into direct contact with danger.
