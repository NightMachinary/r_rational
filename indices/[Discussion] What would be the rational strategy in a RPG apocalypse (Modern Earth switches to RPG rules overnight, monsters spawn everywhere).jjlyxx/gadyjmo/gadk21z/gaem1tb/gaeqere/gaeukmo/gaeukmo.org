I'm not sure I agree. Real life is much more complicated than RPG rules, and I think being more of a generalist in real life is probably better, unless you can be /extremely/ specialized, which is relatively rare and difficult. But with RPG rules, specialization is usually easier, and is highly rewarded, and being a generalist means grossly underperforming your character level, so if you're encountering enemies that are determined by your level and not your actual stats, that's a major problem.

A determined nerd can probably also memorize the DnD ruleset in a couple weeks (maybe less? or a bit more? I've never actually played paper DnD), whereas I think it's probably physically impossible to memorize real life laws. DnD rules, and RPG rules in general, are also more internally consistent. I think all that makes rules-lawyering much more practical in RPGs than in real life. In addition, RPG rules implies a DM or enforcement mechanism that's much more omniscient, powerful, and consistent than any real life law enforcement (mostly fortunately, in both directions), so rules-lawyering is less likely to be overridden by simple violence.
