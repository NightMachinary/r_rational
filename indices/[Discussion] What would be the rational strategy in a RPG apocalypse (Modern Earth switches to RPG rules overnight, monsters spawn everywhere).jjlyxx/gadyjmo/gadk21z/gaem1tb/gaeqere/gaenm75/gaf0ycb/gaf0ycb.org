Rules-lawyering doesn't seem like a practical answer to a LitRPG situation. If some particular set of RPG rules have become the new laws of physics, then you probably don't have access to the exact wording of those rules, and don't have anyone to complain /to/ about those rules.

In fact, barring the existence of an unusually helpful AI-type "System" behind the RPG mechanics that not only gives you all the details of the new rules in a humanly-interpretable format, but is additionally willing to listen to your complaints about said system and make adjustments on-the-fly in response to those complaints, rules-lawyering seems more or less impossible.
