Because your military targets are too mobile to target and completely self sufficient.

A high level spellcaster doesn't require industry to build and maintain, doesn't need an air strip to take off from, doesn't need support lines and (assuming a certain level of teleport magic is available) can effectively be anywhere at any time.

If you want to strike at an enemy country in such a world you can target their leadership (if those aren't high level spellcasters themselves) or civilian targets because there just isn't much else to target.
