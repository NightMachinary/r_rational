Yes, that's true but for the average person I don't see why they'd be setting new societal power dynamics.

Since very few people will be patient, capable of restraint or even give it a second thought you will be competing against almost everyone by rushing headlong into it.

Say 90% of the classes are shit at 1% are super op. Lots of bloat rpgs are like that where splat book content is superior in every way.

If you're capable you'd be a rare person who didn't choose.

If babies have this sense the moment they're born they will choose at random since they have no capacity to understand the permanence of the choice

If that's how it works then you'd be part of a very finite group
