That could definitely backfire though. Some earlier editions of D&D had limited numbers of upper-level ranks of a class. For example, to level up past level... 7, I think... as a monk in 1st edition AD&D you had to defeat one of the monks who held a higher rank and take their place, which would demote them back to the lower level. Given the absolute advantage of the higher ranks, it is easier to hold a position than to climb to it. If a mechanic like that ended up in play, you might end up at the bottom of the totem pole if you delay.
