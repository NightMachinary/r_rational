  I did not read that as rare and powerful advantages
#+end_quote

The OP /literally says/ "you can't luck into rare and powerful advantages." "1% of classes are super OP" means that those classes are, by definition, (a) rare and (b) powerful. They must therefore be available to everyone on equal terms or else gaining one of them would be an act of good fortune. (To be born in a specific place, to discover the mystic McGuffin, etc) Unless you're asserting that the vast majority of people would be idiots and not bother reading the whole list?

  Why on earth wouldn't it be the case [that babies would know about classes and choose randomly]?
#+end_quote

You are confusing the burden of proof. You are making an assertion and you need to support it. I see nothing in OP's post that suggests awareness of classes is instinctive or that the choice can be made casually. You need to demonstrate that this would necessarily be the case.

  What senses don't we develop in infancy?
#+end_quote

Balance, for one example. Also, why do you assert that this is a 'sense' in the same category as sight or hearing? Why wouldn't it be written information that pops up when you say a specific word? Or an exposition fairy that comes to each individual adult, verifies that you are compos mentis, explains the details, and gets your decision? Or a series of training halls that pop up all over the world and accept applicants? Or a mystic ritual that requires eating the souls of a thousand lemure?

You are taking a nigh-infinite possibility space and saying that it must definitely be the one that you want and no other possibility could exist so there nyah. You need to defend your assertion.
