People forget how ridiculously strong an average US soldier is. Except for magical threats that are intangible or use extensive mind-magic, there is almost no D&D creature that would survive a standard fully equipped modern military squad.

Primarily, a normal engagement range for a solider is between four to five hundred meters. Non-sapient monsters wouldn't even know what's happening as they're dying, as the riflemen mow them down from relative safety.

For harder targets (eg a dragon) the squad also has enough firepower. Even if the grenadiers can't get through the armor, the AT troopers are carrying guided anti-tank armaments that can't be blocked or dodged and blow holes through basically anything.

It wouldn't be very fair
