Before we continue let's just quote my comment:

#+begin_quote
  The best decision would *probably* be to avoid choosing a class until most people have so you can choose the class that will be most in demand so you can sell your services for maximum profit.
#+end_quote

So quite clearly I am suggesting that most people will probably rush into the decision with very little if any consideration.

#+begin_quote
  The OP literally says "you can't luck into rare and powerful advantages."
#+end_quote

Right, and having some classes turn out better than others is not a rare and powerful advantage. It is the case in almost every RPG that some classes spike at different power levels (and some are straight up worse in nearly every realistic situation).

#+begin_quote
  "1% of classes are super OP" means that those classes are, by definition, (a) rare and (b) powerful.
#+end_quote

Yes having a 100 classes means every class will be rare, or more likely people will gravitate to familiar or cool sounding classes, hence my position

#+begin_quote
  They must therefore be available to everyone on equal terms or else gaining one of them would be an act of good fortune. (To be born in a specific place, to discover the mystic McGuffin, etc)
#+end_quote

Yes, I have no suggesting anything differently

#+begin_quote
  Unless you're asserting that the vast majority of people would be idiots and not bother reading the whole list?
#+end_quote

Indeed, or even that they would read the whole list (if at all especially if they're being immediately attacked or are driving or are surprised or choose one accidentally as a reflex upon gaining a new sense) they would still not choose the "nose-picker" class over "cool warrior awesome guy".

I don't know why you think that every, or even most, people would read the entire ruleset, carefully analyse each individual class (of which there could be thousands), look at every level of the class (if that's even revealed), compare and contrast unbiasedly their own qualities with what makes a class good, estimate the different level spikes and how difficult it is to level in this new world (how would they possibly know this information), and more. I don't really think it's crazy to suggest that a) most people wouldn't wait and b) waiting for more information to make such a crucial decision is probably good.

#+begin_quote
  You are confusing the burden of proof. You are making an assertion and you need to support it. I see nothing in OP's post that suggests awareness of classes is instinctive or that the choice can be made casually. You need to demonstrate that this would necessarily be the case.
#+end_quote

Honestly I don't know what's up with you in this post eagle. Are you deliberately misreading me or just wake up on the wrong side of the bed or what? I literally wrote "if". There's nothing to suggest that the choice can only be made after 10,000 hours of important thought where you analyse everything to choose. Hence why I said "if". You at the moment you are granted this sudden decision along with everyone else in the world, have no information at all. Your position is that this makes for a justified headlong dive into immediately choosing. Maybe it does. For example *IF* everyone is immediately attacked by a level 1 mob 5 minutes after the option appears then probably choosing instantly is a good idea.

#+begin_quote
  Balance, for one example.
#+end_quote

From what could you possibly assume within two seconds of receiving this choice that balance would exist or be relevant? You are just making the same guesses as I am. I didn't assume anything, that's why I said

** IF

#+begin_quote
  Why wouldn't it be written information that pops up when you say a specific word? Or an exposition fairy that comes to each individual adult, verifies that you are compos mentis, explains the details, and gets your decision? Or a series of training halls that pop up all over the world and accept applicants? Or a mystic ritual that requires eating the souls of a thousand lemure?
#+end_quote

Indeed maybe any of those could be true. All we got was choose.

#+begin_quote
  You are taking a nigh-infinite possibility space and saying that it must definitely be the one that you want and no other possibility could exist so there nyah. You need to defend your assertion.
#+end_quote

Really, because all I said was "probably" and "if". You asked why would it be sense based and I said why wouldn't it be sense based? As you've correctly deduced there is literally no reason to think the other so this critique of my "if" statement is completely unfounded.

Where are you getting definitely from? This is what I'm talking about. I wouldn't expect you to go in with bad faith and put me on a position I never made any hint of suggesting. Every post I made I have couched in ifs and probablys and maybes.
