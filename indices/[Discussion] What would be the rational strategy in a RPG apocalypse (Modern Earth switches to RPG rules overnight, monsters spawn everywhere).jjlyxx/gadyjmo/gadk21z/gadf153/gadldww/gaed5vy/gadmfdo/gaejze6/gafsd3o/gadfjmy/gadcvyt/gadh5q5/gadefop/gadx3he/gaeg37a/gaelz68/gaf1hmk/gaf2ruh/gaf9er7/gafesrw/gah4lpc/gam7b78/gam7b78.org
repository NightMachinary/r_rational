  As an example, try finding a roguelike (examples in sidebar of [[/r/roguelikes]]) you've never played before and win it on your first attempt without using any external resources. This is approximately what you're expecting, and it's not going to happen.

That's a pretty good analogy, except in addition you don't even know if it's a roguelite or if it's permadeath or if it's anything. Basically you don't know nothing, and while in some cases randomly guessing when you know nothing can be better I'd say as a rule you should probably avoid doing so, especially in this case when even the tiniest of delays will give you vast amounts of information.

For example, rather than choosing immediately, turn to the person next to you and see if they have reacted to this sudden choice. If they have well, then it's not just you. Do they look like they are turning hostile to you and are you turning hostile to them? Well maybe it's PVP if they are and you better choose ASAP
