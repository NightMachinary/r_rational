I'm thinking that a tamer or summoner class might be a particularly useful one. Most people will not have fighting experience, but if you're a summoner then even if you panic and freeze you still have your pets to defend you.

They also have a nice advantage in that they specialise in Charisma. That's an overwhelming advantage because it lets you attract allies, find peaceful resolutions to conflicts with other humans, and spot false friends. If you've heard there's really good loot in a fire themed dungeon, having a network you can ping to put together a team of water specialists is worth more than a bit more DPS. Even if organising raids falls to specialists with classes like guild master, I'd say being on good terms with the boss would be valuable. Plus, if you go for a magic type summoner there's a good chance it uses Intelligence too, it need not be said why that's an advantage.
