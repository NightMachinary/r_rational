Caveat: while this is something I've done some research in I am by no means an expert.

My understanding is that undernourishment has fallen due to increased distribution of carbohydrates, while malnutrition has risen in macronutrients (not enough protein) and fallen in other respects (vitamin deficiencies). At the same time, water scarcity has risen due to drought.

So it's definitely a mixed bag.
