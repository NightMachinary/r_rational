"is now running on D&D rules" maps how exactly to "3rd level spells are now candy"?

I guess if whatever entity foments this apocalypse decides, in its munificent wisdom, to structure magic such that the basic staples of life are now available to everyone without scarcity, because the alternative is that everyone just dies, uh. At that point, well, we get whatever scenario and society the magical space whales wanted and we have no actual ability to predict what would be optimal, but hey, post-scarcity society on food staples, and the collapse of industrialized civilization means no more global warming! I'll take it!
