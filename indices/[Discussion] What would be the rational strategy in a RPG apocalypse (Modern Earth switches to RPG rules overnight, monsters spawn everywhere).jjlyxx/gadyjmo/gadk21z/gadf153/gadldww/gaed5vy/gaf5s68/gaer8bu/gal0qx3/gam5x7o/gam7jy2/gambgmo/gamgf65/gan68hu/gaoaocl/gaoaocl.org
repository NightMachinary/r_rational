Yeah, this really isn't a productive argument. You think that things are pared right to the bone; I think that in a real emergency, people will figure out workarounds for the worst of it. Neither of us can really prove our claims to the satisfaction of the other, and even specific cases can be dismissed as atypical; we'd need to do some serious research to find out who is correct, and simply winning an internet argument is not worth that amount of research.

So yeah, I don't think that we're going to reach a conclusion or even take this argument anywhere useful, either. It only makes sense to drop it now.
