Real world people in a D&D like setting doesn't get you squads of 4-6 people going into level appropriate dungeons to fight dragons and what not. Such settings are inherently going to devolve into a Tippyverse-like world sooner or later (sooner being a lot more likely), which means massive professional scry and die squadrons and warfare that is inherently going to be brutal and focused on hard to defend (ie. non-military) targets.

I would try gather a small (<100) group of people I can mostly trust and get as far away from anything that people might consider valuable. Then go through a lot of effort not to ever appear as a threat and stay off of everyone's radar.
