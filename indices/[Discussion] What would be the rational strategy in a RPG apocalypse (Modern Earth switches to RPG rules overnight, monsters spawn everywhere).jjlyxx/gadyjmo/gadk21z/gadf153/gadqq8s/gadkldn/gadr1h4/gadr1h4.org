You don't even need actual healing. I've thought a lot about how the Cleanse aura in Delve would stop Covid in it's tracks. Best skill ever indeed. Our ability to rehabilitate people with damaged (cellular or large damage) bodies is already great. Being able to walk into a building, destroy all the Covid in the air, destroy all the Covid in everyone's bodies, and then walk away to the next building would be wonderful even if you couldn't also magically repair the damage already done to sick people along with the rest of the magic.
