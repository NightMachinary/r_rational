It's part of the picture, but only a part. A Dynamo of even a low level would be able to do a lot more than another build, but quantity has a quality all it's own. A Dynamo working at an airport may be able to clean 5 planes an hour for a straight 8 hour workday, while another build may only be able to clean 5 planes total in a workday, but if those other people are 8 times cheaper/more plentiful then that's fine, especially considering they can do other labor during the 8 hours.

In the scenario where everyone is awakened that doesn't necessarily mean everyone is level 5 and has a class, but the overall volume of people would still lead to a lot more Cleanse out and about. Cleanse is a fantastic utility skill, so in a universe like ours where MOST people would largely want utility skills because monsters aren't eating us every day, I think a lot of people would want it.

Even if a lot of the people that have Cleanse only use it for a couple bursts that's still a lot of Cleanse to go around.
