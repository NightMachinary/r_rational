Yeah the math of what exactly you'd need is interesting, both for cleanup and for prevention. Like, how many cleansers would you have needed in December or January? If standard program is that a Cleanser is waiting on the walkway, the airplane door opens to them cleansing, and then they walk through the plane once to get everybody before they deboard..

Doing that on every international flight means the disease never left Asia, but how many Planes can one Cleanser do a day? How many would you need at each airport? Is that reasonable?
