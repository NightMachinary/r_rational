To summarise a strategy, we'd need some basic axioms. Everyone starts at Level 1, roughly normal stats (a D&D average of 10~11), and can choose a class. We'll assume a rough D&D-like system, with things like fireballs, levels, resurrection, healing, and magic items. No version specifics like BAB or proficiency.

Firstly, I'd hold off on picking a class. I'd contact as many people that I'm friendly with as I can. For those who are familiar with RPGs, I'd have them as what's effectively colleagues. For those who aren't, I'd write or prepare a quick explanation of my plans and what they should do. If possible, I'd get most of these people to be near me. If not, long-range communication will do until then.

Once I have a group to work with, I'd see what kind of range of stats and class choices I'm working with. I'd aim for, at minimum, one of a few key class types in my group. I'd want a healer of some kind for certain, be that an Alchemist, Cleric, Priest, whatever. I'd want some sort of mage-type, preferably more along the lines of a D&D Wizard who can share or invent spells rather than a Sorcerer. I'd explain and justify myself to the group as to why we should have our particular class makeup. As for myself, I would likely be something along the lines of a Wizard or Artificer, preferably the latter.

With a group and classes established, I'd then aim for a safe base of operations. Pick someone's house or something, and focus my early efforts on fortifying it to be a safehouse. Ideally, there'd be no monsters in my city, but it pays to be safe.

With a safehouse established, I'd go through the usual apocalypse routines, gathering food, water, and supplies. I'd figure out which of my Level 1 friends could have any method of producing such supplies; D&D typically has /create food and water/ or similar, which can be invaluable. If the system has resetting traps, we're laughing and I'll just go through the Tippyverse motions as supplies become a dime a billion.

Once things are established, I'd work from there. Provide magic items to the vulnerable if able, thus adding them to our community; tabulating as much information about the new system as possible and providing this to whoever asks; finding out how to level up and develop class abilities.

Essentially, I'd try to get a safe basis to work from, and then would try and develop the new world into a stable, functional life, ideally enhanced by magic. Magic items would make this notably, notably easier in every aspect. Food and water could be solved by magic items. Defense against monsters could be solved by magic items. Get high enough levels and even death is immaterial.

Just gotta be safe and able to survive, then you can start exploiting the system.
