This might be an odd answer, but I think I'd deliberately go for something weird.

Like, the way that I see it is that with a system like this, your first though is gonna be munchkinry. You pick wizard or whatever, because you want the wish spell so you can commence world-optimization. Blah blah blah.

But there are people more suited to that than me. Most people will probably go with either intelligence based shit so they can abuse the system, or combat stuff so they can survive.

But my logic is that if a class exists, it's probably balanced against the other classes, right? Especially in a real-life world altering system. Presumably there wouldn't be anything like "oh this class wasn't popular so we didn't put much effort into it". So therefore, any choice is theoretically valid, and I should just pick something that basically nobody else will, on the off chance it offers something unique. I mean, I know that you said I "can't luck into rare and powerful advantages", but if I'm purposefully going for something odd, I can presumably at least bring /something/ unique to the table.

This of course could make survival early on pretty hard, but again assuming it's at least sort of balanced, I'll probably have SOME way to fight. And I live with my family, and in an area with a decent population, so I see no reason I couldn't rely on others to keep me alive as I figure out whatever weird shit I picked.

(Unless I'm just immediately attacked and don't have time to go over my list of available classes. In that case survival takes priority, and I'd just pick whatever the easiest melee combat class I can get seems to be.)
