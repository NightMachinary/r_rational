In a sensible world this should probably feed back into itself too. The moment you've got a couple of high level clerics known to the general public someone is going to think about using a life insurance policy to pay for their resurrection. Standard economic rules should probably start making the risk of death while adventuring less of an issue over time.

in a few decades most people will have some tier of resurrection insurance and people with the resources to do so would essentially twink their way into capstoning faster by paying a group of high level adventurers to carry them through appropriately over-levelled encounters.

Presumably pretty much everyone would be some shade of full caster due to the greater utility offered. Probably mostly Clerics or the like who can swap out spells every day.
