Yeah, you absolutely hit it on the head. The specifics of builds are impossible to determine, we don't have a system described so we can't say things like "go Summoner/whatever". What is universal in such settings and rulesets is the concept of specific builds having counters and weaknesses, and the importance in most cases of building at LEAST a small team to balance out those weaknesses.

Sure you may luck into an OP build (which OP is specifically trying to head off) or circumstances (maybe you happen to be in an area that doesn't offer a diverse array of threats, so a single builds weaknesses aren't very important as long as those aren't the things you'll run into. For example if you live in a swamp and pick some feature with poison immunity you may be OP in your very local area and not have to worry about things so much), but in most circumstances you need a minimum level of diversity.

At a bare minimum you'll want a couple different damage types, healing, and some crowd control. Depending on the details you'll want more variety. In 95% of systems the monsters are largely melee, or there are video game style damage-sharing or super gamey threat-generation mechanics, so you need Tanks and a front line. Sometimes that's not as true and everyone needs to be able to take at least some hits because you can't count on aggro. Another possibility are stamina issues (like with Delve, or touched on in City and the Dungeon) where you may have to choose in your builds between really going strong in one encounter, or being able to keep going through multiple encounters.

The last thing is crafting. If it's something like most MMOs or Culling of Man and everyone gets combat classes and then can pick up a few crafting skills on the side, then great (Or if it's a system where pre-system equipment matters, great, but I don't think I've ever read a Litrpg where the rusty daggers level 5 characters pull out of a rat's anus can't slice through a Main Battle Tank). If it's something like System Apocalypse where people only excel at crafting with specific non-combat classes then the minimal community size for fielding effective people with level-appropriate gear grows a lot larger.
