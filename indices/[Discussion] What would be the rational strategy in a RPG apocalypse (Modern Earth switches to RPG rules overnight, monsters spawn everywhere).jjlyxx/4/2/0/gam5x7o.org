Because all of this stuff is incredibly fragile.

In the developed world, it's fragile beyond belief. Farming is an industrial process where hydrocarbons (petroleum for transit, natural gas for fertilizer; a lot of farmland would be worthless for a couple growing seasons without fertilizer) and the end-products of a vast array of production lines (various types of machinery, roads, all of the vast dizzying array of transit infrastructure) are turned into crops. The whole system is JIT (Just-In-Time) on many, many levels; the labor is only present when it's needed, the tools likewise, seeds likewise (and hey, why not throw in some no-self-germinating/terminator genes in there), everything only shows up when it's needed because storage space is expensive and these are massive, massive businesses where any cost savings is a large amount of dollar profit. (This also means they mostly ship out what they grow as soon as they harvest it. See also, storing less is more profit.)

These food production chains are vulnerable at every stage to any unpredicted disruption, and nothing says unpredicted disruption like monsters spawning everywhere, widespread economic turmoil, and a sudden decrease in imported (or in the US, often effectively slave) labor (because of the monsters, because of the new opportunities, because of a lot of things).

Farms that are worthless without two seasons of fallow, normally farmed by seasonal day laborers who have better things to do than get eaten by monsters, transported by trucks that no longer have petrol and whose truckers are getting eaten by monsters, you'd need to have a godlike AI constructing your new paradigm in order to have the food-production systems keep working, at which point prediction is useless.
