I don't think you understand how pared to the bone things are. The interconnected systems are robust only to yesterdecade's challenges; we already get massive famines and goods shortages from what is now routine weather conditions in many places around the world.

There's a couple billion people in the world already suffering from malnutrition in one form or another (I'm being generous here; arguably it's more; malnutrition isn't just 'enough calories'). The parts of the world which aren't suffering are least well-placed to successfully pivot, and the parts of the world that are well-played to successfully pivot are least well-placed to weather the transition.

Anyway, I'm probably done with this argument, because it's beyond pointless. The thought experiment posed is (IMO) pretty dumb, and a sources-free argument between two internet randos about the resilience level of food pipelines across the world is even dumber.
