If it's that fragile, then why don't we have massive food shortages every time that a major highway needs repairing?

--------------

Here's what I think will happen. There will be panic at first. But despite the fact that storage is expensive, some food is stored (how do you think you get some fruits massively out of season?) and every step along that pipeline /has/ stuff in it at the start.

So yes, there might be a warehouse somewhere from which food is sent out to a city's worth of shops. Maybe there's some problem with some of the trucks - so they send out the trucks that /don't/ have a problem. Maybe there's monsters on some of the roads - so they find /other/ routes. (Monsters on the roads are either able to survive being hit by a car, or won't last long). There will be bottlenexks and shortages for a while, yes; and maybe some of the drivers will go off to find sudden new opportunities. But I think that the only reason why we're likely to see food shortages in the first week is because of people panicing and buying out /all the food they can/. (Which means that those panic buyers won't starve).

Now, international transport will be a bit more of a pain - /particularly/ over the sea, as sea monsters are likely to be /big/. England, in particular, will have a problem, and a massive one (with little more than a week or two to figure out a solution). Other countries will have more minor problems. But humanity will survive in all the countries that have a net /export/ of food; which implies that the first step in a rational strategy is to get into one of them.
