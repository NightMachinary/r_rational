I disagree. Locking yourself in early is very likely to be a mistake if there are many options, and people who haven't chosen yet (and so can become anything that's needed, within reason) may themselves become in high demand. Your chance of "setting the new societal power dynamics" is about the same either way.

I think you're kinda forgetting this isn't a story. People will work together, and if something is OP they will focus resources on training someone they trust up in that. "Going solo" or trying to be a frontrunner is the absolute worst thing you can do for your survivability.

As an example, try finding a roguelike ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/][examples in sidebar of /r/roguelikes]]) you've never played before and win it on your first attempt without using any external resources. This is approximately what you're expecting, and it's not going to happen.
