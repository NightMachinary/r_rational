This is much more of a medical /drama/ than a medical procedural, and I prefer the former. The problem I have with procedural stories is that I have no knowledge of medicine myself, so I'm completely dependent upon the characters for information. As a result, I care much more about the emotional weight of the story than realism. This comic does a very good job of making me care.
