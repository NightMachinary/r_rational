Cool concept. It's similar to what I'd like to write rationalist fiction about, except my story will be called Medics and Magics (referencing D&D as well as M&M, which in medical lingo refers to Morbidity and Mortality, both a CDC publication as well as a monthly conference held by doctors to talk about things that go wrong.)

[[/u/trekie140]] are you interested in medicine? If so, what are some other rational medical things do you like? What sorts of story plots would you like to see in a serial fiction? (steering away from the 'disease a week' styled serial)

{I'll read the webcomic too and post a comment below with my thoughts and reactions.}
