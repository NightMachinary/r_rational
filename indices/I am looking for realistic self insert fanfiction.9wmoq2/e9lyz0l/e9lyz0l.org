I dropped this story partially because it was doing exactly what you list as unwanted traits of an SI story. Granted, I've only read it to chapter 10, but even in these starting 10 percents of the story, the protagonist does all this:

- instantly gets attached to Ino, who is her biological sister in this story, and develops absolute loyalty to her.

- potentially arouses Hokage's suspicions by making a dumb ominous remark for no reason

    "... You begin the academy next year don't you?"

    "Yes Hokage-sama," she replied with an exaggerated nod.

    "See that you do well. I'll be expecting great things from you."

    Rei's smile turned sly. "Don't worry Hokage-sama. I promise I'll be like no one you've ever seen before."

    /That/ earned her a long look and suddenly the smile on his face didn't look quite so genuine.

    "Take care of yourself Rei-chan," he said before turning and walking away.

    The smile on Rei's face fell as soon as he was gone.

    /Damn it damn it damn it. I definitely went too far. Shit!/

- intentionally copies young Orochimaru's style of dressing --- again, for no reason than I assume to appease her mary sue / SI aesthetics and use it later on as an excuse for drama complications.

She also has a very shitty personality, and the other character behave out-of-character to enable her. [[https://np.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/9p7vfo/ocsi_prodigy_fanfics/e8lck1v/?context=3][I've commented more on this here.]] I've tried looking for others' reviews on this story to determine whether maybe it gets better later on, but it seemed like drastic personality and goal changes keep happening almost from one chapter to the next, and her personality traits and behaviour only worsen in the later chapters.

  Why even risk butterflying the future plot to nonexistance. You lose your only advantage doing so.

Because by just existing the SI already influences things and thus changes the future. The stories also like to use the butterfly-effect excuse to explain their lack of originality and regurgitation of canon stations.
