[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11245587][Shadows of a Slaughterhouse - Burnscar]]: As far as I can tell, the main character was forcefully recruited by the S9 immediately after arriving on Earth Bet, and only managed to free herself after months. At the start of the story she just moved out of the Pelham's, who helped her recover.

So far it's purely dialogue focussed, but what's there is good.
