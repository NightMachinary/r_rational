I've been largely unimpressed with metaworld chronicles.

The main character is supposedly a former businesswoman but acts like a stereotypical magical girl teenager, and is otherwise a rather bland character with little to no growth. She have some cool powers and I'm a sucker for the rise to power stories, but at chapter 170 I still can't recall a single time she had taken initative to drive the story.

Any want she appears to have, beyond becomming more powerful so she can protect her friends against unspecified threats, are shortlived and quickly resolved. Either because she either overpowers her opponents or because she does one of her honestly uninspiring speeches in which she quotes a few earth philosophers and then swooes everyone.

There's squad exploration or contemplation of what happened to the original girl whose body the main character inhabits.

The currency is based on continually regrowing mana crystals and she has a background in business but have no ideas how to exploit their system.

A majority of the population is treated as second hand citizens because they can't do magic and she can't bring herself to care.

She can gain affinity towards new elements by eating monsters but never bothers going hunting for that.
