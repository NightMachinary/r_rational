If you're willing to take serious purple prose in the first ten-odd chapters and grimdark survival guide 100% fucking seriously, then try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10996503/1/Of-the-River-and-the-Sea][Of the River and the Sea]] where the SI is born as the daughter of a whore in the Bloody Mist, and at fucking /7/ is sent to the front lines of the Third Shinobi World War. Kiri is a bitch, and anyone sending children to their deaths like that are fucking sociopaths and in this story are characterized appropriately. Also the protagonist has some sort of medical disorder involving brain chemistry (schizophrenia maybe? Whatever) and guess what civilization doesn't have appropriate mental health care yet? Guess who she turns to for the development of the pills she needs? It does get better, but it's slow and realistic, especially how fucking traumatizing it is to A. fight in a war against super powered shinobi and B. Watching children die around you and C. Deal with A and B in a civilization that hasn't discovered therapy yet.
