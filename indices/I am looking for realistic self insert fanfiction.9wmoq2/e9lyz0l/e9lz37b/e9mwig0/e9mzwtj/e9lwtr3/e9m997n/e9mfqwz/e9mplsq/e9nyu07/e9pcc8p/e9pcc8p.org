Yes and no. The recent issues are published in HTML/CSS and so are easily converted, and there is work done to retrofit the older ones. But most are still raw text, because for the longest time HTML just wasn't good enough for formatted text, and the authors didn't want to use such a non-standard (at the time) way of displaying text. Remember, we're talking about a work that began its life on a campus' usenet server in 1990...

So yeah, there's epub versions out there (like in my Calibre library) but it's not official and there's probably formatting bugs.
