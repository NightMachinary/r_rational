With This Ring has an interesting twist on setting knowledge: the SI remembers /everything else/ he knows about DC comics, but has completely forgotten even the existence of the specific setting he's in (Young Justice). So he has a lot of meta knowledge, but can't predict the main storyline.

And now it's about a year into what was a 5 year timeskip in canon, so it's way off the rails
