I heartily reccomend checking out [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-subtle-knife-worm-yj-si.342043/][A Subtle Knife]] by Industrious. It's a Young Justice SI with some Worm elements. The protagonist wakes up in a Gotham alley with Jack Slash's powerset, including his enhancements from Bonesaw. He almost immediately kills a man in self defense, and things progress from there.

The prose starts a bit rough, but improves noticeably as the story goes on. It's got some of the best character work I've seen in a fanfic, I'd really recommend checking it out if you're at all interested.
