My favorite, next to MOL. I only mentioned How to avoid death because its a bit darker.

Its not Worm in its worldbuilding, but its pretty entertaining. I mentioned it because its litRpg like Worth the candle, and it doesn't have wish fullfilment or harem. Its not rational, main character is emotional but its well writen and updated often.

I read daily grind as well, but updates are rare.
