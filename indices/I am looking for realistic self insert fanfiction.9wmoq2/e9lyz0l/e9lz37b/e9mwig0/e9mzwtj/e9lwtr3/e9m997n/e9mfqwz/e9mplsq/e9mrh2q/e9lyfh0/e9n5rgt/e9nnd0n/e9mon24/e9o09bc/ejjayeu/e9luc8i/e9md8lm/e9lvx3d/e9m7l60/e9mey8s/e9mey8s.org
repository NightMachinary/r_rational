The story just passed chapter 200, and a fair amount of the most recent chapters are based entirely around what you're talking about in the spoiler. I think the problem is that the author takes a looooong time to move things forward - a bunch of words are, IMO, wasted on elaborate descriptions of food and fashion - but when you consider that the OP is seen as a 15-17 year old girl, it's not surprising that she can't easily skip out to some of the most dangerous areas on the planet on a whim, even if doing so might be one of the best ways to get powerful. Doing so in Australia wouldn't have been realistic, as she didn't fully realize the potential of doing so until she left (and she had the Kirin Pendant and didn't need to advance that way); and doing so in China would have been extremely difficult, as she is being closely watched by incredibly powerful individuals and governmental entities, and travel is tightly controlled by the Communist party.

To your other points:

  There's squad exploration or contemplation of what happened to the original girl whose body the main character inhabits.

I think you meant to use a different word than "squad" there (Scant? Squat?), but this is also a point brought up in recent chapters. Although I find the resolution to be unsatisfying. Granted, it does leave the door open for future conflict...

  The currency is based on continually regrowing mana crystals and she has a background in business but have no ideas how to exploit their system.

Agreed, this is a really disappointing part. HDM/LDMs are mostly taken for granted once the China arc progresses, because CC becomes what most characters care about, and those aren't can't be traded or (easily) manipulated economically.

  A majority of the population is treated as second hand citizens because they can't do magic and she can't bring herself to care.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure what you mean here, as she continually shows caring for the NoMs. Her paper in her college classes, her behavior on the excursion, even early on with her first mission that leads her to a slaver's ring in a NoM neighborhood. If your comment was meant to say that she doesn't prioritize them over her personal concerns in general, then I'd agree... but that's not the same as not caring. Gwen does care, but she knows it's not a simple solution to fix, nor one of the main ones that occupies her attention ATM.

Anyway, I don't think Metaworld Chronicles is a masterpiece by any means, but I do think it's a pretty interesting read with an interesting alt-Earth setting, good power progression, an entertaining cast of characters, and a pretty interesting magic system. I read it for those details more than the technical writing skills.
