Well. If you're looking for sci-fi/anime SI, try Undocumented Features from Eyrie Productions. It's basically the largest one out there, so there's a good chance you'll find at least part of it to your tastes.

I'm rather surprised that it's seemingly never been mentioned here, actually. I know some of Eyrie Prod's works have sparked some... controversy (please don't start about DJ), but it's still a fanfiction landmark.

It's also collaborative, more than five millions words, and still growing since 1991; and the story itself is multi-generational, stretching over more than 400 years and many, many worlds. Not quite a crossover, but certainly the largest fusion I've ever read, in terms of sources, cast and world-building.

Due to its age and collaborative nature, its quality can vary (especially at the beginning), although I can't say I've been disappointed by anything in the last fifteen years or so, and even the beginning is a fun read (in an insane, wtf is happening way). The Symphony of the Sword books in particular are really great.
