[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11122077/1/A-World-Full-of-Monsters][World full of monsters]] is hands down best SI fic I have read - somewhat sociopathic SI in Naruto world who fixated on getting Rinnegan. Starts with humour and friendship like so many fix fics, but by the end of 3 chapter you would see that it's definitely not one of those. The only downside is (slight spoiler) female!Naruto . Unfortunately on hiatus.
