Yeah, Self-Insert is being used here to refer to a trend in fanfiction, where the viewpoint character is a forked personality of the author introduced to a setting they are /already familiar with./

In contrast, Narnia is an example of the related but much broader Portal Fantasy, where a plausibly-from-real-life original character, enough for the reader to empathize with, is thrust into a setting they are /wildly unprepared for./

As this is a rec thread, I won't be the only one to put forward Worth the Candle as an incredible marriage of both concepts, even if OP has a hate-on for the game elements c-:
