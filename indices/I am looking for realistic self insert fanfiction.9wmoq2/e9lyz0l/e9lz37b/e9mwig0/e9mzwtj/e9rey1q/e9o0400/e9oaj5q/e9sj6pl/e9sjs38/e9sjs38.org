I'll be honest I probably could use a few. The way i write doesn't really lend itself to it though.

My intermittent writer's block tends to resolve into full blown inspiration irregularly. Pretty much every chapter was written in one draft in one sitting. I've occasionally gone back to redo certain word choices or alter flow, most notably at one point where a speech was a bit too stilted and unbelievable.

I want to be more regular, but I need to do some more research before the next chapter as it's a PoV I haven't done before.
