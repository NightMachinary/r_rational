It doesn't exactly fall under the "grim dark survival guide" category that you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff]] is a pretty enjoyable Harry Potter SI that just started back in August. The main character is a 30-something woman who falls through a mirror at a garage sale into a Gringotts bank vault and realizes she is in her 11 year old self's body because... magic. Though it isn't finished yet, it's already got a 16 chapters and a good 98,000+ words for you to go through. It's also Gen which is pretty nice. I've been enjoying the heck out of it.
