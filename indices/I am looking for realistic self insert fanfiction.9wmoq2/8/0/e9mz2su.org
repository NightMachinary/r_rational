Yes, that's basically correct. In this usage (most of this seems to come out of the spacebattles/sufficient velocity forum cluster), it's a version of the author being either transported or reincarnated into a fictional world. Generally told from a first person perspective.

The self insert generally has full knowledge about the fictional world they are in. (So if they're in Harry Potter, then they have read all the books before they arrived there.)

It's not the same as a Mary Sue, as it's not necessarily an idealized version of the author, though it often becomes a fix-fic. (Which means "fixing" bad outcomes that happened in the original canon by getting directly involved in the plot.)
