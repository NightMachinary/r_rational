Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][Dreaming of Sunshine]]. It has extensive and grounded worldbuilding, good characterisations for the SI and the background characters. The story does have some problems, but nothing bad enough to spoil the otherwise great writing quality.
