The very first "issues", the Core books, are undoubtedly an in-group project, with lots of in-jokes and crazy stuff. The kind of things 90's anime fans write about when thinking "what if the Dirty-- I mean Lovely Angels just dropped by Worcester, no wait, what if we accidentally summoned a version of the Lovely Angels using hypertech we stumbled upon"

That's only the first two Core books though, which these days would be considered short stories (barely 40k words each). From there they actually got serious about storytelling and worldbuilding, but still kept the early work as things that actually happened, and for which there were serious and lasting consequences. Like First Contact and uplifting.

I also suspect that some of the authors then went through a depression, and that gave birth to the Exile arc. Definitely not crazy fun stuff.

By Future Imperfect, which is the vast majority of UF, the quality is solid and the authors are committed in delivering a well-crafted, coherent universe. The in-world history has also advanced significantly, so the SIs take a step back and the storylines are mainly about their children. They do make appearances though.

Symphony of the Sword is already deep into Future Imperfect. It adds an Utena crossover/fusion to UF, and is third-person but from the POV of Utena, with one of an SI's daughter as a co-star (although it's really a full-cast work). Since the world is viewed through the eyes of a newcomer it doesn't really demand an in-depth knowledge of the rest of UF, and I'd tentatively recommend starting with that to get a feel of the work.

Note that by that time, there's already one or two dozen fandoms fused into that universe. Ah! My Goddess, Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5... And of course Bubblegum Crisis, Macross and Dirty Pair from the early days. But as always, UF take them as fusions, not straight crossovers.

There's also lots of it available in audiobook, if that helps.

Disclaimer -- I'm a big fan of Eyrie. I've been following their works since about 1994 (my own high-school days), so I may be biased. But I tried not to be.
