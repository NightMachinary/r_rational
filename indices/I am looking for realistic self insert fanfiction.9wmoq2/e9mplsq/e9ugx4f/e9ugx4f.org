I've heard of it often, but I've never mentioned it here because I thought it'd stay the same quality as in the beginning. It has a lot of inside jokes and unrelated references early on that just drag the story down, and I couldn't make it past the first few thousand words.

Would you say it's a particularly good SI later on, or a particularly good story? It'd be more impressive if it was also the latter, but I've always heard of it as a trivia piece, not something that's actually worth reading.
