I'm curious about this evolution of language. By your usage, I take it that Self-Insert in this case means the author is a human from our world that is transported into a fantasy or SF world? The classic example being Narnia?

(i'm curious both because I'm aware of an older term for this phenomenon, and because Self Insert is also an existing fiction term which has meant something rather different before)
