Metaworld is pretty fun, I wouldn't go as far as to call it realistic or rational, but it's Hella fun. The world building and characters are it's strength, the plot being a bit iffy at moments.

Though I get to enjoy it as an Australian, as the MC is Australian and more than half the series so far is based in Australia it gave me some enjoyment to see my culture highlighted a bit. Not sure how well that would transfer.
