Not to spoil much, but she goes hunting quite alot (read last chapters) and collects power base with allies since its what is most important for gaining strength in that world. She loses control quite often due to teenage hormones and her magical affinites but at the same time plays people quite well while gathering social power.

Anyways, its that kind of realism instead of "kill everything with how cool you are" stories that made me like Metaworld.
