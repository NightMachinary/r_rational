Erin transported into a new world. She found an abandoned Inn in the woods and decided to be an inkeeper. She deals with problem arise, from stray Goblins, Crab/Oyster-like monster, vagrant, and (friendly) authority of city nearby. She has sunny disposition and her approach to problems is amusing. Her tendency is to serve, so she sometimes fail to look after herself.

Ryoka transported into the same new world. Ryoka and Erin unrelated. They spawn on different place too. Unlike Erin, Ryoka is more educated, more cautious. But like Erin, what's true on Earth they seems to believe is also true in this new world. Ryoka's has a bit of bitch personality.

Magic and hilarity ensues.

I honestly think the early chapters is well written. Not well in sense of suck you in, made you forget time because you're so enamored with its beauty. Author is not Ursula LeGuinn after all. But things make sense, and drama is well directed. I just have problem when the scope get expanded and all new characters feel the same old stubborn and egoistic and frustrating. Author skills doesn't seems to keep up to make things stays interesting.

I'm not recommending it, but it seems you're already intrigued.
