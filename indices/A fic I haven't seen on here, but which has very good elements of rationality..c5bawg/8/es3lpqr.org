6.27 M is a perfect example of how very not-rational the work is. The assassins are inexplicably terrible at their jobs, like really fucking bad, so bad it's comical, in a way that makes no sense but is very convenient for the plot, so that you can get a sense of a threat without the good side losing anything.

And how is there enough work to support a guild of thousands of assassins? We're even told that traditionally the nobles of Izril don't fight each other using open bloodshed like this, so how do thousands of assassins make a living each year?
