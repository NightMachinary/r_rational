My apologies, I meant the first one, after monsters pour out of dungeon, which was possibly the Skinner one. That doesn't change the fact that I find Ryoka and Erin, especially Ryoka, so pointlessly antagonizing everything, operating on such petty behaviour, that I just didn't want to bother with it anymore. I might just try and grab an epub/mobi version from somewhere and try reading it on kindle, less distractions and options to jump out once the story gets annoying.
