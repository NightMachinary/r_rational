i'm not really sure what part you're referring to with those spoilers, sorry! i can think of at least three events that i would call "the city battle," and i may have forgotten at least one. it's been a while since i first read the story and i've yet to do a reread (its an intimidating prospect, this sucker is a real doorstopper! and most of the first book is not my thing at all) but as far as i can remember by book 2 i was getting invested and by book 3 i was long since hooked. i think the first time i was really getting hyped was when the skinner arc was in full swing, or maybe the start of winter, and ryoka's interactions with the sprites. Hopefully those spoilers are vague enough, if you haven't reached those parts yet. also, Ryoka and Erin are some of my favourite protagonists in general, so it's possible that this is just a matter of taste.
