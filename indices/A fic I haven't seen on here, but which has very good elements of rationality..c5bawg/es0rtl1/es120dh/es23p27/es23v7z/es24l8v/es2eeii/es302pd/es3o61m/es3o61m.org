I had some huge gripes with the writing as well, especially because I can't stand the narrator 'signposting' (as my professors would've called it) intentions and explanations, but the writing does get better. I still dislike many side characters and I hate how the author has shifted his focus away from what I loved recently but as a slice of life kind of story it is really soothing.

Writing the every day life of some of these characters mundane life and making it a blast is definitely pirates strongest suit. On the other hand I have frequently skipped paragraphs and more during high action chapters just because I feel there is no real flow and urgency during battles. Partly the fault lies in the world and not the writer here though, just because the concept of skills makes combat so outlandish with its video gamesque names that I find it hard to stay immersed in the action.
