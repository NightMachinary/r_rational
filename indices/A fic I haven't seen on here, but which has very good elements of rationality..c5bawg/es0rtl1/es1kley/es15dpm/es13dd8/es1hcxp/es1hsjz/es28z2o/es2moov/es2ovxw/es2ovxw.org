Hmm, I read Wondering Inn until winter spirit that attached to Ryoka died. Which book was that? Fourth? I actually like the work at early chapters. Author was trying to establish characters and world around them. Problems were simple then. From then on, the scope seems to keep expanding (as it should for fiction of this kind). And in my opinion, narrating higher stake demand higher writing skill. It also demand higher creativity. Author's skill at that time just doesn't cut it. So, if her current skill pleases you, I'm happy for you. However, I can't justify reading mountain of words just to see whether your opinion that 'later Wondering Inn chapters exceed the Mother of Learning in term of prose' also rings true to me.

This is an aside, but it might provide clarity to where I stand: I think when Ryoka being bitchy behind her Batman iPhone chat handle is the highest point of this fiction. She's approach new thing with caution. It went downhill since.
