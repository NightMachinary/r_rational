I see overwhelming favor for the work, but my personal experience says otherwise. People can assign different taste for differing opinion, and nobody should fault that, but my dislike goes deeper than that. Here's my observation with my personal opinion followed:

1. High word count makes the work lack polish. You can scroll without reading much of the text and not missing any. After some chapters (my case is after two books), you'll feel that author's skill on writing does not improve as she still need tremendous number of words to deliver idea.
2. Melodrama. You'll see similar sense repeated in multiple sentences without increasing impact. I assign it as melodrama as following sentence doesn't hit harder than earlier sentence. Just repetition. I think the author want to appeal to readers' emotion intensely, but she's lacking skill to invoke it.
3. Idiot balls (many characters's guilty of this), forgetting priority (idem), disregarding the value of communication (mostly the ant-like colony under Liscor). Stubbornness seemingly the defining trait for many characters in Wandering Inn. Some rooted in lofty ideals, which is nice. Many forget the practicality of it, which is par course and quite nice if they can learn from mistake. Sadly, learning from mistake is not equal stubbornness in this work. I have intense hate of it. Especially when some ideals are quite fatalistic. I think the author plunged to deep into the rule of drama.
4. Multi POV. You can dismiss this because it's entirely my taste: I hate multi-POV. Developing characters so that readers care for them takes time. Double the amount of time needed if they're idiots. I can only stomach multi-POV if the POV characters is highly competent AND offered a new perspective to conflict happening in the work. Given that my earlier experience that multiple characters in Wandering Inn are idiot, stubborn, (and I forgot that some of them are immensely egoist), multi-POV is really a bad thing here.

So there you go, a differing opinion on work that many seems to like it so much.
