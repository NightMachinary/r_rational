Second all this, in case anyone's still on the fence and needs more reinforcement.

I'm legitimately not trying to humble-brag or engaging in Imposter Syndrome or anything, I'm proud of my work and don't mind talking it up when appropriate, but I actually get sad that Reckoning gets less upvotes than my story. The likely culprit is that Animorphs is less popular than Pokemon, but unfamiliarity really shouldn't stop anyone from at least checking it out.

Even if I imagine it being only 70% as enjoyable without familiarity with canon, that still puts it head and shoulders above most fiction I've read, and I don't think it lowers the value of how much /simply good writing/ and /effectively communicated rationality/ there is in it. The author literally was in charge of teaching hundreds of people applied rationality for /years,/ if you care at all about getting more out of fiction than just a good story then it's seriously a must-read.
