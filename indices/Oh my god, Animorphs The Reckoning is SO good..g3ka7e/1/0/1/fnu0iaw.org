It's mostly just that you miss out on jokes/references/cool explanations for things from the original canon. For example, there's a really funny line like "what, are the bad guys gonna just put giant R's on their chests??" that would be much less funny if you hadn't seen team rocket in the OG stuff

The story itself will still make basically complete sense
