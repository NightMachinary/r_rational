I share your dislike of that aesthetic, but Animorphs never triggered that same dislike in me. I think it comes down to the fact that the characters don't "identify" with their morphs in any way (in fact a lot of the times the changes are downright traumatic) and rather use them as tools to fight the alien invasion.

The closest you can get is with one of them who gets permanently stuck in a certain form in canon, but this is again treated as something terrible that they have to learn to live with rather than some transcendent experience.
