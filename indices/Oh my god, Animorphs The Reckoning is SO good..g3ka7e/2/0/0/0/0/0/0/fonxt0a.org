Hello, I just got caught up in r!Animorphs and I wanted to tell you that I loved it! It was delightful from start to finish. Lots of cool ideas, lots of fun references to pop culture or science fiction, and lots of nostalgic memories. When the first name of the DHS guy's son was revealed, I gasped out loud. It's been years since I read an Animorphs book, but the instant I read his name, it felt like a punch in the gut and his whole story came flooding back. Thank you so much for giving such a complex series the care it deserves.
