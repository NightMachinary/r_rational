The author ([[/u/TK17Studios]]) has put a ton of effort into making all the disparate parts of the Animorphs universe more cohesive. The original series spends at least half of its run being a monster-of-the-week serial, and this results in a lot of one-off developments and plots that /almost/ work but are then dropped, never to be touched again. TK17 takes all those threads (well, the good ones) and neatly ties them all together.

If you're familiar with the Ultimate Marvel comics, the same treatment has basically been done to the backstory. Where originally all the various super heroes are basically make-it-up-as-we-go-along, in Ultimate Marvel many of the heroes are the result of people trying to recreate Captain America's super soldier serum: Hulk happens because Banner thinks he can boost the incomplete formula with gamma rays; Spider-Man and Green Goblin happens because Norman Osborne is trying tons of things to nab the same military funding, etc. It's a relatively small change to the universe, yet it takes a lot of unrelated parts and ties them all together beautifully. Animorphs: The Reckoning does this but better.

That alone makes the world more /rational/, but it's the treatment of the characters that makes the whole thing meet the higher bar of /rationalist/. The kids are all turned up to 11, and each of them has a handle on some aspect of intelligence that gives them a means to contribute without feeling same-y and while also preserving their original voice and characterization. And then of course since they've been given a lightsaber...Visser Three has been transformed from Saturday-morning-cartoon villain into a true mastermind.

Care has also been taken to alter the various alien species to be more, well /alien/. KA Applegate did a good job of inventing cool alien ideas, but for the most part is hampered by the standard sci-fi "everyone speaks English and is basically a human in a rubber suit when it comes down to it". TK17 fixes this by giving each species vastly different values from our own, and in some cases alters even the way they think, to challenge what it means for a thought or value to be universal.

As someone who maintains a tier list of the original books and who regularly reads through them all every few years...there's not really any aspect that the originals do /better/. The Reckoning makes em look like the first draft for this story.

11/10 could not recommend higher.
