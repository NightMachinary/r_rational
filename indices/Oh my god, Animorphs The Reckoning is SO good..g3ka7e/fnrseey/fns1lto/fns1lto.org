Alright, you convinced me to give it a go. Mostly I've kept away because I'm not an animorphs fan, animorphs isn't a cool power, and a general dislike of 'furry stuff'.

But you got me. I'll read some chapters and post back.

Edit: It seems to be written pretty well. I'm not sure if I'll hang on long term though, since I'm not that interested in the setting.
