[[/u/ConnorF42][u/ConnorF42]] covered it I'd say, I've been told from others who aren't familiar with pokemon that they still enjoyed it and got good stuff out of it.

You'll miss some inside jokes and be less able to appreciate some changes to the world, but the only really annoying part will be the lack of mental image that comes from a pokemon being named, since I spend minimal time describing them (there are just so many it bogged down the writing when I tried it early one).
