My org decided to move some of its planned research retreats up to now instead of later due to the coronavirus crisis, so the time I would have spent writing in Feb and March was instead spent running around doing tons of ops and logistics and support and research and stuff, and then I was burned out and wrote [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTpxkN4svJePRPGtvg9rI8OAZpYS1FFb5yIiYVz3ZbM/edit?usp=sharing][a bunch of essays from anonymous prompts]] instead of writing r!Animorphs.

But I've just this past two days been working on the next chapter, and I expect it to go up in 1-3 weeks with at least four or five updates following fairly regularly before I have to take another break.
