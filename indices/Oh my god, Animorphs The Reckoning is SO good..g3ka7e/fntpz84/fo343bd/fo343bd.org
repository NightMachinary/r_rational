I sent you a dm 3 years ago asking for updates to the story, and you've managed to hold my interest for all that time. There are not many things that have achieved the same, I usually move on with my interests pretty quickly if they don't manage to snatch me quickly, so well done.

I wonder how much of it is nostalgia. I never did manage to read the original series (mostly because I wasn't proficient with English when I read them and only the first twenty books were translated to Finnish), but the stuff you write is far more interesting to me at this point in any case. I'll make sure to give a little more feedback in the future if it's something you like receiving!
