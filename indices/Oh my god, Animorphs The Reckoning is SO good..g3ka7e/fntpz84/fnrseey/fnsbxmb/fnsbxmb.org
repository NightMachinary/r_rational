Seeing that A:tR doesn't require any canon knowledge is pushing me to read it now. I've seen good reviews about your story, but I haven't read it as I have absolutely zero Pokemon knowledge. Would you say your story requires any sort of canon knowledge, or can I jump in without knowing anything beforehand?
