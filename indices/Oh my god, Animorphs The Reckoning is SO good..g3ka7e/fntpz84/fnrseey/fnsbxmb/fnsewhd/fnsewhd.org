I have minimal Pokemon knowledge, played the first game and watched a bit of the show when it came on TV at the kid. The story is completely understandable and enjoyable so far, but it is kinda annoying to have to look up what every Pokemon looks like when they come up for first time, as I am only familiar with Gen1. I downloaded a pokedex app on my phone for it.
