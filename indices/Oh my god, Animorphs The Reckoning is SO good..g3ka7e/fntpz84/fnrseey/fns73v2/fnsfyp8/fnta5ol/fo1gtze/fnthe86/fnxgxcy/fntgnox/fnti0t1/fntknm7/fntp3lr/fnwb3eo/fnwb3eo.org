When you put it like that, I'm reminded specifically of that book with The Inspector. It's more interesting to see that chapter as abridging that one with Book 2.

Also, not remembering if you've mentioned it or not, but somehow I doubt The Inspector is appearing in this fic. Though I find his biology and character less perplexing than the confusing implications about the Yeerk hierarchy. Also being a monster of the week that was never mentioned before or after. Did someone give a disabled Andalite coffee, and decided it would be funny to offer their Yeerk a seat on the Counsil if they could keep it up for a week?

Is it too late to add Ax/Helium / the Visser on caffeine?
