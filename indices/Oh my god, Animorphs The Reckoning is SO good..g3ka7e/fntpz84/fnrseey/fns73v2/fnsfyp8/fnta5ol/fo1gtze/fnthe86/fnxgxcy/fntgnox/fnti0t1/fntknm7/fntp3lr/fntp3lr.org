In part, this was because the canon Rachel would not have lasted within the rationalist Animorphs universe; I needed her to make a very bad mistake and learn the lesson very, very hard, as early as possible, sort of leapfrogging over what was 20 or 30 books of character development in the original series.

There are not a lot of other mistakes like that.
