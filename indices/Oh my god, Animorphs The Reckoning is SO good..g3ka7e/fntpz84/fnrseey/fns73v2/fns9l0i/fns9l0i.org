I watched that lecture, too, and I've read about 10 chapters.

Things seem to move quicker than they did in the books, there's a lot of discussion about details of the mechanics of the setting/more munchkinning than is mentioned in the books, visser 3 is smarter, and the whole thing is more 'mature' in the sense that it's not written for kids (I presume the language in the original books is a lot simpler)- the characters imply a lot of things with few words in a way I'd doubt would show up in a kid's book. It's actually slightly unlikely to hear (13 year old?) kids speak this way- not impossible, just seems unlikely that a whole group of kids would be this smart- but it works for me.

It seems darker than the original, too.
