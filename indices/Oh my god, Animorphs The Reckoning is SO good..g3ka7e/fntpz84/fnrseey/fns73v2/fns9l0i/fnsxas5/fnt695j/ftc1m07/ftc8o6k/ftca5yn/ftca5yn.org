The Forgotten being released on 9/1/1997 makes me understand why it was the first book I started with.

I went to the bookstore on my 8th birthday with my aunt later that month. She let me pick out a book for my present, and I liked The Forgotten because I thought the guy on the cover was turning into a cheetah, which was (at the time) my favorite animal ('coz they're fast).

Goofy book, but I spent the next 4 years hunting down books in libraries, used-book sales, and occasionally scrounging up enough cash as a preteen to buy the latest release. Thanks for the trip down memory lane.
