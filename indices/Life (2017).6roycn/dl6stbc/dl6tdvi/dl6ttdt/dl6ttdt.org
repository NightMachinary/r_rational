Yeah, I know what you mean. I had huge expectations for Life and it starts rather well, but as soon as Ryan Reynolds goes into the lab to try and save the idiot scientist the movie goes into a downward spiral. The characters are completely irrational and unprofessional and the ISS seems to be designed to make quarantine as difficult as possible. Also I hated that the alien gets a face after it evolves enough, making it so different form what the usual monster designs was one of the only creepy things in the movie.

Make sure to come back with your opinion about Alien! I think it'll surprise you with just /how/ dumb it gets.
