Okay, I get what you mean. There's like, three scenes where someone goes: "Do the thing!" "We can't do the thing, we will literally die!" "Do the thing anyway!"

And on top of that, the stand in captain is a weenie who apologizes for things he shouldn't. Checking out the planet is a no-risk scenario up front, a week out of the way on a 7 year trip. Then, the girl who was hanging out on the lander starts freaking out for, at the time, no apparent reason, and blows up the lander by firing wildly in every direction, and why do they even have guns on a colony ship in the first place? And again, their final plan is pointlessly convoluted, they can lock the thing into any compartment with their sensibly blastdoored ship, and instead they lure it into a complicated trap?

It didn't seem to trip too many switches though; most of the problems could be chalked up to being an action/horror movie where we expect them to be kind of dumb. It could have been Cabin in the Woods, but I dunno if I'd call it unusually egregious for its genre.
