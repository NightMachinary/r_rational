I wouldn't mind it so much in an Alien movie; I'm not expecting that to be anything clever. But Life looked like it was trying to be something sort of thought provoking an intellectual (I mean just look at that pretentious title), and so finding it to be... not that, made me pretty pissed... I actually had that movie on my list, thanks for reminding me.
