How can I become aware of the cognitive biases I have (e.g. if I'd be someone who'd do something stupid like killing someone with electricity [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment][because someone told me to]]) so I can work on correcting them? Is just reading about that sort of stuff in the sequences the best way?
