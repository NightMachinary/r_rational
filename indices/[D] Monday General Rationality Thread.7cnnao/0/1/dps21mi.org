can you find somewhere more spacious to spread the papers out? when I had to alphabetize exams I'd usually just do an insertion sort, but that was with far fewer than 500.

If the papers are 8.5" x 11", why not separate them into 50 (or 51 lol) piles according to their leading 2 digits and then sort each pile? That would require what, like 7' by 7' or so? Assuming they actually are numbered 001-500.
