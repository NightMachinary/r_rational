It sounds like instead of acting like you violated a social rule your mother was trying to protect you against the possible negative ramifications of discussing your salary, which you very quickly directly experienced.

By the way, your boss may have been stern, but he wasn't polite. There's not much polite about asking you to be deliberately complicit in covering for unfair workplace practices, with the possibility of negative consequences for you if you don't comply. In the grand scheme of things that is actually rather rude.
