  The problem is with class and class distinctions. We speak of upper-middle-lower classes because it's easy and convenient for the sake of demographics. Without ignoring the fact that people who have more money live differently than those who have little money, we can do away with that language.

We're definitely using class in very different ways here. Socialist usage tends to be:

- Aristocracy: people who make their living from, well, state-enforced titles of nobility, usually land ownership. Essentially, you pay taxes so the aristocrats can take them and spend them on themselves.

- Rentiers: people who own stuff and charge for its usage, but never actually /sell/ it, thus ensuring themselves a permanent income stream. Usually landowners, sometimes other natural resources.

- Bourgeoisie/"owning class": People who own the means of production, eg: machines, land, and natural resources, but whom are /not/ paid out of state revenues /nor/ can send in armies to just /take/ wealth for themselves. They have to "earn it" through a market, but they're also the best positioned /in/ the market, /by default/, without needing any particular merit.

- Proletariat/"working class": People who sell their labor to live, while existing within a legally-codified formal economy. Can contain all kinds of smaller "castes" like professionals, unionized blue-collar workers (the "image" of the working class), and the "precariat" (people who put multiple jobs together to make a living, but still exist in the formal economy).

- Lumpenproletariat/"informal working class": People who sell labor or perform illegal acts to live. Exist largely outside the formal economy. Drug dealers, thieves, mafia laborers, prostitutes, email scammers, etc.

These classes are very real in terms of what assets and what work they use to generate what kind of value within what legal constraints. Those are their defining features: what do you do, within what laws, for whom, with what.

  The important fact to remember is that heritage is not destiny. "Class mobility" is real, something that blurs and removes class boundaries.

Well of course. You can start out professional and wind up bourgeois, like any typical tech startup founder. Other cases exist, blah blah blah. For instance, the "magic money tree" of Anglo economies used to be housing wealth: you started out a moderately-paid middle-class prole, you bought a house, its price rose, and over time you became more and more an asset investor or land rentier.

(This is why the Bay Area /sucks/, btw.)

  Consider class struggles from someone at the bottom. A minimum wage worker (or, heaven forbid, unemployed) wants a top paying job. If he succeeds, he isn't taking that job from someone else. He gets in in addition to everyone else. This may seem counter-intuitive when looking at a job market.

Yes, we all understand. Nobody actually hires you to generate net-negative value. Not all transactions maximize expected profit, but over time, bankruptcy drives out those which do not at least satisfice on expected profit. Gains from division of labor are very real.

  Did I say earlier that there's no real distinction between the classes? I lied. The people at the bottom? They are there for a reason. Most of them, anyways. The reason isn't that they are poor, it is the reason they are poor. Confusing the two means mixing up cause and effect. In a very real sense, heritage is destiny -- but it is not a heritage of money. The children of the rich do not end up rich because they inherit wealth, but because they inherit the knowledge of how to become wealthy for themselves.

This is the part that basically amounts to a romantic apologia for the supposed meritocracy of a deeply unmeritocratic system.

The bourgeoisie are defined by what they /own/, not by what they generate. So for instance, Donald Trump (oh lovely, right?) /is/ bourgeois. Really. Sure, his business ventures are all massive failures when they're not flagrant money-laundering schemes. Sure, as far as we know, he's near-constantly in the hole. Sure, he's a walking example of how to have a rich person's lifestyle while never contributing to society in any but the most minimal ways.

/But he still owns the means of production./ He still pays /other people/ to work /for him/, rather than requiring a wage or salary himself.

He's a completely incompetent, unmeritorious piece of shit whose very existence defames capitalism -- but he's still bourgeois!

Now, if I could only find it, the paper I'd like to link you to had an important finding. [[http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/2017/06/19/counterintuitive-problem-everyone-room-keeps-giving-dollars-random-others-youll-never-guess-happens-next/][Oh well, this is similar.]] You start out however many agents you please with however many dollars each you please, and start flipping coins to determine who profits off randomized transactions (eg: random agents interact). We can model the "profits" as talking about the financialized expression of differing subjective prices.

The result ends up being an increasingly unequal, concentrated, non-competitive "marketplace" -- a degradation into financialized feudalism. The only known remedies were to re-randomize, forcibly redistribute downward, and/or "break up" the richest parties into much smaller actors.

Note that this was just a model of agents stochastically interacting. The inequality doesn't come from some difference of merit in this model. It just comes from the sheer /math/ of some stochastic systems having rich-get-richer laws. The big insight gained was: once /any/ inequality begins to show up, even by random chance, these systems of transactions would exacerbate it. The only agents "safe" were those who could mostly get into transactions where no significant fraction of their existing wealth was at stake.

I hope you see the point here. I may be a heterodox socialist, but I am a socialist, because I view economic inequality not only as degrading the standard of living of the masses, not only as undemocratic, not only as morally dystopic, but as something like entropy that needs to be /actively held off/. There will probably be some form of inequality under socialism, too! Socialists tend to fall into every trap that a "whuffie"-type mechanism would produce, as do democratic votes. That is still better than a system in which inequality occurs by stochastic mathematical necessity, and people begin rationalizing it as the relative superiority or inferiority of different people's contributions to society.

You don't apologize for the Second Law of Thermodynamics, so don't apologize for this either.
