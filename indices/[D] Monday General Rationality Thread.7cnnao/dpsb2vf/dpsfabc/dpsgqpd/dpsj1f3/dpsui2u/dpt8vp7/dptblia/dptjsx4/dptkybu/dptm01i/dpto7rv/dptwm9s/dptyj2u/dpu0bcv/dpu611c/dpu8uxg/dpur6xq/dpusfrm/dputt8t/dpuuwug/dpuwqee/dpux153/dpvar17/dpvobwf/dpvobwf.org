The operation of the clause /has/ changed substantially:

- From 1901 to 1948, all Australians were "Australian British subjects", and no solely British subject was considered a person "who is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen of a foreign power" because of it (even if born in eg. NZ or India)
- From 1948 to 1992, Australian citizenship was exclusive - at the citizenship ceremony migrants would hand in their old passport, and were considered solely Australian.
- In 1992 dual-citizenship became possible, and the same year(!!) we had a High Court case about it. In order to prevent the operation of foreign law /irremediably/ preventing an Australian citizen from standing for election, the High Court ruled that dual citizens could be eligible if they took "all reasonable steps" - meaning you are not required to eg. visit Syria in person having left as a refugee - and disqualified the person in question.

So some parties have been ignoring it entirely (government, independents, far right), others taking "all reasonable steps" as allowing dual citizens who are in the process of renouncing (opposition; unlikely to fly in the HC - it's not unreasonable to allow a few more weeks for bureaucracy), or accecpting the plain meaning and resigning (Greens).

But nonetheless, I agree with you entirely - if they thought the rules should be different, take it to a referendum and change the constitution!
