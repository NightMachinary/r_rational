You're getting one personal-level reply that engages, and one mod reply. Both will use direct quotations.

  Inequality is not a problem to be solved. It is a feature of dynamic systems. It is an inescapable attribute of existence.
#+end_quote

There can be more or less of things, and we can control whether there's more or less, depending on what's desirable to us as human beings. We killed smallpox, we can minimize inequality -- if it's good for us. Which, IMHO, it is, and keep in mind that no less than the International Monetary Fund have called for economic inequality to be significantly reduced to boost growth.

  You want a meritocratic system? Your system would take from those who merit most.
#+end_quote

Only by a tautological definition of "merit" under which the fastest-moving particle in a heat bath is deemed to have Done Something Right. You are /yelling/ at me that economic inequality is an inescapable fact deriving from Pareto's Law, and yet you also claim that it /is congruent to human merit/. That's bunk. Humans are not particles in a heat-bath, and any evaluation of humans that throws away all the distinctly /human/ features to evaluate only on "relative position within heat-bath" is /humanly/ wrong.

  You want an egalitarian system? You would do it by theft.
#+end_quote

You know as well as I do that states are what create and enforce property statutes /in the first place/, so again, you're starting from a rather tautological definition of "theft" as "deviation from my desired socioeconomic order". Well sure, deviation from your desired socioeconomic order /does/ deviate from your desired socioeconomic order. Things that aren't anarcho-capitalism, /are not anarcho-capitalism!/

But this isn't any kind of moral argument to someone who, well, doesn't axiomatically accept anarcho-capitalism as a deontically binding optimal human system, and the whole case for that is radically undermined by /your own claim/ that the distribution of outcomes, from a consequentialist viewpoint, is /indistinguishable from a heat-bath/.

  You want to sort people by their natural inborn abilities? You get eugenics.
#+end_quote

I've always supported genofixing, dude.

#+begin_quote
  I said before, Pareto's law is a mathematical observation. You provided the proof yourself. If it doesn't appear, something is very wrong with the world.
#+end_quote

It's a mathematical observation about /certain kinds of stochastic systems/, with have their own specific dynamics, which are not being controlled from the outside. We could just /not have those dynamics in the first place/, should that prove morally superior. Turning to these dynamics and shouting, "These are the supreme mathematical dynamics and /THEY! SHALL! HOLD!/"... really comes across as kinda paper-clippy. It's not really a justification that touches on why any of this should be desirable to human beings.
