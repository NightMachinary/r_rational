  It's not an excuse, but Australia just voted >60% for marriage equality, and now all the right-wing Christians in parliament are trying to write exemptions to discrimination law into the legislation. And unironically talking about how we need to protect the rights and freedoms of minorities (ie, of old white hetro men, to discriminate). The parties have been great, but the context kinda sucks.
