  Today, my boss told me that he knew I had been telling coworkers my salary and politely, yet sternly, stated that I should change the subject whenever someone brings it up so he doesn't have to explain to them why I get paid more than them even though they've worked here longer.

Well, /yeah/. Your boss is telling you not to do things that put /him/ at a disadvantage. Such is capitalism, welcome to it, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28-fC6_Byu0][would you like to hear about the alternatives?]]

  The reason I'm paid more is because my education makes me eligible for a position I will eventually be trained for, but right now I'm working the assembly line with the other blue collar laborers. I was really nervous during the meeting and now I'm worried about what I should do.

Shut the hell up, and then quietly unionize with the other blue-collar laborers. "Will eventually be trained for" is an excuse: your boss is paying you more right now, which means he probably makes enough profit off you /right now/ to be paying the other guys more. Fight with them.
