Well, I don't treat my salary as a signifier of my status in the workplace and I don't see why anyone I'm friends with would hold it against me when I don't decide how much I get paid. I'm autistic and don't understand social norms, so I tell everyone I meet to be brutally honest with me so misunderstandings can be avoided and mistakes can be rectified. I never told my salary to anyone who didn't ask me first and they never called me out for being rude.
