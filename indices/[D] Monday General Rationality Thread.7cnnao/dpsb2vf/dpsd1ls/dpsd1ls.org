People get upset about this topic because it's an /egalitarian/ social more. For example, my D&D group has in the past had jobs ranging from "part-time cashier" to "high level defense industry IT consultant". Flat out comparing salaries would have seemed /horribly/ douchey. Now, that's a social group, rather than a collection of employees, but there's a similar dynamic at play. When you tell the "blue collar laborers" that you make more than them in spite of being less qualified for the actual job you're actually doing, it's going to come off as offensively pretentious and unfair. What, they have to wipe your ass while you learn the job and you get paid more anyway because you're just magically /superior/? Even aside from potential discontent with the boss, you're inviting discontent with /you/, which adds an extra burden to the boss, because they're the one that has to deal with the hit to morale.

The American refusal to discuss pay may make salary and wage negotiations more favorable to employers, but it also serves to remove salary and wage from workplace social status games. You've just forced that element back into the game, and implicitly claimed a high status position.

As for what to do about it... find a new job? The only real alternative is to /rock the shit/ out of your current position such that if/when you do get promoted up to your level of education, the response from the "lowly" blue collar people is "Yeah, alright, that makes sense." A high level of empathy for your coworkers would help, but you'd need to avoid coming off as pretentious like the plague.
