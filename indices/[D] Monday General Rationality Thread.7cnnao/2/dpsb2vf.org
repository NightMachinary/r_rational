Before I got my job, I had seen the [[https://youtu.be/7xH7eGFuSYI][Adam Ruins Everything]] about how the taboo against discussing salary gives employers an unfair advantage in negotiations, so I had no inhibitions against sharing how much money I make with whoever asked.

When my Mom found this out, she chewed me out in one of the few heated arguments we've *ever* had. She acted as if I'd violated some sacred social rule and when I rejected her justifications for it as irrational, she continued to insist it was “just a thing you don't do”, which I've never heard from her.

Today, my boss told me that he knew I had been telling coworkers my salary and politely, yet sternly, stated that I should change the subject whenever someone brings it up so he doesn't have to explain to them why I get paid more than them even though they've worked here longer.

The reason I'm paid more is because my education makes me eligible for a position I will eventually be trained for, but right now I'm working the assembly line with the other blue collar laborers. I was really nervous during the meeting and now I'm worried about what I should do.
