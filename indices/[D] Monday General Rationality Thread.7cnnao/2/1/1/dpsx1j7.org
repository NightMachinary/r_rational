That was something I considered, but it looks like the majority of employees here come from a temp agency the company contracts out to so the situation might not be so straightforward. I'm an exception because I got a referral from one of the engineers who happened to be in my graduating class, so my salary was negotiated individually. I did mention this to the coworkers I spoke to, but I still got a lecture from the boss.
