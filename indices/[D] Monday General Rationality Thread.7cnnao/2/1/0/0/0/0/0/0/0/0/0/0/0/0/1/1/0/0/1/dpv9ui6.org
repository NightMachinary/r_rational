  talking about how we need to protect the rights and freedoms of minorities

I don't know the particulars, but if this were in the States, I would guess this means religious freedoms. We have situations here where individuals are being crushed by the government for not celebrating gay marriage even though they find it morally abhorrent. Take the case of the baker who doesn't want to make a gay wedding cake. I don't care how you feel about the marriage issue, making someone do something they don't want to is just wrong, and they deserve legal protections. It /shouldn't/ need to be written into the law, but sometimes it needs to be just to be clear.
