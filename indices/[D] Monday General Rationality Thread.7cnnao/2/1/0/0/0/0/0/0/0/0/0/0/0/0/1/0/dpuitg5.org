I think that this is a continued pattern of behavior from this user, not to the level of flagrancy that I would necessarily consider ban-worthy, but which still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It's things [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7a0suv/eliezer_yudkowsky_is_writing_a_new_book/dp7fj1d/?context=3][like this]]:

  ... right! Because computers don't need anything to run. They can be made arbitrarily small, run arbitrarily fast, give off no waste heat, and don't require electricity. Let's see... use the waste heat to power a small steam generator, and use the electricity from that to power the computer! Genius!

  In case I wasn't clear enough, I'm mocking you.

These are mean-spirited snark and would be prime examples if I wanted to point out how not engage in productive discourse. Sometimes people or conversations get heated, and I can empathize with that, but there's disutility in keeping around someone who has shown a pattern of starting (or escalating) pointless negativity, or an inability to express their frustrations or points of anger without dipping into insults or attacks, whether they're hyperbolic or not.

/That said,/ it's not like he's just a dick all the time for no reason, and I think being a contributing member of the commentariat earns you at least a little bit of slack, so long as this doesn't turn into a repetitive cycle of bad behavior (which I think it's approaching).
