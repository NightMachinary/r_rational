[[/u/PeridexisErrant]], [[/u/alexanderwales]], could you guys take an unbiased look at this?

  You piece of crap. You stain on humanity. You ignorant moron!

We have rules about moderator discretion for being pleasant and on-topic. I'd definitely call this the kind of highly unpleasant personal attack that warrants moderator intervention. Unfortunately, I'm a mod, so I have to summon the other mods instead of just removing your comment, slapping you on the wrist and calling it a day.

#+begin_quote
  You repulse me.
#+end_quote

Again, yikes.

  If you try to get rid of it, I will try to get rid of you.

Unrealistic rhetorical threats are fine, I guess, but it's still a personal attack.

Other mods, opinion? We don't have an official scale of offenses or punishments, but I'd call this solid grounds for a comment removal. If [[/u/ben_oni]] goes on from there without problem, no need for a ban, but if he's gonna turn this into EXTERMINATE THE ENEMIES OF +HUMANITY+INEQUALITY, it might be time for a temp-ban. But that really requires he double-down on the personal attacks first, IMHO.
