    This is socialist language that doesn't relate to reality.

  At least from our point of view, it certainly draws a map. If you want to say it's an inaccurate map, sure, but at least point out how these pens, so to speak, are incapable of drawing an accurate map.

The problem is with /class/ and /class distinctions/. We speak of upper-middle-lower classes because it's easy and convenient for the sake of demographics. Without ignoring the fact that people who have more money live differently than those who have little money, we can do away with that language.

See, there is no distinction of classes (at least in America; other countries are not so egalitarian, I know). You can't say that a particular thing is true of people who have so much money but not of people who have less (except the amount of money they have). It's an arbitrary division. There is no nobility, or bourgeois (there is, I know; bear with me). The important fact to remember is that heritage is not destiny. "Class mobility" is real, something that blurs and removes class boundaries.

Take a look at [[https://www.learnvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-shot-2012-07-16-at-11.25.22-AM.png][this chart]]. I'm not sure where the numbers on this one come from, but you can find something similar all over the web. See that bottom quintile? 43% are "stuck" at the bottom? That means 57% got out, meaning they did better than their parents. You see that top quintile, with 40% of children remaining? 60% didn't do so well, meaning they did worse than their parents. To sum that up: It's easier to climb up from the bottom than to stay at the top. I've heard a lot about "the 1%" the last few years. I want to take these people and make them understand that /they/ can be the 4%. That's the 4% from the bottom quintile that end up in the highest quintile.

Enough about class mobility. Class warfare. This conjures the image of the great economic pie, each section of society trying to claim a portion for themselves, battling for more and more. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle][Yes, the rich have the most pie.]] The 80/20 rule doesn't exist because of class distributions, or class warfare. It's fundamental mathematics, and if it stops being true, things are very wrong in the world. (As an aside, I'll note that it's not always 80/20. I once had the data to check a particular distribution, and found it was 70/30. Upon verifying the math, I found 70/30 was in fact the expected result.)

Consider class struggles from someone at the bottom. A minimum wage worker (or, heaven forbid, unemployed) wants a top paying job. If he succeeds, he isn't taking that job from someone else. He gets in /in addition/ to everyone else. This may seem counter-intuitive when looking at a job market. You see a good job that matches your qualifications. You submit your resume, interview, and hope to get the position. 99 other people also applied, but only one of you will get the job. So if you get it, that means someone else didn't. But wait, it's more complicated than that. Perhaps you do the job well. Deadlines are met, sales are made, earnings projections are up. More profit means expansion and more positions open up. More of the applicants in the job market get hired. Alternatively, perhaps the company was on the verge of collapse. You try your best, but management screwed up, and sales are tanking, investors are fleeing, and layoffs are coming. You're most junior, so you go first. Nobody from the applicant pool ends up better off than before.

Did I say earlier that there's no real distinction between the classes? I lied. The people at the bottom? They are there for a reason. Most of them, anyways. The reason isn't that they are poor, it is the reason they are poor. Confusing the two means mixing up cause and effect. In a very real sense, heritage /is/ destiny -- but it is not a heritage of money. The children of the rich do not end up rich because they inherit wealth, but because they inherit the knowledge of how to become wealthy for themselves. That's what makes them the bourgeois.
