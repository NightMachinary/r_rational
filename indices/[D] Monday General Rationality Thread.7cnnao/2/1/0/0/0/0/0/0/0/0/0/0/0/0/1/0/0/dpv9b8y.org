I appreciate the slack, and thank you pointing out the pattern. I have little patience for (what I believe to be) stupidity. I'll try to keep the... mean-spirted-ness... in check. That said, I'll probably continue to direct snark toward LessWrong, as it is such a uniquely worthy target (and a group rather than an individual).
