On the upside, our ongoing constitutional crisis* is entirely peaceful and about the worst outcome imaginable is we go to an early election (or choke on the popcorn!). In short: our constitution makes any dual citizen ineligible to sit in parliament (unless you take "all reasonable steps" and can't renounce, so eg being born in Iran isn't a permanent bar). Abreviated timeline:

- One Greens Senator discovers he is a dual citizen and immediately resigns. Another Green follows a few days later. The Murdoch press, among others, has a field day (and rightly so)
- Two government ministers are also dual citizens. One resigns from cabinet but both remain in parliament - the Attorney General and PM are "sure" the High Court will say they're OK. (pro tip: don't declare how the court will rule, they hate that)
- So is the Deputy PM. Likewise remains in parliament. So, it turns out, are two of his colleagues in the "Nationals" party (conservativeish rural protectionists).
- So is a member of the far-right party "One Nation"; he's completely deluded.
- So is a populist independent.
- The High Court, having been stacked for decades with black-letter judges, issues a brutally direct set of findings. If you are a dual citizen or were at the date of nomination, you are /gone/. 5/7 are out.

This whole time, everyone has been assuring everyone else that there's no need to worry, everyone in $MY_PARTY is in the clear. Then...

- The /president of the Senate/ (government party; independent by convention) is a dual citizen. Some cabinet ministers knew. Some claim they didn't. The PM might have known, or more likely it was kept from him. Unclear what the AG knew or when. The Senator resigns, and nobody can quite believe the gall.
- Calls for an independent audit of all parliamentarians are resisted by most; strongly supported by the Greens.
- Another government Senator is a dual citizen. Resigns.
- /Another/ independent Senator is a dual citizen.
- Two opposition members were dual citizens at the nomination date, but in the process of renouncing. Government insists they resign. Opposition insists they're OK. (High Court is pretty clear; they're almost certainly inelegible)
- With the support of the Greens, anyone could refer anyone else to the High Court, but that's mutually assured destruction. Watching everyone talk tough while agreeing not to do the right thing to protect themselves is a complete farce.

So we have a government with a minority in both houses, an opposition that (like the government) could lose the numbers any day now, ongoing chaos and questions about an audit and the timing of byelections, and a reactionary rump that might be willing to blow it up to delay marriage equality.

On the other hand, peaceful transfer of power is guaranteed and we don't have the CIA conspiring with the Queen of England against us - unlike last time! (and no, not joking about that)
