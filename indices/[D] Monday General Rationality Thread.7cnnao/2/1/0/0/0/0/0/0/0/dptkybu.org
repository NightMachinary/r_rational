  Are you familiar with the collapse of the american automobile industry? It's a fascinating story.

I thought that was caused by a refusal to install technological, engineering, and quality upgrades to compete with the Japanese imports, which then got "taken out" on the unions.

I of course agree that unions aren't a global optimum of worker-representation. Codetermination and cooperative firms work a lot better, but they're harder to create from today's position of extreme class power on behalf of capital and purely confrontational class relations.

Today's class relations are an "inadequacy" in Eliezer's sense.
