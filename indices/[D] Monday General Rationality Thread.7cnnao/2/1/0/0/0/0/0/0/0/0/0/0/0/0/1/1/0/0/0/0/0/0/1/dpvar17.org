The nice thing about writing down rules is that anyone can read them and know whether they're following them or not. If the meaning of the rules isn't known until a court says something, then what was the point of writing them down in the first place? Hence, originalism.

Being an originalist myself, I have short shrift for anyone who wants to reinterpret the stated rules. /Especially/ when it's to achieve their preferred (zero-sum) outcome.
