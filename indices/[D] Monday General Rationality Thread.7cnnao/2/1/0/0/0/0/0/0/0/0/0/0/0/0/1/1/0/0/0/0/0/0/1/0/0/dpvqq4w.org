Well, we all hate politicians, so it's nice to see them get what they've got coming. It's not a very rational hatred, of course, since there doesn't seem to be a reasonable alternative (at least for now). Here in the States we're trying this experiment where we put a non-politician in charge -- it's not going so well.
