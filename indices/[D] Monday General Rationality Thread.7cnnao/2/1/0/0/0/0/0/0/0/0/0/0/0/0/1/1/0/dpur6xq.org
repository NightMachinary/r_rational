  Threatening personal violence would usually be a perma-ban; that's a site-wide rule as well as [[/r/rational]]. [[/u/eaturbrainz]] doesn't mind so much though, so take a day off and please keep to polite discussion of the topic in future.

IMHO, there was no /real/ threat, no "I'm gonna dox you and come to your house". Rude, but not actually violent.
