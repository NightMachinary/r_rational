  I'm autistic and don't understand social norms, so I tell everyone I meet to be brutally honest with me so misunderstandings can be avoided and mistakes can be rectified.

I'm /not/ autistic, but I am very blunt and literal minded, and in my experience this literally never works. It flies in the face of a lifetime of conditioning for social/white lies. I think most people interpret it as some kind of signalling.

If you're just answering honestly when people ask you, then my concerns in the previous post are greatly lessened. Much lower chance of a social backlash against you. In this scenario, you're biggest worry is probably that your boss will decide you're socially retarded in a career-limiting way. If your eventual position is more technical than leadership, this may not be much of a concern. In that case I'd advise telling your boss, regarding the request to avoid the topic, something like "Well, I'll try, and I can avoid bringing it up, but I'm not really comfortable lying to people."
