You could work your way through the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases][list of cognitive biases]].

As you're reading through the list, it would probably be a good idea to consider times in your life when you've demonstrated the bias you're reading about, or read about examples of people who demonstrated that bias if you haven't yet had the opportunity. That will help you recognize your own biases when they appear in similar circumstances in the future. It might also help to consider how you would recognize and avoid that bias in any circumstances which are likely to come up in your life.
