I've tried watching the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM3rTU927io&list=PL8626D1DED5B1C405][free lectures]] at Yale. The professor is good at using examples and making the students play games to better understand the concepts. Trying watching at a faster speed if it starts slogging along. Hope this helps!
