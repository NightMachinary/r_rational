One thing that I've been really curious about with when it comes to this sub and the assorted mentality is the sort of irrational insensitivity to difference.

Which is to say: I think so many "munchkin" plans aren't actually rational cause they don't account for the way the world is. A basic example would be setting up an intercontinental shipping company if you can open portals. Seems pretty standard and sensible right? Right. Except not really, not in this world as it exists. There's just no way you walk into the government building and get permits, for obvious reasons. You're a worldwide celebrity now, not a businessman.

I think people almost never factor in how disruptive the things they're munchkining are and how the world would react in the short term. Possibly because it's essentially impossible to tell. Predicting non-fantasy geopolitics is hard enough.

Does anyone ever get this sense or is it seen as a cost of doing business when you munchkin in thought experiments.
