  Even step #1 has a crazy amount of issues attached, as if a foreigner can easily wander around a third world country, offering money to anyone willing to say a phrase

To be fair, as someone from a third world country that tries to bring in tourists and cater to them...that's definitely the easiest part :P

That said...yeah. It's actually hard to explain what to do with superpowers because they're sort of a singularity; everything after them changes imo, especially if they're public. It's why so many stories start a while after they showed up, cause it's hard to predict how things would change in the short term.

But that still doesn't excuse some of the more optimistic "rational" munchkins.
