Ah, I should mention that in this setup, when you give away your breath, there are /noticeable/ effects (colors appear duller, capacity for happiness is decreased, etc). So I was just put off by the idea that you could get /thousands/ of people to give you their breath without facing some major blowback.

But fair point, maybe it would be possible (unlike some of the later points).
