I recently read this interesting article on ancient methods of multiplication of large numbers: [[https://mathwithicecream.tumblr.com/post/167402359658/ancient-egyptian-multiplication][(link)]]. The idea of doubling one side and halving the others, then adding back the remainder at the end when you accidentally generated a remainder with the halving, is pretty clever. This, along with [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/parents-corner-polish-han/][Polish Hand Math]] is the kind of math thing that's pretty interesting to learn. Taking principles of mathematics and using them to generate a tool that operates on those principles and so can be used for calculation, is fun. In a more modern format, we see mechanical analog computers like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule#Basic_concepts][Slide Ruler]]. Cool stuff!
