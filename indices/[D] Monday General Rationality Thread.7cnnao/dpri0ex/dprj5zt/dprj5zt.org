  Temporarily Fireproofing Houses
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure it would take me well over an hour to pull and stake down any kind of cover over my house, even assuming it hasn't degraded in storage.

And I'd get better fireproofing by building my house to Sydney standards in the first place (double walled brick construction, fireproof tile roof, etc).

The most common and occasionally effective /temporary/ fireproofing is just soaking your house in water.
