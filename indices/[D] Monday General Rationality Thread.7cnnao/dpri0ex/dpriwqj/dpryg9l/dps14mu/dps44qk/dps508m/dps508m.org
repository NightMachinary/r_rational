  This is just so patently false I don't even know what to think. Even if you assume that they invariably end up with urine crystals, a year of living happily before being put down due to urine crystals vs being put down right away... it boggles the mind.

Haha and yet I feel the proposition "well, if any problems do present themselves (which I imagine you're certain they inevitably will), I'll just get the cat euthanized! and then get a new one! the cat gets a few happy years it otherwise wouldn't have, everybody wins!" wouldn't be well received!

Our dog's an Italian Greyhound, [[https://i.imgur.com/lVpWyZT.jpg][actually]]. Didn't know the bigger versions had to be muzzled anywhere, though! Maybe I'll reexamine the veg*n dog food issue with him sometime, if not as a complete replacement then in a "reducetarian" approach to cut his existing food with. Another difficulty with him is he's a bit of a picky eater and is missing a few teeth, and so we've only with some mild difficulty found a food combination that will let him keep weight on (the vet's given him a 4/9 breed-specific BCS).
