As a regular reader of [[/r/vegan]], the cat food threads there are insane. People act as though it's completely different for a cat to eat meat than for a human to eat meat because ~OBLIGATE CARNIVORES~ like you were saying. I think vegans are so terrified of people thinking they are cat-murderers that they don't think rationally about this. I remember posting in [[/r/vegan]] saying "meat is not some magic substance, it is made of atoms like anything else. There's no reason we can't make vegan cat food that meets all their nutrient requirements even if that requires making lab meat".

I guess, putting my nutrition student hat on, we probably don't know every single vitamin, amino acid, or fatty acid a cat would need to live a long and comfortable life. So there's a risk that Vegan Cat Soylent is missing some essential item in cat physiology that we don't know about because it's ubiquitous in meat but we don't think to add it to the vegan cat food because we don't know it's essential /for cats/ because humans can synthesise it (like we can synthesise taurine but cats can't). But that's just speculation and anecdotally there are cats that do /fine/ on a vegan diet, but it could be a long-term deficiency thing, or a "increase cancer risk" thing. Who knows....

At the end of the day it looks like the main issue with vegan cat food - apart from the lack of long-term studies - is that it seems to alter urine pH and cause urine crystals to form which results in kidney infection. I'm not sure why every brand of vegan cat food doesn't just contain some pH balancer to avoid this, but I'm guessing there's a more in-depth reason.

We've got a dog and we feed her a AAFCO approved vegan food. It's much more expensive than cheap dog food but about on par with premium dog food, though I have no illusions that it's probably nutritionally closer to the cheap stuff.

The way I look at it personally is a pet eating meat based food would be "responsible" for a few animal deaths (then again, the argument about meat byproducts not contributing much to demand means you could get a cheap mostly-grain-based food?), so even if our dog's diet means that she will die a year earlier than she would have otherwise, from a utilitarian point of view it's better to sacrifice one year of a dog's life than it is to kill a bunch of animals to feed it for 8 years. Plus if you're dealing with rescue dogs, having your dog die sooner (humanely of course) means you can rescue a new dog a year earlier than you would have otherwise. Just to be a bit morbid.
