  I remember posting in [[/r/vegan]] saying "meat is not some magic substance, it is made of atoms like anything else. There's no reason we can't make vegan cat food that meets all their nutrient requirements even if that requires making lab meat".

Now trending on [[/r/science]]: new study suggests that cats literally subsist on murder, and do not, in fact, need to eat meat so long as something dies in their vicinity.

(Actually, that's be solvable too, depending on how the death needs to happen. Just take your cat on regular trips to the hospital.)

  even if our dog's diet means that she will die a year earlier than she would have otherwise, from a utilitarian point of view it's better to sacrifice one year of a dog's life than it is to kill a bunch of animals to feed it for 8 years. Plus if you're dealing with rescue dogs, having your dog die sooner (humanely of course) means you can rescue a new dog a year earlier than you would have otherwise. Just to be a bit morbid.

I love arguments that sound totally off-the-wall and yet...make total sense when you stop to think about them.
