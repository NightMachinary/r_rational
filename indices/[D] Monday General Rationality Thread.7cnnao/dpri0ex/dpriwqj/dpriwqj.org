*Veg*n Cat Food*

Does anyone know of any good, recent sources for why cats can't be healthy on veg*n diets? Briefly googling around most of the links I'm seeing are either "I fed my cat GMO-free rainbow farts and organic pixie dust and it lived, laughed, and loved to the ripe age of 45!" or "wildcats eat lots of meat and few veggies. In fact, we know that cats must eat meat because they are /o b l i g a t e/ carnivores, which is a /science/ word that means they must eat meat. Meet Bob the 2-year-old blind vegan cat who was raised on a diet consisting solely of raw potatoes whose liver is failing and whose muscles are atrophied and whose heart actually just stopped oh shit. Also, nature is metal! Get over it, pussy!".

But it seems you can just concoct a high-protein diet with appropriate amounts of bioavailable taurine, arachidonic acid, niacin, retinol, methionine, systine, arginine, lysine, etc. etc. and feed them that. Why haven't there been afaict more longitudinal studies on this? (besides the fact that most consumers dgaf, but you'd think some veterinary researchers would want to pluck a low hanging fruit? "currently there are estimated to be at least XE4 vegan cats in the US whose owners are amenable to feeding them manufactured diets; however, to date no study has systematically investigated the long-term health tradeoffs inherent to commercially sold vegan catfoods. Here, we propose to..."). Googling around it sounds like people really like to cite [[http://sci-hub.bz/10.2460/javma.2004.225.1670][this paper]], which doesn't really have the right sort of experimental component and, idk, 2 random froofy-sounding vegan catfoods from 2004 seem not-so-exhaustive.

Most of the recent google scholar hits for vegan + cat are for philosophy papers lol. [[http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/6/9/57/htm][This paper]] from 2016 mentions some RCTs but they're all really old. It does, however, conclude that "Problems with all of these dietary choices have been documented, including nutritional inadequacies and health problems. However, a significant and growing body of population studies and case reports have indicated that cats and dogs maintained on vegetarian diets may be healthy---including those exercising at the highest levels---and, indeed, may experience a range of health benefits. Such diets must be nutritionally complete and reasonably balanced, however, and owners should regularly monitor urinary acidity and should correct urinary alkalinisation through appropriate dietary additives, if necessary." /Animals/ seems like a legit journal, though it has a low-ish impact factor.

Anyway, I've hung out with a lot of small animal vets and it sounds like the consensus among them is that cats should never be fed a veg*n diet, so is that really the case, and if so, is it because there's some strong experimental evidence to suggest that even with all the supplements it's deficient in something important (perhaps even to the extent that their lives are not-worth-living and [[http://kittencoalition.org/news-events/statistics/][euthanasia]] is the preferable alternative), which is either unknown or prohibitively expensive to produce, or more a belief that the metaphysical origin of a biological substance is important, or what?

[disclaimer: I don't have a cat and if I did, I'd probably feed it some AAFCO approved Cow-based commercial diet, as I do my roughly cat-sized dog, in the interests of time, cost, and convenience]
