  *Temporarily Fireproofing Houses*

With a wildfire, you have huge amounts of material being burned simultaneously. The hot air produced by the fire expands, and when things are burning over a large area you end up getting a lot of hot air expanding outwards. The problem is not akin to having a bunch of torches flung at your home and you just need to keep them off. The problem is closer to having your home placed into an oven at temperatures high enough to set it aflame. A fire-retardant tarp will most likely be useless in a wildfire.

If you want your home to be unscathed in a wildfire, you need to build it out of thick brick and stone walls and use ceramic or slate shingling. Aim for high [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_mass][thermal mass]] to help regulate interior temperatures. When you hear of a wildfire on the way, you should still get out as soon as you can, don't get stuck in a traffic jam. Just because your house won't burn down doesn't mean you'll definitely be able to tolerate the heat, or that you'll still be able to breathe the air when a wildfire passes through your area.
