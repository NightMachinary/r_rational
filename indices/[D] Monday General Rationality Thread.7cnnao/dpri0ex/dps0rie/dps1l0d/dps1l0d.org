  When you hear of a wildfire on the way, you should still get out as soon as you can, don't get stuck in a traffic jam. Just because your house won't burn down doesn't mean you'll definitely be able to tolerate the heat, or that you'll still be able to breathe the air when a wildfire passes through your area.

Oh yeah, definitely agreed (that was my "fires move too quickly for manual deployment?" bit)! I was just thinking of all the facebook posts I saw a few weeks ago where people were saying "it's likely this fire will not be contained in time, and it's estimated that it may reach us in a few days. Now, we are carefully packing up our valuables and driving a few towns over" (I was all set to host a few of them at my apt, actually, but they found other, closer accommodations).

  The problem is not akin to having a bunch of torches flung at your home and you just need to keep them off.

Are there any intermediate cases where this is the case? How close to the oven scenario is a home surrounded on all sides by some dry redwood forest, vs one in a standard suburban neighborhood, vs one with lots of spacing and flat land between houses? see my earlier comment here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7cnnao/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dps01pe/]]
