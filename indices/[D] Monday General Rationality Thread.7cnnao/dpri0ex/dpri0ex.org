I've had four sets of questions/thoughts this past week that I'm curious to find the answers to. Sorry if they're not appropriate here and would better go int he Friday thread; if that is the case I can delete and repost then:

--------------

*Temporarily Fireproofing Houses*

A bunch of homes near-ish to me in N. CA have been devastated by wildfires, and the other day I had a thought: with forewarning is it possible to prevent your house from burning down in some sufficiently slowly encroaching forest fire by covering it in a thick fire-retardant tarp and then maybe soaking the tarp through with water? Stake it down so it doesn't blow off, even even a little bit -- to prevent gas exchange? Naively it seems like a few thousand dollars could buy something that can be deployed in <1h and provide a layer of protection when you know the fire's coming. Googling around it looks like things like this /are/ available, e.g. [[http://www.firezat.com/info.html][this]] or [[https://www.tarpaflex.com/acatalog/avoid-severe-fire-damage-with-flame-retardant-tarps.html][this]] or [[https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-06/fireproof-house][this]] (not quite soaked nomex or w/e but far cheaper I reckon). So I wonder why I don't hear more about this, or see photos of that one house in the neighborhood surrounded by burnt out husks cos it managed to get its fire tarp up. Is it because these systems aren't very reliable? Or fires move too quickly for manual deployment (could an automatic or semi-automatic system work there? press a button and sheets unroll from the roof, or your drone-battalion-with-redundancy takes off, or something)? Or people aren't aware of them, or underestimate their forest-fire risk? I'd like to assess how worthwhile something like this is if I should ever live in an especially fire prone area.

*Sexual Consent*

Given all the recent celebrity sexual misconduct scandals: can we conceptualize sexual consent in an ad-hoc, not-really-rigorous Bayesian decision theoretic framework, where agents could e.g. gradually escalate sexual interaction, obtaining stronger and stronger evidence that their prospective partner is interested/willing (i.e. responses to actions would constitute further evidence)? Gradual escalation would not be “required” in the case of strong initial (“enthusiastic”) consent, enough to overwhelm the prior (which I guess could be specified on an individual-by-individual basis -- given your demographic and the demographic you're interacting with, what is the frequency with which consensual sex occurs or consent is obtained? And maybe wiggled a bit if you've e.g. had sex with the person a thousand times already, the most recent of which was yesterday. Also a good place to reemphasize that “uniformative” priors are often pretty bad! Don't use a discrete uniform prior here! lol). Culture-specific likelihoods could be obtained empirically, e.g. through surveys of the general population -- “in instances where you have performed action X, what is the frequency with which you'd have consented to sexual interaction Y”. The input space would be truly vast, though. And another difficulty could be that individual actions are not independent -- e.g. there's temporal autocorrelation w.r.t. smiling, which might be taken as exceptionally weak evidence for sexual consent if smiling is even slightly more probable when consent is present than when it is not. But if someone smiles at you a thousand times over a conversation you don't get to multiply all those likelihoods -- maybe they have a spasmatic facial muscles, or something. Also, interactions between inputs -- bundles of behaviors might mean more than the sum of their logs. And between-individual variation in sexual interest-signaling behaviors, too.

I think the most controversial bit would be the definition of (culture-specific?) loss functions for various actions, as that would require explicit quantification of badness (especially) under action/hypothesis mismatch across a wide range of conditions. Imagine the outrage when someone collapses it to the equivalent of Blackstone's Ratio for sexual assault! (“better that a thousand consenting adults go sexually unsatisfied than a single dissenting adult be the victim of sexual misconduct” -- but of course that's being done implicitly whenever we make any sort of judgment under uncertainty). Consent could also not be a discrete, binary state, but rather continuously valued, and the likelihood, priors, and loss function would need to accommodate that. It could also be ordinal, thresholded, etc. This seems biologically and socially realistic -- someone might suffer more under violation if they've mostly consented, or are on the cusp of consenting, rather than in the case where they strongly dissent (e.g. consider the case of kissing your committed partner when they're really feeling it vs. the case where they've got a tummy ache and just want to lie down).

And since consent is a two-way street you could also assess the probability with which you yourself give consent, though there you're privy to much more information re: your internal state. There's also some question over whether consent is internal or external -- e.g. how does the Gettier problem relate to consent status -- the nature of legal vs. moral agency, the relation between the parties involved, the intentions of each party, and whether the structure of the loss function can change relating to external circumstance. The loss functions could also be party-neutral -- i.e. summing across costs to both parties -- but I guess it might be more valid for it to be agent-specific with some tunable “compassion” parameter, since a sizeable fraction of people probably dgaf about hurting prospective partners. Also, consent values aren't static and presumably change over the course of a series of interactions? -- e.g. making out stokes the fires and gets someone randy where they weren't before. Or do they? How does foreplay fit into the nature of consent? If someone is uninterested in a sexual act at time t but anticipates being interested at t+1, is there an element of coercion at play? e.g. consider “he doesn't want to have sex with me, but I'm going to /make/ him want to”.

Anyway, some quick googling failed to uncover whether something like this has ever been attempted. But I'm no sexologist and not really familiar with the gender/sexuality studies literature so maybe it's been tried and failed (also, game/decision theory really isn't my field so I'm probably missing lots of other stuff)? Worm cans aside, would there be any value in such a treatment? Obviously it wouldn't and shouldn't see the light of actual application, all models are wrong etc. etc. (and this would be inordinately simple and ad hoc and with a ton of effort /maybe/ applicable in an extremely narrow set of circumstances), but it could still serve to build those intuitions and heuristics that get used in real-world decisionmaking.

*The Recently Proposed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act*

A ton of people in my social circles are criticizing this thing in its proposed revocation of tax exempt status to grad school tuition waivers. As a current PhD student it wouldn't affect me too much (I think I fall under 26§117.b/c with a scholarship/fellowship instead of a "tuition reduction", and if not grad student tuition is only ~$14k where I'm at so the marginal burden would be pretty small, especially with the increased standard deduction).

It looks like PredictIt is giving the following $.3 to the dollar of it passing [[https://www.predictit.org/Ticker/S.TCJA.2017#data][the Senate]] in 2017, and $.85 to the dollar of it passing [[https://www.predictit.org/Ticker/H.TCJA.2017#data][the House]]. Can't seem to find any more detailed predictions, though, so I'm not sure how these bear on the probabilities of it being passed in 2018, or being amended in some relevant way, but insofar as prediction markets can serve as effective oracles it sounds like it's not quite a done deal yet (the bets aren't conditional, either, but can maybe still give us something of an upper bound). Trumps probably not gonna veto it! lol. How likely is this thing to pass?

This has also had me wondering -- how much value do people place on the goverment having money/resources? For instance, if by anonymously destroying your own $1 (or material equivalent) you could generate $1X in wealth to give to the gov't, what value would X need to take at the margin for you to happily burn that dollar? (if negative, it would mean paying to destroy gov't wealth). If you're completely indifferent then I guess it can take on any value short of destabilizing the economy (local or global), assuming you'd prefer that not happen.

I don't think the gov't optimal at allocating and distributing materials in accordance with my own preferences compared to alternatives, but I don't think them antithetical to it. So at the margin my gut says X is somewhere in [10,100].
