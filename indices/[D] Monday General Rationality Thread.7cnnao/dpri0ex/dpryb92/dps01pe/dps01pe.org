Good point! A tarp might stop stray embers from getting through to the underlying house, but if ambient temperatures are hot enough the house may spontaneously without direct exposure to flames or burning materials. The tarp would probably provide only negligible insulation in that case.

Is there an intermediate case where it can make a difference, though? The wildfire itself might burn for hours, but do the portions of the wildfire in neighborhoods burn for hours, or do houses surrounding a hypothetical tarped house burn down pretty quickly? If your house is in the middle of a burning forest there's likely nothing that can be done, but ambient temperatures don't seem to have been sufficient to e.g. burn [[https://i.imgur.com/BX7mQRi.png][these houses]] down. To me it seems intuitive that it was only dint of chance that that right-most intact house survived (e.g. no embers were successfully blown into ignitable material, causing runaway house death), but I don't know anything about fires lol.
