  Temporarily Fireproofing Houses
#+end_quote

Fireproofing usually works something like "This will keep the contents below [temperature that damages them] while in an environment at [likely fire temperature], for [time]". For example, a safe might be rated to keep paper below 350F for one hour in 1700F surroundings. I'm eyeballing those safe walls at 2" thick.

Wildfires are roughly that temperature, and burn for more than one hour, and houses are roughly as flammable as paper. I don't think that you could get a tarp thick enough to give protection from a wildfire for long enough to matter, while still having it be installable. They usually stop it kilometers before your house is at risk, or else long after it passes through.
