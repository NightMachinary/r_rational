I strongly agree. So many of the suggestions in the munchkinry threads, seem to make some /crazy/ assumptions that fall well outside the realm of plausibility.

For example, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7ar5by/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dpclgvs/][a recent thread]] posed a question about munchkining [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/BioChromatic_Breath][Biochromatic Breath]], from Sanderson's /Warbreaker/ novel.

One person's "munchkined" plan was:

#+begin_quote
  Step 1) Go to a third-world country or somewhere with lots of poor people. Offer them money to give you breath (without telling them how giving you breath actually affects them).

  Step 2) Start animating corpses en masse with the order "Behave as if you were alive, but completely loyal to me and willing to obey every command I give."

  Step 3) Mass clone people, raise the clones in secret facilities until they can speak and manipulate them to hand over their breaths. Then kill them and grow another clone. Use the undead from step 2 to guard your secret facilities.
#+end_quote

It's just...there are /so many/ unrealistic assumptions in this munchkining. Even step #1 has a crazy amount of issues attached, as if a foreigner can easily wander around a third world country, offering money to anyone willing to say a phrase, and not attract a lot of attention. It just escalates from there - where the heck can you just get a bunch of corpses? And then we jump straight to "mass clone people in secret facilities"???

I guess rather than exploring extreme power fantasies, I'm much more interested in /realistic/ approaches to "munchkinry". The former is creative storytelling, the latter is an actually interesting logical exercise.
