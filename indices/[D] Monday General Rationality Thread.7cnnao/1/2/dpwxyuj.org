I don't think the intercontinental shipping example is as bad as you're making it out to be. Sure you can't just immediately get permits. However once your powers are known I'm sure some countries would set up some sort of special laws through which you could do something similar since they stand to benefit from the increased trade or other such benefits.

Though of course if you can open portals, using that for shipping is among the lamest and least imaginative munchkins for that power.
