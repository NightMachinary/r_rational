I mean...you are kinda making my point.

In the event that superpowers show up there'll be far more massive concerns than allowing said superpowered person to build portal pipelines in your nation.

Hell, if you're that guy you also now have a bunch of other concerns. You are now the most famous and coveted person in the world.Every single government and corporation is paying attention to you and what you can do.

Is this what you want? Can you handle this? No one seems to factor all this stuff into the analysis.
