You're thinking of "Famous" as "singer-songwriter" famous (i.e. no one really cares and you have no real power). And not "famous" as "guy who invented the atom bomb" or "rogue state" famous.

The idea that this is something to be brushed aside while you make money is just part of the overly optimistic nature of the "munckinry" here.
