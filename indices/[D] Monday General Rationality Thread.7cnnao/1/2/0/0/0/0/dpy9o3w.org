See I think you're overestimating the degree to which having that level of attention on you, necessarily impacts the general overview of whether you can still do the things you were initially planning with these plans.

For instance if anything should you want to use your portals to get things into orbit the fact you're currently the most famous person to exist seems likely to make it easy to find patrons for that sort of thing. And you say "rogue state" famous but that seems like a vast overestimation of how negative public opinion of you is realistically likely to be. My money's on most people instinctively revering somebody with superpowers, not to mention you really need the whole world to like you in order to find a government patron here.
