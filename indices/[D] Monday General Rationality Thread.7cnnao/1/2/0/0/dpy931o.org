Yeah I mean I did say other aspects of the power are way more useful than using it for shipping, but the fact you're going to end up absurdly famous doesn't really eliminate any of the possibilities there or with other applications.

I think you're forgetting that people leave out the degree to which you will be the most famous person to ever live because it's not really as interesting to think about. In practice it just serves as an occasional inconvenience as well as a source of money to get things started.
