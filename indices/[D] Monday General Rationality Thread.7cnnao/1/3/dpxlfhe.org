If you want a plan, you first contribute ideas of /any/ way to reach your goals, regardless of feasibility.\\
Once you get enough candidates, you can smash them against reality of your choice and see which ones have any chance of being implemented. Then you make those actually work.\\
Including complications and problems in your plan will make those far too expensive mentally, and many people just won't bother.

Besides, it's just a game in the end- if you wish your players to play on hard mode, just ask them. "Make sure your plans can be carried out by an average adult western man." or something.
