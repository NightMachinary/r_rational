I think there's an implicit assumption of "this is the best case scenario", that the shipping company or whatever is the optimal method that you would strive to accomplish. I don't know how opening intercontinental shipping company works, and I also don't want to spend however many dozens or hundreds of hours it would take to learn all of the relevant business and political details before I make my reddit post.

We sort of abstract away the details and say "this is what I'd like to do" with an unmentioned nod to the idea that if you did get portals you would be willing to invest the time to learn how these things work, and even if there are trials and tribulations and maybe the company doesn't get going until five years later, it would be worth it once it did.
