  I think there's an implicit assumption of "this is the best case scenario", that the shipping company or whatever is the optimal method that you would strive to accomplish.

The problem is that the assumption is soooo broad that you're not munchkining or coming up with a rational plan, you're declaring how your fantasy works.

You don't need to know the details of intercontinental shipping. That's not the problem. The problem is assuming that the usual rules apply when you grab an inherently disruptive power. It's the opposite of rational.

The problem with intercontinental shipping is not that you don't know the regulations for shipping right now, it's that the idea that revealing yourself to the world as the first superpowered person is not so disruptive that you won't spend your entire life dealing with it is kind of absurd.

No one factors in the obvious problems caused by outing yourself as the sole person who can open a portal anywhere. They just ignore it so they can construct their "build a shipping company" plan.

That's like me "munchkining" the ability to shut down fission and radiation on large swathes of territory by...starting a nuclear waste disposal company. What about the massive disruption to nuclear deterrence? What about the impact on countries? Who wants to kill or bribe me? What does this mean? All of that is ignored for an outlandishly simple plan.

That plan doesn't actually work rationally within the world as we know it is my point.
