Is there reason to suspect fireproof materials would degrade if stored in a cool, dry place?

I guess it depends on the size and shape of the house -- I spent a lot of time running around the rectangular roof of my reasonably-small childhood house growing up and think I could do the job there in an hour with appropriate care -- 10 minutes to get the materials up there, 20 to unravel and cast, 30 to stake down. But IDK. The first link says "Most structures can be covered in a couple hours by 2 or 3 people with another 40 minutes to an hour to secure the shields for optimum wind resistance." Which I'd misread as only taking 40 minutes, and not a couple hours lol, which served as a baseline for my own figure. So I'm probably dramatically overestimating my own abilities.

I agree that building with fireproofing is best, but it's not always feasible to build vs. to buy a home already built (edit: or ofc if you already have a house lacking in such in-built fireproofing). Plus, what would the marginal costs of that be vs. a temporarily deployable measure?

Soaking does sound effective but also especially temporary, since I imagine houses are intentionally designed to not be porous or hold water (else it seems you'd quickly have mold problems if it rains).
