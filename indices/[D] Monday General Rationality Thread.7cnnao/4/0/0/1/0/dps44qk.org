I totally agree with you on the cat food studies. I guess there's only so much money going towards cat nutrition and the people interested in cat nutrition just aren't interested in studying vegan cat food.

  feeding a cat a vegan diet is subjecting it to a fate worse than death, since so many healthy cats get euthanized each year

This is just so patently false I don't even know what to think. Even if you assume that they invariably end up with urine crystals, a year of living happily before being put down due to urine crystals vs being put down right away... it boggles the mind.

On food: I guess I view buying the vegan dog food as part of a way of supporting the market for such things, and unlike cats, dogs can be /allergic to meat/, and in the US at least there's actually a readily available brand of dog food that is vegetarian. We order the food online, about six month's supply at a time.

I do wonder about feeding animals kangaroo instead - here in Australia they're overpopulated culled en masse and the meat is used for pet food. "The culling would be happening anyway", so maybe that's an acceptable pet food source.

Our dog is a greyhound so she's also a good way of reducing the stigma associated with the breed (they have to be muzzled here) and of (hopefully) making people really think about the racing industry.
