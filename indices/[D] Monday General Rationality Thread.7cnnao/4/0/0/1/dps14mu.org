we certainly can't say that about human nutrition either! depending on how strictly one defines long and comfortable, and especially not in any mechanistic sense. Undoubtedly most benign human foods are modifying lifetime cancer risks in subtle ways, despite the tons of $ devoted to figuring what those are. Ultimately with cats I don't think we have to, though, because it's something that can be investigated experimentally. Maybe a few hundred cats would live sub-optimally in the process, but it's not as if we know where the optimum lies with meat-y diets either. It just seems like there are so many incentives in place to do this but afaict it hasn't been done yet (a veterinarian scientist doesn't even have to be ostracized to perform the research -- they don't have to endorse the diet, they just have to say "hey, those crazy stupid vegans are gonna torture their cats either way, I'mma figure out a way so that they torture the cats a bit less").

The consensus online also seems to be that if you want to feed a cat a veg*n diet (no matter how well designed or monitored) you shouldn't have a cat at all, which to me implies that feeding a cat a vegan diet is subjecting them to a fate worse than death, since so many healthy cats get euthanized each year. Which is a bullet I may be willing to bite, I guess, if it's truly the case, but it's not one I imagine many would be (for the record I don't think well-cared for veg*n cats live so nightmarish an existence).

In terms of direct impact when I back-of-the-envelope my (~10 lb) dog's diet I'll be roughly responsible for some small fraction of a cow's death, which is not at present worth the costs of switching him to a veg*n diet (especially if it requires additional veterinary monitoring) -- I'd rather direct those monies to other ends (e.g. donating to animal welfare charities -- though given other considerations I don't see the offsetting argument applicable to myself).
