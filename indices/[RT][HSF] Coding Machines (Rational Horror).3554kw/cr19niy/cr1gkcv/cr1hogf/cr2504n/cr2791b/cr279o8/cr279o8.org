  The *transistor count* of a device is the number of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor][transistors]] in the device. Transistor count is the most common measure of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit][integrated circuit]] size. According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_Law][Moore's Law]], the transistor count of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit][integrated circuits]] doubles approximately every two years. On most modern microprocessors, the majority of transistors are contained in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache][caches]]. In fact, IBM's Storage Controller at 7.1 billion transistors with 480 MB L4 cache in 2015, is bigger than any microprocessor before, on both counts; it is however not a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit][CPU]] until combined with one (or more) of its companion [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_z13_(microprocessor)][IBM z13]] microprocessor chip. That chip holds the rest of the cache, 64 MB L3 (and the other smaller levels) and processor logic, and while having the same dimensions has only 3.9 billion transistors (near record breaking for a microprocessor on its own). To date, combined, this [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe][mainframe]] is the biggest general purpose processor when only one Storage Controller is used, let alone when two are used.
