Depending on your resources. If you need something that's x86 compatible, you better have the resources of a gigantic megacorporation, because you'd have to design it yourself, but if you just need something that can be targeted by a C compiler, you can get away with the simplest possible 8-bit CPU, you could even take something like a Z80 or a 6502 that pre-dates the infection and implement it. I have absolutely no idea what it would take to do the entire fabrication process without involving any software or whether it could reasonably be done. If not, you couldn't make it as an integrated circuit, you'd just have to solder individual transistors together. Per [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count][transistor count]], that means around 10000 for an 8-bit CPU, or around 5 million for an x86-compatible one.
