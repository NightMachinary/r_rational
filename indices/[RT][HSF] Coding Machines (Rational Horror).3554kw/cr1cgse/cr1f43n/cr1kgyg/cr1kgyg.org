Maybe the chatbot-like accounts only lasted the first couple of times, and by the point of the story those, too, have become more advanced.

Half of Slashdot's active community is actually just sophisticated programs talking back and forth to each other in order to maintain a tight illusion of humanity. After all, if 100 /really well-written/ posts attack yours, and don't seem to have much other history, then you might be suspicious. But what if each of them has a history going back years? Then you assume that they're human.
