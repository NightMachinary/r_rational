This sort of bootstrapping is honestly actually fairly manageable, to the extent that we make students do it as exercise. Assembler sounds scary, but you only need to write /one/ compiler in Assembler, and all it has to be capable of doing is build a slightly more powerful compiler. (Actually, write an interpreter instead. Preferably for a Lisp. Who needs compilers?)
