Not terribly realistic - if it's clever enough to do complex conditional logic, it's also big enough to get caught. I don't think a sneaky rate of evolution is compatible with the rate of change of computing stacks, let alone the problem that most evolved solutions don't work!

That said - as a Python user with no compsci training, the thought of having to rebuild everything from assembly by hand is totally and rationally horrifying.
