For the record, this attack is well known in programmer circles as the [[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheKenThompsonHack][Ken Thompson hack]].

[edit] Though they jump to AI too fast, instead of considering that somebody maybe built a working [[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SuperCompiler][Supercompiler]].

[edit edit] The ridicule is unrealistic. Surely people on Slashdot would have heard of the Ken Thompson hack. Add all the paranoia that already exists around the NSA... One wonders how far this virus has gotten.

[edit] Okay, the switch is scary.

[edit] > We had to stop the perpetrators before they modified hardware disk interfaces

You know, this is already possible! Google around, some people did it on a lark. Hard disks contain a small ARM chip with firmware nowadays.

In summary: good story by somebody who sounds like they independently rediscovered an attack that has been known for decades. Props to the author! But the virus that can evade a team of dedicated hobbyists with logic probes has (probably) yet to be written.
