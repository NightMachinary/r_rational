Thing is, "we don't like it" /is a problem/.

Emotions aren't something that exist separate from the human world. Our entire lives are nothing but emotional reactions to the stuff that we do, see, and experience. Yes, people stayed in power by killing everyone who opposed them, but it's not like that created no problems. It just didn't create problems /for them/. And even then, half those rulers die to assassination from some pissed off revolutionary anyway.

Sure, sometimes violence, especially as self-defense, is a cruel calculus of what will cause the least suffering. But even that assumes that you've done the math, and decided that your self is worth protecting. Any violence done hurts more people than just the target. Fuck, there's a thread on AskReddit right now about the psychological damage that killing in combat deals to the survivors.

So yeah, I'm okay with people saying that violence can accomplish their goals. But I question whether those goals are rational, and I absolutely think they're shitty people.
