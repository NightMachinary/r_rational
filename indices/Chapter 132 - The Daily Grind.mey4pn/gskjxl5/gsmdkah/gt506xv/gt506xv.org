I'm not sure I buy the 'violence doesn't work and just makes more problems' argument. I think it might be something we wish was true because we dislike violence and don't want to live in a world where it is a viable solution to problems, but that we do unfortunately live in a world where violence can be a viable solution.

For example, plenty of actual rulers have stayed in power for a long time by straight up murdering (or visiting unspeakable tortures and then death upon) anyone who opposed them. They are proof that violence can work if you're willing to be an utterly ruthless monster about it. People fear death and will do whatever the maniac wants if that's what it takes to survive. This is basically monarchy and dictatorship 101.

There were points in time where people even killed whole families, including children, to ensure that there would be no rival claimants to rally future rebellions around. They may have even been right to do so, at least from a purely utilitarian perspective, if their actions prevented all the deaths that would occur in future wars. Which is weird, since, you know, child murder.
