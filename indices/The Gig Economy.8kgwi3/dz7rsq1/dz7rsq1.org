To be honest, I am not a fan of nosleep stories.

I understand that for some people it is exciting or interesting to read a story that /could/ be true, but for me this format is usually simply confusing.

I am not sure how to say this correctly, as English is not my first language, so I'll just try.

I feel some kind of mild 'resentment' when reading stories like that, because it feels as if I am being... decepted. Not sure if that is the right word.

Or maybe being insulted in some way. It is unclear to me, all I know is I don't like that format.

For example, the username in the reddit screenshot in that story is a real user who posts exclusively in nosleep.

I understand that the story can't actually be confused with reality, but that is not immediatly clear. It starts like any normal blog post.

Now if this was on [[/r/nosleep]] that would be fine, but having it on an independent page just makes it murkier. The realization that you are reading fiction hits only after you've read some paragraphs.

I understand that adding fake screenshots gives it an interesting spice of reality or plausability, but I can't get away from the feeling I tried to describe above.
