The Minotaur idea reminds me a lot of David Foster Wallace's subplot idea in /Infinite Jest/ -- there the MacGuffin is known as The Entertainment, a video made with fancy filtering technique that somehow activates the pleasure terminals in a viewer's brain, making it so entertaining that it leads a person who merely glances once to become compelled to watch the film over and over until they ultimately die of dehydration/starvation, and are willing to literally murder other people or cut off their own limbs to get another viewing in unethical testing scenarios. The drama comes from a French-Canadian insurgent group seeking to find a master copy of The Entertainment in order to threaten a broadcast, to thus force the US government to meet their demands.

Great job +Tenobrus+ /edit:/ duckevenfree1.
