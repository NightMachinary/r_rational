A story I read once somewhere, paraphrased by me:

#+begin_quote
  Scientists have just unveiled the first computer in a new, highly advanced generation. It's big and shiny and imposing. It's orders of magnitude beyond anything else in existence. So naturally, they throw it a party.

  After the festivities are all done and everything's winding down, the President (I don't know why he's in this story, this is just how I heard it told) decides he wants to test the computer out. So he goes up, turns it on, and asks it, "Is there a God?"

  The computer whirs for a moment, and a voice from it says, "/Now/ there is!"

All that aside: /wow/. This reminds me of some grand combination of "The Library Unpublished" and Charles Stross's /Accelerando/.

That said, I don't think I should read any more of it. It's doing weird shit to my brain.
