I agree about nosleep and the genre of "it could be true!" creepy pasta. However, this piece specifically seems more like using the medium of a blogpost as the correct medium for this fiction story. Most of what makes the story so good is it's a "very-very-very-near future" sci-fi story, something set in a fictional world that's uncomfortably close to our own (but still clearly not), and the plot involves so many current-internet things and trends. In that sense having the medium of the fiction be a first person blog post is extremely fitting.

It feels very different from the usual usages of this format, i.e. "I found a scary thing in a cave", or "there's a creepy person in my house" which could really just be put into an anthology of creepy stories just as well as a subreddit, in that the fact that it's a first-person /blog post/ is actually a good medium choice.
