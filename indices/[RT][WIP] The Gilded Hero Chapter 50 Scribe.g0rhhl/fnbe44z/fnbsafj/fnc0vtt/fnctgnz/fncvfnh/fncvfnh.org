I was under the impression that skills/classes have statistic requisites, so some hero who got summoned in with 100 dex would shoot a bow for 15 minutes and unlock their skill(s) and become a great archer or something, and someone like the main character with 5 dex would spend all day plinking arrows and get nothing.

Or are you suggesting that either of them has an /equally/ likely chance of unlocking a bow skill from the same amount of time shooting? And if they both happened to unlock the same skill, that they would be /equally/ useful with that skill?

Because if both of those aren't equal, then they ought to have customized training regimes based on stats. It takes no more effort at all.
