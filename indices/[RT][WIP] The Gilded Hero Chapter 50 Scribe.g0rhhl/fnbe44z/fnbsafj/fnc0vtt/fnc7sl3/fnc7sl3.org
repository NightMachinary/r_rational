I've enjoyed it quite a bit. The pacing on updates and MC progress has been uneven - update schedule being very excusable due to current events.

The thing about [heroes] are that they're apparently a dime a dozen, and if incapable of getting a martial class, they're thrown away. A pair of them were even sacrificed to fuel the spell that teleported John to his mercenary company. Heroic casters are problematic in the extreme for the king who summons them.

I can understand how not liking the setting can get in the way of enjoying a work of fantasy fiction. A non-rational world, however, doesn't disqualify writing from being rational. It's the main character's motives and actions that matter here.

This being said, John doesn't yet seem to have much agency. I think we'll see this change soon, and it will be that much sweeter when he gets his moment. The attempt to steal the knife from Karen was pretty frustrating because he finally seemed to be acting on his own goals, impulsive though it was.
