I mean, I think the whole point was that there was a battle and they didn't care enough about the hero's to NOT put them in the battle. So instead of training for ages they just shove them in and hope for the best.

tbh it seems plausibly rational to me, we don't explicitly know how classes are chosen or what the empire needs, so you're making an assumption when you're saying that what they do isn't the best method for them.
