My problem is that Guilded Hero *isn't* that. It pretends to be a rational world, but in practice it's just a world of grimderp.

Everyone has stats, they know that stats are required to gain the all-important skills. The main character spends 2 weeks before anyone even /asks/ what his stats are. As far as I can tell from reviews which follow after I dropped the story, it keeps this up the entire story. Eg, why they don't even /try/ to max out summoned heroes.

The story seems to confuse dark writing for deep writing.
