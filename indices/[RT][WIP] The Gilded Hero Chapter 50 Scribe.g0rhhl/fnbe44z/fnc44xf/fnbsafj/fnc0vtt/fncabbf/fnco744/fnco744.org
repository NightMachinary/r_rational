Its explained in the story why they dont spend a bunch of reasources on every hero.

>! The empire can just keep summoning heroes so there just a resource. The heroes get a broken ability to train faster but they arnt equal as a group. Some take a lot less time to gain ability. At first all heroes used to be given years of training before war. But since stuff like massed arrows or catapults or magic pretty consistently kill heroes its not worth it to train all of them for years. Only the really talented get more time to train while the inferior heroes get sent off to just be one more body in the army. And then it explains they cant be mages because if they were they could end up killing the empire thats using them as soldiers. !<
