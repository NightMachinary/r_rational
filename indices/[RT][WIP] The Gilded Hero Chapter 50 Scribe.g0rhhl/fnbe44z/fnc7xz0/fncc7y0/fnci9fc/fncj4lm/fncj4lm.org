"my efforts to show him such" doesn't provide enough detail to be useful information, did he sing his ABC's, attempt to to write the alphabet???? and the shitty little scribe was "downright brutal" just doubles down on the lazy lack on information ....so either he's getting physically beat by a mousy little scribe dude with a bad temper....or he got browbeat so thoroughly he just...gave up on proving his literacy??
