the scribe keeps calling him illiterate, and writing out his ABC/s would immediately prove he wasnt illiterate and potentially improve his mood towards the MC.

unfortunately the MC being too passive and spineless to actually do anything that would improve his situation is either entirely 100% in character, or just lazy writing in this chapter.
