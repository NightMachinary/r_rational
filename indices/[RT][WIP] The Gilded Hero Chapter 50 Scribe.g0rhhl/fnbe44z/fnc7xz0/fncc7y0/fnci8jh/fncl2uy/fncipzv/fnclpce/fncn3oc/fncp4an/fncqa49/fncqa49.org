My position is “the author left this section of plot relevant information so vague it's useless to the reader” which reflects poorly on the authors efforts this chapter. Story wise it fits and make sense, but unless what the author is trying to convey here is “the MC is so addled and useless he can't even describe his own life accurately” then that small paragraph is not fit for purpose.

The MC not being able to convey his meaning to the scribe and the scribe losing it on him is totally fine, same with him lacking agency right at this moment.(despite how it irks me) so the story is fine in that sense. But the authors done an incredibly poor job of conveying that to the readers. It's just really sloppily done.
