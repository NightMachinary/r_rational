He's pretty clearly doing what he knows will (eventually) get John a skill.

In a world where armies are power, martial skills - and how to teach them - are better understood. (With the benefit of hindsight, Kepler was a true gem of a man.)

The [scribe] is clearly an /utterly crappy teacher/. The problem is that the [baron] has nobody else remotely capable of the task.

Compounding this is the problem that the [scribe] isn't apparently training John to be literate; he's training him to be a [scribe], a class that grants literacy as a side benefit. John's personal efforts to decipher the language are critically important. If the [baron] gets himself a [Hero] [scribe], he'll probably kill John in a fit of rage.
