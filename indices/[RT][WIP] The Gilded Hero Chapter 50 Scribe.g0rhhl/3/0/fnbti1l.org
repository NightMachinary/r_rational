"Scribe" sounds like a class dedicated to (copying) writing. So to get someone to have that class maybe they force them to just copy something over and over, so he assumes he can force the Hero to do the same until he gets a skill or something. Basically he's trying to skip straight to the end because no one illiterate ever becomes a scribe normally.

Still crazy, since writing without reading is useless to the baron. MC should really threaten to complain to Baron -- a bit MAD considering the Baron's mood.
