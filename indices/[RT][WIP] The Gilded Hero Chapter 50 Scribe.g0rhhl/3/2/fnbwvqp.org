Before the invention of the printing press, books were extremely valuable commodities. Literacy was rarer. In-universe, these two factors combined mean it's not worth it to make books that teach reading. It's more commonly done in person, sketching characters in sand with a stick or the like.

The Scribe, as he's protested, ain't got time for that shit, but he's gotta get results anyway. As the main character has literally never seen these characters yet, and doesn't know the words associated with their sounds, he can't tell him "this is A, it makes an 'ah' sound." It'd probably make things worse.

But there's no better way to get better at recognizing characters than staring at and reproducing them a ton. And, as our protagonist has a rote skill learning buff, and the Scribe doesn't want to waste his time... He's set him to work waiting for "Writing Lvl. 1" to ping.

Also he wants to make more copies of whatever this text is and it'll be easier and less painful on his old arthritic hands to edit the protagonist's shitty chicken scratch than to copy it himself.

That's my attempt.
