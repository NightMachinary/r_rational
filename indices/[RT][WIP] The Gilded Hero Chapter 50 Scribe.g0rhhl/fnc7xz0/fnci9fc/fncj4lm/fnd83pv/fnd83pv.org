Not gonna argue there.\\
I'm pretty annoyed at the pacing as well. Speed read through most of the story until the point he awakened his magic fire.\\
This chapter as well had like 4 or 5 paragraphs wasted on establishing how much of an asshole the Scribe is, for no apparent reason other than to provide a measly excuse as to why the teaching is going as it is going.

The skill/class system intrigued me but the story is meh. Mostly because it feels like the author has an outline and he sticks with it even when it makes little sense.

Let's just hope whatever the payoff for this rolling idiot ball is, it is at least entertaining skill/rpg progression wise...
