I respectfully disagree. Said baron doesn't care about the particulars of John's literacy and delegated it to the scribe.

The baron also made it clear he was willing to kill John for no reason whatsoever, and in fact nearly did so.

The MC justifiably considers him to be a venomous honey badger.

That isn't to say the MC's lack of agency isn't annoying; it's annoying as hell at times.
