no he didn't. he sorta kinda attempted something that's left extremely vague and did so halfheartedly, and stopped immediately after an equally vaguely "brutal" response from the scribe. there's exactly as much justification to say "he wrote the entirety of war and peace and recited it while ignoring the scribes well intentioned and earnest lessons"" as there is to say "he might've wrote down the alphabet and the scribe freaked out at him"

you're just bound and determined to assume the best case scenario, while im in the middle.

and also if he did attempt to read war and peace to the scribe, that totally justifies an ass beating lol
