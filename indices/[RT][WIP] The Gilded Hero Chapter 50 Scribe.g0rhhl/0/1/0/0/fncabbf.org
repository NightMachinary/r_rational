Ugh and then in this chapter a scribe attempts to teach the main character how to read the local language.... by having him copy pages of text. Over and over again. Onto parchment. Without any sort of translation or explanation. So now the MC is just copying gibberish /without knowing what it says/.

The scribe is described as being unwilling to teach the main character and having to be ordered into it against his will, but this is absolutely ridiculous - literally anyone (including the baron who ordered these lessons) should understand that this is /not an acceptable way to teach reading/.

And the main character is just taking it like an idiot, instead of going to the Baron and saying "hey dude, your scribe is wasting both of our goddamn time and a shitload of parchment".
