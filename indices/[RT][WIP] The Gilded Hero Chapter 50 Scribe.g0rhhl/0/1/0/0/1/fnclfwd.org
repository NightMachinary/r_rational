The MC being a Hero could factor into the method. The scribe doesn't want to teach him and heroes have a reputation of magically picking up skills once they do something enough. Looking through that lens it's not entirely stupid even if the chapter is still pretty stupid.

I'm not even going to touch on how the whole hiding behind a door thing got hand waved away. It feels like the author doesn't have a plan of how things are going to go.
