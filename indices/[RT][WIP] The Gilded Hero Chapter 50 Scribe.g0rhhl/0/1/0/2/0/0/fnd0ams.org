I was under the impression that stats were a first-order factor, but that other factors were similarly important.

Most people have roughly average stats, which means that doing a bunch of everything gives them the best chance of unlocking whatever they're best suited to, which might not be what their stat suggested, while serving to round out everyone's baseline stats.

It's true that people with poor stats in some areas might be practically locked out of certain classes early on, but people with valuably-high alternative stats will generally unlock their wanted class early anyway, and for the rest it makes sense to round out their missing attributes.
