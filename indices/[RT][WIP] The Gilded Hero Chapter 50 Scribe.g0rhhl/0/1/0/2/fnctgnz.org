Nobody asks what his stats are because it largely doesn't matter. You try everything you're allowed to try (aka. not magic), and you either pick something up or you don't. You don't want to specialize before people get their class specialization.

idk what you mean by “they don't even try to max out summoned heroes”. They do; they just do it by throwing them into war and seeing who sticks. You might be thinking about keeping a more elite group in reserve and levelling them less dangerously, but given the logistical issues of handling kidnapped soldiers, the downsides of not having combat experience, and the fact the empire is in a panicked crunch, it makes sense that they wouldn't.
