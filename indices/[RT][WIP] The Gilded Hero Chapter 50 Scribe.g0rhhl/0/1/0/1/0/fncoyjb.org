Again, I'm saying these are rationalizations and not rational.

It costs them literally nothing to say "Hey, what's your stats? Cool, strength guy use a sword. Dex guy go use a bow." 10 seconds and it would be /faster/ in that initial week.

The short time training is also a poor excuse, since the bulk of the army aren't heroes and literally everybody who's in the army and /not/ a hero got more than one week training. It costs the same amount to train a peasant for 4 weeks and train a hero for 1 week, or to do it vice-versa. Except that the other way around gets you vastly better returns since it's training for a hero.
