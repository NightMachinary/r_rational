Plot twist: This is why Frieza uses his power to conquer and subjugate entire races, rules them with an iron fist, and sometimes sells planets for exorbitant prices to the highest bidder (when using resources to crush the would-be buyers instead would be vastly more expensive). Someone has to, otherwise insane planetbusting weirdos would turn everything to rubble.

...Poor guy just wanted immortality. Is that so much to ask?
