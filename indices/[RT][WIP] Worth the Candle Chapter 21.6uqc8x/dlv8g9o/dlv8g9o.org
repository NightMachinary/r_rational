Fantastic serial. I tend to disdain LitRPGs, but this one is fascinating and clever (people in the world aren't stupid and protagonist doesn't get to win by thinking about basic and obvious things), and the advantages (levelling up is OP compared to training) is balanced against zero world knowledge in a deadly world.
