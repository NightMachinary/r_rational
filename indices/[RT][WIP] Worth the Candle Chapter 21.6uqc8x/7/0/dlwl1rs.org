Fixed the typo, thanks.

As for the anachronism, it's hard for me to definitively track down the etymology, but my /suspicion/ is that it's a post-radio invention created by sports broadcasters, maybe independently, and used as a rhetorical device in speech since shortly after that. Aerb is firmly post-radio (and post-nuclear, for that matter). This is also a story that's somewhat egregious about its disregard for the fourth wall (though I mostly try to keep it like that within the bounds of narrator voice/thoughts, I guess). /With that said/, I'm always somewhat gun-shy about things that take people out of the story and have tried my best to avoid too many of those, so I did take it out.
