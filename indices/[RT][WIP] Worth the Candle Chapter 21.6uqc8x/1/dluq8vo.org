Let's look at some descriptions of level-ups.

  *First one:* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][*/Level up!/*]]

  That last message came with a sensation that I can only describe as orgasmic. Golden light burst forward from me in a wave that kicked up wind and I briefly lifted up off my feet. It was like someone had jabbed a live wire directly into the pleasure center of my brain.

  It was over in less than a second and left me trembling afterward.

  *Fourth one:* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25980909][*/Level up!/*]]

  You might have thought that the golden light was familiar to me now, but it still managed to catch me by surprise, and the wave of ecstasy was no less sweet for having experienced it before. I lifted out of my seat, only slightly, and came back down without losing my balance.

  *Fifth one:* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26163864][*/Level up!/*]]

  I sank down to my knees as the golden wave of bliss took me, but it lifted me partway up, supporting me entirely as it shook my body with ecstasy. It seemed to last longer this time, long enough that I felt myself in its grip. When it stopped, I felt this hollow emptiness, as though I'd been pithed.

  *Seventh one:* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26748348][*/Level up!/*]]

  It had been too long since I'd felt that light touch me, the fingers of it gently gracing the pleasure centers of my brain. I felt somewhat hollow as it receded from me, a feeling that hadn't come with it before, and it was with regret that I returned to the real world.

The apparent trend isn't hard to note.

Speculation: level-ups' side-effects are going to be increasing in intensity and duration, asymptotically approaching wireheading. At higher levels, Juniper would become obsessed with leveling-up, as no worldly pleasures would be able to compare to this sensation.
