I was waitlisted by MIT this Wednesday. Despite all my preparation, I think I made a couple of major mistakes during the interview. In retrospect, the business school application process has been very disappointing. I don't think I've ever tried this hard at anything and failed.

Now I need to decide if I want to apply to other top tier bschools outside the Boston area, wait a year and retry, or just attend law school. Because I took the shotgun approach and applied to law schools too.

In slightly happier news, I took the LSAT for the third time and scored the same as the girl from Legally Blonde, which means I have a fighting chance at Harvard Law.
