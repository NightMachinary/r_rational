Just had my last day at my current job. Will be starting a new place Jan 2nd. I'm a consultant, so that's not abnormal, but I'd been here for two years and rather liked the team. But, I have 11 days off, so that's nice. Might end up coming back to the previous place as a normal employee later, if their procurement works out. It's an odd feeling.
