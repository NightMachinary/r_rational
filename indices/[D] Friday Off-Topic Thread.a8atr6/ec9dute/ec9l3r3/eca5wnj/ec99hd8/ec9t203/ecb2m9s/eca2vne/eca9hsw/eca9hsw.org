I'm still trying to make myself an informed opinion, honestly. Like, seriously, sometimes I spend hours reading Wikipedia articles about what he did and I still don't know whether I should agree with it. It's terrifying.

My uninformed opinion is that, at least aesthetically, I really like him. He's a reformist, which this country definitely needs. He's trans-partisan, or at least tries to be, which essentially boils down to "every other party hates him". In some ways, he's like a Donald Trump that doesn't go "Let's piss off a foreign country on Twitter for no reason" every so often. He says what he thinks, which is a trait I value in a politician, even if he gets a ton of shit for it sometimes. He's very candid and self-critical in situations where previous presidents would have pretended that everything was going great.

There's something in his speeches sometimes that makes me want to believe in him, that maybe his government can pull through, give our country non-suicidal economic policies, start paying back our national debt, etc, without feeding the vicious cycle of government after government getting put up and torn down by angry mobs that expect their leaders to magically lower taxes and increase social aids at the same time to fix every problem. He also seems to believe in a coherent Europe with working trade and immigration policies that doesn't force its members to be in a permanent state of open borders, and in working with the OCDE to stop tax optimization by multinationals (especially GAFAs).

Regarding his actual policies, it's pretty hard to tell whether any decision is good or bad. Replacing the ISF by the ISI is super unpopular, but I think it's a sound decision? I have no idea whether lowering housing benefits makes sense or not. The /Montagne d'Or/ seems legit (or at least, as legit as a mining project can be). He liberalized French railways, which ended a century-old special status for train conductors, which I /think/ makes sense? Not sure what else it involves. He set up laws to forbid cumulative mandates, which has been a long time coming, and stricter supervision of campaign finances.

Overall, he just seems like he knows what he's doing, and a lot of his critics just... don't. A lot of the scandals he's involved in or the controversial decisions he took, just seem to me like him honestly trying something new, and getting shit from actors that are just looking for reasons to tear him down (because he represents the economic establishment, because he's a liberal, because he's unpredictable).

tl;dr I kinda like him.
