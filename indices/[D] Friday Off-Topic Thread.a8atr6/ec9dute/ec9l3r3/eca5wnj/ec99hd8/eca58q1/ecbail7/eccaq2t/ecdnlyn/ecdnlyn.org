Probably not, I just looked it up on Wikipedia. He kinda talks about the "pals" in vague terms, and I didn't really grill him on specifics. I don't know if David Belle had already left the group when they founded the Yamakazis.

He told us some about their training at the time, though. He says skinheads were a big problem in the suburbs at the time, and they all trained at a militaristic pace to be ready if and when fights broke out.

I don't think they thought about it in terms of "inventing" something. /Parcours du combatant/ had long been a part of military training, and I /think/ most of them had gone through mandatory military service. I think they just were all sport / martial art enthusiasts with common interests who trained together until it started to look like they could build a formal discipline out of it.
