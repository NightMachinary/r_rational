After taking up parkour for two years (thanks [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]]), and at the request of one of the coachs, I've finally watched /District 13/ and /Yamakazis/.

Aaaaaand they're pretty good!

--------------

/Banlieue 13/ is basically /Escape from New York/ in Paris suburbs. In the far-away, dystopian future of 2010 (the movie is from 2004), crime has risen so high that Paris' suburbs have been quarantined and surrounded by giant prison walls (presumably not /all/ suburbs, or else I don't see how people would go to La Défense, but anyway). So these districts have become lawless ghettos where crime and poverty is everywhere, the strongest rules and the weakest pay rent, etc.

The government has lost a guided nuclear missile, its convoy having been intercepted in District 13, the most dangerous of all districts. An elite police officer must associate with a heroic street rat to find and disarm the bomb before it blows the whole District up. They're at odds at first because the officer is a little uptight and the street rat doesn't trust cops, but they develop a bond and must come together at the end to save the day.

So, it's essentially fight scenes, and a lot of parkour scenes, with very little SFX (no wires or greenscreens). The scenario is simplistic, but works well enough, and the actors manage to deliver a ton of emotion and personality in their interactions. I especially liked the mob boss's death scene.

The political aspects are a little on the nose sometimes; it's clearly a Luc Besson movie. Like, guys, I've seen you lived in a ghetto surrounded by 100m high walls, I've seen the cops with assault rifles, I don't need you to /explicitly tell me/ "Yeah, the government doesn't care about us, it sees us as criminals to keep locked in a cage!". Same thing for the cop. I've seen he was serious, I've seen he fought crime, I don't need him to lay out his entire philosophy between two actions scenes, especially when it's just "I fight for law and order because we're nothing without law! I don't fight for my corrupt superiors, I fight for the ideals of justice and equality that the law represents!". I mean, thanks for saying all that out loud, it would have been a shame to let me understand the movie's message by myself. :P

The main character is played by David Belle, one of the tracers that popularized parkour as a sport in the 90s.

(fair warning, the only relevant female character in this movie is played by a former porn star and gets taken as a sex slave near the beginning, and basically becomes irrelevant except as a motivator for the hero; it /is/ a Luc Besson movie; it's too bad, I really liked her performance and thought she was one of the actors that put the most emotion into her role)

--------------

/Yamakazis/ is a little less exciting. It's more grounded, and feels like a story that /might/ just have happened to the Yamakazis in the 90s.

For those wondering, the Yamakazis are the /other/ group of tracers that popularized parkour in France. As I understand it, they were a group of friends training together that formed an official outreach group in 1997, and featured in a few documentaries and movies since, including /Yamakazis/ in 2001.

(also, the founder, Charles Perrière, is my parkour coach, which is super cool)

The synopsis is fairly simple: after a kid gets a heart attack trying to imitate the Yamakazis' antics, he needs a heart transplant. The only available is a Switzerland, and thus can't be reimbursed by social security. The Yamakazis get mad at the hospital's director, who tells them he won't perform the operation if he doesn't get the money. They decide to steal the money from the hospital's directors in a series of burglaries to pay for the operation.

The movie is even more Luc-Besson-ish, with cops who are all various shades of stupid, racist and corrupt, the one with the heart of gold gives his demission at the end of the movie, all the rich people they rob are snobby jerks, etc. Overall, while I really liked the action scenes, the political message of the movie left me a little uneasy. One of the last scenes, in particular, is the ex-cop having the hospital doctor pay 10'000 Francs from his own pocket, /at gunpoint/, to outbid another demander. I think that was supposed to be the director's comeuppance, but it just... left a bad taste in my mouth? The guy didn't do anything wrong, and it's not like there's anything heroic about raising a bid for an organ transplant; that just mean the other bidder won't be able to save /their/ kid.

Anyway, good movie overall.
