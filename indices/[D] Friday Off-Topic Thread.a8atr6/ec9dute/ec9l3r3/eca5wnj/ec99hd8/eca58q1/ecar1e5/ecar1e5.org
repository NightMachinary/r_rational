I double majored in English and Computer Information Science, and took two writing classes as part of that.

My experience was that they were /okay/, but probably wouldn't have been worth the money if I had been paying anything to go to college (scholarships). The primary thing that academics offer are 1) a structured approach to learning that might be better for some people's learning styles and 2) fellow travelers who are doing the same things as you and are available to engage with on things that have some consequences for failure and 3) trained professionals who can offer advice, insight, and guidance.

It's great to have someone you can go to and say, "Hey, read this and tell me what you think" and you don't have to worry so much that they're going to give you incompetent advice, flake out, or turn you down. That's actually pretty hard to get, if you want to cobble together a writing education from pieces. /Ideally/ your professor or instructor will know a thing or two about the subject they teach, or be an author themselves (preferably published, preferably something that you've read and appreciated, if not liked), and that's a good resource to lean on that you might have trouble finding elsewhere. It's also great to be able to build up that relationship with someone who's passionate about the same thing you are, whether that's your instructor or fellow students. Again, replicable elsewhere, just kind of hard to find organically, because so many people flake out.

That said, the most important thing for developing writing skill is to write every day, which sounds simple and stupid, and /is/ simple and stupid, but still works better than almost anything else that anyone will try to sell you.
