  I'm still trying to make myself an informed opinion, honestly. Like, seriously, sometimes I spend hours reading Wikipedia articles about what he did and I still don't know whether I should agree with it. It's terrifying.

I feel like regular citizens really /shouldn't/ be able to fully comprehend all the ramifications of a policy choice made by anyone playing the game of statesmanship at a high-enough level.† If they can, it's a sign that the politician is too busy pandering or signalling to optimize for the long-term well-being of their country, and so has chosen a policy that is obviously of benefit to nobody, rather than one that's just mysterious in exactly who it benefits.

† E.g. doing things like gathering intelligence about the secret failures of another nation's operations against your citizens to use as leverage in any negotiations with them, only to sit on that knowledge during the actual negotiation, content in the knowledge that they will /assume/ that you know about their screw-ups, since you've pulled out such intelligence before---meaning that that failure is still being used as leverage, but is never put on-the-record for the citizenry of either country.
