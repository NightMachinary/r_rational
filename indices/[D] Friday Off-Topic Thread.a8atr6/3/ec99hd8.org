You know, I thought about it a few weeks ago, and it still seems true: French president Emmanuel Macron (and /La Republique en Marche/ in general) is the real-life incarnation of a MoR!Harry Potter as a politician; like, he's exactly what you get when you get what we think of as a rationalist character elected IRL.

- Younger than all his predecessors in living memory, and known for hiring younger staff than average? Check.

- Rose from relative obscurity to President of the Republic in less than 5 years? Check.

- Has a core following whose loyalty is described as almost cult-like? Check. (although you can say the same about Melenchon)

- Changes a shit-ton of decades-old systems, that lots of people agreed were obsolete, but politicians thought would be too controversial to touch? Check.

- Kind of bad at public speeches, everyone agrees he's kind of stilted, and yet very charismatic in private meetings and good at convincing people one-on-one? Check.

- Even people who support him think he's arrogant and should get better at presenting his views? You bet.

- Acts like everybody would agree with him if he could just get them to sit around a table and explain why his ideas are the best? Oh my, check. (It's becoming almost memetic how much some sections of the French electorate are sick of hearing the word "pedagogy", and yet the government keeps using it anyway)

Also, not exactly a rationalist trait, but his wife is 20 years older than him, and they met in a theater class when he was 15 yo, which his supporters kind of try not to bring up, and his opponents /love/ to bring up.

I don't really have a deeper point to make, it just seemed like a fun connection.
