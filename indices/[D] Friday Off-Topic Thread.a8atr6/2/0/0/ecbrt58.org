My particular company doesn't do a ton of travel, so I don't need to worry about that. For a consultant, two years is a really long term assignment, so you'll generally be swapping projects more frequently than that. Depending on the place and your level of experience you could be doing anything from just being an extra hand on the project, to full managed delivery either on your own or in a team, to making recommendations for how the larger organization can manage a team or project more effectively. It's such a broad title that your experiences can vary incredibly massively between companies, so I would focus more on the specifics of the role you're looking at than on consulting in general.
