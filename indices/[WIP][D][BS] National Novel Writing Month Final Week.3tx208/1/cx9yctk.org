We're in the home stretch!

I need 2,200 words per day in order to finish. That's not a terrible prospect. I've got few other non-work obligations and I've got time off for Thanksgiving, but I'm also traveling to visit family. It might be a little bit tight.

Plot-wise, I'm still not where I need to be to actually wrap this up at the 100,000 word mark, but I think I'm close enough to the finish line that I should be able to just power through to the end (but I have other outstanding writing obligations first, so maybe not).

As always, the updated-daily [[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html][link to the text can be found here.]] As fair warning, this is probably being removed shortly after the first draft is completed, though I have no idea whether there's actually anyone reading along.
