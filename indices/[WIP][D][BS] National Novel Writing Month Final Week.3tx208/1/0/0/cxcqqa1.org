Yep, I've just read it (I really liked the beginning last year during the nanowrimo so I had to read the rest).

I like it more than Shadow of the limelights. It feels a bit rougher around the edges but the characters are more likable and just Henry and Sofia but also Ventor, Hirrush, Omarr and Adrianna and that's what makes it very enjoyable to me. Having people with widely disparate point of views that are self consistent in their beliefs and actions and that are each likable individually despite the fact that they would dislike each other.
