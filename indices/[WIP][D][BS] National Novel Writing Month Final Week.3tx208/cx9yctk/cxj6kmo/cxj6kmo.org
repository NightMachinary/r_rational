I have officially failed at reaching my goal, ending at 97,255. Thanksgiving is mostly to blame (though I also probably would have made it if I hadn't spent time on the appendices for /Shadows/, or if I'd started from 50,000 words instead of lower than that). I think it's time to spend a few days reading back over what I've written, make some quick edits, finish everything that remains for /Shadows/, then dive back in and finish this (though there are lots of things left to write, and I wanted to start up another proper web serial before too long).

Edit: Also, as fair warning, this thread will be unstickied in a few days once everyone has a chance to deliver whatever after-action report they'd like to give.
