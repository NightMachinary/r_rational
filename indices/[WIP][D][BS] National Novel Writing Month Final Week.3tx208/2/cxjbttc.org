I made it, but with an asterisk.

I started with ~60,000 words written; I had this great plan where I was going to finish /The Change Storms: Induction/ in October, then do an romance novel for NaNoWriMo. That didn't happen; I kept thinking "well, I'll wrap Induction up by the end of the first week, then do 50k on the romance in 3 weeks. That didn't happen. Finally, three weeks in, I started logging words for Induction. The problem was that I would write a chapter, edit it, then publish it over on Patreon and the [[/r/changestorms]] subreddit, so I was losing a lot of words as I went. I was only counting words in the final versions, so I only logged about 30,000 formally. If I hadn't finished the book in November I would have put myself down as a 'fail'...but I /did/ finish it. Yesterday (November 30), on the plane back from Thanksgiving on the East Coast, I wrote the last word of the last chapter in Induction. So, I submitted the whole book -- 98,075 words -- and took the win, then noted in the 'synopsis' section on NaNoWriMo that I should get an asterisk.

Oh yes, the latest chapter (ch15) is available [[https://www.reddit.com/r/changestorms/comments/3v0qmb/chpr_induction_chapter_15/][over here]]; the remaining ones will continue coming out weekly.
