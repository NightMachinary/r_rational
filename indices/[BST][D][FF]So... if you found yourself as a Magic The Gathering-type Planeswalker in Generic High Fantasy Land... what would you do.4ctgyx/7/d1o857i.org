Going Black would probably make you a lot of enemies right off the bat. People tend not to like necromancers taking up residence nearby...

Going too strongly White could also do the same. The forces of evil might try to pick a fight with you. However, the ability to heal would be very useful, and so would protection spells. In real life you would probably have to worry about random arrows from bushes as much as dragons.

The more neutral colors such as Red, Green, and Blue would be best from a survival perspective. Maybe mix some White in, especially without green.

I'd probably thus end up going Simic Blue Green. I'd provides a nice mix of meta magic, draw/scry, healing, and protection. This would make me hard to find, and hard to kill.

I also would totally use magic to create incredibly dangerous monsters, like the Simic guild does. Why use generic ones when you can make your own?
