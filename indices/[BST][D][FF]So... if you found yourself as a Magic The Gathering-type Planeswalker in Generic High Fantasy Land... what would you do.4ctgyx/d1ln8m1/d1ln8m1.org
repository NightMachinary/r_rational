I'm pretty sure that many people here would lean towards colorless arifacts and Blue, with smatterings of White/Black.

Scry would be extremely high on my list of effects to get access to, off the top of my head. The divination-like series of effects(card draw, scry, loot, shuffle, and tutor effects) are incredibly powerful in game, and in setting they'd be just as ridiculous, since most of them involve seeing likely possible futures.

Breaking the system actually isn't extremely difficult. The first things I would work on would be getting access to would be things like [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=391927][Soulfire Grand Master]] and [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383131][Time Walk]] (Or any similar effects - There are more common versions of the same things, if I remember correctly) - Time Walk with Buyback means you literally have all the time in the world to amass whatever you need for victory.

You're in the Narutoverse and some big bad mean S-rank ninja are after you(Or choose your own deathworld with suitably dangerous creatures)? Start a time walk chain, walk on over to them and prime some detcord.

[[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=110517][Walk The Aeons]] is 'Just' a rare, instead of a mythic or legendary(Most time walk effects are rare).

If that's too hard, you can use get and use spells that shuffle Time Walk back into your library and reclaim it with a tutor spell, but that's more expensive in general, even if it would be easier to assemble('common' and 'uncommon' effects - Archaeomancer, Memory Journey, Runic Repetition, etc.).

Jace is the scariest planeswalker in the entire setting, [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=288937][for good reason]].

I might reply to myself with answers to the rest of the questions later, I guess.
