*Phase 1*

I would learn magic, spells, especially the very useful ones, focusing on protection and escape early on and gradually progressing to more versatility-granting spells.

*Phase 2*

I would create a religion with myself as its deity, and gradually spread it out to all the world.

*Phase 3*

I would use my followers to take over the plane, with a focus on precision strikes against the leadership of the opposition, with the followers acting as the spies to find the ones that go into hiding.

*Phase 4*

I would start instituting humanist, progressive ideologies throughout the plane and progress to developing a functional plane-wide government to establish peace.

*Phase 5*

I would start focusing everyone's work on technological advancement.
