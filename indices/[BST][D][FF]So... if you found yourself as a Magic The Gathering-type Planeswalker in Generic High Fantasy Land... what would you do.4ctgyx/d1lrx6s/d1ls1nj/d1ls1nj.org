Next we have things like the Eldrazi or Phyrexia. It isn't clear whether we can expect to see these threats in particular, but in general, one should remain vigilant for threats of the general description: "Plane Eaters", and "Interplanar Infections and/or Expansionist Empires" Basically the solution to those is more or less "Just run. Get help."
