#+begin_quote
  What do you do?
#+end_quote

Immediately try to break whatever limits are present.

#+begin_quote
  What don't you do?
#+end_quote

Attract the attention of big scary things before I can reasonably escape them/beat them.

#+begin_quote
  What spells/cards do you research as high priority? Consider the things that are rarer or more often banned or otherwise 'weird' as harder to research and get.
#+end_quote

If I can find them, Intruder Alarm + Sprout Swarm gives me an arbitrarily large force of saprolings. If that doesn't work, Presence of Gond + Midnight Guard. If that doesn't work, find some other way to make the mana or card limit irrelevant. This assumes that there are no significant drawbacks to having an arbitrarily large following of mana constructs at my beck and call. If that works, find Ashnod's Altar, Gemstone Array, and Skullclamp. If that doesn't work, there's other options for the same result.

#+begin_quote
  What game mechanics do you put as high priority to figure out what you are working under? How do you figure out your rules?
#+end_quote

Is mana burn a problem, what happens if I control a large amount of creatures/permanents, how true to life is the 4 per deck construction rule, etc. Test all of these by trying to cast more spells and seeing where I can't.

#+begin_quote
  What weird side effects would you be wary of? What is in the fiction or lore that is especially notable to beware?
#+end_quote

Mana Burn, which is drawing on mana and then just letting it sit unused in your head without a safe vessel to store it in, the Eldrazi, which are world devouring eldritch beings beyond comprehension, and Nicol Bolas, who is responsible for everything bad in the Multiverse, probably. Also Phyrexia, but you can usually run away from those guys.

#+begin_quote
  How would you keep your values and goals and sense of self given the massive amount of power inherent in the magic system? Including the very strong possibility that the style of magic itself will warp your personality, depending on what you favor?
#+end_quote

I heavily favor green and black. This means that I should let natural instincts tell me what to do, and my instincts are telling me that I can do whatever I want as long as I can pay the cost since I'm the most important person to myself. That said, realistically speaking I'd probably keep a journal of what I want and why and consult it once in a while. There's no way that ascending to relative godhood isn't going to completely skew my priorities since most of those are based on ensuring survival and having the power to crush worlds tends to mess with that.

#+begin_quote
  Who or what forces would you specifically fear? How would you escape their notice or fight them?
#+end_quote

The aforementioned Eldrazi because depending on how you look at their lore they're either going to try to swallow me whole which is a problem or they swallow magic itself which makes it difficult to fight them. That said, fifteen flying squirrels can take down Emrakul, so I'm not /that/ worried.

#+begin_quote
  What do you cast? How do you build your 'deck'? Assume you have to build it card by card, until you get up to some (60? Another format?) limit.
#+end_quote

Whatever cards are required for an infinite combo, something that makes angel tokens, and bubbling cauldron. If we're relying only on commons and uncommons, Midnight Guard, Presence of Gond, Thermopod, Fecundity, and Gemstone Array are all in that category and allow for infinite mana of any color as well as infinite cards. The sequence probably goes Gemstone Array, so I don't have to make more than four mana bonds, then Midnight Guard, then Presence, then Thermopod, then Fecundity, then viscera seer, then bubbling cauldron, then Angelic Accord. Once this is secured, Lich's mirror.

#+begin_quote
  You'd end up using your magic outside of a duel, for a lot of time -- what would you use it to do, what spells would you cast, and when?
#+end_quote

Mostly scrying via viscera seer and researching to see if my abuse of the system is causing huge entropy somewhere.
