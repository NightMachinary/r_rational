At my starting level of power I'm about as vulnerable as I can ever expect to be. Therefore I would be very cautious and grow my power slowly, avoiding altogether worlds where the means to kill me are common and trying very hard not to make any enemies. Also, this would be my only chance to live a normal life without the dynamics that power brings. Now, I don't particularly put much stock in a normal life, but if I'm only going to get one chance at it I may as well give it a go. Only once I reach a high level of power would I make more overt moves.
