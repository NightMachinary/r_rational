  What weird side effects would you be wary of? What is in the fiction or lore that is especially notable to beware?

The lore contains The Mending. Basically, all the BS planeswalkers were pulling: Throwing planes at each other, traveling through time, world-shattering duels... took it's toll on the multiverse, and caused time rifts to begin to appear, leaking energy from the multiverse and causing it to start falling apart. After several walkers fixed the issue by filling those gaps with their Sparks, the multiverse had enough energy to retaliate, and it nerfed the nature of the Spark itself in the event called The Mending. Long story short, walkers lost most of their godlike power and immortality, and basically became glorified worldwalking archmages.

So, step 1) try not to do anything too worldshattering and,

step 2) someone's going to screw it up eventually even if it takes millenia before it happens, so prepare for a mending. Nicol Bolas managed to regain much of his power through a gambit to eat a chunk of a plane's mana, and Liliana managed to buy eternal youth from some demons post-mending.
