Learn artifice, because almost every single artificer in magic (planeswalker or not) has been extremely high on the powerful wizard scale. Also blue is the color of magic itself as well as the color that can magically make yourself smarter, so focusing on that seems like the best bet.

As far as escaping notice, blue is also the color of teleportation, invisibility, mind control, and flight. Even with access to only effects that are "common" it's the color that has the most utility.
