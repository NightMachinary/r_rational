This is a remarkably specific question. Are you setting up a quest or a story, by any chance? Perhaps an SI?

Things I would want to know:

- Can I die from deck depletion?
- What is the maximum size of my deck?
- Are my spells like cards, where I use them once and then they're gone to the graveyard and not usable again without some sort of recovery?
- What determines the research cost of a spell?
- Do I have a graveyard, and can I animate things from it?
- How can I predict the location of mana wells?
- How many mana wells are there on this plane, and where are they? If the answer is "a lot and not horribly far", then I'll stay on this plane and bond everything with completionist frenzy. By the time I leave the tutorial I want to have several hundred mana available, of all colors.

If its research cost weren't ridiculous I would want to get [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382946][Future Sight]] as quickly as possible. Combine that with a ton of mana and you can play as much as you want.
