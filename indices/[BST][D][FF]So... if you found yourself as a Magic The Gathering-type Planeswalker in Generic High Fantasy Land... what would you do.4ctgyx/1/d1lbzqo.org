The scenario, in a lot of ways, seems akin to "What if you received a HUGE inheritance?"

It would represent a fundamental change in the sorts of problems that I have and the way that I'd relate to the world.

I'm used to thinking about problems at an interpersonal scale. I don't think I'd have a great intuition for what I should do with the power to shape nations.

So, I suppose my initial plan would be to wander for a while, meet people and see things.

I suppose my big "fear" would come from the possibility that there's some magical-incentive for other people to go hunting other Planeswalkers.
