The alien races are bland and forgettable, the various unit models don't do much to differentiate, the story is told in a horribly slow fashion that reminds me of games older than the original Command and Conquer, the graphics were at least 10 years out of date for the time and the actual unit control is clunky compared to modern RTS games.

That's all off the top of my head from when I played it ~5 years ago but the Let's Play I just watched seems to confirm it.
