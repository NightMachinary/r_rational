Are you referring to the tutorial/demo level they provide to introduce the mechanic? If so I agree its not the best , nor most comprehensive, but you do have to grant that time travel is not an easy topic to explain either..

In any case that mostly effects how easy it is to get in, after you are in it doesn't really effect the experience anyway..
