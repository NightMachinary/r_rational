I remember following this as it came out. The concept was awesome but sadly they skimped on all the normal RTS things. If not for the time travel it would look like a bad copy of the original StarCraft. In fact a lot of the game looks more like a proof of concept prototype than like anything that's supposed to stand on it's own and make revenue. Would be cool if someone took the time travel engine to make an actually good game with it.
