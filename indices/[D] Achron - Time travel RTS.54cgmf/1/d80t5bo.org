Man, the time travel mechanic on this game is absolutely the best thing about it. I wish there were more games that used this mechanic. I heard the game developers had to sacrifice a lot in order to make it work. But I know it's possible to do it better. Look at planetary annihilation and their chronocam technology. I would bet money on that being easily adapted to implement this game mechanic more efficiently.

I'm down for a game though.
