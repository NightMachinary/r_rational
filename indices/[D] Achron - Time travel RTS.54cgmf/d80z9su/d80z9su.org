I'd be up for some games some time.

I found it to be a really interesting game that was unfortunately way overambitious. On release the pathfinding was atrocious and it's been improved to merely 'bad' (like, starcraft 1 dragoon level bad). The campaign was slow and didn't explain the time travel mechanics very well. The graphics especially were problematic, as it was often hard to distinguish between some units.

The biggest problem was definitely the pathfinding though. You only get one release, and on release the pathfinding was so bad that it was unplayable. After the patches it became playable, but it was too late.
