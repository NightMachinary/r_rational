  After you've flipped a card, discard it. Once your discard pile is full, shuffle all the cards back into your deck and start over.

I'm not experienced with tabletop rule creation, but was this rule created purely to curb Fenn's elf luck? Or to guarantee a wider range of outcomes and prevent streaks?

It just seems to tempt card counting and, consequently, a potential lack of suspense (or fun) when the deck thins to the last few cards at a critical game moment.
