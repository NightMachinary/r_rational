  There's a difference between not wanting to kill a player's character in the moment, and not wanting there to be a penalty of death.

It just appeared to me that Joon was being a bit of hypocrite at that moment, like he didn't like the idea of dealing with the drama of Grak's character dying there, and tried to take a moral high ground, like there's nothing he could've done, but in fact he personally designed the system so it's stacked /very/ harshly against the players. I think there's something to be said for the difference between having a penalty of death and stacking everything on a single fickle save-or-die (with awful odds too boot, if I understand the system correctly, a person with average End would die on the first flip with the probability of ~71%).

  Even 5E can result in people checking out, because their "turn" is a single roll of a die that they have nothing to add to, leaving their fate entirely in the hands of the dice ...

And with harsh rules it's over quick, but then the players checks out until the end of combat at least plus however long it takes to get to the point of the introduction of the next character (unless you're suggesting there's supposed to be hot swap, like the new characters enters the next round already somehow).

I guess there's a difference in styles, to me it feels like having the fate of a character that represents a quite sizable personal investment/attachment depend on a single throw with bad odds is /very/ harsh, like something you'd do with the purpose of making a particularly hardcore or mean game.

Anyway, thanks for the reply.
