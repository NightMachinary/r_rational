Kind of? The biggest difference right now is probably my wife, who is super proud of me, and much more willing to give me writing time if it's helping support our family rather than just my hobby of sitting in front of my computer for hours at a time. Not that she wasn't great before, but it's also easier for me to ask when it's not just "hey, I'm going to disappear for a bit, watch our son, please".

Motivation is probably minor though. I'd be writing either way, it's just a matter of how much I try to sneak writing in on the off time, or how much I think about writing when I'm not writing, and stuff like that. Maybe I'm a little more conscious of trying not to do unproductive things (like arguing with people on the internet). I'd like to be able to say that every time I get a new patron, or someone increases their pledge, I race to the keyboard, but it's not really like that for me.

And motivation is distinct from inspiration, which has a much bigger impact. I won't say much about it, but there was a point a few chapters back where I had this "a ha" moment of being able to tie two different plot threads together, and that's the sort of thing that A) makes writing a lot easier and B) is really hard to induce artificially.

*tl;dr:* Motivation gets my butt in the chair, inspiration gets the words flowing, patronage does help motivation (though I'm already pretty self-motivated) but doesn't help inspiration.
