Much of this story was written when I was writing ch 56, but my $300 goal on [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon]] was that I would finish it, which I did yesterday (and that actually worked as motivation a lot better than I thought it would). I don't consider it required reading for /Worth the Candle/, though it is suggested; maybe stay away if you don't like the tabletop parts of the story as much.

Thanks for reading, and if you're a patron, thanks for the support.
