If Joon /didn't/ want to kill his players' characters, his death save system seem /very/ harsh. Immediate death on any failure (which, if I understand it correctly, is almost always more likely than a success), and you can only recover on a critical success? I'm thinking the system may have been designed for dramatic tension first and foremost, so death is at stake on every flip, by comparison D&D 5E death saves are very safe, but very unexciting. Or maybe that's Joon's "DM taking his grief out on the players" approach lingering on.
