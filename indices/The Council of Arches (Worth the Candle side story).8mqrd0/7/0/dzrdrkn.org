There's a difference between not wanting to kill a player's character in the moment, and not wanting there to be a penalty of death. I've played a variety of systems with different rules on death and dying, and usually find the more permissive ones to be grating. If it's /really/ permissive, where "reduced to 0 HP" just means "knocked out", then the player is just taken out of the game, and combat can last a long time, so they've got nothing to do. Even 5E can result in people checking out, because their "turn" is a single roll of a die that they have nothing to add to, leaving their fate entirely in the hands of the dice ... just more drawn out, which is a problem as far as tension goes, IMO, since you get "oh right, he's dying" moments that tend to make it fall flat.

Besides that, part of the point of them playing the tabletop game, in-story, is so that they can get a feeling for what it's like to play a tabletop game, and relatively harsh rules on character death help underline the "death and re-roll" aspect of how parties work, narratives get cut short, etc.
