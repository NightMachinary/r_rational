Not technically a typo but you might not be aware there are only 2 sentences in between

#+begin_quote
  we had a single page of simple rules I'd written myself
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  you could have fit the whole system of rules on a single page of paper with room to spare, which I had
#+end_quote

which felt a little redundant. Also not a typo but something that felt like a continuity error was that there are only 6 sentences worth of dialogue between this sentence:

#+begin_quote
  [Solace] ... got up from her chair and slipped away, down into the cellar beneath the tree house.
#+end_quote

and this sentence:

#+begin_quote
  “What kinds of trinkets?” asked Solace.
#+end_quote

(also requires Solace to hear the previous line of dialogue and there's no mention of them waiting nor a pause in the conversation nor Solace returning)
