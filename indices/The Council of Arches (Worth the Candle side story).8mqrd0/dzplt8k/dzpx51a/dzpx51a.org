  Everyone else, flip up two cards a total of five times, keeping them in their groups, then take the highest card from two groups, and the lowest card from the two other groups
#+end_quote

I think should be "flip up two cards a total of four times"?

  The rules for Arches can be found *here*
#+end_quote

Not a typo exactly, but this just links back to the same AO3 page.

Finally, this might be me misunderstanding the rules, but if Fenn flipped seven, six, five and four for her stats, how does she have a zero to put into Charm?
