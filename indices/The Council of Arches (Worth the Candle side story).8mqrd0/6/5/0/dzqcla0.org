Edited the first one slightly, because you're right, it's clunky.

The second one was due to editing. Time taken while people speak is always one of the hardest things to nail down in prose, because it's hard to account for speaking speeds, pauses that aren't noted in the text, distractions, etc. It's now noted in the text that Solace asks her question as she comes back, which I don't think is unreasonable given how long it took me to speak the lines out loud ... but maybe it still reads poorly. (I have no idea if the internal geometry of the treehouse is written down anywhere, but the cellar is basically just down a ladder from the common area with the big table, so it's equivalent of stepping into the next room with the door open.)

Thanks for pointing those out.
