You flip up two cards five times, but only choose from four of the groups. Similar to the D&D stat-rolling concept of "4d6, drop lowest".

  Not a typo exactly, but this just links back to the same AO3 page.

That's probably AO3 not allowing links to a Google Doc ... I don't think that I've ever seen them do link-stripping before, but I also haven't tried linking there. I added the rules as a second chapter to this work.

  Finally, this might be me misunderstanding the rules, but if Fenn flipped seven, six, five and four for her stats, how does she have a zero to put into Charm?

Juniper made her throw out her stats, because they were suspiciously high.

  “Okay, since you're identical twins, Fenn, you and Amaryllis will have the same pool, but you can put your abilities into different things,” I said it quickly, not giving Fenn a chance to object. “You have four cards, just take half their number value and assign those four numbers however you want. Remember that ace is one, off-arche is zero, and on-arche is fourteen.” There were eight of the arches, two in each deck, one good and one bad, which I was effectively using as a red and black joker, special cards with special rules. “Oh, and round down.”

The full stat arrays for each character:

|-----------+------+------+------+--------|
| Physique  | 6    | 7    | 0    | 3      |
| Endurance | 5    | 2    | 2    | 5      |
| Wits      | 2    | 6    | 6    | 5      |
| Charm     | 3    | 0    | 7    | 1      |
