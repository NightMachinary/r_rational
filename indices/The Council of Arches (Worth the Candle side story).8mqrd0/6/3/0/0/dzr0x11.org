Can you include the stat block in the chapter directly? I know I was trying to figure out what each character had for each stat, and it took me out of the immersion in the reading a little bit. If you really don't want to add it in the middle of the chapter, then how about adding it to the second chapter with the rules?

By the way, it was a very well-written chapter.
