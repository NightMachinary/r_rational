I flipped for stats, built out the sub-characters as I thought the characters would build them, then played two combats solitaire to see what potential outcomes were like in terms of how the system actually worked and where the most interesting scenes might come from.

For the actual story, I think I made flips twice, then just faked everything else (but kept careful notes so that no one would flip a card that they logically couldn't have).

For the end of play, when Grak had to make a flip for survival and Amaryllis had to make two flips for revival, I actually wrote it a few different ways and then picked the one that I liked best, both as it sits within the story, and as it sits within the larger narrative (IMO, here it largely provides an up note and a counterpoint to down notes that happen a few chapters away from where this sits). I also think that's where fudging is most noticeable though, but it was a tradeoff I was willing to make.

I actually wrote [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9AfeqVGDHDY5ldctk444LNCt4V33ffl2DWCqQo7zLc/edit?usp=sharing][an essay on Simulationism vs. Narrativism]] you might find interesting.
