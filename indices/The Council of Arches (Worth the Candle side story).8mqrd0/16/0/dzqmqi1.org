Unfortunately, they use essentially the same part of my brain. I've also had mixed success with online games; there's a bit of a disconnect with people, and everyone comes in as a stranger, which means that it first takes some time for everyone to find their groove with each other, and sometimes it just falls apart because people are bringing in different ideas about what the game is or should be.

My DMing right now is limited to linked one-shots that I do with some friends, less than once a month (and it's been a while since the last one). [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEEMqsW05SEGhp42JLmHOTVy_elHOXIXGJfpKbvqH-U/edit?usp=sharing][Here's the setting doc,]] I'm fairly sure I've linked it in one of the worldbuilding threads before, to the wide disinterest that worldbuilding docs usually warrant.

That said, I've thought about it, it's just more something that I would try at a meetup or convention than as a reward over the internet (partly because I don't think I can guarantee a good level of quality).

Besides, I think I'm a better writer than a DM.
