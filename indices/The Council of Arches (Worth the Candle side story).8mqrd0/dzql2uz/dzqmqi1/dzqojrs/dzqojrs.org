  I'm a better writer than DM

You're great enough at writing that would you have to be worse at almost everything else by comparison. :P

The way you make character development and conversations WORK is incredible. Fenn's jabs, Solace's caring, Amy's strong methodical nature. And Grak who is so hard to understand that it feels so much nicer when you get those glimpses. Like when Joon said that he didn't think Grak meant it when he said “clever”: that was hilarious.

Thanks so much for writing this and your other works.

Worldbuilding doc looks cool too. I'm sure you're selling yourself short as a DM, but of course I believe you about the challenges and reasons for online being a poor medium.
