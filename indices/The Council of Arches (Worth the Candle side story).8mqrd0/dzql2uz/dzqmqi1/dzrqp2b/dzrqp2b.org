  there's a bit of a disconnect with people, and everyone comes in as a stranger, which means that it first takes some time for everyone to find their groove with each other, and sometimes it just falls apart because people are bringing in different ideas about what the game is or should be.

To add to that, it's /really/ hard to get a good feel going with just a videocall; jokes fall flat, people check out constantly because there's no subtext channel, and generally meh.

Which is a shame because conceptually Blue Stairs / Red Stairs was right up my valley :(
