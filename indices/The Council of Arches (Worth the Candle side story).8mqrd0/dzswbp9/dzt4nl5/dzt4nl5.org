There are three reasons for it.

1. It makes "luck" fairly even, so that a streak of bad luck will immediately be balanced out by a streak of "good luck".
2. Shuffling after every flip is a lot of busy work and overhead, especially if you're going to be calling for multiple flips in a row, which as the rules are now is a definite possibility.
3. Having a discard opens up a lot of design space for magic items, class abilities, enemy attacks, spells, etc. If you have a discard, you can have effects that put cards into it, pull cards from it, that shuffle it into your deck on certain triggers, activate when it's at a certain size, etc.

The rules do caution that card-counting might be a problem though. "Hidden" discard is the easiest but probably least effective option to deal with it. Shuffling after every flip removes a lot of design space and makes things more random, but probably doesn't hurt you that much unless you were actually using the design space. Alternately, if you really wanted, you could increase the size of the player's deck to make card counting much more difficult; it's at fifteen cards per player, which is pretty small and easy to track.
