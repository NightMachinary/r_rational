The sidebar says:

#+begin_quote
  A subreddit dedicated to the discussion of works of rational and rationalist fiction
#+end_quote

Why not start [[/r/LWBookClub]] for stuff that doesn't belong here but is written by the right people? Rational fiction isn't going to gain popularity if people see it as synonymous with LW circlejerk.

Imagine this sub was filled with One Direction fanfic. That would be terrible moderation even if ten thousand OD fans voted everything up. People: vote down if it's in the wrong sub no matter who wrote it. [[/u/alexanderwales]] and other mods start actually enforcing the shit in the sidebar.

PS. Nothing against Scott A, I've loved all his writing that I can understand.
