The sub is not necessarily strict on /only/ truly rational fiction being posted - if it's sufficiently rational-adjacent to be enjoyed by the same sort of demographic/mindset as the people who have collected here, then it's probably fair game (self-regulating community, it keeps getting upvoted)

Also the author is a part of the LessWrong/rational crowd; his blogging is more rational than his fiction.
