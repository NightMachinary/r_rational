  Why not start [[/r/LWBookClub]] for stuff that doesn't belong here but is written by the right people?
#+end_quote

Sounds cool, I would subscribe to it. Don't personally feel strongly enough about it to put in the effort to create/promote/moderate though. But, I mean, no-one's stopping you, if you want to.

  That would be terrible moderation even if ten thousand OD fans voted everything up.
#+end_quote

Minor false equivalence there: what we're seeing is (presumably) rational-fiction fans voting it up, not a group coming from /outside/ the community doing so. Unless there's an 'entryist' group of Unsong fans who don't participate in the rest of the sub, but that seems unlikely.

But I take your point; if we all collectively decided to upvote pictures of ducks as part of some sort of bizarre in-joke, that wouldn't make them rational fiction.

Although... if this comment were widely seen, I wouldn't bet /against/ it accidentally starting a trend involving pictures of ducks. Maybe I'm mistaken, just my read on the collective personality of the sub.
