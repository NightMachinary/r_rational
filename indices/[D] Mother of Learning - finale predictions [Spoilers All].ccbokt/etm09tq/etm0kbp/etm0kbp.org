Great, thanks. Quick glancing over it seems like most people agree that Zorian mind magic on Zach is a certainty, though I think now we have more evidence to believe it's going to be an illusion of some kind. Also see that I'm not the only one who places a medium to high confidence that QI is going to survive.
