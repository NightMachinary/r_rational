  [High] Zorian's going to use his one hundred telepathy relays to construct a city-wide illusion that he died for Zach. Zach won't believe it at first, but Haslhush will present Zach a letter from Zorian that spells out why it was necessary and that he went into the battle knowing he would die, that he'd rather die than Zach, etc. Only then will Zach fully believe it.
#+end_quote

Yea, I'm on board. I have a feeling nobody103 still has a card up his sleeve on this front, but I'm banking on a bait and switch.

  [Med-High] They will not permanently kill QI. There's been very little discussion into finding his phylactery, other than "we have more important things to worry about." Plus, given that nobody103 has indicated that he may write a sequel, QI is a natural villain that ZZ could work against without the aid of time magics.
#+end_quote

I have a feeling they will destroy him during combat, the conclusion will roll out LoR style, and then right there at the very end there will be one last ominous paragraph on how IQ is still alive and makes plans to go after of Zach & Zorian.

  [Med] Bryn's going to get a Crowning Moment of Awesome with his firedrake - reminiscent of Neville cutting off the head to Voldy's snake.
#+end_quote

I kinda doubt it, considering the scale of everything going on. I doubt very much he and the salamander could do much even with the right conditions. But that would be one hell of a moment.

#+begin_quote
  [Med] Someone emotionally close to Zorian will die, and it's probably going to be Taiven. She's died in most of the loop-restarts where she participated in the final battle, I think, so it fits.
#+end_quote

I would hate to be right, but I'm betting on Kirielle. During the time loop we found out a lot about her in bits and pieces and she was one of the characters that hanged the most with Zorian without having to do with the main plot. Zorian warmed up to her after finding why she always wanted to hang out with him, and we had one scene immediately after he came back about protecting her and one more when we find out RR&Co. were planning to ambush Zorian's family. If someone is gonna pull the feels strings, it's her.

#+begin_quote
  [Med] In line with the above, at least one of Zorian's mentors will die. Probably Xvim or Ilsa.
#+end_quote

I'm betting on both.

#+begin_quote
  [Med] Kirielle will be kidnapped by RR at some point in the encounter - she may already have been. There's been more than one mention since Zorian exited the time loop about how dangerous it would be to have her in Cyoria.
#+end_quote

See above.

#+begin_quote
  [Low-Med] There is another method to summoning Panaxeth that neither Zorian or Zach are aware of, but RR has been keeping a secret just in case ZZ save all the shifter children.
#+end_quote

I'm very much waiting for the giant curveball that will sidestep all their preparations. Either that or a Xanatos Speed Chess Gambit Pileup.

#+begin_quote
  [Low] Zorian will suffer some type of permanent magical disability from the fight, owing to the angels trying to curb some of their influence in the world. Mostly this prediction is predicated by Zorian's foreshadowing in one of the recent chapters about how convenient it'd be for the angels if he and Zach died.
#+end_quote

I'm thinking the moment that they win, the angels will try to tie the loose ends and Zarch & Zorian will have to find a way to stalemate them into a non aggression deal.

#+begin_quote
  [Low] Both RR and Silverlake will survive the immediate battle, and one or both of them will enact some type of permanent long-lasting damage to Zach or Zorian before the month ends and Panaxeth kills them.
#+end_quote

If this is to happen, I'm betting on the crippling being during the situation I mentioned on the point above.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

One more: I'm predicting we will find out how divine magic, and by extension angels and primordials work and there will be a surprise there.
