#+begin_quote

  - [Med] Someone emotionally close to Zorian will die, and it's probably going to be Taiven. She's died in most of the loop-restarts where she participated in the final battle, I think, so it fits.
#+end_quote

Noooooo.

I am very much a Zorian/Taiven shipper (even if only platonically), over any of the other possibilities. I really don't want her to die.

#+begin_quote

  - [Med] Bryn's going to get a Crowning Moment of Awesome with his firedrake - reminiscent of Neville cutting off the head to Voldy's snake.
#+end_quote

Imo, the firedrake's already has its moment against Veyers. It probably won't have another one.

#+begin_quote

  - [Med] In line with the above, at least one of Zorian's mentors will die. Probably Xvim or Ilsa.
#+end_quote

:/ Narratively, probably Xvim, but at the same time, he's more competent. But at the same time, he knows about the loop and is facing the upper tier mages. Eh.

With an author like nobody103, it's hard to predict what exactly is going to happen, though it will seem obvious in hindsight. Typically, there's always a spin the reader doesn't guess. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
