  [Med] Someone emotionally close to Zorian will die, and it's probably going to be Taiven. She's died in most of the loop-restarts where she participated in the final battle, I think, so it fits.

Not emotionally close, but as one of Zorian's family, I think Fortov gonna die. Enemy will target him since he's a Kazinski. And he's probably the easiest target (unless he was evacuated).
