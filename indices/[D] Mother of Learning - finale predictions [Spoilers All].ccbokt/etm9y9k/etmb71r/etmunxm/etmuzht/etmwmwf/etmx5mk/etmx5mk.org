Sure, let me try.

Zorian will use his 100 telepathy relays to construct an illusion of his death somewhere in Cyoria for Zach. The illusion will be localized to Zach's location, but will be in the city. Zach will initially disbelieve this. Hashlush will deliver a message to Zach from Zorian convincing Zach of Zorian's death. That information will come from the sealed letters, though may not directly be addressed to Zach. At this point, Zach will be entirely convinced. This will ultimately serve as a successful subversion of the divine contract.
