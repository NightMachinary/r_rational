  [High] Zorian's going to use his one hundred telepathy relays to construct a city-wide illusion that he died for Zach. Zach won't believe it at first, but Haslhush will present Zach a letter from Zorian that spells out why it was necessary and that he went into the battle knowing he would die, that he'd rather die than Zach, etc. Only then will Zach fully believe it.

I had in mind that this has too much detail. Zorian can use his telepathy relays to construct something other than an illusion, or he may construct an illusion through other means. The illusion might not be city-wide. Someone else might construct the illusion. He may construct the illusion that he died for Zach, for Taiven, or that he simply died. Zach might believe it directly, or might have lingering doubts. Haslush might present Zach with a letter, or with a message, or might play no role because Zach saw it with his own eyes. Someone other than Haslhush might present Zach with a letter. The letter might contain something else other than what you hypothesize. Etc.

I'm thinking that something is likely to happen which falls into the broad class of scenarios which are somewhat similar to the one you describe, but that the specific one is not that likely in itself. This reminds me of the: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy]].

And yet I'm not really a hardcore fan of MoL but a casual reader (for example, I don't really remember who Haslhush is), so this is not the hill I'll die on. Anyways, I'll offer you a 10:10 (â‚¬) bet that at least one detail in your prediction doesn't happen, as judged by [[/u/DaystarEld]].
