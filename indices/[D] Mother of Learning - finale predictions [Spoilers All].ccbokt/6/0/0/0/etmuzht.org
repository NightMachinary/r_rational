I understand and I'm happy to take this bet with a few caveats. Since I didn't write that prediction with putting my money where my mouth is, I'm going to offer a few gentle qualifiers which I hope you'll agree is reasonable.

- The letter may not be directed specifically at Zach, but WILL be engineered for the purpose of convincing Zach that it's the real deal.

- Hashlush may indeed deliver a message to Zach and not a letter, but the message he delivers WILL come from the letter.

Other than that, I'm fine with it. Zorian will construct an illusion, Zach will disbelieve it, and then the letters Hashlush has will be used to convince Zach. Sound fair?

EDIT: Oh, also, I didn't mean that the illusion will consume the entire city, but that it is designed to take place at any point in the city. My thinking is that Zorian cannot know where Zach will be when he needs to “die” but is prepared for it to be anywhere in Cyoria
