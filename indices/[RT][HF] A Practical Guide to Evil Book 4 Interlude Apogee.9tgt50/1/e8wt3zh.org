To make sure I understand what Wekesa and Tikoloshe are worried about, it's primarily two things, right?

1. That Masego will try a ritual for apotheosis. They consider this to be a bad thing because dying permanently destroys an individual in some way, and whatever is left after is changed and basically just a close copy. Masego fundamentally disagrees with this idea, noting people change all the time, and so that's no real argument at all.
2. That Masego will copy TDK's ritual, which is actually a trap that involves TDK taking over the body of the caster.

I think point 1 is just a fundamental question of value differences. But if point 2 is a true concern, why would they not warn Masego so he could prepare or investigate it? Tikoloshe calls knowledge of the Kabbalis Book of Darkness "an infection," which implies infohazard, but the text glosses over how or if Masego justifies continuing his research. I really wish EE had raised his counterarguments there... but even later on, Masego should really know what he could be facing, so he can keep a (glass) eye out for it.

  “Never the complete book, because then they might realize the purpose of it,” Warlock murmured. “There'd be risks, ‘Loshe. *If Amadeus is right about the Wandering Bard*-”

  “Black isn't even a /hundred years old/,” his husband hissed. “And he thinks he can grasp the nature something like the Bard? Last time he followed that conceit Sabah was killed. Do we need to lose our son to his pride as well?”

What does the section I bolded here mean? If Amadeus is right about /what/ concerning Bard?

  “Hakram,” he said. “Before Catherine left...”

  He trailed off.

  “Yes?” the orc encouraged.

  The mage folded his arms together.

  “No,” he finally said. “It doesn't matter.”

Refresh my memory, do we know what Masego was about to reference here? Final instructions he was given?
