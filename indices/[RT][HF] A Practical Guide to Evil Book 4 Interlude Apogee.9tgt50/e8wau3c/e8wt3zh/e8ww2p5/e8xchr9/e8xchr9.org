  If Amadeus is right about what concerning Bard?
#+end_quote

Whatever Amadeus' teory is, following it would apparently mean not taking Masego's memories. The phrase "There'd be risks" directly after the description of the scheme means the risks are applying to Neshamah in spreading his influence that way.

Maybe Amadeus has figured out the same thing Vivienne and Kairos did - that Bard's non-intervention policy means she can only be harmed by the direct consequences of her actions - and came up with some plan? The plan itself he didn't tell anyone (otherwise Wekesa wouldn't be worried), but perhaps this is the reason he was marching around Procer, waiting to be captured?
