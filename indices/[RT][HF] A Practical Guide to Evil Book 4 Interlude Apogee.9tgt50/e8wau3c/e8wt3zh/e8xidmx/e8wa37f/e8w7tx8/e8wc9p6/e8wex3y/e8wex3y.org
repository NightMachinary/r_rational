The situation with Tikoloshe reminded me of [[http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?58227-Tales-of-Wyre][Lady Despina's Virtue]], so I've posted it here as some readers of PGtE who appreciate the FRPG aspect may find it also an interesting read. It's a D&D3.5 campaign journal, and the premise of the story is the redeemability of a succubus demon.
