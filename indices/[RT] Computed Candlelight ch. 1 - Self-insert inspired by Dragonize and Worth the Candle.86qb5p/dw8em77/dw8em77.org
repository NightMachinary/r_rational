I want to say something along the lines of "I'm tentatively interested" or "I'll be following this", but honestly, there's just nothing to go on here.

Athena and the way Dragonize handled reincarnation was interesting and novel (compared to the way every other reincarnation isekai does it), but by straight-copying it you remove that novelty, and aside from that there's literally nothing to tell me about the story. You don't have a summary, there's minimal setting information (aside from what has to be inferred from having read Dragonize and Worth the Candle), and the character's still a human, so there's no aspect of "I want to read this because I want to read about a main character that's an interesting species."

I don't want to discourage you from writing-- I didn't notice anything that put me off about your style of writing, and I love the genre you're writing in. But please, give us something more to work with. A summary, a premise, or at least a few thousand more words. Some sort of twist, to distinguish your work from every other isekai out there.
