As others have said, I was excited to see this because WtC is my current favorite [[/r/rational]] fic and I wanted to read more like it. Unfortunately, there's nothing here to engage me -- nothing happens except a little bit of musing on love/power/knowledge and then boom, done. I'll read one more chapter because I really do want to like this, but the next chapter needs to have some real meat on its bones -- it doesn't have to be long, but it needs to be interesting. Action, set up a plot arc, introduce some engaging party members or antagonist...something.

Technical note: dialogue paragraphs always start with a ". They end with a " unless the same speaker continues across multiple paragraphs without pause, in which case only only the last one does.
