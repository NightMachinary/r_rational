I'm not sure this test quite applies, because it's a valid reason to write when you have something to communicate to others -- people NOT reading it does negate that reason.

It's just the author asking the readers in advance "Are you interested in what I have to communicate?" at this point in time will inevitably get the response "Not sure, you've not communicated enough of it yet".
