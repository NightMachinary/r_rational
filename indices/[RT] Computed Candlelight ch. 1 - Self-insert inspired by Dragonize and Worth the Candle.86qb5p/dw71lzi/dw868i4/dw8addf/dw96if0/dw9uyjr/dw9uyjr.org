  TV shows have pilot episodes because they're expensive and there are limited time slots on the networks

But a writer's /man-hours/ are a scarce commodity.

If a writer has other stories they might equally want to write, then they can write "pilots" for all of them and let audience response dictate which story they'll continue.

Likewise, if a writer has other /passions/ in their life (say, they're also a {teacher, painter, entrepreneur, ...}) where their time is freely apportionable between one passion and another (i.e. all these passions are equally uses of their "spare time", however much of that they have), then I could see them using audience response to decide whether writing is the hobby they should continue to invest their time into.

On a separate note, though:

I don't think that this is the thing that the OP was looking for? They were interested in having at least a few people actively /engaging with and discussing/ their work with one-another, I think. Not so much /fame/ as... the reason people like to /perform/ stories for audiences, or the reason it can be (for some) more rewarding to be a Dungeon Master for a group of people than to create a story by yourself. It's "storytelling as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types#Single-player_appeal_to_the_Socializer][Single-player Socializing]]."

Besides that, though, there's a more core need that I think everyone here would feel some sympathy with: the desire to actually get /feedback/ on your work from people who are consuming it for their own enjoyment. It's very hard to create any kind of thing "locked in a cave" where you can't /test/ how the changes you're making to the thing affect people's reaction to it.
