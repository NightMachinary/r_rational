But a writer's man-hours also are a factor in TV shows, and I don't think they're a significant reason for pilots (presumably, the TV pilot exists cuz that writer already thinks his man-hours are worth being put on TV)

If there's a multiple-muse scenario and the tiebreaker is how much people want each, then clearly the sensible thing would be to post a pilot of each and say "which do you want to continue!"

I didn't mean acclaim to be /fame/ so much as people telling him how much they like it. Which I think is a valid use of the word lol.
