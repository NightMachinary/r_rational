I'd say there's some truth to both sides. I think it's fine for an author to use praise as an incentive to write (maybe not optimal but that's a problem for the writer more than the reader), but TV shows have pilot episodes because they're expensive and there are limited time slots on the networks, two things that don't really apply to web fiction.

There's an argument to be made that acclaim is a reasonable analogue for funding, considering the situation where the writer is using praise as an incentive...but again, that's something for the author to worry about, not the readers. Imo.
