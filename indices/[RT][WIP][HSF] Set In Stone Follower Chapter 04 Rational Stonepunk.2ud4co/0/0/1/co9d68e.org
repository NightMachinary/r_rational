I think a lot of the confusion is that Albert is seeking a nature solution to human conflict, not a nurture solution. He literally wants to isolate out genetic material which results in violent reactions to conflict.

Even the most utopian society will have conflict. Maybe it will be rare, but it will happen. If the tendencies for human violence aren't weeded out, conflict even in a utopian society might lead to violence.

The evidence of human violence in a utopian society is exactly what Albert discovered to make him choose this course of action to begin with.
