I can maybe see how Albert doesn't want to intervene when he doesn't absolutely have to. It was stated earlier that he believes the best course of action is to let humanity fend for itself wherever possible.

What I can't see is him /on principle/ not interfering with economic policies that result in starvation, probable war, and lots of deaths, for the profit of a single state. This seems like exactly the behavior he wants humanity to grow away from.

Also, the result of war usually isn't less violent people in the long run. The winner (who was if not more violent, at least /more efficient/ at being violent) gets more resources, conferring a survival advantage. I would expect this process to probably increase violent tendencies over time, not lessen them.

This isn't to say people can't /believe/ that Albert doesn't interfere with economic policy on principle. Or that Albert wouldn't allow a war to occur. Just that what Albert /actually does/ is consistent with his stated goals, and what he /actually allows to happen/ for good and clear reasons strongly steers humanity in the direction of his goals.
