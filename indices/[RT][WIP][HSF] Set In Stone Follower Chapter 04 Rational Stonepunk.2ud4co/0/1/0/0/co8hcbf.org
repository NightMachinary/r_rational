  Emotion and rationality mix poorly, in general
#+end_quote

I second the disagreement.

Emotionally-influenced behavior can be irrational, but doesn't always have to be. Being influenced by strong emotions is a perfectly valid character trait, and one that many real-life people share. And for that matter, having characters that do not always behave rationally is completely ok. In fact, how many people do you know who always behave rationally? (Hint, it's probably less than 1)

The requirement here is just that the reasons for the irrational behavior, and the situations in which characters act irrational needs to be /believable/, /consistent with their personality/, and /consistent with the narrative/. So if you put yourself in that person's shoes, it should be clear to see how they might act irrationally in that situation, given their personal disposition. And it should be equally clear to see how the story flows from and is influenced by that character's actions.
