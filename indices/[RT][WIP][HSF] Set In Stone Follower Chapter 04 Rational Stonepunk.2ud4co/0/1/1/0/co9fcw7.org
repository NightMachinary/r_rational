I actually caught that you were going for that, and it's a subtle thing to convey, so you're doing well there. The parts that I thought could use shortening - and it looks like it needs less of it now than it did when I first wrote my comment so maybe this is what you touched up - are these two paragraphs:

#+begin_quote
  “A swineherd's carriage?” I looked back at the carriage. Knowing the name started to let me imagine the functions, and some of the strangeness started to make more sense. The bundle of slats. The holes in the planks that extended beyond the bottom of the frame of the carriage slightly. The slats matched the holes. I slid a slat out of the bundle and it fit into one of the holes in the plank with just a little room to wriggle. It extended about a foot out of the top of the hole. “The slats can make a pen under the carriage?”

  [Perfectly fine paragraph between them.]

  I put the slat back in the bundle and secured it. Then I noticed that there was no door on this side of the carriage. Looking inside the window, I did not see two benches facing one another as I expected. There was no little aisle between the two benches that didn't exist. There was one very long, wide padded bench underneath the window I was looking in, on the side with no door. No, the padding was a mattress. The bench was a bed. There were two cabinets, one on either side of the door opposite where I was looking. There were little storage compartments of many different types everywhere. I scanned the interior through the glass. A few shelves with high lips so things wouldn't slide off easily. Side-swing doors over cubicles. Netting across the ceiling. Pull-out drawers of half a dozen different sizes. “Granpa, this isn't really a carriage, it's a little house?”

Everything inside quotation marks in these is golden. The rest - the puzzling and the descriptive bits - are what cut up the flow of a more emotionally-oriented scene. It might work to rearrange the surrounding paragraphs so some of this information gets conveyed earlier, though my first impulse is always to cut as much as possible.
