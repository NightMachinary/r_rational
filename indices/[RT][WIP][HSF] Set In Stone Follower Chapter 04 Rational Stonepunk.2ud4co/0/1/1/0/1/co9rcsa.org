Broke it up a bit, simplified it some. Made it try to feel more like the acceptance of a gift than an analysis. Better?

"A swineherd's carriage?" I looked back at the carriage. Knowing the name started to let me imagine the functions, and some of the strangeness started to make more sense. The bundle of slats. The holes in the planks around the base of the carriage. The slats matched the holes. "The slats can make a pen under the carriage?"

"Very good. Yes. Some farms have dogs with more fight then sense. If you're working a farm for a fee and some idiot dog tries to get at your swine when you aren't working them, the slats will delay things long enough to give you a chance to intervene. Paying customers won't react well if they see your sounder eating one of their dogs. Around here, people know better then let their dogs bother our swine, but it still happens now and then."

I nodded. Having dealt with aggressive dogs a couple times myself, I knew how quickly swine vs. dog could escalate. That's when I noticed that there was no door on my side of the carriage. I touched the side of the carriage where the door should have been and looked at Granpa, who was watching me with a big grin on his face.

He nodded his head at me. "Go on, look inside. There's a reason there's no door on this side."

Puzzled, I looked inside the window. I did not see two benches facing one another as I expected. There was one very long, wide padded bench underneath the window. As I scanned the inside of the carriage I saw cabinets and little storage compartments of many different types everywhere. Shelves with high lips so things wouldn't slide off easily. Netting across the ceiling. Pull-out drawers of half a dozen different sizes. "Granpa, this isn't really a carriage, it's a little house?"
