If you are worried about reading fan-fiction, then try reading [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/][Exhalation]] or [[http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang][The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling]] by Ted Chiang. The [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html][Fable of the Dragon Tyrant]] is another good one to learn that being rationalist means facing a truly terrifying idea instead of flinching away. Only when you face your fears, can you ever accomplish big goals. Or at least that was my interpretation of the three stories.

For fiction about rationalist characters instead of rationalist ideas, there are the [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Beisutsukai][Beisutsukai Stories]] and other [[http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/][fiction]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky.
