You should be extremely careful with your use of the word "magical". That's implicitly anti-reductionist, and as such should receive a large probability penalty via Occam's Razor. In addition, there are many interpretations of quantum mechanics that do not involve collapse postulates, and /definitely/ not observer-triggered collapse. You might want to look up Hugh Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation.
