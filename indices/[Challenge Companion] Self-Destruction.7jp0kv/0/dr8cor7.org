(This doesn't really go anywhere in particular. It's just some out-loud thinking about my writing as it relates to self-destruction)

People who have read [[https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com][Heroes Save the World]] (which should be getting revived next week, sorry for the wait...) probably won't be surprised that self-destruction is a recurring theme in my works. My characters, in HSTW and elsewhere, have a tendency to, say, create doomed duplicates of themselves despite knowing there's a 50/50 chance of waking up as the duplicate, ingest poison to convince an enemy that a drink is safe, mutilate themselves to acquire magical power, or are voluntarily scapegoated in order to heal wounds in the community.

This usually doesn't crop up much in a single story (HSTW is a big exception, because there are so many characters), but across my stories there is a definite pattern there. Given that I've frequently gone through periods of suicidal ideation in the past, my guess is that it has something to do with that--my characters don't have much of a problem with harming themselves for the greater good because /I/ don't, and I don't because my dream has often been to find something that I can sacrifice myself for so that my suicide is selfless rather than selfish. Even now, when I'm past the point of regular suicidal ideation, there's a part of me that still yearns for an opportunity like that. In my stories, it just so happens that I can arrange circumstances so that such sacrifices are both necessary and legitimately useful (as Dan Carlin said in an episode of Common Sense, if you're willing to set yourself on fire to bring attention to a cause then that cause probably needs you alive more than it needs you burning and then dead).

Not that this recognition means that the pattern isn't going to keep going. It's fun to see how readers will react, for one thing, but it's also genuinely cathartic to write these scenes.

(There could also be a religious element. I grew up Mormon, and I can't discount the idea that many of these are "types and shadows" of the crucifixion of Jesus, especially since the part of me that responds to mythology has not ceased to respond to the crucifixion. [[#s][In HSTW]]. I hope that I'm not just writing Jesus expies, though. That would be kind of disappointing.)

At any rate, for whatever reason, self-destruction is my thematic crack. Please recommend me stories where the protagonists kill themselves for the greater good. >:P
