I would strongly recommend Bujold's /The Curse of Chalion/.

Introduced in the very first chapter of the novel is the concept of "death magic" - one of their five gods has a ritual that will send a demon to kill the person you specify, but it kills you at the same time. I'm certain you can see how someone who is deeply devoted to someone else might choose to use this magic.

Sacrifice, the giving over of oneself to another, is the central theme of the work. It is also, in my opinion, just a very good book.
