As the one who posed the challenge, I really like that at least one person has some kind of personal resonance with it. I can certainly connect with a lot of what you've written there, as well. (The suicidal ideation parts, mostly, I've never been a Mormon.)

Well, not in mine (that would probably be Metafiction), but I have a soft spot for it in the works I consume. It's still really, really hard to recommend those, mostly because the protagonist's suicide tends to be the end of the story, and usually shouldn't be spoiled. Therefore, I'll tag the names of works in the discussion below, and I'll be quite vague in my recommendations.

I invite you to watch [[#s][spoilers as discussed]] if you're not averse to Anime. They're pretty different in just about every aspect, but they do share a plot, though its connection to suicidal ideation is more evident in [[#s][as above]]. I absolutely love that specific implementation of self-destruction, and I invite anyone who wants to talk to me about it to send me a pm or reply to this comment.

([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9829580/chapters/22071191][On the Continuity of Consciousness]], my recursive fanfiction of various Harry Potter fanfictions, covers that topic as well, though it kinda... subverts it a bit? You might not like the ending, but if you are interested in reading it, it's probably best to do so after watching [[#s][as above]].)

As far as christ-y examples of heroic sacrifices go, the trope [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype][Messianic Archetype]] might deliver for you. As usual, the most over-the-top examples of the trope are found in the Malazan Book of the Fallen, where one character manages to sacrifice himself for roughly four different causes in quick succession.
