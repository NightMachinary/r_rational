  Please recommend me stories where the protagonists kill themselves for the greater good.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104089.Tigana][Tigana]] by Guy Gavriel Kay has self-destructive characters. Their motivations are complicated, but 'the greater good' is a fair description for at least a few. I think you'd like the story.
