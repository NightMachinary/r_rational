I've always wished that there were more breeding in videogames. CKII has a fair amount of it, but it's more of a side issue, and I tend to find myself giving priority to other things (like keeping my kingdom stable with a marriage for power). Worse, the outcomes of arranged marriages for genetic fitness aren't always too wonderful. And breeding more involves serious risks to the power structure.

I think what I'd really like is a pure breeding game, probably with animals instead of humans to avoid any potential political issues. But every time I've seen it done, it's really shallow; there's barely even a Punnett square, let alone epigenetics, co-dominance, etc.

I like the family trees though.
