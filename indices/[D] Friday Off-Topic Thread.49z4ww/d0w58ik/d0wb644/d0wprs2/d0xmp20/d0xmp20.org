  instead of "1 in a million" measuring uncertainty, it could be seen as a survey of all possible many-worlds branches?

When you say "I think there's a 50% chance of this event", you're not necessarily saying "I think this event happens in 50% of the branches". Not unless you're in a Shroedinger's Cat scenario where you know all the facts except the outcome of some future quantum events.

You could instead be saying something like "in 99% of the branches, the event happens. Or in 99% of the branches, the event does not happen. It depends on some piece of information I don't have, which (recursively based on other information I have - and, in the end, priors) has a 50% chance of going one way." The 50% is still in the map, not in the territory.
