I'd argue that risking worse consequences to win instead of conceding the fight is almost the definition of heroism. Then I'd argue that the world has got too many heroes and [[http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_martha.htm][not enough engineers.]]

Heroes are reactive, they respond to crisis by rising to the call. Almost everybody will do this, especially when they're part of a group or are given direction by an authority... but they don't like to make hard choices: Save everyone, leave none behind, sacrifice yourself first.

Engineers are proactive, they analyze the situation and propose long-term solutions to potential problems at great expense, and no matter how many problems never materialize because of their efforts they still get blamed when the one they didn't foresee pops up.

We reward heroes, as a society and as a species, because their heroic actions are right out in the open. Something terrible was happening right then and there and somebody walked in and dealt with it.

We do reward engineers, but as a business or as a civilization. Society and species don't need that sort of foresight as often. What they see is the extra costs (in time, money, labor, or comfort) that they have to bear to build the engineers' reinforcements, and those rare mad disasters that slip through nonetheless.

Heroes look good in the super-charged moment, engineers only look good in aggregate and in the long view.

Now there are people who run into a burning building and die for no reason. We don't tell stories about them. There are leaders who end up losing more lives because they were unwilling to surrender a few. We don't celebrate them. That dark side of the heroic enterprise is depressing and makes for lousy legends and crappy movies.
