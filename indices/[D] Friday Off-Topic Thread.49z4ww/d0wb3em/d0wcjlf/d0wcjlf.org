If by "In Media" you include books that have been published, google says there have been 129 million books published in the traditional manner. In a typical book, you can expect there to be at least 10 characters (but sometimes many more). Assuming 100M of the 129M books are fictional, a reasonable lower bound is 1 Billion fictional characters. There are plenty of other sources for fictional characters, like movies, periodicals, unpublished books, fanfiction, and people just posting stories online or published for free on kindle.
