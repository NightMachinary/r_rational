I'm slowly learning to code. Very slowly, since I'm only spending an hour or two per day on it. At the moment, almost half of what I learn is coming from breaking things I didn't mean to and then figuring out what went wrong.

Also, it turns out scripts don't care about common sense. I know this is coding 101, but it's one thing to hear other people talk about it and quite another to have your browser crash because your random choice picker keeps looping and looking for something that doesn't exist.
