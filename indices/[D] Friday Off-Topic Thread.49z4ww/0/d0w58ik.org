Does anybody here get annoyed by scenes in a fiction where the smart guy or computer says there is a 1 in a million chance of winning the day and that they should do the [some unpalatable alternative action]....and the the heroes risk it all anyway to win anyway?

I mean it's one thing to try anyway, because if they don't then world will end, but if the alternative is to concede to the villain, then they can allow others to eventually try forming a resistance movement or something similar later. Risking even worse consequences to win instead of properly conceding to fight another day *isn't* heroism.

It was a brilliant, climatic idea for a trope when the first writer used it, but not when it's so commonly used nowadays that I consider it lazy writing if someone tries writing in some low odds to "stop" the hero from trying. It's one thing if the hero is trying to win against improbable odds, but it's another thing to actually state it directly to show off the hero's resolve, when we can already see it for ourselves.

Does anyone else have an alternative view or point?
