Heh, yeah I've read it before and it's part of the reason why I now see heroes the way I do.

To be fair, it's not that I see heroes as a bad thing, but I just think too many writers see them as reckless characters who always choose the 'right' thing to do even when the right thing is only chosen due to story logic instead of rational/sane reasons.

I have a long, /long/ rant about how the true meaning of heroism is to be a symbol to do better for a people and that to be a hero is to push past fear, always strive to become a better person, and to accept one's failures when it happens.
