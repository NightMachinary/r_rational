Honestly, I Shall Seal the Heavens has the highest quality translation I've seen in a while. It's steeped in Buddhist principals and all the standard xianxia stuff, though. But the translator tells you which chapter so-and-so last appeared, and where he got such and such ability, so it's easy to pick up whenever.
