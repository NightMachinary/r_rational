I /want/ to get into reading translated light novels and wuxia, but as I've ranted about before, I hate how stilted the writing becomes due to the translations. Weird grammar choices being repeated, uncommon words that always seem a bit out of place, and naming conventions that always seem a little ridiculous. And that's on top of the fact that most of these stories have webnovel origins, which leads to the same problems fanfics have, and I'm pretty intolerant of harems overall (there are a few notable exceptions, but not many).

I'll be trying out coiling dragon, though. Hopefully it's greater relative fame leads to a higher quality translation.
