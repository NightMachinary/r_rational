I've been reading a lot of xianxia (Sort of like Chinese high-fantasy) recently. It scratches a few itches that I wasn't really getting anywhere else, and I think more people should read the genre just to see if it's their thing. So here's some recommendations.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/cdindex-html/][Coiling Dragon]] - One of the most popular xianxia stories. It's about Linley Baruch, a child from a once-great clan, and his struggle to become strong enough to restore the clan and protect those he cares about. The translation is complete.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/st-index/][Stellar Transformations]] - By the same author as Coiling Dragon, this one is set in a world more similar to our own when compared to Coiling Dragon. Noteably, Stellar Transformations has stars, planets and an entire cosmos for Qin Yu to roam about in. Qin Yu starts as a boy who's body's condition prevents him from training in the way everyone else does, leaving only the most difficult and painful way that no-one has ever truly succeeded in. After finishing the books on wuxiaworld, you have to go to translation nations to find the rest.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/][I Shall Seal the Heavens]] - My favourite novel currently being translated. A deep world with many factions and ways of life to explore, and many mysteries to be uncovered. The story follows Meng Hao, a failed scholar who is abducted into the Reliance Sect, as he journeys throughout the nine mountains and seas(the universe in the buddhist faith) to uncover mysteries, amass strength, and build a great fortune.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/atg-index/][Against The Gods]] - The One Punch Man of xianxia, it takes common tropes and pushes them as far as they can go. And does it better than most. Yun Che, a man hated across his home continent, is reborn into the body of a crippled child with the same name as him. He uses his past life's memories, and more than a little luck, to forge a path to become as strong as he can be, and to build a harem.
