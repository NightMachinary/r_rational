**** What is Mafia?

To put very simply, Mafia is a game of lying. There is a group of people, some of them are lying and some are telling the truth. Your job is to figure out who is lying, or if you are lying to convince the rest of the group that you are telling the truth.

To elaborate, the game is divided into two teams: the town and mafia. Mafia know who each other are and can coordinate their actions privately. Townies on the other hand don't know anything other than their own role. To compensate, there are many more townies than mafia; usually the ratio is 1 mafia for every 4 townies. In other words, Mafia is a game of an informed minority against an uninformed majority. Can the mafia use its superior organization and knowledge to lead the town astray? Or can the town figure out the mafia and kill them before their numbers advantage runs out?

At the beginning of the game you are PM'ed your role. The game is divided into two repeating phases: day and night. Days last 48 hours and revolve around deciding a lynch target by means of voting. Every player in the game gets one vote, and each player must argue and convince the others to lynch their target. At the end of the day the person with the most votes is lynched; their alignment and role are revealed and they are removed from the game. The majority of the action in the game takes place during the day phase.

Night is 24 hours long and is reserved for private actions. Any player in the game that has an ability (such as mafia kills, detective checks, medic protections, etc.) can use their power in this phase. Usually during the night everyone discusses the results of the lynch and makes plans for the next day. It serves as downtime from the emotionally charged days. After the night ends, a day post comes up with the results of who dies. After the day post, the discussion for lynch begins anew.

Once there is a winner, everyone will typically weigh in on the game with their thought process and advice. Many times the hosts or observers will contribute their thoughts as well.

Mafia is a game of *logic*, *intuition*, *persuasiveness*, *reading ability*, *emotion*, and *will*. In short, *it's a thinker's game*. There are many different ways to approach the game and every game is a very different experience. Whether you are looking to test and improve your intelligence or have a unique, fun experience, Mafia is the right game for you.

Be warned: Mafia requires a time commitment. This generally depends on the player, but at minimum 1 to 2 hours a day of solid effort is required. Some players spend as much as 8 or 10 hours a day playing Mafia. More time spent gives you a better chance at making the right decisions, but you can do a very acceptable job with just 1 to 2 hours a day. Mafia games typically last between 1 and 2 weeks, but usually you will die at some point before it ends.

As part of the time commitment, mafia requires a great deal of reading. Most people actually are very poor at reading comprehension and playing Mafia is a great way at improving your reading ability. As you also must be posting each cycle, Mafia is a good way to improve your writing and ability to think and argue logically.

In addition, mafia is not for the faint-hearted or overly emotional. While not occurring every game, sometimes people can get into very heated arguments with one another. People can get very emotional playing Mafia, as it is a high-intensity endeavour. That being said, playing Mafia is an excellent way for developing thick skin, improving your patience, and making yourself a stronger person mentally. In addition, there's an unspoken rule that arguments are kept in the game. After the game is over and everyone cools down, there is rarely any bad blood. Some people may be harsher than others, but almost everyone is here to help each other learn and improve.

**** Why forum Mafia? Why play on TL?

Many people have played mafia in real life and wonder how you can play it online. After all, real life games are in a much shorter period, with no accurate information logging, and let you interact in a more informative medium than text. To put it simply, yes you can play mafia online without any problems. No, it is not quite the same and you will need to adjust your approach and play slightly.

In forum mafia, you have the ability to view logs over a period of days instead of relying on memory during a chaotic 20 minutes. You find mafia by analyzing motives, objectives for posting, and closely scrutinizing what people write. Naturally arguments are more sterile as it is based solely on cold text.

Think of the difference between forum and real life mafia as this: for the former, imagine a detective hard at work, pouring over reports, speeches, and witnesses trying to solve a murder; in the latter case, a detective grills someone in an interrogation room and tries to outwit or break them. Both have their perks and while the overall goal is the same, both require different skill sets to master.

As a magnified version of TL, this is a tight-knit community. Many players are long-time members, and you'll frequently be playing games with the same people. Like a real mafia, we watch out for our own.

**** How do I join a game? What are the different types of games?

If you want to join a game, just wait until the next game is unveiled and type /in. Usually if you check the forum once every other day or so you won't miss out on anything coming up. You can check the active mafia games list at at the top of the forum to see what games are coming up soon. Be warned: some games, especially by certain hosts, are very popular and tend to fill up fast.

The amount of games going on depends on activity, but the goal is to have between two or three games simultaneously happening. Do your part and help make this happen!

There are three different types of games: normal, themed, and mini. Normal games are the mainstay of the forum. They typically have 20 to 30 players, and the rule sets only differ slightly between games. If you sign up for a normal game, you know what you're getting into. Setups will almost always have a good degree of balance and you can expect to have a fair shot at winning no matter which side you are on. Normal games are where the highest level of play and activity is. If you want competition, this is where it's at.

Themed games encompass a wide variety of types. Usually they have unique roles, flavor, and game mechanics. Many hosts like to try their pet setups or whatever kooky idea they came up with. As such, theme games tend to hit or miss. There have been some very good ones, and some complete busts. Since the setups can be strange, there are usually opportunities to win by thinking outside the box and developing unique strategies.

Mini games are special 9 to 15 player setups which may be normal or themed. Since there are a smaller number of players, there is generally less to read and fewer players you will have to analyze. However this means that there is more pressure on you to fulfill your role, as one person represents a higher percentage of the total players than in a normal game.
