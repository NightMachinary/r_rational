I just /really/ like the idea of intergalactic space as a setting. The only reason to travel intergalactically is to avoid a galactic catastrophe, of which I can think of none except for a vacuum metastability event.

Intergalactic space is orders of magnitude less dense than interstellar space (the average density of the universe is 1 proton per 4 cubic metres). But I'll read the paper in more depth to see if I can calculate how dangerous those stray protons would be. Of course, exiting and entering galaxies would be problematic, but (if it's a entire system) they have entire planets worth of shielding, as long as they can point it in the right direction.

I was considering a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_starship][Black Hole Starship]] at the centre of the system, where the planets used the blueshifted CBR as their "sun". Alternatively, the system could have been ejected during a galactic collision event, which is possible but unlikely (fastest moving star is 0.1c).

The ship (or system, as it's seems to have shifted to) would have genetic storage, but even I'm not convinced that a small Von Neumann machine filled with genetic information and social norms could survive the millions to billions of years in intergalactic space. Whereas "life (er) finds a way" because it has the resources to self-replicate and evolve during the journey.

If you sent a ball of Von Neumann machines they might make it.
