  A hard-sf intergalactic odyssey. Starts a little after halfway through the journey, with civilization having developed over a million years under a starless sky, having forgotten why their ancestors launched them into space. Not sure if it's going to be an O'Neill Cylinder or an entire star system. Also, if anyone can tell me if the flux of the cosmic background radiation can substitute for sunlight at near-lightspeed, that would be appreciated.

Near-lightspeed will [[http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?paperID=23913][kill everyone with X-rays and sparse hydrogen gas,]] so no, the blueshifted CMB cannot be used as sunlight, even if it /were/ energetic enough. Everyone will be behind a ton of shielding. Have you actually calculated any of this, the distance, times, and energies required? The sheer difference in mass and volume between an O'Neill Cylinder and /a solar system?/ The actual energy budget of the thing, and how you're getting this energy? What reasons do you have for making it a generation ship instead of preserving energy with cryonics or genetic storage or /anything else/ and making the whole thing /as small as possible,/ other than as a hook for the same old politics and ontological mystery? /What reasons do you even have for traveling intergalactically?/

The only feasible way you can sustain an entire civilization intergalactically is with a star, and using a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engine][Shkadov thruster]] on our sun for one million years yields a delta-V of /twenty meters per second./

You either need to work on your science and setting, or give up on hard-SF for intergalactic travel.
