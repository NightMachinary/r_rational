Two Points of Contact: The aliens encountered were meant to be memetic in nature, requiring a memory wipe to prevent them from being spread. But yeah, I think the concept boils down to "I want to re-read Blindsight". I should do that next week.

Intergalactic: After a million years, I think evolution would begin to take its toll on the body, with its cycles of technology and barbarism. The halfway point would be the beginning of deceleration; the plot was to be the rediscovery of purpose (which has been forgotten over the past million of years or so), and the awakening of mostly broken/destroyed constructs who try to prepare the civilization(s) for the changes to come.

I'll keep working on Future Horismos. Current plot line is quite the Sam Hughes-smorgasbord: a version of Oul appears, a version of Tanako's World as well. I also tried to make the Anomalies antimemetic as well, but I can't actually think of any ways antimemes would work except by magic.

(on a related note, memetics is really the only think I find scary nowadays. Only when something can invade your mind and change your behaviour without you realizing it does it seems scary)
