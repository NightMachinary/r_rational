Future Horismos: I like what you've got so far, feels like reading Fine Structure all over again. If anything, it hews a bit too close to Fine Structure specifically - good artists copy, great artists steal.

Two Points of Contact: If I wanted to re-read Blindsight, I'd re-read Blindsight. Again, acknowledge your inspirations but don't forget to take the story in your own direction. Secondly, amnesia as a plot device is overused, self-induced amnesia especially. Other than that, it's a promising outline.

Intergalactic: While I think [[/u/Transfuturist]]'s comment below is a bit harsh, I agree with the main thrust of it. Intergalactic travel is ridiculously difficult. I also have my doubts that you can make the halfway point of a megayear journey in any way meaningful to your characters. But! I'd love to hear more about the sort of technological society that can survive for ten million years (look at all the crises we've faced in the last century and then multiply those by a hundred thousand) and still accomplish their mission when they arrive.

Gratuituous Space Battles: This is the only one that I don't like. It's not a story, it's brainstorming for a story. "What will 22nd-century space battles actually look like" is a question for NASA engineers and the military, not science-fiction writers. And it's one thing to start from "my protagonist is going to be an ace pilot, so I need a world where ace pilots can exist" when you have a specific story in mind, but if you just want cool spaceships for the sake of cool spaceships... well, by all means write it if that sounds fun to you, but I have no interest in reading it.

In short, they're all good inspirations for stories. But to misquote someone-or-other, writing is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. The ideas aren't worth anything until you build them into a story. So if you want my recommendation, I'd say to keep writing Future Horismos, because it's the one you've already started and you'll get nowhere if you keep throwing out your unfinished work.
