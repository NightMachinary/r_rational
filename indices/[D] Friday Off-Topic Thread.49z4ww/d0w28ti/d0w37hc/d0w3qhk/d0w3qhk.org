Html and javascript. Remember that interactive worldbuilder CYOA from a week ago? I started out with that and am converting it into my own thing. I'm sure it's 'better' to start from scratch and in only one language, but making my own CYOA is a carrot I've wanted for some time, and I'm finding it very satisfying to be making progress on it.
