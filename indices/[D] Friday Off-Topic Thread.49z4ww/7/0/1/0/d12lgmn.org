Log horizon/Sword Art Online are kind of harems, but not really, as they're more of expanded love triangles.(though I might be misremembering SAO; it's been a while.) Can't think of any others off the top of my head.

Keep in mind that I still don't enjoy the harem parts, it's just that they don't detract badly from the rest of the story.
