*** Forum Mafia for Rationality

If you're interested in practicing rationality, one fun way to do so is in a competitive game environment. I do this by playing Forum Mafia on Teamliquid.net [[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/mafia/][here]]. We have a game open for a mixture of new players and experienced players so that new people can get involved [[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/mafia/505275-newbie-student-mafia-xx][here]].

I consider it one of the most intellectually stimulating things I do. It's exciting, requires thinking in lots of ways. You will think in terms of puzzling out possibilities for the game state, making decisions to determine if people are lying or telling the truth, and trying to be convincing and displaying your own logic to others. People talk about evidence, heuristics, and even things that turn out to actually be Bayesian analysis ("Although you'd expect people who do X to be mafia, there are 3x as many good players as mafia players, so...").

It's a lot of fun! [[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/mafia/][Come check us out.]]

Ask me any questions you have. I'm Blazinghand on Teamliquid. This community ([[/r/rational][r/rational]]) is one of the most thoughtful communities I know. I think you would have a lot of fun playing TL Mafia, and I'm always eager to welcome new intelligent players into our group. Right now there are probably 20 or 30 people who play fairly regularly, and another 30 or 40 who play rarely.
