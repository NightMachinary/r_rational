The flow is fairly fast-paced. You might be expected to make 10+ posts per day. Generally, each finds some time (lunch, after work, etc) and spend an hour catching up with the thread, then making posts, asking questions, accusing each other, etc.

Over the course of 48 hours, people (town, and mafia pretending to be town) discuss and cast votes to kill someone as an election in the name of the town. Then, during 24 hours, the mafia meet in secret and kill one member of the town. This cycle repeats a few times, 2 people dying each cycle. A game can be over quickly, or it can take as many as 5 cycles (to kill 10 people in a 13-player game and send it to the final round), which is 15 days, or just over 2 weeks.

A typical game takes 10-14 days.
