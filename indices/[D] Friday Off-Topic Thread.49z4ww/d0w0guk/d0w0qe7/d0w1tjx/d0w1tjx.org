All cynics start out as idealists: You have to see the potential in something before you can be disappointed when it fails to materialize. See, for example, the short life of [[/r/FinalExams]].

Rational fiction presents solveable, clockwork worlds. The game is fair, and all the pieces are out in the open. Turns out the mechanisms of our real world are unfair, largely invisible, and every solution has its own set of complications.

Hope is a powerful thing, but it wasn't kept in Pandora's Box as a mercy. It belongs in there with all the other memetic monsters. Turns out ideas are cheap. The hard part isn't in imagining what needs to be done, it's in actually doing it.

But...

Lying to yourself for hopeful reasons is the single best ways to do the impossible. Our susceptibility to hope is a feature, not a bug, and losing that susceptibility harms your chances of success in almost every arena in life.

If you can hang onto your idealism even in the face of repeated and catastrophic failures - if you're not crushed by a lack of happy endings but inspired by it - then you've got a real chance to find solutions the cynics missed and to change the world.
