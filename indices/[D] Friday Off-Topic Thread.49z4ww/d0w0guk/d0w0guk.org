I love rational fiction, and ever since I discovered this place I've come here regularly. While here, I've learned a lot; I enjoy reading the stories just as much as reading the interesting discussions here. Since I'm new to rationality and still in high school, I never have a lot to add, but I just wanted to thank the community for being great.

For discussion: What are some of the negatives about reading rational fiction?
