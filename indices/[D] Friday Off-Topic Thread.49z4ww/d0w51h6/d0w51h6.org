I have too many ideas for (original) serial rational web fiction, and I'm not sure which to work on, since I keep editing and re-editing and am never satisfied on the final product.

Current ideas:

*[[http://eniteris.com/tempiii][Future Horismos]]*

Two chapters completed, although haven't touched it in a while. Stylized like Sam Hughes, the plot is to span multiple levels of reality, starting with the discovery of teleportation.

*Two Points of Contact*

A first/second contact novel, borrowing from Peter Watts. The main character is a ship forced into a human-normal body after returning from a first contact mission where the alien probe was destroyed, the rest of the crew killed, and the ship returning after wiping its own memory. Another crew is assembled, and sent to intercept a second alien ship, following on the tail of the first.

Would probably explore what occurs during both the first and second contacts. Crew consists of human personalities implanted into various bodily (or non-bodily) forms, sometimes with multiple personalities.

*Intergalactic*

A hard-sf intergalactic odyssey. Starts a little after halfway through the journey, with civilization having developed over a million years under a starless sky, having forgotten why their ancestors launched them into space.

Not sure if it's going to be an O'Neill Cylinder or an entire star system. Also, if anyone can tell me if the flux of the cosmic background radiation can substitute for sunlight at near-lightspeed, that would be appreciated.

*[[http://eniteris.com/gsb][Gratuitous Space Battles]]*

Attempting to explain how, in any rational universe, space battles will ever occur with small fighters. Hard science fiction space battles and ship designs, under the assumption that battles will ever occur in space.

Any thoughts? Any recommendations on which idea to develop more?
