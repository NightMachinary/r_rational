Precognitive psychic powers that are common enough and operate with a precision and timescale that makes it favorable to put psychic pilots into your star-fighters. Note that psychics need to be common enough/easy enough to train to make this economical, and their powers can't see too far into the future, otherwise you could have them pilot remotely and compensate for lag with their precognition, yet the powers need to be general enough and accurate enough that the drone AIs still don't have an advantage due to speed and mathematical processing ability.

If they aren't actually fighters, but some other craft being improvised as fighters for a single scene... The enemy has a limited number of nukes, by launching all your atmospheric shuttles they can't eliminate all of them, using the shuttles as suicidal kinetic kill vehicles or having them release payload as KKV or otherwise improvising an attack.

Weird cultural imperatives. Maybe a treaty bans automated and weaponized ships over a certain size? So to get around it, each side build a bunch of really small piloted fighters.
