I'm a pretty quiet guy(well, verbally), and I read a /lot/, so I'm currently estimating the amount of words I've read at somewhere around two to three orders of magnitude greater than the amount of words I've said. I've been trying to figure out how to get a better estimate than incredibly imprecise fermi estimates, though.
