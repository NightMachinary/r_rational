As I think you picked up on, the names were meant to be a hint that the people were fake. ("Arti" is short for "artificial" which probably wasn't obvious, "Jen Erative" I think is pretty straightforward.) The section "It didn't feel real. Arti realized his heart was hammering. When had that started? He couldn't even remember what he'd been working on earlier, everything outside of the facility was a vague blur of unimportance." was also supposed to be a hint.

The AI is basically wargaming; simulating lots of different types of people and seeing how different approaches affect them. Arguably a superintelligence would do this in some more abstract way rather than literally simulating a bunch of universes, but eh, it's a story.
