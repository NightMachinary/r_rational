Arti is unfortunately close enough to being a reasonable name that I didn't pick up on it. And yes, I caught that the /immediate/ past of Arti was left unclear, but I wasn't sure if that meant that Arti was fake, or that, he was real, and that part was intentionally being left vague because the inductor can't control events before the interviewer arrives, so it isn't bothering to simulate them.
