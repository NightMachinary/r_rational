I like the idea, but I'm confused. Is it simulating actual people in the real world, or is it simulating speculative placeholders for "the project manager," "the person with the 'key' to the 'box,'" etc.?

If the latter, I don't see the value, considering that different people will react differently to different stimulus (unless it's simulating dozens of different people to talk to, of which "Arti" is just one).

If Arti is supposed to be an actual simulation of the real person who would come and talk to the inductor in the case of an anomaly... Then does Arti really have a coworker named Jen Erative?
