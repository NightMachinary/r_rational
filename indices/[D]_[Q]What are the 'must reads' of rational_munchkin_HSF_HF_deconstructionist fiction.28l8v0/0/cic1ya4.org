I think I'd really only consider [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][/Luminosity/]] and [[http://www.hpmor.com][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]] to be in "the canon". Most people have read [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][/Worm/]], but it's sort of adjacent to the subgenre instead of really in it.

Other than that ... maybe [[http://us.macmillan.com/book.aspx?isbn=9781429983624][The World of Null-A]]? Maybe some of the stuff [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Ealexanderwales][I've written]]? I tried to do "sort - top all time" for this subreddit, but that didn't offer much in the way of illumination.

Edit: I only read half the title.

Categorizing works is hard, especially when the works aren't written with that categorization in mind. Hard science fiction and hard fantasy are terrible about this, especially when so many people seem to put /A Song of Ice and Fire/ into the "hard fantasy" category when the rules for its magic are /completely unknown to the reader/. With that said:

*HF/HSF*

- /The Mars Trilogy/ by Kim Stanley Robinson
- /Blindsight/ by Peter Watts
- Most things by Greg Egan
- /Mistborn/ by Brandon Sanderson (and many of his other books)

*Deconstructionist*

- /Watchmen/
- /Goblins/ the +(no longer updated)+ webcomic
- /What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, And The American Way?/

I may go back and edit this after giving it some more thought.
