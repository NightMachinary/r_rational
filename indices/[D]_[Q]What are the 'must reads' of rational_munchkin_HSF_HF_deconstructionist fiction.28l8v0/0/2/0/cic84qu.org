I can definitely see the resemblance. I loved the first book in that series, but remember feeling more and more let down as I went on until eventually I stopped. I think part of the essential problem of munchkinism is that eventually you break the world wide open and change everything, which most authors don't seem willing to do. But I must have read those books back in the 90s, so maybe I'm getting some of the details wrong.
