[Author of The Two Year Emperor here]

First off, thanks so much for including it...I'm flattered. And yes, not breaking the world is a problem. I've been having to deal with that for dozens of chapters now. I'm fairly satisfied with my solution but YMMV.

No, it never appeared anywhere else. Although <shameless plug>I do have a spinoff novelette over on [[http://greendogpress.blogspot.com/][GreenDogPress]]</shameless plug>, being sold for $1. (It's my MVP to see if people will pay for my writing. If so, I'll do more.)

I read and loved the Wizardry series as a kid (although the first book was definitely the strongest; he clearly wasn't expecting to write sequels and didn't leave himself a lot of outs, so the others had a "um...look! magic thingy!" feel).

The biggest influence on 2YE, however, was The Guardians of the Flame series by Joel Rosenberg. Fun series; a group of D&D players are translated into the game as their characters. They start off fighting to get home and then run into some difficulties: does the guy with muscular dystrophy want to go back, or does he want to stay a badass berserker dwarf? Can the team walk away from the anti-slavery fight they accidentally started? And so on. The only real Munchkinism is that their wizard happens to be a civil engineer so...yeah.

In a similar vein is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Stargard#The_Cross_Time_Engineer][The Cross Time Engineer]] and its sequels, by Leo Frankowski. An engineer gets sent back in time to 1231, just before the Mongol invasion of Poland. He's got 9 years to gain enough influence that he can gear up Poland and its environs to hold off one of the greatest armies in history.
