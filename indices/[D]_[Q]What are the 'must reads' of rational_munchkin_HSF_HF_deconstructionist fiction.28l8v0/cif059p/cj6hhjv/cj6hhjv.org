Just reading it (Next enemy: Crowned Death) and it feels more and more draggy. Maybe it is the Munchkinry-genre, but I do not think the last fights really pushed the story further. For example, the whole Dark-Angel-Underworld-Army war seems unnecessary to me. In contrast the Reaper Arena challenge was awesome.

It is also quite long with 700k words. Lord of the Rings is 500k words.
