Why not make one for popular rational fiction available for free online? It could be invaluable for those just starting to become interested in the genre our hubble subreddit has been hoping to build up over time.

Also having events effectively celebrating our communities best contributions so far and reflecting on such just sounds like a good idea in general whenever we add new works to this ever growing list. I know I would thoroughly enjoy it.

Not to mention that by having such highly-lauded recommendations at the forefront of our subreddit for every new visitors to see could spark the kind of interest that'll motivate and inspire the next great authors of rational fiction to add to the pool of works that this community should have the chance to look forward to now and into the future.

So yes, we should totally try something like that, that would be awesome.
