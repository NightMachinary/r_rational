  I think I'd really only consider Luminosity and Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to be in "the canon". Most people have read Worm, but it's sort of adjacent to the subgenre instead of really in it.

Trying to work out why I agree with you - I think there's a distinction between "rational fiction" and "rationalist fiction". The former is defined by the four mandatory points in the sidebar; the latter /adds/ explicitly rationalist themes to a rational structure through real techniques and approaches (ie the bonus points in the sidebar).

Basically, the first points together form an uncommon but known style; while difficult to pull off well most writers could at least make an attempt if they wanted to. The latter, like very hard SF set on a spacecraft, won't work /at all/ without an unusual amount of expertise backing it up - and since readers can try the techniques at home, assuming your readers aren't experts either won't help.

So the (acknowledged) "rationalist canon" is basically limited to /HPMoR/, /Luminosity/, and /The World of Null-A/.

One written under a nom de keyboard advertising a rationality community (by it's founder), one by a member of that community, and the lesser-known novel by a brilliant author of SF. Oh, and chapter one opens:

  Common sense, do what it will, cannot avoid being surprised occasionally. The object of science is to spare it this emotion and create mental habits which shall be in such close accord with the habits of the world as to secure that nothing shall be unexpected.

The challenge of finding more candidates was set out [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/][five years ago]], and I don't know of anything convincing that's been found.
