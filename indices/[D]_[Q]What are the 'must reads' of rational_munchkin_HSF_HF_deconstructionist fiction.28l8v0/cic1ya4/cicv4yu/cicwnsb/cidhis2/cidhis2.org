Must be my history error instead, hopefully I'll figure out where I left it off.

And darn it appears I've read everything that's in internet form then, does munchkin really only apply to DnD crossovers though, I thought it could be min maxing in anything, say learning the best spells in Harry Potter and finding the in universe way to min max, kinda like Natural 20 but Milo can't even use in universe spells so

I'll throw in [[http://www.erfworld.com/book-1-archive/?px=%2F005.jpg][Erfworld]] for being similiar to Two Year Emperor (in that someone is teleported in).
