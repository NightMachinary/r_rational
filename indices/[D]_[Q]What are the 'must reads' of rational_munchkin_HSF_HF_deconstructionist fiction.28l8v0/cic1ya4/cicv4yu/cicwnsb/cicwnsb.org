After having been reminded about it, I think I'd add in the /Wizardry/ series by Rick Cook, which has the distinction of actually having been published - see the other comments. Beyond that ... it's possible that either [[http://darthsanddroids.net/][Darths and Droids]] or [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=612][DM of the Rings]] would qualify, though I'm not a hundred percent sure on that, and both are rather more hemmed in by a literal DM.

I have no idea whether /The Two Year Emperor/ was published under another name, but I sort of doubt it - I've been following that one since chapter three, and so far as I know it's always been there.
