I think that's about where I stopped reading the first time, too. I tried again, much later, though: it does get way, way better.

Importantly, Bella's agency /increases/ exponentially over the course of the books, which feels (if you haven't experienced this in a book before) a bit like a series of weights you didn't know were there, being lifted off your chest one by one. It's an addictive feeling.

There are still some narrative flow problems; the one that stood out most to me at the time is that, for every chapter where the protagonists actually /do/ a thing, three chapters are spent with them /meeting and planning/ to do that thing. While this is likely realistic for motivated rationalists, it doesn't make for compelling prose. But the story is still told well, and it's a good story.
