  Fi's now seen an N64 rumble pak 'detect magic' device in action. We could have her spend some VP to see if she can recreate its effects. With a working example hopefully it will be cheap in VP. Cariyaga gets partial credit for this idea :).

Seems like a good idea to check, at least.

  I don't think Zelda should go back to Castletown. It will take at least a week for her to get back and that's much to long to wait to make decisions about this new crisis.

Agree.

  Taetus is already working on Hylian refugees so it might be best to dump helping the Zora refugees with him as well. The only reason I wouldn't give him that responsibility is if we're concerned he'll get even more political power. If we do have him do that we probably shouldn't try to micromanage it. He'd probably ignore the micromanaging anyways.

I feel like we're already getting dangerously close to giving Taetus too much power.

Maybe we should check if we have anyone in the capitol that is close to an expert on the zora that might serve as a good ambassador?

  Speaking of Taetus, has Zelda actually done what Lensa suggested and assigned some advisors to oversee his efforts? Maybe we should assign one of them as a Zora point-person to make sure the Zora aren't getting screwed over.

This may be good if those people were actually assigned, yeah.
