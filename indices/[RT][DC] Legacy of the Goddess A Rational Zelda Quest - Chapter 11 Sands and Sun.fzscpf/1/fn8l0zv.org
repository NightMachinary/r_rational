Zelda has just been informed that there was apparently an attack of some kind on the Zora's Domain. Limited information is available and the details are still unfolding, but the Zora are claiming it was the work of a malevolent entity called "Ja'bu." Desperate Zora refugees are flooding into Hyrule by the thousands, and no one knows what to do about them. A priority message was sent to Last Bastion and a rider there was dispatched to contact the queen before she ventured too far away. It has been approximately four hours since the news first reached Castletown.

Zelda and Link are now with the caravan the better part of a days' ride west of Last Bastion, and the messenger has just revealed this news. It is about three hours before sundown.

*What do you do?*

How should Hyrule handle the refugee crisis? Are there any messages you want to relay back to Castletown? What are Zelda and Link's plans from here? Who goes back to manage the crisis, if anyone?

- The whole party; the Lynx can wait.
- No one. Instruct Wymar and the Council on how to handle this for now and continue as planned.
- Send Link by himself to manage the situation and act as Zelda's proxy. Recently awakened ancient evils? He's the man for the job!
- Zelda, her guards, and some number of the Sheikah go back, leaving Link and a small group to continue traveling with Naibi.
- Zelda and the rest of the party except for Link head back. Link continues onward with Naibi to meet the Lynx by himself.
- Some other arrangement? (Write-in)

*Note:* Naibi will accept Link going in Zelda's stead if you are willing to reveal to her that he is also marked by Hylia.
