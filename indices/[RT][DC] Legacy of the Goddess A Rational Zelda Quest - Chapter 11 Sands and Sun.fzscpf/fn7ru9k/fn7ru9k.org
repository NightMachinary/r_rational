  And the River Hylia was running backwards.

That is a very bad problem. Were going to run out of fresh water soon. And if its running backward all the way from the ocean, thats a worse problem, because its going to salt the riverbed.

Wait... /how/ is it running backwards? does it seem to be explicitly defying gravity, or does it look like someone dug a massive hole somewhere upstream, or a massive swell downstream, causing it to flow backwards temporarily? All of these options are unbelievably bad, but there bad in different ways.
