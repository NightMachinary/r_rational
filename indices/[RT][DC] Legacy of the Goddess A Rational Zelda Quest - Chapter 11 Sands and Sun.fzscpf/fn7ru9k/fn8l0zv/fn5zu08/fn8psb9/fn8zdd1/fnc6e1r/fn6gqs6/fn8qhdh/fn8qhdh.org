On this topic, I have updated the [[https://chaossnek.com/PlayerLog][player points ledger]] to include bonuses from discussion for the last two chapters.

In response to [[/u/eaglejarl]] in the previous thread's discussion:

  My understanding is that they actually do have value, because you can trade them with other players and spend them in-game.

They don't have a use in-game at present but they can indeed be traded with other players at any time for any reason.

I keep trying to entice people to bet with them but so far no one has taken me up on that. (This despite the fact that I have given out multiple bonuses such as 50 points to the first person to actually make use of the point system by trading them...)

People seem to want to horde them and not use them. I don't know what's up with that! Maybe they should have some in-game use to spur spending and trading. I'm not sure what though.
