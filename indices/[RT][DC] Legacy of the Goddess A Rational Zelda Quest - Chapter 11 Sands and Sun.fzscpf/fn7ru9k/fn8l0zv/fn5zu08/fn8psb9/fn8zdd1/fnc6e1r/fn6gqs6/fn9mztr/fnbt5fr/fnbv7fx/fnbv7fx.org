I did some math here.

Link spent 174 VP, over 9 times on refilling MP, which is a total of 19.3 VP per instance, or, with the conversion factor, 16.4 MP. Assuming he didn't run himself raw before asking for MP (though, Link, so...) each time, let's say he's got around 20 MP total. Probably less, but that's a nice round number we can work with. Zelda has stated that she can send "a few dozen" short messages with Telepathy, compared to Link who can send "about half a dozen", meaning that IF Zelda and Link spend the same amount of MP to cast Telepathy (whose cost is "Proportional to complexity of message with no mention of skill level"), then Zelda's MP total is something like 120 MP.

So with that in mind, I'd actually advise keeping something closer to 400 MP in the banks; 3 refills for Zelda, and 2 for Link (who doesn't have quite as much use for it, yet).
