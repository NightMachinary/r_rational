This post is intended to give standard operating procedures for our character, Fi, in the Legacy of the Goddess quest by [[https://www.reddit.com/user/-Vecht-/][u/-Vecht-]] . The first chapter of the quest can be found [[https://chaossnek.com/Story?chapter=A1][here]].

Credit goes to [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/kurkistan.14149/][Kurkistan]] on Sufficient Velocity for writing the original post. I've moved it here since Sufficient Velocity is no longer being used for the quest. I've added one bullet point (" Spend up to one tenth of our current VP on time-sensitive research related to old magic or Link's essence changes. ") based on previous discussions on Sufficient Velocity. Further edits may be made as players discuss them.

*Standard Operating Procedure for Fi:*

Marked Interaction:

- Respond to questions by using Telepathy or Intangible Avatar, whichever is more energy efficient.

  - Ex. If it's a complex question or one that's likely to have enough follow-ups that it's a lengthy discussion just use Intangible Avatar.

- Abide by reasonable requests/commands for use of Fi's abilities or channeled Old Magic.

  - Abide by /all/ requests/commands when a Marked's or Marked-candidate's life is in danger.

Energy Use:â€‹

- Convert ~470.5VP to get about 400 MP stored in MP form. Between chapters, convert VP to MP to refill your reserve pool unless stated otherwise.
- By default spend no more than ~50 VP per day per Marked on answering queries.
- Don't spend more than *half* of VP reserves at Markeds' behest over the course of any given update

  - Override this if a Marked's or Marked-candidate's life is in danger.

- Magic Power reserves can be spent up to their entirety.
- Spend up to one tenth of our current VP on time-sensitive research related to old magic or Link's essence changes.

Fi-nitiative:

- Spend MP reserves at at your discretion to prevent Marked from falling into magical exhaustion.
- Fi-detector: Have Fi offer aid, advice, and insights to help navigate social interactions.
- Warn Marked individuals if you perceive or anticipate some imminent calamity to which they are ignorant. Do this only if they're capable of taking action to prevent, ameliorate, or evade said calamity.

Specific directives within any given plan override these procedures as appropriate.

Definitions: /Marked-candidate/: Someone who we've recently expressed an intent to Mark as soon as Void Power is available to do so.
