  My first thought was "Raolin would be good, if he weren't dead", but, well. He's dead. My second thought was that if we can convince Seff to help (not sure how up on Brandon Sanderson lore you are, but if so, he's Hoid/Wit), he's probably capable of interfacing with them for us temporarily.

I'd be thrilled to get ahold of Hoid/Seff in general, but he generally has his own agenda and a minimal intervention policy in most cosmere stuff. I wanted to track him down early in the story and tried to pursue that, but without any luck. If you have any ideas on how we might find him, I'd be glad to hear them.

  Otherwise... I don't know of anyone that would do so well as Zelda would. I think it might be best to send her back, unless we can come up with someone suited to the task... though I really, really do not want to.

Honestly, I'd rather deal with a zora-related catastrophe than the risks of splitting Link and Zelda up at this point. Zelda is still a comparatively soft target and we've seen from at least one instance that the sheikah were insufficient to keep her protected without Link's help. I don't want to roll the dice on Zelda being splattered because we split the party.

Maybe having too many eggs in one basket is a bad idea in some respects, but my preference is to keep them together until we get Zelda some sort of defense. Maybe if Lightsworn have Knight Radiant style regeneration capabilities that might work for her if we can get her Lightsworn status, or maybe the Cane of Bryna's defensive powers if we get those researched, etc.
