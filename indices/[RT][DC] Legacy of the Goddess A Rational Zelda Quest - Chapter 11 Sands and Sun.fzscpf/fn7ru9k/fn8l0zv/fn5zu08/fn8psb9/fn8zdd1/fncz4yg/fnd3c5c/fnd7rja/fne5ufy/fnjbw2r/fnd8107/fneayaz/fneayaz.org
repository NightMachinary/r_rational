This is speculative, but VP production seems to increase when the Marked individual does 'heroic stuff' or maybe 'notable stuff' which is a point against Vestele and sheikah doing bodyguard duty (unless Zelda gets lots more assasination attempts). I'm definitely in favor of marking more people.

I'm fine with the plan btw.
