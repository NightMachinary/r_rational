  We should definitely tell Wymar that the Lynx has promised 2,505 soldiers and have him tell us where he wants them deployed.

Zelda has informed Wymar of the 2,505 Sunseekers who will be joining the front under his command. It was briefly alluded to in Zelda's journal entry (though it seems through editing that became less explicit). These soldiers have not yet left FYI and are still awaiting Naibi's return.
