From the discord:

#+begin_quote
  We are tossing around the idea of letting players purchase (for a hefty sum) PoV chapters from characters other than Link and Zelda. This would be restricted to characters close nearby to a marked character.

Would be a good way to vet potential allies- getting a chapter from Naibi or Taetus's (or the Lynx!) perspective would help us get a measure of their character, and in the Lynx's case a buttload of forbidden lore.

The initial meeting of Zelda and the Lynx from the the Lynx's PoV could be immensely valuable.
