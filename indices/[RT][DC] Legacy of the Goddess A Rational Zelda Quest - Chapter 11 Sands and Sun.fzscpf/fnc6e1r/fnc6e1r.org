Here's some vague guesswork on the nature of magical exhaustion:

We have been told that magic comes from Farore, Din, and Nayru, and that the triforce is the physical representation of magic within the world. Not sure about that last one, but it's not super relevant. What all this amounts to, is that native magic is channeling divine energies, and one's magical affinity dictates how much they can channel, but not how much they can withstand the effects of it -- thus, those with stronger affinities tend to get magical exhaustion a lot more easily.

What does this tell us? Not too much. Still working on ways to test this, and utilize it. Perhaps it might be possible for Fi to learn to forcefully channel native magic through others?
