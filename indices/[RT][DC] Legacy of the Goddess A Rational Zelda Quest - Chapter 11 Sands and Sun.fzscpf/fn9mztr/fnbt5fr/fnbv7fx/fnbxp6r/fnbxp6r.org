Oh, good call. I misread the section about reinvigorating Zelda as meaning that was restoring her mana, as opposed to using the cane's Invigorate function.

I've updated the SOP with the following: Convert VP to MP until you have 400 VP worth of MP stored in MP form. Between chapters, convert VP to MP to refill your reserve pool unless stated otherwise.

Does that make sense?
