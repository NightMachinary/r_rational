I vote for this plan, except we send Zelda back. Zelda had visions of the river while Link had visions of mountains and desert, so if we assume that the thing granting the visions has our best interests (i.e. fragments of the gods that created Hylia, who empowered us and our champions), putting our champions where the visions say they should be is a good bet.
