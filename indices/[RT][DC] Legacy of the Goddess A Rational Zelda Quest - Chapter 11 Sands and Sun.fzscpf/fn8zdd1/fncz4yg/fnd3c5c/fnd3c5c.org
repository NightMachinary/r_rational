  We're severely limiting the advantadges of having multiple marked if they are always together.

That's a fair point; having viewpoints in two locations and being able to communicate that information between them is useful. I don't think we're necessarily ready for doing that, though.

If we discover the location of the place that Link was envisioning - say, one of the Temples or something - it might be reasonable to split the party and send him there while Zelda deals with the Lynx, for example, once we feel comfortable that this is not a trap.

I would be more comfortable splitting the party if we had someone close to Link-tier as a replacement bodyguard - say, a Lightsworn sheikah, or maybe a powerful gerudo buddy, etc.

  We need to take some risks. The situation is apparently so bad that if we're too conservative it's unlikely we'll win.

Going to the Lynx directly rather than trying to turtle at home was already a pretty considerable early game risk. It's a route that was fed to us to some degree, but I wouldn't call this anything close to risk-free. The gerudo are actively working against Ganondorf himself here. From both an in-character standpoint and an out-of-character one, we have reason to believe he is one of our main antagonists - I think keeping Zelda safe at this point in time is very reasonable. (And I also think keeping the two of them together might be better for Link's shaky mental health, but that's iffier.)

If we want a Mark in another location, we could consider marking a sheikah soon and sending them to scout. It's a big investment, but given that we can deactivate those marks and continue to gain VP over time from them, it may be a good long-term plan to mark several people for long-term VP income anyway.

The cost of marking Link was 3498. It may be worth trying to figure out if marking a sheikah would cost something similar - we're not all that far from that VP range.
