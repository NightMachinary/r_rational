Hrm yeah, you've convinced me. I was apprehensive because Vecht explicitly gave several options and this was only one of them, but I do agree it is what makes most sense. (Also: "Recently awakened ancient evils". That's spooky.)

It's also a good idea to think about having a third marked as soon as possible, although it will be at least an in-game week before we can do it.
