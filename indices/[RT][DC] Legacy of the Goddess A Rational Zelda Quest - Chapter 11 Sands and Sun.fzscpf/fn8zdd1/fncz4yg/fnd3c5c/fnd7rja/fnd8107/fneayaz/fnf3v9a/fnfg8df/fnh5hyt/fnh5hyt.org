Link seems to be gaining a fairly substantial amount of VP just through training and everyday activities. It's very likely that high levels of activity - e.g. heroics - could make that spike, but I don't feel like we really need more than one person actively going out and farming VP through heroic actions. I could be wrong. This is a risk vs. reward calculation, and right now I lean heavily toward playing it safe.

I would be much more comfortable sending someone newly-marked off to do some heroics for us and see how that level of VP income generation works. I don't see any Marked as expendable, but Link and Zelda's connections with the triforce make them more incredibly important to protect, imo.
