In general, I don't think we should be too shy on separating Zelda and Link. It may seem risky, but:

1. We're severely limiting the advantadges of having multiple marked if they are always together.
2. We need to take some risks. The situation is apparently so bad that if we're too conservative it's unlikely we'll win.

I'm not sure this situation merits sending Zelda or Link, though: If we send either of them it shouldn't be to deal with the refugee crisis but to se wtf happened in the zora domain and if a party needs to be sent to deal with it, or if it gives important or time-sensitive information that complements what the Lynx tells us.
