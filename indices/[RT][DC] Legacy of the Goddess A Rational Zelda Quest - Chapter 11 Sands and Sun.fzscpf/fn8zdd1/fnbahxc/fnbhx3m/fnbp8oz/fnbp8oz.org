I'd suggest bringing it up to Link as something that is explicitly reducing his capacity to do his job. As such, it's not something he'll set aside. He may feel BAD about it, but he won't ignore it, and that's the first step.

In the meantime, keep him juiced up with Rejuvenate (the name I made for the Old Magic Invigorate [because that name's already taken by Native Magic Invigorate] that restores someone's stamina), and consider suggesting that he cast soothe on himself to get back to sleep, and possibly do some research on Fi's part for something to soothe Link's nightmares. Also, ask Zelda if she knows of any herbs that would help with that.

I have a niggling idea in my head about what to do about the Zoras, but can't quite figure it out...
