Yeah, that's why I'm pushing so hard for getting her proper combat training. If we can get her to the point where she's competent as a combatant -- even if not Link-level -- then her magic in combination with Fi ought to be able to keep her safe. Most especially if we can keep her combat capacities secret.

Once she's up to speed on stamina and halfway-decent at dodging, she can introduce her spellcraft into her fighting style. With as strong of a magical affinity as she has, she should be able to use Energy Burst to keep herself safe relatively well.
