The Zoras... honestly, I think they're going be a LOT of trouble if Zelda's not there, and if we don't find someone well versed in their culture to interface with them.

My first thought was "Raolin would be good, if he weren't dead", but, well. He's dead. My second thought was that if we can convince Seff to help (not sure how up on Brandon Sanderson lore you are, but if so, he's Hoid/Wit), he's probably capable of interfacing with them for us temporarily.

Otherwise... I don't know of anyone that would do so well as Zelda would. I think it might be best to send her back, unless we can come up with someone suited to the task... though I really, really do not want to.
