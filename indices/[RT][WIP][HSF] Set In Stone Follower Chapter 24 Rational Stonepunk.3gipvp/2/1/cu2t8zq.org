It's a story from the perspective of a teenage boy. As a teenage boy, I have a lot more close male friends than female friends. Furthermore, you're cherry-picking by looking for important men, then ignoring important women.

I mean, there's probably some gender bias, but this is a society where manual labour is the norm, and only one corner of it.
