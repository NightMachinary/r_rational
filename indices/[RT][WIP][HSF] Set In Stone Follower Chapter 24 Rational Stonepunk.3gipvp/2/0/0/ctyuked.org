The first few chapters are about locusts and swine and other farming affairs. On a farm, the entire family tends to work. That means that the women in the family are cognizant of farm affairs and qualified to talk about them. Moreover, the farm is their farm, which means they have the right to make decisions about the farm. Instead, we see men doing most of the talking.

If you're saying that menfolk are needed more for farming, that implies that politicians should be women, since politics takes time away from farming, and you claim the men are more valuable for that. If men are more valuable on the farm, families should prefer to send women instead of men.

Allen's grandfather built him a carriage. That's just carpentry. My mother is a hobbyist carpenter and isn't freakishly strong. Could just as easily have been his grandmother there.

My mother's also an architect and went to school for mechanical engineering, so the ability to design such a thing is obviously not restricted to men.
