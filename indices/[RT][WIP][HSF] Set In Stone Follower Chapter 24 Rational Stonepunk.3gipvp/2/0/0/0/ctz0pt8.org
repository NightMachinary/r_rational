I have female characters that are more than just props, but the main character is Allen. I'm not giving any spoilers here. You are correct that few of them show up early.

On a farm, there are preferred gender roles, because, in general, men have more muscle mass, with bone structures that allow more leverage. Muscle mass and leverage is important to a great many jobs on a farm. Everyone that grows up on a farm learns to do most jobs, but they gravitate towards work that they are better suited for.

Outside the farm and other heavy manual labor, not so much. Gender neutrality is a given. There are several women in positions of leadership in the militia and government, for example.

*EDIT* Carpentry is, indeed, one of those things that women can and do learn to do on a farm. Allen's grandfather does most of the tool-making and carpentry on the Rickson farm because he's missing a foot. On a farm, crippled individuals get first pick of jobs that they can do.
