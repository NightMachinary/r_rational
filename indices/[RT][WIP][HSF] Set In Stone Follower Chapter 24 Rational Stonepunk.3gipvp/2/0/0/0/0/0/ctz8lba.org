I did not use any sort of method to choose what characters were which gender other than simply choosing. When I say gender neutrality I mean that people tend to gravitate towards jobs that they are good at, and well-suited for.

Stateman Urda, despite the title, is female. She is the highest-ranking named human in the story. The current doctor in Allen's home town is female. Lieutenant Baker and Fobi are female. Anu, one of Allen's friends in camp that gets time 'on stage' is a female bodybuilder and warehouse worker. Allen's mother is more than just a simple farm wife, and her role becomes more important later. I tried to make it very clear that Riko, one of the most intelligent people in the story, leans very heavily on his wife for support in decision-making. A lot of the militia camp's guards are female.

Women are disproportionately represented, by necessity, in jobs that require less sheer physical body strength. Women of childbearing years (who want children) also tend to gravitate away from heavy manual labor or environmentally dangerous jobs like glassworks.

That being said, in a preindustrial society, everyone is doing physical labor, with very few exceptions. Most women who stay at home in this society are going to have arm and upper body strength that modern men don't have. Simply manually washing clothes, cutting wood for the stove and/or house heating, and making staple foods like bread from scratch are not easy jobs. The simple tools that they do have are made of wood, glass, and stone.

I did not set out to explore gender roles in this book, but I did consider them. I do not write about alternate sexuality explicitly in any of my fiction because that is something I do not know, and trying to write about what one doesn't know is foolish - especially when it can be a hot-button topic for some people. That being said, there are references in the book to marriages of more than two people.
