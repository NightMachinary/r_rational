People do things for no plausible reason /all the time/. They solve problems by accident, or without even realizing they've done so. There are no supporting characters - much less main characters - in human society, techniques which work in fiction don't necessarily apply outside it, and there is a distinct lack of puzzles with ideal solutions.

The rules of the real world are consistent, but I'd be uncomfortable calling them "sane". Many of the most common logical fallacies stem from confusing reality with narrative. It is not a just world. Correlation is not causation. Qualities you imagine in people you meet, or in yourself, are less likely to be character traits than accidents of circumstance.

We can make narratives out of real life, of course, and I look forward to writing one... but /we/ make them. Stories are not simply built into the natural order.
