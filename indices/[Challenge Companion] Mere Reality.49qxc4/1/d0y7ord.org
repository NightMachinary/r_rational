It very much depends how strict you are being about the reality of the world. I mean the majority of crime stories /act/ as if their world is real - they don't have magic or the supernatural and most killers have to have some kind of motive; even when they are supposed to be mentally ill, their illness has to have a narrative (one could argue too much of one) and not just me kill random people because I can (Dr Shipman, anyone?)

But crime stories are often deeply irrational. Amateur detectives stumble across murders all the time without being suspected, a ridiculous number of murders take place in charming out of the way locations, female serial killers, child murderers and multiple personalities are far more common than IRL (even while Criminal Minds for instance keeps saying how uncommon they are it still does loads) all crimes are solved and most are interesting.
