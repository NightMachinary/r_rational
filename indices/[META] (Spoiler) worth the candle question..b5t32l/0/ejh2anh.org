If I had to guess, I'd say that Joon more-or-less told her that [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/28298427#workskin][the end of this chapter]] was going to happen.

After all, she /didn't/ get any Loyalty boosts from that, but /did/ from such things as affectionate gestures after their relationship became more formal. So, my guess is that (at least one or two of) the Loyalty boosts came about from letting her know ahead-of-time that he was going to ask her on a date as soon as he felt comfortable doing so.

Edit: Other options: Amaryllis said that she would kill Fenn if she needed to. We don't know how Joon reacted to that statement; that reaction might have been worth something

The other thing Amaryllis /probably/ said under the influence was that she would "endure" sex with Joon if she wanted him to, and Joon more than likely made it clear, as he did when she discussed it with him later, that he "would never have done anything if [he] thought that there was any chance [she] didn't want it." That itself might have been worth something as well.
