Modern mysticism/esoteric sometimes separate immaterial astral and mental spaces, where soul inhabit astral space and mind inhabit mental space. Sometimes mind considered as immaterial mortal part of the soul. Traditional chinese folk lore also assume that human is inhabited by several souls (and a lot of spirits), wich separate and go different way after death. One (or some) of those is "evil" "animal" soul wich may inhabit body after death making it living dead.
