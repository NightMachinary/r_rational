I can't seem to find the passage right now but I distinctly remember Alanic saying that soul's doesn't preserve the ability to think and that the potion would emulate that.

  Clearly for most people in the loop, the mind does not go back on reset. There's still a lot we don't know about the function of the soul markers. One function might very simply be to make sure that the mind stays attached to the soul when the soul is moved back to the recreated body. So instead of re-emerging as the result of the physical processes, in Zorian and Zach's case the mind is impressed onto the physical body recreated for them.

Sorry, I missed it. What was the point you were making with this part?

  maintain that the mind is a direct emergent product of the soul Would you mind elaborating what this means?

We can actually measure a lot about the mind by measuring electrical signals in the brain.
