In regards to where the mind is, I think that the soul stores a copy of the person's brain state at every point in time, but the soul isn't naturally able to run the mind. As an analogy, a hard drive can hold a multitude of programs such as games, but it can't really do anything with said programs other than copy them somewhere else. This is in line with the stated purpose of souls, in that they allow the deities to look back on a person at any point in time. The brain would be the device that actually runs the mind, and it obviously stores a copy in itself to work with, but it doesn't store a copy of the mind at every point along its existence like the soul does. The time loop thus creates the body of the controller, attaches the soul, and writes the most recent mind state onto the brain for it to then run.

The purpose of the magic brain spell that Alanic cast is to use the soul to run the mind even without a brain. This is somewhat similar to animation spells where the user copies a part of their mind for making the spell "smarter", except in this case the spell copies the entire mind.
