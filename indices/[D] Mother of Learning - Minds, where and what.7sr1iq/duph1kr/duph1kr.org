  Could personality in theory be altered by mind magic(rather than just memory), even if very complex?

At the opening of the memory packet of Badass Aranea Matriarch Whose Name I Forgot, Zorian saw glimpses of all the crazy stuff she could do, and I'm sure there was something about psychic self-induced compulsions because I remember it made me jealous.

  If that's the case though, it seems a little weird that Zorian doesn't observe that his older memories disappear when he learns new things and had the Aranea package stored.

It makes sense if he's still far below his brain's capacity for memory. I'm skeptical that anyone gets there IRL. If merely age brought on that kind of problem I'd expect QI to have to do some silly shenanigans to make sure that he keeps the important memories.

  Mind blank are said to make people paranoid when used for further time. It is possible, however, that only people who are likely to be paranoid in the first place have consistent mind blanks running, and that mind blank doesn't actually cause paranoia. If it does however this might be because even non-psychics have some capacity to feel the projected emotions and that lack of exposure from these are unhealthy.

I like this interpretation.
