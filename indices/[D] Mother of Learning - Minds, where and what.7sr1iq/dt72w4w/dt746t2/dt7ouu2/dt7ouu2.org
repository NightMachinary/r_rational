It seemed clear enough that minds are soulless.

I get that you don't want to say anything to spoil stuff but I would be super excited if you went more in depth with this sometime along the story.

The idea of the mind being a processor makes a lot of sense. I guess a fundemental question is whether the brain have local copies of the deep layer and the soul makes copies of this all the time, or whether the soul has a single deep layer that the mind can access.

I think that the latter would explain the most. Like how it's difficult to do permanent damage without diving into the deeep layer, simplify Alanic's postion, simplify the whole loop memory conservation business.

It does open the question as to whether you can trick the gods by changing your own memories.

I am also curious as to whether skills actually are in the mind. Clearly Zach's ability to throw giant boulders implies that his accuracy have caried over which would imply that skills are either in the mind or in the soul. I suppose they might just come from a connection of many different memories rather than being their own thing but it could be pretty cool if a sufficiently advanced mind mage could copy skills from other people onto themselves. People are already doing this with monster abilities.
