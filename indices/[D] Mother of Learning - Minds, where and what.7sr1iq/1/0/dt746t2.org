Not going to say much except that souls are unable to actually 'run' minds. Like [[/u/sicutumbo][u/sicutumbo]] below said - without some kind of processor to do the actual thinking, souls are mindless.

If you asked an in-setting scholar where the mind resides, they would tell you it's in the brain. Clearly the brain has deep (and mostly unexplained) links to the soul, but that's where a person's thinking happens.
