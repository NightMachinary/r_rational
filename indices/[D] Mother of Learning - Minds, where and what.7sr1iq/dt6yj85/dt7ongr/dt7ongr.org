It makes sense that the brain is needed to run the brain.

What makes you think that the soul stores a copy of the brain state all time time, and as such holds multiple copies of the memory/personality states?

It seems simpler that there is a data-bank stored in the soul and that the brain simply access this data bank and acts as a processor. This also would make Alanic's potion simpler. Giving a magical processor is one thing. Creating a magic processor, creating a magical data bank from the brain, and overwriting the actual brain witht the magical data bank, is many times more complicated.

That does open the question, why do people forget things?
