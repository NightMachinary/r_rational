Max Harms is writing the Crystal Society Trilogy.

Eliezer has sold some stories on Amazon.

Wildbow and Scott are writing rationality-adjacent works of fiction such as Twig and Unsong and getting paid through Patreon.

There was Sufficiently Advanced Magic a few days ago.

Most people who are writing rational(ist) fiction are unpaid; this is true. But I feel this is just a symptom of how most writers are unpaid and only post their books on sites such as fictionpress or Inkett. In general, unpaid writers outnumber paid writers. The issue is further exacerbated by how most works posted here are /fanfiction/ which are illegal to make money off of.

However there are the rare few who are making money off writing rational fiction.
