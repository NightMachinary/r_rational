I'd personally cut out "And so, the conversation continued for a short while longer." Everything that follows it is a description of the conversation continuing, it's self-evident. That's not even the main thing, the main thing is that you're calling attention to what you're doing; if you just do it, peoples' eyes will just gloss right over it and they won't notice what you've done.
