I want to "yadda yadda" over a few conversations in my story because I don't want to have to bore /myself/ by writing smalltalk and bore /the reader/ by making them read it.

My husband was doing a beta read and he reckons that I should "maybe just write what they actually said"

Here's an example of the passage he flagged:

  "What is Columbus like?" William broke the silence, placing his drink back on the table. Red shrugged, taking another sip of his.

  "It's nice. Not as large or grand as Rome, of course."

  "What has brought you here?"

  Red hesitated; he didn't have a good explanation at hand for his presence. William seemed to notice, and gave him a kind smile.

  "No need to answer. We all have secrets."

  Red nodded. "Thank you, sir."

  And so, the conversation continued for a short while longer; when it came to talk business, William asked for a price and accepted Red's figure immediately. That was a surprise, as Red's coworkers had told him to expect to haggle a little. When Red finished his drink, he got straight to work; William excused himself, to visit with friends.

Like, I want to give the impression that these people are getting to know each other - but does anyone actually want to read the boring minutiae that comes when you first get to know a partner? I wouldn't want to read it!
