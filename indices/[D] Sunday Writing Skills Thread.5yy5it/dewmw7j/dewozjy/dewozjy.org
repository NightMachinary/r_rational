I'm also writing something in a similar "first serious piece of fiction" category, and I'm planning on posting it when it's finished one chapter at a time until I either become the next HPMOR or crickets and downvotes scare me away forever.

I've had great feedback from people here both in this thread and in the Friday Offtopic Thread. I even posted a previous draft of my first chapter on this Sunday thread about a month ago and after the critique I rewrote it to be much improved.

Personally I'd recommend just post a chapter in this thread if you don't think it's "finished" yet, or if you think it's "finished" then post a high level OP.

Another thing - in the course of posting around here, a few people have kindly offered to be "beta readers" for my story. As unpaid people reading fiction by a first time author of questionable quality, getting actual feedback can be hard or take a long time (and in my case it's gay supernatural romance, so.... not the greatest fit for the rational demographic).

But in the spirit of comradery and all that, if you want to post a chapter here or PM it to me, I'd be happy to give you some feedback.
