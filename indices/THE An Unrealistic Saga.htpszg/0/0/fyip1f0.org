Yup!

Thankfully, this won't be a permanent state of affairs. I just needed to spend an arc establishing that exact ignorance.

It's been a trial, trying to come up with a good way to establish that Theo believes himself to be the smartest goddamn man alive, without confusing readers into thinking he actually is, or worse, confusing readers into thinking that I believe he actually is.
