I will say that it feels strange hearing someone who is, at least in-character, literally experiencing something, and describing it as "unrealistic", given that to the best of their knowledge, it is literally real to them now.

It's a special sort of egocentrism to assume that when you're faced with something you can literally observe occurring, it's reality that's wrong, rather than you. (I'm aware this is an intentional characterization, so it was effective, but mostly at making me want to root for whoever the antagonist ends up being.)
