Not sure, because I'm not sure on the mechanics of vacuum cavities, but sounds plausible. Propelling objects using soundwaves is definitely possible, but it would probably make a lot of noise unless you were very delicate.

This reminds me, I need to work out exactly how much fine control practice can give you over emission. Right now I'm thinking that with extended practice, it should be possible to control the color of light and the pitch, tune, etc. of sound. Still thinking of what someone with fine control of heat or motion could do.
