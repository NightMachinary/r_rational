Perhaps you're right, it would make it much more intuitive than what I had in mind.

That's correct, although some degree of fine manipulation is possible using fingers, since they can be easily re-positioned. I am actually considering having motion TK's operate in a similar manner to Mistborn, with equal force applied to both ends, because that opens all sorts of interesting avenues for maneuvering and cool wuxia stuff.
