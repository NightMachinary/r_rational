I like the parallelism you have between the four powers, it's nice.

I don't think there needs to be a hard limit of 50 m, seems entirely arbitrary. Should just make it geometrically more mana-intensive (and people having relatively similar limits on how fast they can expend mana).

If energy can only be emitted in straight lines outward from the caster, it would mean they can't quite move objects in 3d, they can only push/pull, like allomancy in Mistborn.
