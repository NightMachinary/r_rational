All sorts of shit involving alternate timelines that demonstrates a basic failure to comprehend the magnitude of the butterfly effect. If two timelines diverge from some point, then statistically, it is with great certainty true that no individuals conceived after the point of divergence will be shared in common between the two timelines. The odds of the same sperm impregnating the egg are so astronomically small. Your AU where Rome still runs the modern world shouldn't have Richard Nixon in it? Frankly, your AU where Woodrow Wilson loses the 1912 election shouldn't have Richard Nixon in it. The universe is sufficiently probabilistic, and is a sufficiently interconnected system, that data from a potential future is not helpful unless it points out a possibility you were unaware of - your 2015 Gray's Sports Almanac isn't going to help you make bets in 1955 because the fact that you have it means that you're not in the original timeline and all of the games are going to go differently this time.
