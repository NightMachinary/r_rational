*The unexamined bacterial hellscapes involved in imagining we might abandon a wasted, desolate Earth to live on other planets.*

Earth has a biosphere with the same life chemistry as we have. The proteins and sugars most of its microorganisms produce are compatible with ours, by (at worst) a few degrees remove. We can eat something that eats something that eats them.

They've all got the same favorite peptides, same favorite amino acids, and are fond of gathering and concentrating the particular rare elements we need to live.

Though alien life will likely share superficially similar chemistry, the devil's in the details. Any planet with anything more than the simplest of life (which we could probably kill simply by infecting it with ours) would be /unpredictably destructive/ to life as we know it. Its microorganisms would figure out how to eat our molecules, without necessarily producing digestible waste products in return. Our bacteria would probably reproduce quickly enough to adapt, and everything less prolific would be at the mercy of both side of that evolving war.

I invite anybody who has struggled to keep a sample clean in organic chemistry lab to imagine this nightmare on a geologic scale.

Terraforming a lifeless planet, on the other hand, even in an ideal temperature and pressure regime, is a closely related disaster. How do we control our own microbial life in a new and unregulated environment? The mad and murderous equilibrium of nature, all the myriad checks and balances in the soil and the sea, didn't develop by accident. It sculpted itself, carved by billions of years brutal infighting.

Even a perfect, carbon-rich atmosphere at the right temperature and with a lot of water, seeded with a friendly mix of plankton and soil bacteria, is (after the centuries that bio-soup would require to take over) rather likely to have evolved into something quite unlike the biosphere we need. But it would be better at surviving there than anything else we could introduce, and better at eating us than a truly alien biosphere.

Essentially one worse case scenario version of the "planet with its own biosphere" problem.

tldr: Future Earth - wasted, toxic, post-industrial - is a relatively nice place to live. It would be insane to leave before the sun burns our atmosphere away.
