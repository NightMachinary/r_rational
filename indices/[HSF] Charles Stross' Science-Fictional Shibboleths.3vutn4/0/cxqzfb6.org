Nice article.

  warships using /stealth in space/ (hint: infrared emissions, second hint: the background temperature you want to avoid standing out against is 2.73 degrees Kelvin, i.e. liquid Helium temperature)
#+end_quote

One way to do this is to bring a big ice pack with you. When you need to "go dark", you start dumping all your heat into melting the ice pack instead of radiating it. (You're going to need a lot more science than that if you're writing hard sf, but that's the basic idea.)

As a bonus dramatic device, there is definitely a time limit in how long you can stay dark - eventually you've melted all the ice and have to start radiating again if you don't want to cook yourself. Maybe you'll even have to shut down life support or anti-zombie internal shielding or something to grab a few more minutes of stealth.

(Mass Effect is the only story I can think of that has used this. The Normandy is a prototype stealth craft, and the design costs of this are /not/ handwaved: much of its bulk is taken up by massive lithium heat sinks that can still only barely handle 3 hours of acceleration or a few days of drifting. I found this quite impressive considering it's blockbuster sf that could easily have gotten away with pure Element Zero magic.)

  Now for a biggie: *Mining the lunar regolith for Helium-3*. This is junk science on stilts and it just keeps coming back from the dead.

While Stross's argument against He3 mining is well made, note that regular Helium is a non-renewable and rapidly depleting resource on Earth. It's so cheap right now that we put it in baloons, but that's because of an artificially inflated supply (the US mined it excessively for military purposes during the cold war, and are now dumping it on the market) which cannot last. Liquid helium is the best coolant we have, so it's not too implausible that some near future technology will create a high demand for it. There is still room for lunar exploitation in sf stories.
