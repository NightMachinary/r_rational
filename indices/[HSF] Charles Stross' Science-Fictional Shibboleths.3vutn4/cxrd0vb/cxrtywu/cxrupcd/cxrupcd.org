I actually dislike more stuff like how star craft's zerg are mega adapters with infectious spores that should give them crazy awesome zombie potential in story.

But mechanics wise the protoss get the actual unit steal ability in brood wars.

I was a lot more pleased with the mechanics design in star craft 2 for this reason.

It's kind of like the equivalent of show don't tell but for games.

Don't tell me this race is a slowly dieing breed with vital limited population and a need to depend on me and more robotics, cyborgization to restore fallen warriors and so on.

Show me that with your mechanics.

Other wise I get serious case of dissonance.
