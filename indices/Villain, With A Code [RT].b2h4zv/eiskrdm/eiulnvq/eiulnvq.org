Despite being a bit too much wish fufiment/OP MC with the vector powerset this is a fun read. The world so far is half the reality of worm and half the vile corruption The Boys is known for, so while you have characters that almost make sense you also have all you'd expect of a high school full of super powered adolescents playing status games. It almost plays a bit of the wrong thing for seductive reasons game worm does, or maybe I just don't quite like the main character. All that said it is a very fun read.
