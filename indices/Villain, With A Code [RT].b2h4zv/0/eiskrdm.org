Not sure if anyone's seen this before but a quick search didn't show it posted here before.

Disclaimer: Not my work

Villain, With A Code (VWAC) is a college age superhero story with the MC as the impossible son of two S tier villains and a villain himself. When caught he is sentenced to attend the story's hero school, with hints that there's a behind the scenes agenda at play.

I won't spoil more about why it's RT but it ticks the first two bullet points in the sidebar and possibly the final one too.

It's currently at 52k words and updating at least once a week.
