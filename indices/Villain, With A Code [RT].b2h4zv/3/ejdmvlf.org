This does remind me of the Aeromancer Storyline. The story has a lot of potential, as the way it does use the villian mc trope is not as used up as most others. The writingstyle is good but in terms of its problemsolving process so far it only plays the card of the mc not being as boxed into one thought pattern as the rest of the world, which is ok and good , but not enough longterm. This could get old fast, but i really hope the author is coming up with some nice twist and adds to the side and background characters behaviour and intelligence levels. In terms of rationality its not that rational right now but it could get into that direction, diplomacy as a focus point could be very refreshing.
