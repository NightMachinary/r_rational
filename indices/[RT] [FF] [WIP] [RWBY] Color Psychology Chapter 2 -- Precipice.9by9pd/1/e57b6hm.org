Another really enjoyable chapter. I am quite interested in seeing where this goes. Please continue writing it. I am curious how you are going to handle fight scenes going forward, will they be as "abstracted" as in this chapter or more descriptive? Though as long as they are better than the ones in the last season of RWBY, I'll be pretty happy.
