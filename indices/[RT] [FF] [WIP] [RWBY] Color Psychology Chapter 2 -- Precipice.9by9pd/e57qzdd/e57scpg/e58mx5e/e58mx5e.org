This was my interpretation, plus the possibility that using the word "allowed" was somehow hinting at huntsmen being in a higher class in the social hierarchy than civilians.

In that they're maybe given permissions that civilians aren't, which could be foreshadowing how the author's setting up this world's society to be a bit darker than in canon.
