In the literal case, a hunter is someone who has ways of avoiding death by Grimm (incredible violence) despite unhappiness. They are also powered by the expression of their soul (through incredible violence). Also, the less happy they are, the more Grimm focus on them rather than civilians. Thus, a hunter isn't only allowed to be unhappy - they're probably required to, in order to bait out Grimm. As we just saw Ruby do. And given that that unhappiness is tied to the expression of their soul, the metaphorical message seems relate to accepting and expressing who you are, even the unhappy bits. That's how hunters grow in power, and also get killed.
