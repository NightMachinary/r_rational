I actually have some data on this since fanfiction.net gives a per-country breakdown. About 55% of readers are from the US. In light of that, I plan to basically use the units that I'm used to hearing US folks think in, which is inches/feet/miles, pounds for eyeballed weights, grams for small or scientific weights, Fahrenheit for outdoor weather, and Celsius for scientific temperature (like the heat of a furnace). Probably also metric lengths for certain scientific or military measurements, like e.g. a 9mm barrel.

I realize that mixing imperial and metric units is in some sense the worst of both worlds, but I also want to write in the units that are actually familiar to a majority of the audience. (And, honestly, part of it is just the selfish fact that those units are easy for me to interpret while writing.)
