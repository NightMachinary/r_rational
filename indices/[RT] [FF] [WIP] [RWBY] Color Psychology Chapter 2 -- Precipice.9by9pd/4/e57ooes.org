Curious: Is it feasible for you to use metric units instead of US units? e.g., 20 miles per hour would be about 30 km/h. Or about as fast as a bicyclist can go without going into excess energy mode. You had many of these last chapter too.

Some possible reasons why you might think it's a good idea to do so:

- A large part (the majority?) of your audience wouldn't need to convert all the time.
- Most countries use metric anyway.
- Metric is used in the US in the scientific and military fields.
- I guess some combination of that might make metric /sound/ more rational to a US audience?

Apart from that, I think it's a generally good fic. I appreciated you breaking down the social rules (even if there are no answers yet).
