Thanks!

I definitely intend to write some real fight scenes, partly as a personal challenge since I'm sort of bad at them.

I'll probably gloss over most of the day-to-day Grimm killing, unless it's serving as background action while the something more interesting happens. (Because, honestly, who wants to read about Ruby stabbing beowulf #3245 in the throat shortly before stabbing beowulf #3246 in the throat.)

One of the things I disliked about the show was that there was almost never a real sense of danger in the fights, so I'll probably try to bump the threat level of older Grimm up a bit too.
