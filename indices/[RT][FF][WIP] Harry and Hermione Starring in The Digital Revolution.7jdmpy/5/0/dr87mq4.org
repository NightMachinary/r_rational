The problem that most 'serious' HP stories have with Ron is that he's just a kid. In a story about going to magical high school, that fine. In a story where HP has to up his game because rational magical Hitler is trying to kill him, Ron isn't good for much. He's a decidedly average 11 year old boy who's apparently pretty good at chess.
