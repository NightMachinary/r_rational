I've read it up to current. It's not bad.

There are definitely HPMOR influences here, Harry reads as a slightly more rational normal Harry with a bit of Draco Malfoy from HPMOR, and Hermione reads like a combo of HPMOR Harry and Hermione.

I like the characterization of Hermione's parents, as actual human beings, and the explanations of some of the canon universe's foiblesa re relatively well done.

All in all I'm optimistic about this one.
