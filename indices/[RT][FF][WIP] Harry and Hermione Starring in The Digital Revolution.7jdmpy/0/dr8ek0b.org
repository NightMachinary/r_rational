So, I like most rational fics. But I couldn't really make my way past the first chapter:

- The Portkey to the volcano: It's not that easy. Voldemort himself says it during the graveyard scene, "He is protected better than he knows." Hogwarts is layered with protections, and portkeying Harry isn't that easy. Combine that with Dumbledore's presence, and Harry is relatively safe. The Triwizard tournament only worked because I assume Dumbledore tweaked the protection to allow the cup back to the starting point, and Crouch Jr took advantage of that.
- Harry rushed headfirst into danger: In the first 3 books, Harry and co. attempt to find a teacher. In PS, McGonagall tells them to forget about it. In CoS, they go to Lockhart, who they think is a competent wizard. In PoA, Sirius grabs Ron forcing them into the situation.
- Mary Sue: Hermione is just /too/ perfect here. Canon Hermione is a deep character with real flaws. She's brilliant, but vindictive. Intelligent, but narrow-minded. By the Deathly Hallows, the three of them truly balance each other out. Somehow in the years since the final book release, there's this idea that's taken hold, that Hermione did the thinking for them. Personally, I think Forging the Sword gets the trio better.
- Hindsight bias: The author forgets, that during CoS, no one, not even Dumbledore suspected Voldemort was 2 years away from returning. It was the events of PoA and the 2nd prophecy that set events in motion. This would be an appropriate point of divergence to "get ready"
- Harry the Unprepared: Canon Harry /was/ prepared. He prepares thoroughly for the 3rd task. He learns several spells well above his age level, and they save his life in the graveyard. At 15, he's teaching kids 2 years his senior. He does a lot of learning off screen, because by book 7, he knows several new spells and defensive enchantments. He's so knowledgeable, that Hermione defers to him on a lot of matters on dark arts in the latter 3 books. He doesn't have much trouble with death eaters that have years on him at the end.Fact is, he's never going to be on Voldemort's level. He's got a skill gap and a 50 year headstart on him. So, he prepared by understanding his opponent intimately. It's what helps him realize the location of the diadem.

There are holes and inconsistencies in the wizarding world. But, this fic feels like it's poking holes that don't exist.
