1. Hermione is pointing out that Harry is taking no thought about his personal security. They know that port keys exist; they may not know of all the specific protections that Harry has on him, but from what they know sending him to a volcano is at least possible. And stabbing him to death after class seems trivially easy.
2. And no one takes the time to sit down with Harry to explain anything.
3. Canon Hermione is so OP that just making her a bit more mature reveals how OP she really is. Turning Canon!Ron into someone useful to Rational!Harry fighting Rational!Voldemort takes lots of work. Canon!Hermione would already be helpful, and making her into Rational!OP!Hermione takes a bit of butterfly flapping.
4. In the past 2 years, V has made attempts to return to life that had a significant chance of success. From these (admittedly sparse) data points, it seems highly like that V will be back before 5 years are out, and will almost certainly be back before 10 years are out.
5. Canon Harry is prepared like a very dedicated school athlete (or something) trains for their sport. Sitting down and thinking about it shows that Harry's preparation should have been done more systematic and much more in depth.
