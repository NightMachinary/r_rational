  1. Canon Harry is prepared like a very dedicated school athlete (or something) trains for their sport. Sitting down and thinking about it shows that Harry's preparation should have been done more systematic and much more in depth.

I think it's clear by /Deathly Hallows/ that Harry was never going to be able to defeat Voldemort by magical knowledge or skill. In the end, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove][he wins by sacrificing himself for his friends.]]

In /Order of the Phoenix/, when Snape is explaining occlumency to Harry, he says this, which perfectly exemplifies the difference between Harry and Voldemort:

  Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily --- weak people, in other words --- they stand no chance against his powers!

The systematic preparation that Harry received wasn't to make him skillful enough to defeat You-Know-Who, but to help him become the sort of person You-Know-Who couldn't defeat. Dumbledore's plan was essentially to destroy the horcruxes and let Voldemort defeat himself. It wasn't until Dumbedore realized he wouldn't be able to deal with all the horcruxes himself that he let Harry in on that facet of the plan.

That said, in /Digital Revolution/, I expect a [[http://www.baen.com/wizard-s-bane.html][completely different]] sort of approach to be taken.
