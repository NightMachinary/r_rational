  Hindsight bias: The author forgets, that during CoS, no one, not even Dumbledore suspected Voldemort was 2 years away from returning. It was the events of PoA and the 2nd prophecy that set events in motion. This would be an appropriate point of divergence to "get ready"

So... this story picks up summer of '93. I expect there are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)][real-world reasons]] for that.
