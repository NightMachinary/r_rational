Problem is that buffing Ron seems to be a lot harder than buffing Hermione and at least harder than buffing Harry.\\
But I'll sit down for a few minutes and try to think of ways to buff Ron. 1. Magical Space Battler Ron. Ron's love of games is not just limited to chess. He's played all sorts of wizard war games and RPGs too. He knows about things like scry and die, efficient magical ambush tactics, the logistics of magical murder-hoboing and so one. In addition, he's had several years as the twins magical punching bag, so he has plenty of actual practical experience about spotting, evading, and countering magical [s]pranks[/s] traps. 2. Lazy effective shortcut Ron. He's spent plenty of time coming up with the least effort ways to to things, so when, for example, Hermione suggests a course of action that will take hundreds of hours of research in the library, Ron is able to come up with some shortcut that will answer the question with much less effort. 3. Weasley family as their own demographic. Ron's grandparents had as many kids as his parents had. His aunts and uncles do too. If Harry needs an army, a terrible red headed one is readily available to the sorta-adopted Weasley brother. 4. Masterchef Ron. Having been trained in magical cooking (and potions brewing) by him mam, it's Ron, not Hermione, who can brew polyjuice in a toilet bowl.
