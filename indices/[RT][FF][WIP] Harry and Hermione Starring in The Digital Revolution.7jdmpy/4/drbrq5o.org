I don't think this is a very good story by my tastes. Basically, it's too slow. 94k words and the author hasn't actually delivered on even the beginnings of such a 'digital revolution'. That's the hook - I want to see whatever the author means by that phrase. Whether it be our wizard heroes manage to get a PC from the 1990s to work at Hogwarts or they make turing complete wards and then make their own super-spells, etc.

Instead it's just a glacially section of basically tell instead of show. Endless conversations. Yeah, there are changes to canon but a lot of it is just the author venting about weak points in the setting of Harry Potter and not actual forward progress.
