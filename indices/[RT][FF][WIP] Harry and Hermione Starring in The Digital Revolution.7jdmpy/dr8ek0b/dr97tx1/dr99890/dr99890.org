1. Neither of them knew that portkeys existed at that point in the series. Harry definitely has a low level of wariness, but constantly being paranoid starts elevating him to Madeye levels, which is probably worse for him.

2. Dumbeldore seems to be a firm believer in the socratic method. In HBP, he never outright tells Harry anything. He asks that Harry reason it out himself. Witholding the prophecy was a mistake, but a mistake that kept Dumbledore human, and a character instead of a Mary Sue.

3. Ron's biggest strength is his emotional support for Harry. He sticks by him through a lot (DH not withstanding), and someone Harry relates to on a personal level. Also, Ron and Harry are "lazy" exactly one time in canon-5th year when they play quidditch instead of working on homework. Other than that, he works rather hard and is a good wizard. He's also the source of wizarding lore and culture for the 3 of them. Hermione, despite her knowledge, didn't grow up in a magical household, and missess out on salient details (beedle the bard). Lastly, Ron is a good duellist. He held several death eaters off his and Tonks' tail in the Battle of the Seven Potters. Tonks remarks, "He stunned 3 of them in the face" which is effectively killing them. 3b. Canon Hermione isn't as OP as people think. She had her flaws. In DH, Harry realizes the truth behind the Hallows first, but Hermione refuses to believe that they exist in the first place. As Harry says to Dumbledore, "Hallows, not Horcruxes."

4. Voldemort has made 1 attempt. The CoS, to almost everyone, was a memory left behind. Dumbledore has kept track of Voldemort, and he's still lingering out near Albania. He's a shade, with no real supporters, and powerless. The diary is a failsafe, not an active comeback attempt.

5. How more systematic. A lot of his preparation magic wise is off screen. He's talented and handles every other death eater at this point. Dumbledore prepares him well, giving him information for the hunt. The only thing he could have done better, was prepare the technicalities of the hunt better, supplies, etc.
