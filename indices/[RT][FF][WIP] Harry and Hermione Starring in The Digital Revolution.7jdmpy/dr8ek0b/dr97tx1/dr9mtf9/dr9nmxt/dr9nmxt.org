One thing to note-by DH, Harry has a reasonable grasp on occlumency and legilimency. At the end of the book, he's actively delving into Voldemort's mind, which is how he realizes the diadem is at Hogwarts.

But, yes I agree with you. Dumbledore planned and helped Harry understand his enemy, and then let said enemy beat himself. I think it's in OotP, that Dumbledore says that is how all tyrants fall. They mark their own enemy, and then defeat themselves
