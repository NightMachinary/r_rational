It's not true, though. Not as a generalization. Many tyrants just keep going until they die, and their heirs take over. Eventually the tyrannical system collapses, but often due to unforced mistakes.

In terms of /Harry Potter/, I can accept the trope: Voldemort is a particularly flawed villain, and Dumbledore exploited those flaws perfectly.

In terms of fanfic, however, we can change things as needed. For instance, Voldemort doesn't need to duel Harry at the end of /Goblet of Fire/. His arrogance led him to the unforced mistake of putting a deadly and powerful weapon with near limitless potential in the hands of his enemy. He should have just killed the boy and been done with it, and /then/ summoned his Death Eaters.
