I guess but isn't that why people have British beta readers?

I mean I know if I was writing a Harry Potter story I would definitely try and get someone from Surrey to beta read. As someone from Scotland I recognise that there's no way I can write that perspective without either a beta or by researching say the standard primary school syllabus.

At the very least I would just assume that they would not learn about the Highland clearances for example
