The author's anachronisism and Americanisms really undermine the story. Is it hard to find a Brit who would tell you that they'd never say the word jailbird... Also the modern obsession with shoving Doctor Who everywhere, it got cancelled for a reason

Are video game controllers really applicable to wand movements? No is the answer. Wand movement is all in your wrist there's literally zero eye coordination required. Nothing remotely like a gameboy or console controller where literally all the movement is in your fingers.

There's also no way in hell 12 year old Harry knows a thing about the Vietnam war. In primary school history in the final year we were covering ancient Egypt, writing our name in hieroglyphics, not learning about American history...

If anything why the fuck wouldn't Harry make the obvious connection to the only actual terrorists he will be aware of and who map way better, the IRA. Indeed the whole fucking absurd section about them talking about history and never mentioning the troubles is literally ridiculous.

Why do these stories always have to diminish the ability of things? Suddenly phoenix tears struggle with scar tissue? You could literally just carve the scar off and heal it again...

Also can't imagine a 12 year old boy raised by the Dursley to say that he'd have to be high. Honestly I feel like half the authors of Harry Potter fanfiction have never even spoken to any 12 year old much less one from Surrey in 1990

He would say pj's not nightwear??? How posh do you think these people are?

At the very least have a list of all of the dialogue Harry ever uses in the books for comparison.

I don't recall Hermione also being a musical genuis at age 12 either. Violin, piano, every subject well past primary and even secondary education, plus at least for some shared period all of magic, and then she also reads thousands of fiction novels and watches movies and TV shows to reference them. Then we have all the trial things like ballet, you don't do ballet for a week and then play a role, you're talking months.

Also GREW OUT OF THEIR ACCENTS??.? What the fuck is that borderline racist nonsense? Accents aren't some childish speech impediment what the fuck... It makes her total ignorance on the IRA even less coherent since she's bound to have family members involved.

And then she says she knows the waltz instead of the gay gordon or something that would actually be taught by a Scottish parent...

I just hate how many talents this author wants to cram into a 12 year old. I want them to give me an hour by hour detail of Hermione's entire life and I dare them to even attempt to manage to fit in sleep school and literally everything under the sun. She has learned the fiddle the violin the piano probably the bagpipes harp guitar drums and any other instrument that's ever existed.

"Minerva picked out a Scottish jig over the background noise. No, that's of Celtic origin."

Turns out Scottish folk music isn't celtic, huh, someone should tell them.

The author is actually aware of this fact? Well colour me surprised.

  "What she means to say," Harry said, "is muggle education has come a long way. The upper class muggleborn back then would have been able to read, write, multiply, and such, but everyone else learnt their trade and not much else. Literacy was a precious gift for centuries after Rome collapsed and life became complete bollocks for everyone. These days, however, we educate from age five to eighteen just for mandatory, general knowledge. A lot of people go to university afterwards for another four years to learn a science or an art in depth, and some go even further for at least another four years to become... The equivalent here would be a master of their discipline."
#+end_quote

Harry suddenly an expert in ancient Rome and medieval literacy rates as well as class structure and division? Also considering I am confident that Harry had absolutely no life expectations I cannot see where he would even learn this information, it's not like he has an older siblings attending university, certainly I doubt Vernon or Petunia went.

Also university takes three years in England... Mandatory education stops at 16 in Scotland so I'd imagine it'd be the same in England.

Besides which history in primary school is not taught with numbers and dates and the such, Harry has never attended secondary and as such has no experience of having to remember random dates.

The concept of children being taught to read and write by people other than their parents is not new for Tonks. If you seriously expect me to believe that Malfoy went through the annoying process of attempting to teach a five year old to write... The author changed the world so there are multiple secondary schools but somehow primary school absence is coherent in anyway?

A reminder that primary schools are largely a day care place, since the author implied that Mrs Weasley is unusual in not having a job how exactly do two working parents look after a kid?

Not even adults talk like this, if you are going to give up writing human dialogue why not just have them announce their inhuman nature immediately....

Why has Susan memorised this random trivia from a hundred years ago, her knowing the story I get but memorising the dates?

You don't do taxes in the UK unless you're self employed or running a business and in both of those situations you'd pay an accountant to do them for you.

I'm not sure how familiar a young girl in 1993 would be with the concept of being a gold digger to then casually use that phrase around her parents, never mind cougar... Before the Internet kids were barely knew how to swear by the time they leave primary.

Name me a single primary school that has the monkeys paw on the syllabus

Vernon absolutely has strong opinions on the IRA and there's no way you'd live with him for that long and not know if he was going to church even if he didn't shout at the news on the TV. Especially for Christmas, and fuck in the 80s primary schools will have made Harry pray every assembly anyway.

What rpg edition could Dad Granger have possibly be playing in the 80s with resurrection being common?

Also I just realised that it's amusing that Hermione is all about equality but I don't think she ever comments on the gender segregation at Hogwarts, unequal segregation at that, not like it's a water fountain for whites and one for blacks it's girls getting better security.

  To be fair," Harry began, "I've never actually touched a computer myself."

I suppose this one is more possible, but Dudley and Harry went to the same at least reasonable primary school. IT has been part of the curriculum for a while, they should have at least one computer.

Every fucking story, of course when you go on holiday to Disneyland you go cooking in camp fires... Side note do people actually say the states? I can't remember ever hearing a Brit say that. I went to America or the USA or even say Florida sure.

Bit annoyed that they don't take the clothes to charity.
