To be fair a lot of these complaints are something you wouldn't know unless you actually lived in/grew up in the UK. For example, in America you would grow up knowing about the Vietnam war and never hear about the IRA until high school, it's just not something that crosses your mind when thinking of this sort of thing. It's not like you can learn about how someone from a certain area thinks or what historical facts come up first in their minds just from doing research.
