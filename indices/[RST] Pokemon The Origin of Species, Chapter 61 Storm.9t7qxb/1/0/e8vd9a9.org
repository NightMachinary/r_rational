The "customers aren't allowed" thing could also just be garden variety responding based on habit before thinking though the situation. That sort of thing does happen in emergencies as most people don't have much emergence preparedness training and a habit formed over years doesn't easily go away in minutes of being in a situation with drastically different priorities.
