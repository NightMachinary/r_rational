I don't who I'm more suspicious of, Tony or the family. On the other Tony seems pretty shady, and doesn't seem to be that connected to anyone else.

Still, there's A Strom Bird attack going, Pokemon are rampaging through the streets, people are dying in what is undoubtedly one of the greatest natural disasters people in this universe have to face... and when Red suggests moving the group somewhere safer, somewhere where they have less chance of dying, the woman hesitates because "customers aren't supposed to go there"?

At first I was like "incredibly suspicious, have Red and Leaf just saved the lives of some kind of illegal Pokemon smugglers or something?" But then I realized that Pressure can account for almost all the weird behavior in this chapter, making it all so ambiguous. I guess it's not about getting to a shelter before the storm starts; the only real way to truly be safe is to be perfectly safe and coordinated, before the Pressure hits.

Is Tony secretly some kind of looter/Storm Bird profiteer, or is he just a vaguely awkward guy who get hit by the Pressure when he as asleep and woke up emotionally altered? Is the mom secretly working for a shady criminal business that takes secrecy so seriously she would rather risk death than take outsiders into the offices, or was the Pressure just amplifying her rule-abiding tendencies, jut like it upped Red's fear or Leaf's sadness?

I didn't realize it, but Storm Bird attacks are probably so destructive not only because it's a physical god coming down to wreak havoc, but also because it directly attacks people's ability to act rationally on level beyond that of other natural disasters. Truly the perfect storm for a rational story :)
