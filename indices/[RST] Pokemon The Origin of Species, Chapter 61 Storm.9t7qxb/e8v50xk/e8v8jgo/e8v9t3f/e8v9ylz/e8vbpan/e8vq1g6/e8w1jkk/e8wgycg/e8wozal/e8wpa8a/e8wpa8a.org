Mewtwo. Definitely not Blue. I'd bet significant money on that. Mewtwo is the ace factor that centuries of people beforehand have lacked. Giovanni said this himself. "I have seen what this world calls gods, and I intend to tear them from the sky." Mewtwo's line is designed to be a creature with the power to bring down Stormbringers, and there's never been anything like him before.

Will it show up in THIS battle? That, I don't know.
