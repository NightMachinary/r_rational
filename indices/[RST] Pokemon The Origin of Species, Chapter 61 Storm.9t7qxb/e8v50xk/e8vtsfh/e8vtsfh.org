Even without whatever additional tankiness Daystar gives it, and even with the worst of the lightning drawn away by lightning rods: Zapdos is fast, doesn't necessarily fly low enough to be in range of the meatiest hits (and best of luck trying to /fly up/), has a freaking Category 5 Hurricane surrounding it, brings along a bunch of powerful rampaging pokemon not fast enough to get out of its way, and of course has a fear aura that throws off even the most seasoned of trainers and fucks up any sort of clever subtle plan (and limits the number of times the best trainers can actually help out; gym leaders/elites probably need to "ration" their assistance and can't just all show up to every encounter). It's one thing to have the firepower, it's quite another effectively deploying it in conditions that stacked against you.
