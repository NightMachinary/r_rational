You're thinking of all this in game terms though which you shouldn't. I'm assuming due to the destruction they cause then the Stormbringers are heavier than their pokedex counterparts. Assuming that piece of speculation, why would a Smackdown move even work on something so big and heavy? Also a pokemon such as Zapdos who's on top of the food chain would probably just shrug off any but the most powerful status effects. Although we have seen that even Pokeball training barely resists Pressure's effects - what if the reason they were never killed previously was because normally trained Pokemon couldn't resist Pressure at all, and it's only now due to the advancements in technology that it is possible but just hasn't been tried with full force yet. All Stormbringer fights in this fic seem to be defensive and containment efforts, not a full scale mobilization against them which might be enough to bring one down.
