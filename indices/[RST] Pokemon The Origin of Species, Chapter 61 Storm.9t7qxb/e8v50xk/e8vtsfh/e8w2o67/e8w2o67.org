Okay but even that just assumes it always stays in the air. And I believe the war scene showed that anti-air artilley pokemon do exist, and we know rock pokemon would be the most effective at that. Get a pokemon with lightning rod to absorb the lightning and out number him in terms of long ranged projectiles. He can kill all of your pokemon, you only need one hit with a status effect. Ice beam, rock throw, gunk shot, hyper beam, fleur cannon, moon blast. If he dives once, he dies. There's no way a Zapdos can challenge an army of Rhyperior and Nidokings on the ground.

And I still do not consider the pressure or the rampaging pokemon to be significant enough to stop this. If it was doable, there would be one trainer good enough to pull it off through the pressure. There would be at least one instance where someone distracts the rampaging pokemon long enough to set up the kill. If this thing can be killed, it would be dead. And if Daystar wants to write about it dying, he needs to come up with a very good reason how Blue or Giovanni were able to kill it when centuries of people before them were not.
