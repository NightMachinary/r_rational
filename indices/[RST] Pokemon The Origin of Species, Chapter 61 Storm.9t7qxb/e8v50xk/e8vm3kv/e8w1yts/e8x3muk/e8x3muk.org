By the way, [[/u/DaystarEld]], are Steelix more powerful than Onix in the OoS verse? Because if so Aeosis evolving would be a scary prospect. Or are there tactical downsides such as speed, which is why Brock hasn't evolved his? (Of course, I know one main meta-reason is Brock's canonical Onix, just like I don't expect Red's Pikachu to evolve any further)
