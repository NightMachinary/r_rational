I'm excited to see how the gym leaders deal with these stormbringers. This IS a rational fiction, so you have to make those things pretty damn powerful for them to rationally be a threat to these towns. We know gym leaders do be ridiiiiculously strong, we know a lot of the big name trainers in this story are very high level and we know a lot of them are going to be in Vermillion. You can't have it be like how it is in the games or the show where Legendaries can be matched by some pokemon, a lot of fully evolved pokemon in the games are pseudo-legendaries. And there are expected to be dozens of trainers in this city with pseudo-legendary level pokemon, with the leaders having even more. I don't think the pressure and stampedes are enough to explain how these stormbringers can reap so much havoc if they are indeed able to be matched by more common pokemon. If Leaf and Red can survive without any pokemon that are even close to that level, I think the stampede might be more manageable as well. You can just set up a perimeter, have pokemon guarding it who can trap the runners (maybe a wall, a psychic type, paralysis), and then capture them. You have a rough idea of what pokemon are going to be coming, you know the composition of the waves (starts with rapidash, then come the nidorinos). The flying pokemon are harder to manage but even they aren't as much of a problem, they might be more vulnerable to paralysis though.

So in essence I'm curious to see how it is explained that nobody's just went up and killed the things yet. Sure, killing a legendary might be tough, but everything I've seen so far indicates that the humans have the fire power to do it. I mean they have the fire power to get into wars with weapons that can level cities, Zapdos would have to be one hell of a monster if it's really survived this long.
