Fantastic. I read this fic a while back and the last chapter it was up to was when Red discovered that Bill had the corpse preserving pokeball in his house. A chapter that I personally disliked since I dont like obsessions with immortality, and it made me not check back. I thought for sure Red would end up on that path, constantly thinking about death, and I could not immediately click the next chapter button to find out.

Iv been catching up the last few days because I found myself craving a good pokemon story and decided to return. What a chilling chapter to end it on.

What a force of nature. I felt genuine awe at Zapdos's power and presence. The true perfect storm.

The necessity of Mewtwos existence and the paranoia surrounding his confinement makes sense to me now if hes designed to be powerful enough to defeat the stormbringers. He is also almost sure to be able to destroy regions himself.

Speaking of mewtwo, his chapters have been some of my favorites.

And thank you for not letting leaf be a terrible strawman. My personal values align far more with hers than with Reds so I dont like inhabiting his mind for too long without someone pointing out the flaws and showing that you the author arent just grandstanding a set of ideas.
