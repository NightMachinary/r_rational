That's a good point - I hadn't thought that capturing Pokemon does in fact help the defense. And at least for Tier 1 threats, it wasn't considered Renegade behaviour - the Mt. Moon attack involved the Leaders talking about some of the trainers using less lethal attacks to try and capture some Pokemon instead of killing them, but didn't treat them as Renegades. Though they didn't outright abandon their posts, they were just less effective due to their desire to kill two Pidgeys with one Stone Edge, so to speak.
