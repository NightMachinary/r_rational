How do you know status effects will even work? For all we know, this could be like a raid boss - impossible or extremely difficult to slow down or affect with any stasis whatsoever, and able to take an extreme amount of punishment. That's my own guess. I don't think Zapdos, a creature referred to by even Surge as a literal god, is going to be anything at all close to any Pokemon we've ever seen in this story.

They're pretty clearly lifted from Worm's Endbringers. That's the kind of creature I'd expect Zapdos to be. It's not going to follow the rules. Two dozen lightning rods and a layer of psychic shielding might hold back the lightning from destroying every last member of the defense in a single apocalyptic blast. A barrage of type-advantaged artillery attacks might send the Zapdos dodging back into the clouds for a few seconds.

These things aren't Pokemon. They're gods. This has been pretty clearly established in the story, and I'd be surprised if it obeyed even a fraction of the rules that regular Pokemon do.
