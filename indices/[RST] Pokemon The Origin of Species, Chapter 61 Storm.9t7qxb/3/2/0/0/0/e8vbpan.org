Still not really plausible, since other economies in the world seem to do well without stormbringers, and I don't think a conspiracy that kills thousands of people would be realistic. All you need is one person not on board, and you need people to be on board for a long time. Especially since we've seen indication that multiple powerful people, including Oak and Giovanni, strongly dislike these birds. If they actually are capable of killing these things, it would be verrry hard to convince Professor Oak that they aren't. He knows their capabilities.

What I'm saying is, being able to one man a gym leader's entire team is insane. Being able to one-man the teams of an /entire city/ is actually god like. Even without pokemon, humans kill whales like its nothing. I don't know if guns exist in this world (in which case the birds would have to be bullet proof), but is it immune to spears? Harpoons? These are basic weapons that every human society has. Getting a helicopter close enough to harpoon the thing might even be possible. Hell, just hitting the thing with a status effect might be enough. There are literal sword pokemon, you can have them suicide at the thing in an attempt to slice a wing. So like yeah, this thing has to be /insane/ if it has avoided/beaten all that shit for years.
