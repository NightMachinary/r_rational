  There's no reason or recorded evidence yet in the story where the Stormbringers have descended though

I would be somewhat satisfied with this explanation as well. For now, that's just speculation. All I'm really asking for is a bit of a clearer demonstration of how nutty this thing is if hasn't been killed yet.

  And no, even near the ground the hurricane would still surround it making most attacks (except "lasers" like Hyper Beam?) still miss by default, especially Rock attacks which they are weak too.

A thrown rock in a hurricane is not going to to be bothered much by the hurricane. Especially if that rock is thrown by a Tyranitar or by Brock's Onix. And we've seen anti-air military style pokemon in the war chapter, stepping that up to a city scale should be able to at least challenge the Zapdos. And this still doesn't take into account pokemon like Metagross and Magnezone and Bronzong and Magearna and Celesteel maaaybe Forettress and all the ghost types and Flygon who can at least try to ground the thing or to get status on it. Tanky fliers are a thing, having a lightning advantage in the air is big but it's not insurmountable. And that's without thinking about Aerodactyl and Arceops and Hyrdeigon or pokemon who can learn smackdown or literally anything that just clip the things wing. But yeah, this still assume that the bird never comes down, which is not an assumption I think we should make until we know its canon.
