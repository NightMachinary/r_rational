Now that I think about it, pseudo-legendaries have been conspicuously absent from this story so far. Apparently a single Tyranitar going rogue is enough to classify it as a Tier 2 high-risk scenario. I think you're right, and the power ceiling is ridiculously higher compared to that of the games- a Dragonite, Metagross or Tyranitar must be immensely more powerful than your average Raticate, and there must be a similar gap if not bigger between them and the legendaries. Which makes Mewtwo, who in the game has the highest base stats of all, potentially even more terrifying. It truly resembles a caged Super-AI potential dangerous situation, which makes Giovanni's caution seem really reasonable.
