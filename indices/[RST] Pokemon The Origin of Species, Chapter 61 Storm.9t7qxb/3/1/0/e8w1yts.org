Yeah that could definitely be it. Which is why Im so excited to see just /how much/ of a fucking boss this pokemon is because rationally he's gotta be insaaaane. Although it's weird because the pokemon I expect to be pseudo legendaries aren't always, like Onix is waaaay more powerful than Shiftry, even though I expected Shiftry to be really high tier (on par with Septile).
