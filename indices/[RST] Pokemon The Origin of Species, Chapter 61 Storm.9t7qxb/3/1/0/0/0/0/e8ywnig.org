Yeah, a giant rock snake having such pitiful stats is pretty silly so I'm glad you changed it. I guess that in a strict competitive sense Steelix might have a slight edge over Onix, but given Brock's use of Aeosis as a battle mount during emergencies, his speed is important enough to forego the evolution.
