I recently finished a re-read of the whole story and what best way to celebrate than an adrenaline-fueled Endbring- I mean, Stormbringer chapter!

I didn't realize at first it was the pressure making our heroes go nuts, it was a clever way to showcase its overpowering effects. Also makes sense, since they weren't exposed to anything like it before unlike Blue and Aiko. I expect that the next chapter will be from their perspective and they'll react differently.

Tony's totally not suspicious, by the way! I wonder how many people use Stormbringer attacks as an opportunity to loot the affected areas. It's also an extremely dangerous but potentially incredible opportunity to capture rare, high-level pokemon: I'm pretty sure that Ninetales, Rapidash and so on are supposed to be high tier rare mons! It certainly makes for an interesting ethical conundrum: would you blame a skilled trainer for ignoring the relief effort in favor of catching some rare specimen?

Of course, the big absent so far is the Stormgod Zapdos himself- I really hope that we get to see him in action soon, along with the Gym leaders opposing him at full power!

About the re-read of the story as a whole: I've been thinking about the direction this story is likely to take and I'm wondering whether the original game's final confrontation between Red and Blue will actually happen here. Red's growing interest in Pokemon battling certainly seems to hint in that direction. If that were the case, I'd be really impressed! After all, Prof. Oak is also a pokemon champion himself.

The other main plot points introduced so far have been Mewtwo and the Renegade Conspiracy. I'm guessing Leaf will be heavily involved in the latter, while Red's psychic development hints at a possible confrontation with the former- especially if he ends up training with Sabrina, who also seems to have some kind of Team Rocket affiliation. Finally, there are hints that Silph Co. might be working on a Master Ball to contain the legendaries..

Keep up the good work and can't wait for next chapter..this month's wait is gonna be gruesome :P
