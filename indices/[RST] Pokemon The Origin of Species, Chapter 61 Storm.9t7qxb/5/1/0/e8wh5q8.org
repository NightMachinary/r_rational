I wouldn't be too surprised if that were the case, but I think it might be a bit more nuanced than that; actively looting and stealing during the attack is one thing, but just capturing strong pokemon is still indirectly helping the city defense. Plus, I bet the possibility of catching rare mons is driving at least part of the defenders to show up and help the city: civic/heroic responsibility can only go so far for some people!
