I probably missed this when teleportation was first explained, but can't pokemon be trained to teleport humans other than their trainer? It seems to be a consistent restriction, but I don't really understand why.

Assuming each pokemon can only teleport one person, you can still use a pair of pokemon to teleport between A and B multiple times, carrying items.

With that, you can have a team of teleporters repeatedly going from A to B, transporting a person before being returned to Vermillion in their pokeball.

--------------

The problem with an evacuation chain like that is that the teleporters would probably soon be exhausted. But I wonder how many times they could make the trip before needing to rest. You'd probably need a lot of Abras to evacuate a city.

The rangers should totally start a big breeding program, now that they've got a small starting stock.
