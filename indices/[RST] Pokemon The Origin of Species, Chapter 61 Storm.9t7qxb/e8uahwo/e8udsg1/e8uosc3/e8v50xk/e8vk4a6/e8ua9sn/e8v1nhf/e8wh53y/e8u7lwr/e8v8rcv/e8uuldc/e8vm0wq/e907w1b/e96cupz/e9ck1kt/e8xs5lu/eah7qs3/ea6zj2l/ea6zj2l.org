Fun chapter.

How would the abilities Trace/Unaware go against Pressure? I'm assuming that Trace wouldn't be able to mimic such a strong pressure and bad cases of Unaware might not survive too long in the wild. Inner focus might work as well, and Abra does have that as an ability.. now assuming we could somehow learn the way Zapdos is flying, would a bunch of Abra armed with a stockpile of sleep spores be enough to knock Zapdos out? Of course, with all the storms around, this could be a strategy that could backfire..
