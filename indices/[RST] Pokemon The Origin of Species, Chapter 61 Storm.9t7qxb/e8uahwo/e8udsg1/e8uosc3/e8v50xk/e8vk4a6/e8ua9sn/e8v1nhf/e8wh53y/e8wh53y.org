The Pressure and the stampedes really does an amazing job of making the situation feel utterly hopeless for our heroes. Not in a sense of "We're all going to die", but in a sense of "What are we even doing here? There's literally nothing we can do." Everything has gone wrong almost immediately, and we haven't even SEEN the Stormbringer. It's the same as the first attack, where the enormity of the situation really struck home. Blue had charged towards the fight, and in the end they never even came close. Just the eddies of the Stormbringer's presence almost killed them, and it didn't even notice their existence.

Now, here we are, 50 chapters later...and everything they've done seems meaningless. They're able to protect a few people now, but they're still just struggling to survive the mere harbinger, the aftereffects of the travel of an angry, malevolent god. I suppose that's how the Pressure would feel to me. An overwhelming sense of hopelessness and despair, of the problem's impossible scope, of feeling like all the progress I've made, and all the power I have, is like trying to put out a bushfire by spitting on the flames.

I wonder if Blue will be faring any better.

Here's a fun discussion question for people: What would the Pressure feel like for you?
