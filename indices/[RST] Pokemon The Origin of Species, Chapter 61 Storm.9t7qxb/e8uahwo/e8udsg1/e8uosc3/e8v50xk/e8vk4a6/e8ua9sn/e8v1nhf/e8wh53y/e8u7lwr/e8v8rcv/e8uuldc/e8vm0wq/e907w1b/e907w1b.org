This seems like a dumb question, but... what EXACTLY is pressure? Obviously I know what is in the games, and I can infer the broad strokes from the actual narrative. It's just... Everything in this story is usually laid out in detail. It feels we've never had pressure flat out explained, since everyone in-universe knows all about it already.
