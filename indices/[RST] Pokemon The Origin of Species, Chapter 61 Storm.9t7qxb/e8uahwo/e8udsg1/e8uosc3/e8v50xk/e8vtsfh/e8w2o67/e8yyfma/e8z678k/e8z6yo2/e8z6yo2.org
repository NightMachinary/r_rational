There's no reason or recorded evidence yet in the story where the Stormbringers have descended though. Considering their powerscale they probably don't have an exhaustible energy limit, or at least they don't get exhausted by 24/7 flying - there's no reason why they would need to ever descend. And no, even near the ground the hurricane would still surround it making most attacks (except "lasers" like Hyper Beam?) still miss by default, especially Rock attacks which they are weak too.
