Well there might be a reason it's not possible at all which will be explained in the future, like Legendaries being sort of avatars ("gods" with a lower g) created by Arceus himself who can't die at all. Also you're seriously underestimating Zapdos or any other Legendary pokemon. Sure an army of pokemon with Lightning Rods might be able to completely neutralise its lightning, but what about the Tier 5 Hurricane surrounding it due to which most attacks (Rock Throw, Gunk Shot, Ice Beam, Moon Blast etc) AND most pokemon can't even reach it at all. How is an army of Rhyperior gonna do shit if they can't even land their attacks on Zapdos. Also the Pressure affects everyone, even experienced Gym leaders and Champions which is messing up their strategy (like how Leaf is too passive and Red is too afraid, and while they might be fine with solo plans, but Pressure hampers their teamwork even more due to them wanting to do different things) combined with every person experiencing worse Pressure effects the more they encounter these Legendaries - even the legendary champ Prof. Oak can't deal with its effects now after 10+ encounters, with him near sure to die next time they come near him. Also even if they're not immortal or anything, their durability is probably still through to the roof compared to normal pokemon or even Pseudo-Legendaries trained by Champions.
