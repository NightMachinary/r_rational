Yeah, that's true. However, I also understand that it would be insane to have had people who have killed or possibly captured these Pokemon given their drastically greater power than how they're portrayed in the video games.

If somebody killed a stormbringer, they'd be hailed as a hero of the city for certain and we'd have to of heard of it by now, I'd think.

If somebody captured one.....damn. Just imagine having a literal WMD on your belt. There's no way anyone could be allowed to own one of them.
