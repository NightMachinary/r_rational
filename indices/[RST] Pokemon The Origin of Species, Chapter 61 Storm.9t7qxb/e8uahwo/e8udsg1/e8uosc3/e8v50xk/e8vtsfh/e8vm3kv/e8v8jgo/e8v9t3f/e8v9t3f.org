Idk to me if it's possible to kill the thing, it would be dead. If they have pokemon capable of killing it, it would be dead. Pressure's a bitch but it doesn't make your pokemon's fire blast any weaker than normal, and they've shown that people can still command pokemon through pressure, and if it's like the games then one stone edge can be enough. Or at least injure it. I think there has to be a rational reason for it actually being not possible because I don't think "They don't try" really makes sense.
