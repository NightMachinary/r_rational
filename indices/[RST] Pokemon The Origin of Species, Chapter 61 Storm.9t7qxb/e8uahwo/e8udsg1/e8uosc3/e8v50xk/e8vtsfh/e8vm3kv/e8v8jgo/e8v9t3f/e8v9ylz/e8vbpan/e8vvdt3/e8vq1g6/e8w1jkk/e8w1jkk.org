Okay but even that just assumes it always stays in the air. And I believe the war scene showed that anti-air artilley pokemon do exist, and we know rock pokemon would be the most effective at that. Get a pokemon with lightning rod to absorb the lightning and out number him in terms of long ranged projectiles. He can kill all of your pokemon, you only need one hit with a status effect. Ice beam, rock throw, gunk shot, hyper beam, fleur cannon, moon blast. If he dives once, he dies. There's no way a Zapdos can challenge an army of Rhyperior and Nidokings on the ground.

And thats all assuming stealth rock isn't useful here, because I forget how it was used in this story.
