I'm not even sure 1 is desireable given that the "overall structure" of my values framework would probably seem hopelessly naieve to a 700 year old instance of me. I mean, I feel that way about the overall structure of the values framework I used three years ago right /now/. Regardless of if soemone else's structure was already actually pretty good, they could /still/ eventually realise that they were stuck in a local optimum, and that replacing what they thought was good wholesale with a better overall conception which is internally irreconcilable with the previous system was a good idea.

That said, use your magic to put a sentient bomb curse with full access to your thoughts and sensory input into your brain. Have this bomb contain a copy of your values, with a "kill me if I violate them to degree X". Set up this curse such that it harvests 100% of your natural mana regen when you are not actively using your regen, such as when you are topped off, and eventually the curse will be too powerful for anything short of omnipotence to remove.

Include a secondary killswitch such that the bomb will kill you if you seriously consider removing it. Your reign ends either when your values system is violated to whatever degree you chose, or when you consider enabling your values to so change. Higher-order consideration is, I think, irrelevant.

Edit: If you don't want the bomb curse to be sentient, spend a century or so creating an order of religious fanatics who are combinations butler/bodyguard/aids to you as part of their religious duties. Have them follow a creed that requires that they perform these functions, and that requires you to adhere to your values system, and make it so they can set the bomb off, and that the bomb goes off if the order dies out for any reason.

Ah, also that it goes off if your magical signature is ever connected to a spell influencing their persons.

More failure modes, /way/ more ethically questionable, but if we're operating on the premise that we basically /can't/ trust ourselvesover the long term, then any system which doesn't rely on external agency to implement it's functions is a nonstarter. Since we can't, in this scenario, make something magical with a utility function that makes it 100% trustworthy, we have to involve other people somewhere, and fundamentalist religious faith is one of the strongest guarantors of action that can be implemented on human wetware.
