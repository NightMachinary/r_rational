I'd significantly prioritize (2) over (1) because (1) (especially its definition of "evil") is dangerously vague; while also attempting to build some safety nets.

The reason for prioritizing change is that favouring (1) would eventually lead to stagnation of my self and my empire. The reasons for safety measures are numerous, including the increasing chance of deterioration over time of my mind, my morals (affected by new philosophical views, new experiences, or even changes of brain chemistry), and my humanity (may not have been a problem if my character wasn't an emperor over humans).

- I'd hire a number of advisers and design with them [[http://i.imgur.com/1e241.jpg][a system for locating and hiring advisers]] for the emperor. They'd be informed beforehand that neither them, nor any of people they are associated with (relatives, friends, close contacts, business partners, etc) would be able to get into the final group for the next several generations or so.

  - we'd also try to get ourselves an efficient system for locating people who can come up with good prediction, catastrophe, and moral dilemma [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_planning][scenarios.]] These scenarios would then be tested\simulated on me, on the final advisor group, and in virtual reality (see below).

- if the world's magic allows it, I'd [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA5PlJiqOnk&index=1&list=PLv--V1yc2QDJi6hFNhur3iAsyFpXRtB8w][make replicas of my mind and put them in various virtual reality simulations]] to test its limits and see how it changes in a given situation. For instance, what chain of events would be required to change me into a person that's ready to torture large groups of people, and are there scenarios like this in which torturing is an acceptable \ reasonable thing to do?
- Eventually we'd come with at least some understanding of what should be theoretically allowed and what shouldn't be allowed in any given situation (e.g. if my empire is spread over the entire planet, would there be at least one scenario in which killing everybody on it would be reasonable?). Based on this, we'd devise a "constitution for a person", of sorts. These would be "axioms" that the emperor has to always abide. If magic allows it, he wouldn't physically be able to go against his constitution.
- We'd try to determine what should be prioritised above everything else, what should be secondary, tertiary, etc. For instance, if we want to have happiness (and lack of suffering) of (intelligent) beings as one of the top priorities, should we consider that there may be intelligent life out there in the universe (which could make techno- magical advancement somewhat more important than happiness of empire citizens alone)? Or, for instance, when the empire reaches the age of space travels, should all citizens (and their rights to bear children) be tightly controlled to prevent life outbreak (which would eventually spawn suffering\unhappy intelligence out of our control) into far away galaxies?
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/45fqv2/bstd_so_youve_become_an_immortal_godemperor/czxlgsl][gabbalis']] mentioned course of action has its merits but there are some downsides as well. A hundred years is both a very large amount of time and a very small one.

  - Large because much could happen during a century that could change me into a person that an earlier version of me would find frightening \ unacceptable. The changes wouldn't be necessarily bad though, so if the earlier version decided to veto the merging, valuable life experience would be lost, which would defeat the whole point of choosing change over stagnation.
  - Small because these centuries would add up, and the control system would fail to contain the small negatives changes slipping through the cracks over millennia.
  - So maybe I'd make a snapshot of my mind every once in a while (depending on how much information would tehco- magic let me store), make another advisory body out of them, and give them some sort of power and control over me.

- Finally, maybe all these options are partially flawed because they largely rely on a SPOF --- me. So maybe what I should do instead is use my monarchical power to build a de-facto democratic society (or something else that's operated by others) and generally stand aside, only actively acting as an additional level of protection for the empire's "constitution" and maybe as a military asset in cases of war.
