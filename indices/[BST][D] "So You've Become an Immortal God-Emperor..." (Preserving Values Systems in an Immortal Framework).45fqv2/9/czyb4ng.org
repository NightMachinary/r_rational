Well, the obvious solution would be to spawn copies or "reset" yourself every 500 years or so.

But I don't like this solution - the universe doesn't stay put, and chances are there are worst things out there than an immortal emperor. So my focus would still be on growing. Hell, there's a dilemma right from the start - how do I ensure best chances of evolving without growing rogue? There are a few things EY wrote on the subject you might want to read (some obvious overlap with the friendly AI problem). First that come to mind is a pre-programmed independent kill switch (or reset switch) in case your actions obviously depart from some ethical guidelines. Can't find a link quickly, sorry.
