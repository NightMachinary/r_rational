If I were put into this situation, and this concern crossed my mind, I'd write down my values as they stand, and thoroughly document the reasoning behind my every decision on macro and micro scales. I'd serve as the realm's adjudicator during the early years; if teleportation were beyond my powers, I'd perhaps use holograms to appear in far away places to avoid wasting time traveling between domains. Since written documentation would take too long, I'd use magic that can even reveal true objections without having to spend the time introspecting to record my reasoning as I make my decisions, and review these records later.

Further possibilities would probably depend on the level of power I'm bestowed.
