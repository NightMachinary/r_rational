Say you wish to learn the guitar, yet you don't. Charitably assume you actually do want to learn the guitar. The reasons you give revolve around time constraints, but those can be worked around. Hearing this, you say you wouldn't be very good, then, for a very long time; you want to learn how to play, and play well, quickly. You can solve that by taking a learning vacation. You make other excuses.

What is your true objection to learning guitar? Obviously this is a hypothetical, so we can't know. I'm guessing you're just lazy, i.e. you'd rather spend free time doing other things than learning guitar, i.e. you don't actually want to learn how to play guitar all that much.

Another example:

[EXT.] IN FRONT OF TWO RESTAURANTS

- "What food shall we eat, Indian or pizza? I'd vastly prefer Indian."
- "Hmm, I don't know, why don't we just go with pizza."
- "You don't like Indian? I'd very much like to not eat pizza."
- "No, I like Indian. I just want pizza right now."
- "It would be very distressing to me if we ate pizza. Why can't we just get Indian?"
- "I'm not feeling it right now."
- "Is that the real reason? You initially seemed ambivalent, and I have a strong preference for Indian; we should go with the choice that's most strongly preferred, namely, Indian."
- "You know what, I'll just get a pizza and bring it into the Indian place. We'll both be happy, that way."
- "Sure, but if you have some objection to eating Indian I'm fine with bowing to it and getting pizza together."
- "Nah, it's fine. Go get us a table for outside at the Indian place, I'll go get my pizza."

The true objection for not eating Indian was something embarassing, like indigestion, getting a runny nose when eating spicy food, not liking the look of it even if they like the taste, a craving for pizza to which they'd rather not admit, etc.

Sloppy explanation. Here, the LW [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/wj/is_that_your_true_rejection/][post]] is clearer.
