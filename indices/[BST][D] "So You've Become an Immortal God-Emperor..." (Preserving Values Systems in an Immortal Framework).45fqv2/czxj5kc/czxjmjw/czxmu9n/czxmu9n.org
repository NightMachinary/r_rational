[[/r/rational][r/rational]] is a subreddit for rational fiction, by the way. I think rational fiction is a great teaching tool but if you're really serious about values frameworks I don't think this is where you'll get your answer. In the meantime, I'll make a joke once in a while, and nobody is harmed in the process.

Or if you like you can consider my comment to be presenting the important issue that the immortal emperor's values system might not originally include the a value of having stable values and consistent decisions in the first place.

Up to you
