If we take Infinite to actually mean "As long lived as the Universe in which we live" then there are many short-term ways to prevent yourself "going evil". Many good ones have already been discussed.

However, an actually infinite lifespan implies only two possible outcomes. A) Steady State: where You are never changing in your beliefs and goals through whatever mechanism you can come up with to ensure this, and B) Extremism: You will eventually migrate your way to some kind of state that for our purposes can be conveniently called "evil."
