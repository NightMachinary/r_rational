  In short, how do you set up or maintain an "emergency brake" on a list of "no-go" issues or actions (keeping yourself from becoming the Mistborn Lord Ruler), while still allowing yourself to grow as a person and adapt to new information?

  An immortal lifespan is a long time.

Use you "great (though not omnipotent) magical powers" to increase your intelligence and knowledge and figure out the answer.

You don't. You're truly immortal. The world is going to change over hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, trillions of years. Any binding controls you succeed in putting on yourself now will almost certainly one day look like the stupidest thing you ever did.
