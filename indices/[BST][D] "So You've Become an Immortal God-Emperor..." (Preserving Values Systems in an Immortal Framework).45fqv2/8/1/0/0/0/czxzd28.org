Is it really? I have seen plenty of jokes going around here and you are the first person I have seen getting offended and coming to complain to the person making it for diluting his thread.

With all due respect while the thread was made by you, it doesn't mean everyone posting are supposed to make sure what they are writing is useful for you.

If you found the joke to be of bad taste, or you feel it is cluttering the thread go ahead and mod it down.

Anything else and I suggest discussing with the mods\making a separate thread for it to see what this community actually wants. Attacking people is not the solution in either case.
