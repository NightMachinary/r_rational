Suppose you had an oracle show you future you. You find that future you eventually got bored with being nice, stopped caring about mortality, and decided to become a tyrant king. Do you see no reason to stop this?

Or imagine that the oracle shows you two futures. Neither of them seem to change as a result of anything particularly involuntary, but they don't match up. Maybe one you become a tyrant king and another every ounce of power is extracted from you painfully to support a huge population existing after what would have been the heat death of the universe. And just to be clear that's all voluntary because that version of you cares about other people enough that their desires outweigh his own. Do you really not care which of those happens? Surely you'd try to get one of them to happen, or maybe go for a third option, rather than leaving it to the flip of a coin.
