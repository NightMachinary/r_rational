Sealed good in a box, where the good is a fork of myself containing 75% of my power. He is unsealed every hundred years. If unsealing occurs and my fork considers my personality changes acceptable, we re-fuse and reiterate the process. Else he resorbs me and reiterates the process.

Of course a path of acceptable personality changes could lead to a personality that would be unacceptable to my original self, but that's the point to an extent. Perhaps the future will in fact require a value system that I myself would consider untenable, but this should halt the most sudden shifts.

Also this assumes all this is actually within my magical capabilities.
