Only to the extent of your competence.

You might get misled, whether by a malicious party or simple misleading (or misinterpreted) evidence.

You might find it more difficult to live up to your ideals than anticipated, whether due to temptation, akrasia, difficulty managing your emotions, or mental illness - although this is in some sense "involuntary", it's the kind of involuntary thing you should prepare for.

I mean, I agree with the sentiment, but future-me isn't /necessarily/ better than past-me. It's just a strong trend. Plenty of people join cults, or become depressed, or simply become convinced of something really dumb.

I'm optimistic it would even out in the long run, but I'd rather not do something terrible and then have to try and fix it in "the long run".
