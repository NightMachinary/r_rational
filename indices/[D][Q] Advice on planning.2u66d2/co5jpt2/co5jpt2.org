I have lately been using [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][Dan Harmon's story circle]] method for story plotting. If Campbell's monomyth is descriptive, this is prescriptive. Part of it is just a breakdown of story parts, but it also incorporates some of the snowflake method, which I think it one of the more important things to do with plotting.

The snowflake method is like this:

- Figure out the core of your story, then write out all the major, high level plot points as one simple sentence each. You shouldn't have much more than a handful of sentences - if you have more than that, simplify.
- Break each of those sentences down into further description of the series of events that they contain. "The protagonists break into the castle" is a sentence that could encompass a half dozen chapters - maybe part of breaking into the castle is wooing a chambermaid, pickpocketing a guard, crafting a magic spell to breach the defenses, having a conversation on the ethics of overthrowing the king, etc.
- Keep doing this until you have roughly scene-sized chunks. Then, write those scenes, and you'll have a properly plotted book.

If you're interested, I wrote up a three part series prior to National Novel Writing Month: [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing.html][part 1]], [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_25.html][part 2]], [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_28.html][part 3]]. The first four (unedited and very raw) chapters that resulted from that planning can be seen [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3221980/1/The-Dark-Wizard-of-Donkerk][here]], though I have to say that I didn't feel the need to hew too close to my plotting.

If you want to shift your tone, even gradually ... that's a tough thing to do. You run the risk of attracting people that will love the early stuff but grow disenchanted with the later stuff. It's quite possible that you don't care about audience at all, but if you do, it's better to keep the tone relatively consistent. Include a lot of foreshadowing of the bad stuff that's going to happen, and keep in grim comic relief (or however you're planning to balance your moods).
