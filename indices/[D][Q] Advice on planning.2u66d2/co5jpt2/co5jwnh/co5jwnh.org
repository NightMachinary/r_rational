Thanks! This is definitely going to be helpful. I remember you posting this method before, and I honestly should have remembered it now, because it seems pretty cool. I'm not sure how helpful it will be for the long-term serial publication plan I have in mind, but I'll definitely read it and get as much from it as possible. I may end up PMing you for advice in the next few days; is that alright?

My intent is to begin it kind of like Haruhi Suzumiya: very self-aware, playing with the idea of clich√©d storytelling, but overall not too dark or complex (though I've heard the light novels can get complex). The way I see it is, if I enjoy both that show and things like Evangelion or Akira, I'm likely to be able to attract an audience that feels the same way.

Good advice on adding in a bit of comedy, though. That's often an issue I have when getting into what I consider the real meat of a story: I make it too dark. I'll keep that in mind.
