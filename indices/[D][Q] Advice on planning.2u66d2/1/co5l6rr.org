I haven't tried my hand at writing, but I have made a lot of games. Calibrate your grain of salt appropriately.

What I've found is that you need to nail down your thematic pillars and, in abstract, how you plan to achieve them, and write all of that down. Figure out what structure is required, and then studiously stop before filling in the fun parts.

Coming up with all the details and bringing it to life is a lot of fun, so it's easy to write it all down and plan to convert it to your finished product, but if you do it all up front then later on you'll lose your connection with what made the premise fun. And then you won't be able to make it fun for the reader either, or worse just get discouraged and give up on the work.

I'd also recommend the book Save The Cat, which is the best attempt I've read to actually establish what a good story structure looks like. It should be more directly transferable to writing than it is to games anyway.
