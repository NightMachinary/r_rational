Sure, PM away.

Serials are kind of a different beast in terms of plotting, but Harmon's advice (and what he tries to do in his television shows) is to think of each installment as a single story with a beginning, middle, and end, which is embedded within the larger story. If you read through that whole series, he actually talks about the television format a lot, which I think shares many similarities with writing a serial. Each installment should be its own story, but also move along the larger story, which means that you can treat the whole thing as sort of being like a fractal.
