It depends on the mechanics of the Death Star. Time travel can be /incredibly/ weak. In /Kate and Leopold/, time travel requires jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, leads from one exact time and place to another exact time and place, and the portal only lasts for a limited amount of time.

If you're trying to tell a story with that sort of setup, where the protagonist is from 1876 and spots a man from 2001, there isn't even that much of an imbalance. 1876-man can just punch 2001-man in the face. But it also depends on to what extent they have different goals and how prepared the time-traveler is.

Now, if time travel effectively results in bullshit-tier precognition of everything that's going to happen, that's much harder to build a good conflict around.
