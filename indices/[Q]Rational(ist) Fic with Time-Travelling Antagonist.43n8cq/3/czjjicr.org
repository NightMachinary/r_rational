This almost sounds like it begs the question of whether the inverse of Yudkowsky's Law of Fiction* ("If you give Frodo a lightsaber, you must give Sauron a Death Star") is true.

Which is to say, it sounds like you're giving Sauron a Death Star (in the form of time travel). So I feel compelled to ask the following: (a) are you then required to Frodo a metaphorical light saber, in order to make the dynamic of the story "work"; and if so (b) what specific examples spring to mind that would suffice against our particular Death Star?

Nothing except sufficiently advanced superintelligence immediately sprung to my mind. You guys?
