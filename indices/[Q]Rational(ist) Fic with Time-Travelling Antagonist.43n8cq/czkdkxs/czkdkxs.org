Well, I do not recall any novels or fics like that, but after reading/watching few works about time travelling (like e.g. Steins;Gate, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, All You Need Is Kill) I came to a conclussion, that the worst enemy of time traveller is giving up. If your protagonist can somehow take advantage of all emotions his born from losing, he may be able to make antagonist surrender.

If you are wondering about what special ability give to your protagonist, IMO the best choice would be probably some kind of mind reading or precognition.
