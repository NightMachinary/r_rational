The comment doesn't spoil much of anything. Just lists a few names and lets you know that it's possible to kill in the game. You could find out almost all of that from the game trailer.

The names without context are are hardly a spoiler.

Edit: after thinking about why you might say "SPOILERS" in more depth I realized why you commented the way you did. [[#s][Spoilers]]
