Groundhog Day loops would.

The protagonist succeeds in stopping the villain over and over with every loop, with the villain working over many loops to craft a master strategy that will finally allow him to win. We meet the hero on loop #311, playing a game he has no memory of ever having played before, having to outthink not only the villain but also the #310 previous iterations of himself, who have already used up all the good strategies (which are now known to the villain). And of course if he wins, the villain just resets the loop, which means that winning /once/ is a bad long-term solution, since that just shoves the problem out to iteration #312, who will have an even more difficult time.
