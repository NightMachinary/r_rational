Victory Conditions depend heavily on the method of time travel.

If the villain can only reset time by some act of will with an activation delay... then making him go from 'everything is fine' to 'dead' in some amount of time shorter than is required to activate the time travel (spell/device/etc) would work.

If the villain resets on death/loss/duration like Bill Murray did in Groundhog Day... then the protagonist would need to come up with some means of circumventing that.

As to [[/u/ulyssessword]] 's question of how the protagonist figures out that the game is even afoot... I think the villain either needs to flub that iteration and let the secret slip, or the nature of the protagonist (telepath, precog, etc) clues them in.
