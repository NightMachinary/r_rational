I'm not entirely up to date, but close enough.

I think the best thing about it is that there's a lot of creativity to the setting, which is what's kept me coming back so far. The worst parts, for me, are the fight scenes, which there are a lot of, and which I find myself sort of skimming through. There's also a sense of road being hastily constructed in front of the moving plot, but I'm not sure whether that's true to the author's approach, or just the sense that the prose/plot gives me (either way, I don't like it). People sometimes seem to forget their powers/resources, and plot threads sometimes dangle in the wind, which isn't the worst sin, but can still grate if it's too noticeable.

Whether or not you like it will probably depend on what metrics you think are most important in a work, and whether the particular style quirks drive you away or keep you coming back.
