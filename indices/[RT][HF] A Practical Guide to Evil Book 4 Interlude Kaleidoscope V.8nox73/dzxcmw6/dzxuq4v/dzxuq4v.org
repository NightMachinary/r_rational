Army isn't in shambles, just on the backfoot right now. They've taken casualties but the command structure and the core force still remains. Only their

- Artillery
- Levies
- Vanguard
- Mages

Are wounded/lost. They still have their Shock Troops, their Cavalry, Sappers, Scouts, and the rest of the Vanguard that is in fighting condition.

It's not all lost - they're probably on more even footing now than they were before.

Nope. I'm waiting on this one, because it doesn't look like it. I trust in the author to keep things fresh and these turn of events don't seem to by your typical "Foundling Gambit."

During Cat's formative years, it was a hallmark of her lack of ability and foresight, but due to her recent resolve I choose to believe that she wants to outgrow that desperation and is now relying on her people to succeed rather than do everything herself again.
