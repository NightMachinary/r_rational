Their army literally can't take a field in fear of additional loses. Juniper herself said that if they lose any more men it will take year to get back on their legs. And that discounts mages, knights and sappers which they can't really recruit that fast at all. Given there is Crusade on their border this seems like a bit of problem.

So, they let Akua pilot Cats body into deciding battle, guided by commands of questionable strength. And you don't think that's desperate gambit? The person, who fucked them over so many times as deciding factor on war. Sure nothing can go wrong with that. Even if its her people and not Cat herself, its still desperation that drives them. Its like the only way they can accomplish anything is with moves like that and its getting a bit tiresome.
