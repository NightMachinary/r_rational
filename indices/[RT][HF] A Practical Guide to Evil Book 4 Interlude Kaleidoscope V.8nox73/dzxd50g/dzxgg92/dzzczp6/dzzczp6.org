Now that I reread that part I think you're right. When Cat initially wakes up, the narration specifically refers to her as "Catherine Foundling," and the first thing she says is /very/ Cat in tone. After the stab, she's still Catherine while she's beating Larat up, but after that she's "The Queen of Callow" and "the queen." The writing seems to telegraph that Cat was controlling her body before the stab and that Akua took over around the point where Larat started laughing. I might be reading too much into it though.
