Here's my current theory: Akua didn't actively do anything to possess Cat's body. She just took advantage of an opportunity, and in a surprising turn of events, it was the lesser of two evils.

Given the control that Thief has, the first thing she should have done was to order Akua to spill the beans as to what happened and then try to fix it. Since Akua is still in control, either a) they don't have ability to fix Cat, or b) Akua doesn't know what happened to her. Either way, that's bad, because she's a really really /really/ good mage.

So what happened? Going through the paragraphs where they initiated "Absolute Positioning," it reads to me like they were projecting themselves into some sorta astral plane kinda deal. And when the portal was forcibly broken, they got shut out of their bodies. For Masego, that led to his body to cease functioning. For Cat, that led to Akua trying to step in, and for some reason, it wasn't instant. From Kaleidoscope I, we got a pretty grotesque description of what was happening to Cat's body, where it was constantly trying to remake itself. I think that was Ubua fighting a manifestation of Winter for control of the body. When she wakes up, she comments "Well that was a thing," which I think refers to the fight she just had.

Thoughts?
