The throw-away line about Arnaud writing his "bastard son" was interesting too, because it seems out of character with his previous characterizations (either as a foolish blowhard from the Proceran nobles, or as an emotionless psychopath from Grey Pilgrim). If GP is right, then I highly doubt Arnaud is writing to his son - or if he is, at least it's not out of any emotional connection. He's likely working his own angle and the letters he sends are encoded. The question will be, who is he working with or toward? Potentially he's a spy for Cordelia, but with Amadis's thoughts about an invasion by the Dominion of Levant, my money's on them being involved.
