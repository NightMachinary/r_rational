I think a bigger problem is that we can't differentiate whether they're under the influence of that whole magic corruption thing the Pilgrim believes in, or whether they've just grown and changed as people, the normal way, between books 3 and 4. So trying to theorize either way is going to be impossible - any change that can be ascribed to one theory can just as easily be ascribed to the other.

Also, Thief is officially not a hero anymore, so that might be influencing her in subtle ways too. Personally, I think that Juniper would have been ruthless enough to try this even in book 3, and certainly by the end of it.
