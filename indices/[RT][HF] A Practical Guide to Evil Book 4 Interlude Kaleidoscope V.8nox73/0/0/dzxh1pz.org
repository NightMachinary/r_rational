That's very interesting. Akua as an enemy of Cat but as an evil hero, abusing the power of the heavens for all the wrong reasons.

There are a lot of possibilities. Either Grey or Saint may recognize Cat is different and try to save Cat from Akua. I've had a thought since the two old heroes mentioned the five great heroes coming together to face a huge evil, but they don't know who all the other heroes will be. Will Cat be one of them? Or maybe Grey could give Akua a new body if she repents.

Also, promises Akua makes in this body should be binding on Cat if/when she returns.
