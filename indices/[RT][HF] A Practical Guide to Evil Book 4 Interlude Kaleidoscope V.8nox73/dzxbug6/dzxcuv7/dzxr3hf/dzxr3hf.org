I think the thinning of the Mantle of Winter at Saint's hands is foreshadowing. She'll lose it eventually, if only by assorted machinations to get her ' back' in the story proper. Probably after she somehow satisfies Larat.

Who knows, maybe it'll happen very soon - Akua somehow taking the mantle and Cat's oaths that she swore on it, running around as a storybound icequeen. Terrifying thought, even if Cat got a name.
