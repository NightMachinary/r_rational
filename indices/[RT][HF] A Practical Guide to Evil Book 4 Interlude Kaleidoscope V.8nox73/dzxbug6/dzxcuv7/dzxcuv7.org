I would be super disappointed if this was some kind of redemption arc. I don't like idea of Cat as hero at all. I think she makes great villain.

I hope that she will remain without Name. Idea of her kicking around Named without Name of her own is quite appealing to me. She always played a bit of different game, then everyone around.
