You know what would be maddening? It's been heavily foreshadowed that Cat is being set up in a heroic situation right now--what if an opportunity for "redemption" (as in switching sides to the Heavens) appears and then Akua steals it to be revived? And then Akua, being genre savvy enough as she is, manages to stay within the boundaries of being a "hero" while also going around happily wreaking havoc as she likes.

The White Knight is already basically Two-Face from Batman and he still counts as a hero, so Akua might be able to find some niche as well. Praesi are all about being pragmatic and using any sort of power they can get their hands on including demons and Devils, so why not exploit the Heavens as well?
