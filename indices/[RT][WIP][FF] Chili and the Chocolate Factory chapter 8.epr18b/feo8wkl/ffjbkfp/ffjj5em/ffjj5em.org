I have no idea whether any of the stuff is an actual reference - my brain is just making these associative leaps based on tidbits (99% confidence in the last line though) and the deer joke is an embarrassingly large one (or I've just made a wrong turn). Per [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ebr32p/chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_fudge_revelation/fb77tfs/][an earlier comment]], the author used to have a channel in AW's discord (#korridor) and in WtC AW as a "self insert" has no love for deer.
