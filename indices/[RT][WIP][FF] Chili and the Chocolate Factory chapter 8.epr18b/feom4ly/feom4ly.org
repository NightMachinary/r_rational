Taking an inappropriately wide swing here because with this story I'd rather WMG at the most interesting thing my intuition gives me instead of the most likely:

The one who shot himself was the real Bucket, and the other one is the robot. Maybe you can't die in Wonkaland for some terrifying chocolate-related reason (Would explain how the other kids in the first one survived like that to leave), and the only time to leave the factory is at the inception of the suspiciously Cabin-In-The-Woods-esque “contest” ritual. The inside of Wonkaland might as well be a sweets-themed nightmare realm, after all, and not an underground factory.

Or I guess it could be a realistic (chocolate) robot, or (chocolate) engineered bioclone. If you think that's more rational.
