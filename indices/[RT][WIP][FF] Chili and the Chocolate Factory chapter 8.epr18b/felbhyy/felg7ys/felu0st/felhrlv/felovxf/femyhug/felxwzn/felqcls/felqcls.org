  If you want examples, feel free to go into random [[/r/science]] threads and see how many puns, jokes and especially anecdotal comments get plenty of upvotes

Not really seeing the problem here? Puns and jokes are funny, of course I would want to see funny things related to an article im interested in. And anecdotes play an important role in grounding a scientific finding in reality, in making them more than just abstract numbers.

I am simplifying the problem of, whether a post belongs here, by suggesting that it's as simple as counting upvotes. There are lots of complicating factors, but sometimes it's best to look at the simple facts. It's easy to get bogged down in overcomplicated arguments on the definitions of rational, the purpose of the sub, etc... But the simple fact is, every upvotes is someone who's day was made a bit happier by these updates. Sure it doesn't fit into your definition of rational, but it does fit into mine. If there was a consensus that it wasn't rational, that might be different, but the content of a sub should be decided by the people of a sub. And the best way to measure whether the people like something, is upvotes.
