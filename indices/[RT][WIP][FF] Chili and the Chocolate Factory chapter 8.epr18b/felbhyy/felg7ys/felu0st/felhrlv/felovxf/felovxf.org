Upvoters generally upvote stuff regardless of whether it belongs in a sub or not. If this was not the case, there would be no need for rules anywhere, people would just downvote everything that doesn't belong out of view.

If you want examples, feel free to go into random rising [[/r/science]] threads and see how many puns, jokes and especially anecdotal comments get plenty of upvotes.

As far as I can tell, voting has a huge bias towards "like/dislike" and away from "belongs/does not belong."

For another example, see my comment ITT being downvoted when I'm talking about the story. It clearly belongs ITT but it's been downvoted because people don't like it.
