I agree with you that unsong is at a different level, and that this isn't really rational fic. That said, it is expressly a meta satire of rational fic and this community itself. As such, I think it's relevant here. People seem to be enjoying reading and discussing it. Theres also tons of other serial fic on this sub that isn't rational, even those that are quite popular. Maybe just stop clicking on the threads and move on if it bothers you.
