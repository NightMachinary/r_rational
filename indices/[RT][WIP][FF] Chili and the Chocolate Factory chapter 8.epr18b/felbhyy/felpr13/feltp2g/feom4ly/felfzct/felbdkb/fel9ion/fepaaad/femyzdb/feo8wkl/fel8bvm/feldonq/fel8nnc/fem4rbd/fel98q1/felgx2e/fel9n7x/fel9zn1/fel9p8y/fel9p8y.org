  [[/u/gryfft]] if someone made a porn movie and mentioned [[/r/rational]] in it would you be ok with it getting posted here?

I'm not [[/u/gryfft]], but in my opinion, if somebody made a porn movie that directly addressed this community in it, or maybe made a comment on some issues or interesting parts of [[/r/rational][r/rational]], I wouldn't mind seeing it here. But with a label [META], which I also believe to suit the story in question better than [RT] at this point, even if it seemed to be [RT] originally.
