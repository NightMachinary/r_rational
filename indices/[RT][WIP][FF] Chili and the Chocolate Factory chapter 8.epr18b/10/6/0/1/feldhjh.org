Magic /system/? It had as many magic systems as it had characters. Every chapter, just about, introduced some new magical or mystical, or divine, or whatever system of supernatural interaction. The idea that you could predict a hallucinogenic battle of word roots with a drug cactus, or the weird singularity effect of Wall Drug, or the effect of traversing the Panama Canal, or literally any other random thing that happens in the story on the basis of a previously established 'magic system' is... not accurate.

Don't get me wrong, I loved Unsong, but the idea that it had a nice, consist and rational system of magic just isn't supported, in my opinion.
