Unsong's rules were stable only inasmuch as they usually needed to reference something from Judaism to justify them (and placebomancy didn't even do that IIRC). The only really hard-and-fast rules that were clearly established from the start were how Names of God worked - necessary since it was the only form of magic Aaron could use.

That's not to say it didn't work; Unsong did a good job of not overreaching itself in terms of new principles, generally. But it had a very similar vibe, where new things were introduced for the sake of a pun, and one that might even require a footnote on gematria/Hebrew language to understand.
