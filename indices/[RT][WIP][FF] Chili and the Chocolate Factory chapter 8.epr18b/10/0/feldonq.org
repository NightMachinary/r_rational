I like the story and want it here because I think this place has good and intelligent comments, and don't particularly care if a work is rational or not but more whether the rational fiction community is interested in it.

I also think that the upvotes and downvotes on your post and the OP are a fine proxy for a poll, though by all means start a real poll and let's have a real vote. Or more reasonably, let's simply ignore the things that bother us instead of starting unnecessary crusades
