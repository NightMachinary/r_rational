  I also think that the upvotes and downvotes on your post and the OP
#+end_quote

I'm coming into a fan club and asking the fans why the thing they are a fan of could be bad. I didn't expect to be showered with upvotes.

As for upvotes on a post, that is not a good gauge for how well something fits in a sub. Something has to appeal to reddit's primary audience to get upvoted, upvoters don't generally care where the thing that appeals to them is posted. So, I can probably post news about trump getting impeached or a funny/cute picture and get a score similar to this post's.

For similar reasons, I don't think it makes sense to allow everything this community might be interested in (or simply ignore everything that doesn't fit). Then this sub would probably eventually become [[/r/memes]] or [[/r/politics]] or [[/r/nsfw]] or something because that's what reddit's primary audience is interested in.
