I have no interest in arguing definitions on what is rational and rationalist, all I care about, and the purpose of the sub, is whether the works I find on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] are more likely to be things I like than works I find elsewhere. It's not a coincidence that this fanfic has been popular here, nor is it merely a result of high construction quality.

As an example of why people who like rational works are likely to like this work, the answer to the riddle was one of the most effective lessons of rationality I've read on this sub. People suggested the possibility of "entering in what you like more than anything else" as of chapter one, and the concept was popular. But as more people won those winners didn't quite line up with the theory, and the puzzle text never really worked with it at all. What I learned upon being so horrifically wrong while learning the true solution was that I was not properly counting the evidence against, I let my feeling that the solution was clever override my rationality. Learning those kinds of lessons is a big part of the reason i read rational works, and Chili did it brilliantly!

I could talk more about it, but ultimately, this is Reddit, and we can see whether the people of a sub want certain content by the upvotes, and this content is clearly, what the people want.
