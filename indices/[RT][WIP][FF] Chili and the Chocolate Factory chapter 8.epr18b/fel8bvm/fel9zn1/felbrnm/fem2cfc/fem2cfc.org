Literally the meta-point of Unsong when it comes to Kabbalism is that anything can be rationalized post-hoc as being consistent with a sufficiently vague set of precedents.

Unsong doesn't break the rules of its magic system because /its magic system has no rules/. It just pretends to have had rules all along via profound-sounding post-hoc rationalization. You could have justified any other sequence of magical events using the same techniques.

It's like that magic trick where the computer asks you to pick a card from a set of five presented to you, and then it magically removes the card you picked - the trick being that /all/ of the cards have been replaced. You don't notice because you were focused on one card, but the same technique works for every card.
