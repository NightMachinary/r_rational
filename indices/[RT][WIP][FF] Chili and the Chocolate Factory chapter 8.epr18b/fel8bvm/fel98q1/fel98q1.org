I'd say the primary question is if the characters are reasonably intelligent in pursuing their goals. And while the world here is even worse than Unsong's, the characters themselves have done so thus far. They're also a bit simplistic as characters (each one being almost fully describable in under 20 words).

The main thing though is that the subreddit just isn't that active. Posting these updates isn't pushing other content off the front page. This work is at least rational-adjacent, which is IMO good enough for it to be posted.
