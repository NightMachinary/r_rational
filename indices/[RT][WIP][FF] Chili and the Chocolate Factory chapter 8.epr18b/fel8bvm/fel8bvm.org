I'd like to continue the discussion on whether this story is rational in any part.

A response to responses on this thread

  Being "rationalist" isn't really one of the defining traits of ratfic, albeit it's a defining trait of some of the founding works.
#+end_quote

This story isn't even tagged rst, it's tagged straight rt.

#+begin_quote
  This one strikes me as similar to UNSONG: a batshit insane world that is nevertheless a response to an existing work which focuses on the ramifications that said work ignored or glossed over. It's meta-rational.
#+end_quote

I don't see how it can be any kind of rational without the cohesive rules UNSONG had.

#+begin_quote
  Why so? Both poke fun at and play with their source material, with a similar level of surrealism. There have been fewer puns in Chili, but the night is young yet.
#+end_quote

Because unsong had stable rules. This story does not.

#+begin_quote
  This is what I meant by meta-rational; the world itself might be insane, but the things it has to say about the work it's responding to are coherent.
#+end_quote

coherent =\= rational

  if more people told me that they didn't think it belonged here I would stop posting it and tell other people to do the same.
#+end_quote

[[/u/gazemaize]], I don't think the story belongs anywhere near here. Please tell the mods first and foremost that you don't want the story here.

#+begin_quote
  From my perspective, addressing the rational fiction community directly is sufficient for a story to fit in here.

[[/u/gryfft]] if someone made a porn movie and mentioned [[/r/rational]] in it would you be ok with it getting posted here?
