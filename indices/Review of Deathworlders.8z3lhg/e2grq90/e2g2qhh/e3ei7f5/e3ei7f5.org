It's worth picking up. It's well written, keeps itself (mostly) rational and makes some excellent points about psychological and physiological mindsets whilst still retaining the whole hfy premise.

You have to start from the original green text snips.

Also consider the other canon branches: humans don't make good pets, salvage and The Xi√∫ Chang Saga.

They all tie into each other at some moments, help to set up the plot and work with the other authors to prevent fatalistic issues forming or holes in the plot line.

Humans don't make good pets was the result of a standalone author and hfy fan coming across hambones works on 4chan, deciding to continue in the same universe while providing him credit. Few years down the track and hambone himself discovered that his work had not suffered the slow death as assumed, then took it upon himself to contribute.
