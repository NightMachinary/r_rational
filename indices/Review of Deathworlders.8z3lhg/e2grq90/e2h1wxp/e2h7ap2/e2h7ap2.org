I believe Hambone acknowledged this at some point with a line that talked about how Deathworlders affected how the rest of the galaxy thought about things. Plus you're seeing the cream of the crop as far as ET's are concerned so it's not surprising that their competency has risen. It's also been established that the Human mindset is less of a Human mindset and more of a Deathworlder mindset.
