Hickam's Dictum is basically a cautionary tale on a common misunderstanding of Occam's Razor. Occam's Razor says you should favor simple explanations for a given evidence, since p(AB|X) â‰¤ p(A|X), /but this is assuming total ignorance!/ Complex hypotheses need to work harder to overcome their prior improbability, but it's not like they're /forbidden/. Sufficient evidence can and should make you update to privilege a complex explanation, if that's indeed where the evidence points.

Consider a doctor who has an appointment with a female patient complaining of a headache and runny nose. Even without meeting her, the doctor already knows it's probably the common cold. But if during the appointment he also notices she is dizzy, has poor skin elasticity, and has a rapid heartbeat - then he may very well conclude she is dehydrated, and just happened to catch a cold at the same time. It's a more complex explanation that will necessarily fit with less patients, but for this /particular/ patient it explains the symptoms perfectly.
