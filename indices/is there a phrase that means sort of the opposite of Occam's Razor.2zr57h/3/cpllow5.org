nothing comes to mind; there's a vaguely similar idea expressed by Douglass Adams that goes something like "Sometimes the impossible has a certain integrity that the merely improbable lacks." Which isn't exactly about simplicity/complexity, but can apply to a complex-but-known-possible theory versus a simple but believed-impossible one.
