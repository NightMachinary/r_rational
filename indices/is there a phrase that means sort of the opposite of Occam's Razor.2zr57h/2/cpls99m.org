You seem to mean something positive, maybe somewhat orthogonal to Occam's Razor. But ignoring your body text and answering the topic title, as a /pejorative/, my personal TV-Trope name for the inverse of Occam's Razor is "Ice Surfer Jesus".

That's named after people who take Bible miracles and neither disbelieve them ("Jesus never walked on water") /nor yet actually believe them/ ("Jesus walked on water") but instead concoct far-fetched naturalistic explanations for how the miracle might have happened ("Jesus could have stood on a transient ice floe in the Sea of Galilee").

Yes, this is a real phenomenon, and yes, that's a real example that people have suggested in seriousness, and no, I don't understand it the tiniest bit.
