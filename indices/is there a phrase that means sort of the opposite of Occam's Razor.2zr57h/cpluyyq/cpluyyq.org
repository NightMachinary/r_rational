Hmm. Narratively fulfulling? That sounds at first like writing a "good story", and reminds me of Order of the Stick's genre-referencial decision logic (in Elan's father Tarquin's story arc) that says things like (and I'm making this example up) you shouldn't expect the main bad guy to be defeated in any way other than by the main characters, with plenty of drama and probably an epic battle. So that means don't even bother hiring an NPC assassin and expecting it to go as planned.

Or were you talking about something else? Maybe you mean something like 'the answer that connects the most dots in the "narrative" of reality'?
