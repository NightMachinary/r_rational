I doubt it. Every match with similar-but-not-adative styles is, but a melee-ranged team might work well together, or other teams of similar skill. It really depends on if you're better off working as a pair or individual. In this case, sakura was better fighting Ino, and hinata would have been best off taking ino out herself, followed by taking out neji.
