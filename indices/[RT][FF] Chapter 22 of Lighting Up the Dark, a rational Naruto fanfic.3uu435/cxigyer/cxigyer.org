Also, characters in fics seem to have never heard of epistemic learned helplessness, even though real human beings act that way all the time. The proper response to someone trying to talk you out of an exam fight is to say "In a battle is a poor time to evaluate a proposition, where the proposition is likely to be based on motivated reasoning, where there is little time to evaluate it in, where I can't have peers review it, and where even giving the proposition a fair hearing has costs. So I don't see any point in bothering to evaluate it." Try as hard as you can to win the fight, and if it turns out in hindsight that the argument for giving up made sense, you just got unlucky. Hinata should have just ignored Neji, not bothered to respond or think about what he said.

(Of course, it's a lot more dramatic when characters throw propositions at each other in fights, which is why fiction does it.)
