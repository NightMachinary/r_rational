  I've come up with a workaround to a problem like this that took me literally two seconds. It follows, you have thought of something too, haven't you?
#+end_quote

We could come up with a long series of workarounds and counter-workarounds if we wanted to. In the end, any ninja with an iota of caution will not strap a bomb to someone's forehead, no matter how confident they are in their control of that bomb, unless that person is on some level expendable.

  Well yes, unless you do so during one of the three full-on wars that have already happened.
#+end_quote

Those wars ended, though. I can't see any peace treaty which would involve Leaf (or any of the other sides in the conflict) permitting another village to continue an Uchiha breeding programme.

  Say brother, how would you like for you and all your descendants to be bound to permanent service/probable abuse to me and my descendants, on pain of death?

We don't know how the HyÅ«ga came to have a branch family with a Caged Bird Seal, but it's not difficult to come up with a plausible scenario from the clan's distant past. "For your attempt to usurp the clan leadership, you and your followers must die - but we will permit you to live on and serve us as a branch family if you take this seal which guarantees you and your descendants can never rebel against us again."
