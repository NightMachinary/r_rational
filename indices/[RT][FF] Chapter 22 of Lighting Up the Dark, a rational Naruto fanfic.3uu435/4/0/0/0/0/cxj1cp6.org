  The problem with this is if someone found a way to hack it, it would doom the entire clan, rather than, at worst, the branch family.

I've come up with a workaround to a problem like this that took me literally two seconds. It follows, you have thought of something too, haven't you?

#+begin_quote
  You don't get infinite retries when attacking someone. Get caught once and it's a diplomatic incident. Get caught repeatedly and it's a full-on war.

  Also, by the time you kidnap enough Uchiha to make that practical and worthwhile, they will find out who you are and Leaf will annihilate you
#+end_quote

Well yes, unless you do so during one of the /three/ full-on wars that have already happened.

#+begin_quote
  On the other hand, the main family is stronger and better-guarded. The CBS at least helps a little by allowing the HyÅ«ga to keep the branch family weaker than the main one without turning them into a liability.

-Say brother, how would you like for you and all your descendants to be bound to permanent service/probable abuse to me and my descendants, on pain of death?

-Why yes brother, it seems like a wonderful and perfectly reasonable idea! Here, paint my forehead first.

Legit.
