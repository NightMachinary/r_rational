Exactly! Canon CBS is an unsustainable proposition, it even baffles me [[/u/Valorien]] chose to adopt it. A smart enemy would just go for the main branch, just like Lightning did in canon, only they wouldn't stop the first time, and try again until they got the byakugan.

Like you said, to be useful the CBS should work like a cyanide pill, if they get you kill yourself for the good of the clan. Strange enough Uchiha didn't adopt a similar method. Stranger too there is no concocted Uchiha family in any other ninja country (unless you take into account Naruto Gaiden, which I don't).
