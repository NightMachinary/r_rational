It would be pretty cool if the Caged Bird was given to all Hyuuga, and all Hyuuga were able to activate it (It also makes more sense because the main branch in canon is unsealed, even though the goddamn /point/ of the seal is to protect the bloodline). They'd indoctrinate their children into their sacrifice for the clan, to protect the bloodline as it protects their own. The kind of indoctrination that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nwfh6/biweekly_challenge_precommitment/cvuftj9][Free]] demonstrates.

This commitment of their lives to the clan would naturally affect their values, kind of like how the Hyuuga behave in canon but even more alien, and the main/branch distinction wouldn't even come up. Just a sociopathic system producing a unified front. The ingroup is the clan, the outgroup is /everyone else./
