Yeah, sure.

So I've just re-read chapter 20, which was where the Sound ninja made their major appearance. After a bit of thought, I think that the largest difference is that in this chapter you spend a lot of time describing the exact effects of the sound Ninja's Technique. For example:

#+begin_quote
  For a second, the air was eerily still, and all sound disappeared from the area.\\
  Then something hit Naruto hard in the chest.\\
  The blow wasn't that strong, not even enough to knock someone over if they were in a defensive stance, but it did have enough force to pop a shadow clone, and it covered the entire clearing in a full 360-degree radius.\\
  But the instant annihilation of Naruto's shadow clone army wasn't the worst part. The worst part was that the wave also popped Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura. Then it hit the bushes at the far end of the clearing, breaking the originals' disguises.

That's four paragraphs in total, purely describing the effects of one jutsu. In contrast...

#+begin_quote
  To an outsider, the Gentle Fist Style looked incongruously like an attempt to slap your opponent, but in reality a Gentle Fist strike could be deadlier than any punch. Precise needles of chakra emitted from the palms could pierce any of the more than three hundred chakra points a HyÅ«ga could see on the target's body, blocking the meridians along which chakra naturally flowed. A sufficient number of hits could do anything -- disable a limb, shut down the lungs, stop the heart... a terrifying amount of power for an art that ignored armour and was dangerous even to block.

  A battle between two Gentle Fist users did not remotely resemble taking turns. Rather, it was a constant dance around each other, limbs almost intertwining as each attack turned into a block, and each block was reversed into another attack. Hinata and Neji's limbs didn't stay still for even half a second, constantly shifting stance, the fighters leaning back and sideways and occasionally forwards as their hands moved in endless elaborate patterns that seemed completely independent of the motion of the rest of their bodies.

That's two paragraphs, one describing how the jutsu works in a way the reader can quickly grasp, and the second describing the visual implications effectively.\\
Chapter 20 to me read like every time an individual jutsu was used there was a subscene devoted wholly to it. In the latest chapter things seemed smoother because some unneeded flavour text was removed, and the scene was blended together into a cohesive whole.

I love this story more than I love the convenience of Microwavable food.
