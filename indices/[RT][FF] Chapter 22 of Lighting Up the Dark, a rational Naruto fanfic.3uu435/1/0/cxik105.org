  "If I wanted to deceive you about X, why would I do Y?" is self-defeating (and a version of Goodhart's Law), because as long as Y is an indicator of not-X, Y becomes useful as part of a deception about X and therefore is no longer useful as an indicator of not-X.

Not if the cost of Y given X is greater than the benefit gained from the deception. Not to mention that deception itself involves detectable patterns of behavior.
