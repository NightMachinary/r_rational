  "In a battle is a poor time to evaluate a proposition, where the proposition is likely to be based on motivated reasoning, where there is little time to evaluate it in, where I can't have peers review it, and where even giving the proposition a fair hearing has costs. So I don't see any point in bothering to evaluate it."

Points for missing the fact that this is completely different from how someone who's being psyched out in a fight actually thinks and feels. You have to /train/ this nonreaction. You have to /precommit/ to it.
