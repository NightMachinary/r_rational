I wouldn't point this out if this wasn't a rational fic. But since it is a rational fic, characters should ideally act in ways that characters in other sorts of fic might not usually act.

Besides, they're ninjas. They train lots of things that people don't normally do.

(And there are also plenty of characters who should naturally act that way anyway. "stubbornness" and such are just terms describing how humans precommit.)
