I liked how subtly manipulative Kabuto was with Naruto. A compliment here, a bluff there, and he's sold on the whole concept. Seems likely he won't even double check with the proctors that Kabuto actually /is/ a jonin - some of them could be /spies/, after all.

Also, Hinata's technique is pretty neat. I like how you asked yourself what secondary powers are required for canon Hyuuga capabilities, and then went on trying to abuse those in a novel way. Feels internally consistent, not asspull-ish, and interesting.
