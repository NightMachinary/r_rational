"If I wanted to deceive you about X, why would I do Y?" is self-defeating (and a version of Goodhart's Law), because as long as Y is an indicator of not-X, Y becomes useful as part of a deception about X and therefore is no longer useful as an indicator of not-X.

Also, the characters don't know they're in a rational fic (they know /they/ are rational, but not that everyone else is), so the proper answer to "would I be stupid enough to do Y if I wanted X" could very well be "yes, lots of people are stupid that way. It's called cognitive bias, or just making mistakes." Being unprepared for irrational behavior on the part of others is a mark of a Straw Vulcan.
