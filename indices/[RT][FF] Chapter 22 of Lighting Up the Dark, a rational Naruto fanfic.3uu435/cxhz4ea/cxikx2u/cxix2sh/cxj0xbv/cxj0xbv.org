  It would be pretty cool if the Caged Bird was given to all Hyuuga, and all Hyuuga were able to activate it

The problem with this is if someone found a way to hack it (not theoretically impossible - for example, Orochimaru stops Naruto's seal from feeding Naruto Nine-Tails chakra by forcing his own seal on top of it, and that's a crude mid-combat hack), it would doom the entire clan, rather than, at worst, the branch family.

  A smart enemy would just go for the main branch, just like Lightning did in canon

On the other hand, the main family is stronger and better-guarded. No one in the Narutoverse is /immune/ to being kidnapped for their clan secrets. The CBS at least helps a little by allowing the Hyūga to keep the branch family weaker than the main one without turning them into a liability.

  only they wouldn't stop the first time, and try again until they got the byakugan.

You don't get infinite retries when attacking someone. Get caught once and it's a diplomatic incident. Get caught repeatedly and it's a full-on war.

  Stranger too there is no concocted Uchiha family in any other ninja country

How do you envision this? Getting the Sharingan doesn't enable you to breed new Uchiha, and recreating the Uchiha genes using science is beyond even Orochimaru.

I suppose there /is/ such a thing as kidnapping and forced breeding, but I suspect that would have been a bit too dark for a shōnen anime series. Also, by the time you kidnap enough Uchiha to make that practical and worthwhile, they will find out who you are and Leaf will annihilate you (with the full blessing of every village that doesn't want anyone getting ideas about /their/ Bloodline Limits).
