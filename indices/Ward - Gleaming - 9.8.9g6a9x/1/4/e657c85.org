It's very subjective. A lot of people love Worm and hate Pact and Twig, or hate Pact and love Twig, etc. I think a lot of external factor in too (like "how busy was your life when you read it?" or "did you read it all in one go, or as it was coming out").

That said, a few pieces of advice:

- If you read glow-worm (which really isn't necessary), don't worry too much about pinpointing each character. Just get a feel for the broadstrokes, what kind of dynamics the characters are likely to have, what kind of personalities they seem to have, etc.

- Avoid reading too much at a time. Wildbow recommends reading one arc at a time, but pick your own pace. The story takes some time digesting.

- Read some of the comments and the relevant [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]] threads after every few chapter, especially if you're confused. A lot of the action and the themes are a lot easier to follow with the reddit hive-mind helping you discern what were the major beats of the story, or pointing out subtle moments you might have missed (eg: "Character X rubbed their wrist when Character Y mentioned Master-Stranger protocols! It means X is the traitor!").
