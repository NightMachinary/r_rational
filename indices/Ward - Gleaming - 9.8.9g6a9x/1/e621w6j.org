I had to give up on twig very late in the story because it dragged on really badly for my personal taste. Then immediately started ward, but couldn't get past the bizarre intro chapters. Given that I loved worm and pact and 9/10 of twig, should I try ward again? Should I just skip the glowworm chapters with all of the code name internet forum stuff, or is that part relevant to the story? It was really tedious to try to read, only guessing at who the names could be, especially since they were likely to be all new characters.
