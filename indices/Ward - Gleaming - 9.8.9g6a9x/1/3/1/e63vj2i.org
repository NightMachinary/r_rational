Wildbow's work at its best scratches the same itch for me as qntm's Antimemetics Division stories. We get fantastic narration of what it feels like from the inside to try to act rationally on the knowledge that your perceptions, thoughts or desires are actively being subverted by a hostile agent, and it's all very relatable because although there are no master/stranger/thinker powers, reality-eating demons or antimemetic SCPs in the real world, we all have to wrestle with the fact that the human mind doesn't actually need any such subversion --- it's already catastrophically compromised at baseline.

So I have really appreciated Ward's tendency to stay very character-driven without sprawling out too much and getting overly distracted by the very rich worldbuilding going on in the background.
