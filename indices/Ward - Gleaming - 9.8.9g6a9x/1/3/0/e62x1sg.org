Yeah, I blasted through Pact. The pacing was the best of his stories in my opinion. Seems like I'm going to hold off on Ward until it's finished. Then I can power through the stuff that I find boring or tedious.

The reason I had to quit twig was because I was reading it one update at a time. Towards the end the pacing got really bad and each update was disappointing, and I could power through because I was reading it as it was getting released.
