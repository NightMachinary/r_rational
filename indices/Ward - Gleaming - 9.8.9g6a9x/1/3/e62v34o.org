The biggest problem with Ward--at least well through the Fallen assault arc--is that it gives you *glimpses* of all sorts of very interesting things occurring in the universe, then shoves that into the background to focus on a very small story where the characters do their best never to get involved in such things, and instead spend a vast majority of their time resolving personal issues or undergoing therapy sessions.

We see some of the old characters like Weld and Tattletale, who are up to great things but only briefly cameo directly. We have new 'cluster' variations of the Passengers that have made the powers go from simple, focused abilities to weird combinations that interact differently with others. We have the inter-world portal system get messed up in a big way. We have worlds that are like an expansionist Wild West where anything goes. We have worlds themselves potentially going to war with each other (including one that despite its apparent low number of Metas seems quite well motivated). We have a kind of machine race that disguises itself well and spreads like a virus. We have the remains of Nibolg's old Goblin creations struggling to survive. We have some new side characters that are more interesting than many of the main characters (I would happily read a "Buddy Cop" series based around Ratcatcher and Crystalclear, for instance). We have the views of common people shifting to where being a hero or villain isn't as important to them as who can make their lives better. We have heroes going more 'corporate' and having to sell their brand rather than just being controlled by one generic government agency, and the inevitable corporate competition that follows.

We have ALL these cool references, and almost none of them are considered for more than a few updates before we go back to Team Therapy doing their thing separate from all of it.

It gets better, but it takes *awhile*, and I can easily see some people not wanting to go through that effort.

Have you read Pact yet?
