While I don't share your opinion on Wildbow's writing, I can see why it might be tiring to read. I personally like taking my time to slowly read through each chapter and his prose in Ward delivers on that front. Each sentence feels deliberate, and character interactions, especially in the beginning, give the reader insight into what the characters are really like beneath the surface.

The reason why Ward might feel more 'angsty' might be because, unlike Worm, the setting is already somewhat laid out. The story takes it upon itself to become more character focused as a result, and given that all the main characters are damaged to some degree, the dynamics inevitably fall into that sort of deliberation.

It's understandable that the protagonist's ruminations might not be to your preference if you care more about world building, but I really do think that there's plenty of value in delving into the characters, their personalities, backgrounds, and decisions. It's part of what made interludes in Worm so engaging, not only because you get to see a bit more of the world, but also because you get placed into the perspective of someone completely different from the protagonist.

If you're interested, maybe try giving the story another whirl? The most recent arcs have received a pretty great amount of hype from the parahumans subreddit, and I know that I'm eagerly waiting for new chapters to be released.
