Wildbow took some time to worldbuild and character build this time at the beginning (he always does well with that, its just he does it during the action). So the early chapters are light on explosions and near death experiences. More like a novel vs a web serial.

We learned a lot about the world Post-Worm. Even about the politics between the worlds and how earth bet rebuilt in an empty earth so quickly.

Now his story is getting into the action. It is glorious. Due to his earlier chapters developing characters, he has been able to build on the emotional connections. Now that events are in motion, I have cried for multiple characters and even cheered out loud over some of their victories. (my boyfriend has started teasing me about my "poor fictional characters had a big bad author be mean to them again? Do you want a hug?"

All this adds up to Yes, Ward is very very good. Wildbow is a better writer with every story.

lets just say The Lady In Blue made her entrance, and it was a doozy!
