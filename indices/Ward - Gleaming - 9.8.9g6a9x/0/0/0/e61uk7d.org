I think Wildbow's greatest strength as a writer is the use of first-person viewpoint to show-rather-than-tell. He's particularly effective at using this for characterization, to depict psychological trauma, and to depict mind- and reality-altering effects. Ward so far has been primarily focused on these issues and I'm loving it.
