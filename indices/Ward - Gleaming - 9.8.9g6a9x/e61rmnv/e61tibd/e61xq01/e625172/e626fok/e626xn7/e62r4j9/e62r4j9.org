yeah this is basically me, I didn't intend to stop reading, I just did. The fallen assault was really long and I started to lose interest, and then I got really busy for about a month or two, so I put it down. Then when I tried to get back into it, I had to slog through the Ashley backstory interlude which was... really boring. I eventually got through that, but then I got busy again, and now I don't really remember what was going on, so it's hard to get back into it.
