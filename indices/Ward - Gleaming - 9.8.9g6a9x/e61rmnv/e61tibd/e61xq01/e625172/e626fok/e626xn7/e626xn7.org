I think that reading something with the idea that my patience is going to be rewarded is almost never worth it. I was reading because I was enjoying things, but there was a lot that was being kept from me as a reader, and teased out slowly, and ... what was /actually being put in front of me/ wasn't enough. I never actively made the decision to stop reading, I just saw the chapter notifications and took longer and longer to read them, until eventually there was this big backlog and I thought "eh, maybe I'll get to it eventually", which I have to admit is probably not the case.
