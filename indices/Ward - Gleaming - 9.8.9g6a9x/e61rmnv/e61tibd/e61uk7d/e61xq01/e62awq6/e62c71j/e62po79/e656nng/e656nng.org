Kudos for this review, which pinpoints exactly the kind of things some people are likely to dislike about Ward, while addressing how subjective it is.

I see a lot of reviews about Wildbow's writing that go "It's incredibly X, nobody could possibly like this!", while at the same time a lot of other reviews go "I love it because it's incredibly X!".
