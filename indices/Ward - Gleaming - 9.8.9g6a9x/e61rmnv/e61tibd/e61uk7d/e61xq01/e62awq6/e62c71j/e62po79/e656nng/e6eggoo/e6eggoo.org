Ward seems to be suffering from an overabundance of snappy dialogue and prose, yeah. Every other phrase feels like a stoner trying to show the real truth of the world by emhpasizing certain words, using unnecessary metaphors, and acting really dramatic about the quality of their own remarks. It reminds me a bit of the suspended disbelief snapping dialogue of Gilmore Girls.
