Too much angst, and a staccato-like writing style that may be great for putting out a large amount of words consistently but is disruptive to the flow of reading.

I am a big fan of WildBow's earlier writing, in which the world building really stood out. His prose, to me, was sufficient to not get in the way of being awed by the intricate setting. It was a working tool and did not get in the way of the ever escalating plot.

For Ward, on the other hand, there is less relatability in terms of story and world building, simply because the original story has already moved us from a recognizable world to a multiverse-centric "story-aftermath" setting that is much less compelling to me. What remains is a sort of sequence of character studies into angsty teenagers, with whom I find it hard to empathize. When the story does pick up speed, as often as not the story-progressing elements are embedded into angsty ruminations and navel-gazing of a host of mentally ill, struggling young parahumans.

As a sequel to the original setting, the dynamics make sense, but as an aimless dystopic multi-verse filled with PTSD-filled or otherwise traumatized parahumans, it's unfortunately not my cup of tea. Which I truly regret.
