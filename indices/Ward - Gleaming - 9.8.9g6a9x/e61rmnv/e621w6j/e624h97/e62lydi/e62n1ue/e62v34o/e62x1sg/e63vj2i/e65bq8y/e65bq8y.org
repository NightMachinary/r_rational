Getting distracted by? Yes, what a terrible thing to employ that awesome worldbuilding for more than background information. It would be terrible if the story retained character development while *also* doing interesting things in a rich, detailed world.

There are plenty of stories with unreliable narrators. And rational fiction is chock full of ones that involve some level of mind control and a protagonist who has to either realize this and find a way to resist it, or who undergoes it and learns how after their thinking was altered. So that's not quite as impressive to me, although its interesting in short bursts.
