Like you, I gave up on Twig somewhere around 3/4ths of the way through. As others have said, you can skip the Glow chapters. But I'm bored, so let me bombard you with an unrequested review:

Ward is basically Twig re-written into Worm's universe without Sy & Co.'s explicit time constraints or some their other quirks. It has a heavy focus on psychology and teammates needing to know if other teammates are "all right". I don't find intra-team politics entertaining. But Wildbow just jumps right in to that stuff, when, honestly, I would barely care if he just started killing them off. It's too early in the series to expect readers to be invested in that sort of thing.

And, I've been thinking this for a long while, but after reading Worm, Pact, most of Twig, and Ward, it has become obvious that Wildbow's 1st person fight scenes are very hit or miss when his character isn't effectively omniscient. I understand this this can be a tool to demonstrate the character's own limitations and scope of action, but in practice these scenes have not been well-written or fluid enough for me to appreciate them.

That said, Ward is a fulfilling addition to the Worm-verse. Wildbow still hits his interludes out of the fucking park, which is amazing. If he wrote the entire series like interludes 3.x or 8.y... Well, one can dream.
