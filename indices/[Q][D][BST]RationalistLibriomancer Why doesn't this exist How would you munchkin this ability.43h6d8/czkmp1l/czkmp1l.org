So looking at this:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_novels_based_on_comics]]

Does anyone have any idea what the most popular novel with a detailed description of one of the benign power rings in it from this list actually is?

Does anyone know what happens when you try to take powerful things out of books that AREN'T highly read?
