Senpai noticed me! Squee-- ahem. The books have a lot more limitations, mostly that very smart people have been spending centuries locking books so the world didn't end because someone used a book badly. The question is: how to work around that and do the sorts of things that a 250 year old wizard won't see coming, from some sort of presumably new and thus unlocked book?
