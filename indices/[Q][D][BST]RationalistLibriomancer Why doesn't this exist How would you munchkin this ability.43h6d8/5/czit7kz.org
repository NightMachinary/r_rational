I would first create a book which had a microchip-sized-or-smaller being of full intelligence and sapience which did not require anything more than sunlight to live, and was capable of reading and understanding a book. I would have as many non-magi as possible read this first book.

I would then pull out as many copies of the intelligent being as I could given the available magic, and have /them/ read their own book. Rinse and repeat until I had an enormous number of intelligences. Then I would have them read other books I wrote, such as "Volume 1 of the list of Really Useful Things."

If I was being actively countered by the magi, I would previously write a normal book which described a magic spell or device capable of casting an effect on any books or subset of books in its target range, such that /only non-magi not in the presence of magi/ would, on reading an affected item of text, find that a description of the micro-intelligence had been seamlessly added into the background of the story.

I would also create a /giant/ book, either physically or by writing about one which unfolds from a tiny 'packed' form. Or a small magic device which allowed me to expand any object to several times its former size, even if temporarily. Then all I would need is a small copy of The Compiled Volumes Of Really Useful Things.

I'd also see how far I could stretch the definition of 'book'. Is there a minimum number of pages? A minimum weight of cover? A minimum physical size? Does writing the entire text of a book on a single page 'count' as that book? Does the book have to be made of paper? Does it have to be rectilinear? Could I build a tiny metal book into a ring, or an earring, or a false tooth?

Heck, why not write about a book /which is definitely a book yup yup/, but can transform itself into an undetectable magic field attached to your soul (or skull, if that universe doesn't have souls) and have stuff pulled out of it purely by thinking about it?

...or a device/spell which enabled remote access by a magus to a giant store of magic belief power, and operated purely by passively observing my actions and/or thoughts. Hook the other end to a million self-replicating micro-intelligences and put it on the far side of the moon or something.
