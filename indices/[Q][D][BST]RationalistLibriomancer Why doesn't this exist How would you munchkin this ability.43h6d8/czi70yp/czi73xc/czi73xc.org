The series mentions the libriomancers locking some books as not being usable, but I will have to re-investigate the details of that in my rereading. Think of it as 'extra points for subtlety and slipping one past the magic censors and an item that can do things indirectly and without using lots of raw power.' At least until I or someone else reads the fine print.
