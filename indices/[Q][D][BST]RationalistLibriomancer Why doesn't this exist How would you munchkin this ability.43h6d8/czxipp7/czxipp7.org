Lets bypass the whole "Did the porters lock it" issue and go straight for the good stuff. So if we throw morality out the window (or say it is worth it because you're going to create a utopia or whatever lets you sleep at night) I would find a book with extremely fast breeding sentient creatures that are easy to control and don't require much food or upkeep. (Lets say fairies, for thematic reasons) I would then pull the creatures out of the book as children and raise a massive number here in a box or something, then force them to read a book full of objects and powers that I want over and over. Provided that sentients pulled from books give abilities just like human readers do, I win this game. (If they don't I guess I'll need to pull out some sort of mind control spores or something. The key here is realizing power isn't from books, it is from readers. Go straight to the root cause for use and abuse to achieve satisfactory world breaking entertainment)

Of course I would have to make sure none of the fairies can become a libriomancer themselves, since that would mean they could pull from the book too, escape, and defeat their master. That is like, Rule One of mad science munchkinry. For extra safety, it might be smart to check if readers intentionally believing the gauntlet of godlike power is actually a bomb will make it a bomb when I put it on, and to fill the book they read with propaganda on how well meaning and amazing I am and the paradise waiting for them outside the box if they serve me well as readers. No reason to burn a bridge when you don't have to. Plus I might even give them a paradise once I become immortal god emperor. Everybody wins, particularly me!
