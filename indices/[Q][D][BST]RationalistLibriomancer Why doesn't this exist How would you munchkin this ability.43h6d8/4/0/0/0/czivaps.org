  t let anyone experiment with the magic system for fear of them, and if you bring something sapient through a book it goes dangerously insane. Edit: I just want to empha

Right well there ought to be workarounds to that, if you're bringing it through in cold storage then it's not really sapient at the time. Some other comment mentioned a driad that came through as a seed and isn't insane, so this leads me to believe there ought to be plenty of workarounds to the insanity issue.
