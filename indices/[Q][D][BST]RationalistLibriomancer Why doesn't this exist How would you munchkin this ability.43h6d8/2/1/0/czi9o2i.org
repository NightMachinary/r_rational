Well you have to understand is that while Libriomancy is incredibly powerful, it is not all powerful. The items brought from the books are just magical constructs fueled by the collective beliefs of the readers.

Let's say you have some device that grants near omnipotent power, the device when drawn from the book will nowhere near as powerful. There is only so much magical energy generated by the readers, certianly the resulting device will be incredibly weak compared to the one described in the book. And that doesn't even take into account how much power the libriomancer can channel to bring the device out.

Or let's say you are a scifi fan and decide to extract a laser gun from your favorite space opera. Scientists can't study the laser gun to learn how to reverse engineer how it works because it is literally not using technology. It's just a magical construct that mimics the effects of a laser gun. So good luck trying to extract blueprints for a FTL drive, immortality drugs, AI etc.

So yeah while the mages are huge assholes who could make the setting a lot better; the magic is not sufficiently powerful enough to make the world a post scarcity utopia easily.
