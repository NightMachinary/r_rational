The problem is, we really don't know.

As of book 2 where I stopped reading, Gutenberg locks anything he notices is too powerful, and methods of immortality (some of which have another problem: you can't do magic and be magic, so if you, say become a vampire, you cease to be a libriomancer.) The only sure way to know whether a useful book is locked is if it's mentioned in the series.

The eldritch abominations aren't understood even in-series. Just about all we've got on them is that Gutenberg doesn't let anyone experiment with the magic system for fear of them, and if you bring something sapient through a book it goes dangerously insane.

Edit: I just want to emphasize: *if you bring something sapient through a book it goes dangerously insane*. No-one seems to have mentioned that, and people who haven't read the series keep suggesting FAI.

Edit 2: formatting, changed FAIs to FAI (I think it's collective?).
