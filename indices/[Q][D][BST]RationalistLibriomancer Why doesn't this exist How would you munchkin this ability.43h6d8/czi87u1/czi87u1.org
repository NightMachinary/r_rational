If I'm remembering right, while there are few clearly defined limits, overpowered things are occasionally handwaved away with either "Gutenberg locked the book" or "If you experiment too much eldritch abominations will eat you." It doesn't make it very interesting to try to find exploits - it's far too easy to come up with ones that would work without that caveat, yet impossible to know which would be viable with those limits.

Edit: rephrased the last sentence for clarity.
