The Orb of Aldur is the size of a fist, and capable of casually rearranging astronomical features, fairly well known, and solidly capable of casting Fixus Everythingus. Of course, it also incinerates those it consider's unworthy, and there's some reason to believe worthiness is contingent on not being the kind of person who posts here. You'd need to find an easily coachable, particularly innocent and naive child to use it for you.
