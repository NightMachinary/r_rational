Well the main reason that libriomancers in the setting aren't walking gods is because of the Porters. The secret cabal of libriomancers that basically ban the use of most powerful world breaking objects.

However if we're disregarding them then there are many powerful items that you could take advantage of. You could grab the genie lamp from 1,001 nights and be basically set for life. Or you could take a drink from the holy grail and basically become immortal. There are so many ays you can munchkin this power.
