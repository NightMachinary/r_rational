I vaguely remember in the books that there are mages whose entire jobs is to read new books and lock away anything troublesome. Occasionally they miss something and the porters have to get involved.

You could constantly read new books or pay someone to read new books for you and hope to find something powerful that hasn't been locked yet. The porters can't possibly keep track of all the books in the world, so there are probably lots of powerful books that slip through the cracks.

There is also a libriomancer in the 2nd book who can practice libriomancy using ebooks instead of just physical printed books. If you can learn how to do that then a whole new world of ebooks and fanfiction is opened up to you.

The first thing I would do is probably try to find something that would enhance my intelligence. From there I could make more intelligent decisions and hopefully figure out a better strategy to gain more power.
