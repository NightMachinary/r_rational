You can catch vampirism from the books, so I think I might do that (possibly for other people instead, so I can keep my magic).

Seriously, just make a Luminosity!Twilight vampire, and there's the start of your transhuman revolution in one step.

Alternatively, write a custom breed of vampire with even more advantages and fewer disadvantages and use that instead.
