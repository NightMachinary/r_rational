I like your idea because the Thousand and One Nights are a worldwide-known classic by now, which would make the genie much more powerful than, say, Minds from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series][Culture]] (~Δ[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49118][20,000]] ratings) or Jane from [[http://ansible.wikia.com/wiki/Enderverse][Enderverse]] (~Δ[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43963][220,000]]).

On the other hand, because of the very nature of its popularity the summoned Jinn from this story would have hard-to-predict personality and disposition.

This law suggests that people's thoughts and associations would drastically affect other properties of summoned items and creatures as well. So what happens when a non-ignorable part of the population associates jinns with malevolent deliberate misunderstandings or horror movies\stories? It would be like summoning something from from an old religious writing or from a Grimm Brothers' tale. Would summoning Cinderella's shoes give you a pair made from silk, gold, glass, or one that is bloodied red?
