Well since quite a few books contain magical macguffins that can do basically anything, essentially the first person who gets this power will get to be the ruler of everything /forever/, since they will obviously then want to use the macguffin to make sure no one else has this magic, otherwise someone might pull out a planet (or universe) destroying weapon. If the first person to get this power happens to be a transhumanist then the obvious thing to do would be to pull out a FAI then well /you win/. If for some reason magical macguffins don't work (maybe there's a limit on the power of stuff you pull out) then the first person to get this power and know about SI will instead be the person who wins forever. Speaking of which what would you say is the most well known story with a friendly singularity intelligence that sufficiently meets your definitions of "friendly"? Essentially if you could pull any SI out of a book which would it be?
