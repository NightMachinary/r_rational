Legion of Nothing serial by Jim Zoetewey [[http://inmydaydreams.com/]] Collection of first story arc on Amazon: [[https://www.amazon.com/Legion-Nothing-1-Rebirth-ebook/dp/B00IR2CLUU]]

NOT RationalFic like the top of your list, but in line with a number of other recommendations in the thread and I think probably appealing to a lot of the same readers.

Not especially action packed for something in the superhero genre, but really good - Protagonist starts story in late high school (?). Grandson of Golden Age IronMan / Rocketeer analog - He is a bit of a cross between modern Geek/Engineer and a Modesetti Hero. There is a romance thread but so far the series has kept everything (including drinking/smoking/drugs/language) mostly PG - PG13. Violence is also usually not vicerally graphic.

I found it one of the most Unique and interesting takes on the Super Hero genre going on right now. It has a wonderful mix of post Marvel/DC deconstruction of the standard tropes plus a delightfully earnest retro Golden Age vibe with a hint of inventor punk for spice.
