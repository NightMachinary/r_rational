I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, but you can't deny that you pattern match pretty easily for, um, a /certain type/ if you make comments about preferring light skin in and of itself, being disgusted by male homosexuality activity, and only wanting to read stories from a male point of view. Just like, for that matter, if I say that I'm a Mormon, most people are going to think that I'm homophobic.
