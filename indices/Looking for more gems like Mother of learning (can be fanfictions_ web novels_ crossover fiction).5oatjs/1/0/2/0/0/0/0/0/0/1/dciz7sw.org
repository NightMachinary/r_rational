It's hard to accurately connote feelings of distaste without using strong language. The best solution is to moderate language depending on the context in which one is speaking. In casual settings, erring towards politeness makes sense. But if getting across information about one's own mental states is the goal of the discussion, the stronger language becomes more justified.
