I scrolled a little ways back in your post history to see if I could figure out what they were talking about, because obviously you're right--preferring male protagonists doesn't automatically make you a homophobe, that wouldn't make any sense. But you /have/ posted about how you're "disgusted" by gay (but not lesbian) romance, which I assume is what the above poster was referring to. I realize you specified that you don't have an issue with gay /people/, but surely you can see how that comes across?
