Hey man, I get that and I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting a main character you can identify with, but look at it this way: My main concern with this is that you are missing a lot of really great stuff. Worm is one of the best stories I have read and it has a female protagonist. If you were a woman who could only read books with a female protagonist or from a female perspective (my girlfriend is a bit like this), then you would miss out on Mother of Learning and whatever other books you personally love.

I would try and branch out a little bit in terms of characters you can relate to, because I think you are ignoring a lot of great stories. It's like people who don't eat spicy food. You are missing so much great food! And you are doing it to yourself!
