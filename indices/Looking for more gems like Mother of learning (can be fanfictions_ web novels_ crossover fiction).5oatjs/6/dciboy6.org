Mother of Learning doesn't and won't contain romance, the author has clearly stated that. I don't feel that that detracts at all from it, though; I agree that it sets a high standard.

Presumably that means that you're OK with unfinished-but-living works?

I finally checked out A Hero's War recently, and binged it all. Lots of magitech, interesting effort to deal with the economic and social ramifications of introducing the industrial revolution. Romance is present, but not overstated; though bear in mind that it's unfinished.

The only point that seemed to ring a bit false was perhaps a bit too much idealism about how people would react to massive social and technological change. There's push-back, certainly, but I would expect more.

I can't say that I identify with your identifying more with male protagonists, but to each zeir own, I guess.

If you're willing to branch out from that, the Arithmancer is fun, exploring "What if Hermione was a genius at maths instead of a bookworm?" It only covers years 1-4, though, and the sequel is IMO moving a bit slowly.

Have you read everything on rationalfiction.io? I enjoyed some of them more than others, but if you like MoL, they're all worth checking out. Bear in mind that that site doesn't always have the complete story uploaded.
