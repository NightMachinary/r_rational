The “contains some romance” bit makes it somewhat hard for me to give you recommendations because I generally don't like when romance has a major role in the plot-buildling, and tend to forget those parts even when they exist. Nevertheless, here are some things you may like:

Novels:

- *[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/50834-the-magicians][/The Magicians/]]* trilogy --- Chronicles of Narnia \ Harry Potter deconstruction where even magic can't cure protag's depression.
- *[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341735.Replay][/Replay/]]* by Ken Grimwood --- protag keeps waking up each time he dies, but each time a bit later into his life.

Webnovels:

- *[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WithThisRing][/With This Ring/]]* --- a Young Justice SI fanfic with male protag (WiP). I haven't read the most recent chapters, but several months ago he was starting to look for a romantic partner. It has some slice of life elements, but it's not that much of a problem if you're not waiting for new chapters to come out. There are some idiot balls, but not that many.
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][/A Hero's War/]] (WiP) --- protag wakes up in a middle-ages fantasy setting, and his first obstacle to survival is a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors][/Tremors/]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy][expy.]] IIRC, had some neat [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift][TechnologyUplift]] going on.
- [[http://www.fictiongrill.com/how-to-avoid-death-on-a-daily-basis/][/How to Avoid Death on a Daily Basis/]] --- Similarly to the previous story, starts with waking up in a fantasy setting. IIRC, the selling point for this story was that the protag had to survive while he had no special powers, or something like that. Also IIRC, the story somewhat dropped in quality later on.

Translated asian webnovels:

All of these are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse][RPGMechanicsVerse]] stories in one way or another, so if you don't like that genre, these won't be for you, I guess.

- *[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/][/Reincarnator/]]* --- has some repeating tropes, but otherwise is well-written. Protag goes back in time to try saving humanity after a meta-verse merging event.
- *[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-king-of-the-battlefield/][/King of the Battlefield/]]* --- premise is very similar to the previous one, actually.
- [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/terror-infinity/][/Terror Infinity/]] --- a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/][jumpchain]]-type cross-fic that has so far featured the following cinematic universes: Resident Evil series, Alien series, The Grudge, The Mummy, Final Destination series, Jurassic Park, [[http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Mask][the Vampiric Mask]] from JoJo, Starship Troopers, The Lord Of The Rings.
- Evolution Theory of the Hunter
- Life Mission
- Dungeon Hunter --- this one noticeably drops in quality in later chapters

HP fanfics:

- *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][/Too Young to Die/]]* --- Harry's sister dies, and he tries to resurrect her. Very good writing.
- *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][/Elizium for the Sleepless Souls/]]* --- a well written horror\suspense.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109003/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Maw][/HP & the Maw/]] --- Harry gets assigned to a crazy battle trainer from hell and tries to survive.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][/The Denarian Renegade/]] --- Harry gets possessed by a demon, they eventually form a symbiotic relationship.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][/Emperor/]] (WiP) --- IIRC, Harry makes his way into becoming a mundane army commander, and uses his position to try subduing the magical world.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][/With Strength of Steel Wings/]] (WiP) --- Harry is raised by a mundane person who suspects about existence of magic.

Naruto fanfics:

- *[[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][/The Waves Arisen/]]* --- Naruto tries his hand at munchkining using [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Clone_Technique][kage bunshin,]] and some other things.
