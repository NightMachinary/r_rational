[[http://otherhistory.proboards.com/thread/431/shall-reap-whirlwind][And They Shall Reap The Whirlwind]] is a self insert into the life of bomber harris. It's long and well done.

[[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/][Set in Stone]] A rational/ist Stonepunk story set in the future on planet controlled by an AI in an agrarian society. A very interesting and enjoyable story. [[/u/farmerbob1]] 's other story [[https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/about/][Symbiote]] was also pretty good.

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/chapter/58095][Savage Divinity]] I remember the start being a little slow, but seriously awesome world-building. Has a fair amount of romance

#+begin_quote
  A modern man finds himself reincarnated in the body of a young slave with no skills and quickly fading memories. Follow his journey to find normalcy while living in a savage world, filled with myth and legends, monsters and Demons. In a land where the strong rule, the weak serve, and bloodshed is a way of life, peace is a luxury few can afford... Less action, more character and world driven is my aim. Mature language and themes, but no raunchy sex.

Updates 3 times a week usually, currently I get more excited by updates from this than from MOL.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The Last Angel]] is a story where humanity lost a war and was conquered, but humanities most powerful weapon, an AI Battleship, continues the war 1500 years later. It's been 4 years since I've read it and from what I remember it switches genres to a survival horror novel about halfway in for 20 chapters or so. Really good and apparently there is a sequel that I am going now going to have to check out.

[[https://thegam3.com/2016/05/10/prologue-start-enter-the-game/][The Gam3]] is an extremely well done Litrpg. If its something you like the author has published an edited version of the first book [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DFCNAPG][Opening Moves]] with some extra content. Its the best LitRPG I've read, feels smooth and not clunky.
