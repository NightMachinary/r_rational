If you're willing to give light novels a second chance, check out Overlord. Its far and away the most professionally written light novel.

There is also Harry potter and the natural 20. D&D Harry potter.

If you want to branch out to scifi, [[/r/hfy]] has a lot of really good stories. Check the sidebar for the genre defining reads.
