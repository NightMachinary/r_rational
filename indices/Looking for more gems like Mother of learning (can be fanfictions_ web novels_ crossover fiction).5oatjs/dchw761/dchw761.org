Anything by Wildbow. His Magnum Opus Worm has a suposedly female protagonist but she's written so androgynously that you tend to forget it.

There's the Zombie Knight which is pretty good, but has a protagonist crippled by social anxiety. This might be a turn off for some.

Tobwebfiction.com has a list of some of the more popular original webnovels and I use it to look for new stuff sometimes.

For fanfiction, going to fanfiction.net, spacebattles.com or suffiecientvelocity.com checking whats popular and matches your interest might be the best way to go about it. in any of those there are vast amounts of fanfiction for varied tastes.
