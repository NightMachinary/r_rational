Nothing wrong about having preferences, but if people read your comments as value judgements on other people (even if you don't mean them that way), you should consider softening your language.

I.e. say exactly what you said above:

#+begin_quote
  I don't like watching two grown men show physical affection to each other
#+end_quote

Rather than

#+begin_quote
  you're "disgusted" by gay (but not lesbian) romance
#+end_quote

The second is a statement both about you and the act; it's a judgement. That's because disgust is not just revulsion, but also disapproval.
