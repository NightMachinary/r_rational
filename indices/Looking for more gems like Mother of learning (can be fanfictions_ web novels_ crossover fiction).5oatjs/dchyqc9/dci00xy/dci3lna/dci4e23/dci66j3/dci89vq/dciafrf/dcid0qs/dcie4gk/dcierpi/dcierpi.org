  Yes, which is why if you're trying to communicate revulsion without judgement yuo don't say 'disgust', you say it makes you feel squicky, or uncomfortable, or you dislike reading it.

Now that you put it that way, I agree, to some degree.

The problem (partially) is that sometimes the person either doesn't notice that they're using the less-advisable phrasing, or they can't use anything better because English is not their first language. And in both cases the polit-correct hivemind aggros at them and loses all reason. And things like that just piss me off, I guess. Ehm, I mean, they make me squicky? Ahaha.
