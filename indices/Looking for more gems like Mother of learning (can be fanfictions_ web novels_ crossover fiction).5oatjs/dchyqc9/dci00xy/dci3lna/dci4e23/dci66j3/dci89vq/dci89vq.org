I am disgusted by the sexual act itself, not by the romance. It's only come across as bad because we live in a society that just love to tag and condemn people. So what if I don't like watching two grown men show physical affection to each other? People have weird aversions to a lot of things. It doesn't mean that I don't respect them as human beings. These days being politically correct is just an impossible task.

You tell someone that you are more attracted to light skin women and suddenly you are a racist.

You make a bad joke about your fatness and feminists call for your blood.( e.g Hugh Mungus)

And apparently it's impossible to prefer reading from male POV without raising some eyebrows.

Sorry for my rant, just needed to get this off my chest.
