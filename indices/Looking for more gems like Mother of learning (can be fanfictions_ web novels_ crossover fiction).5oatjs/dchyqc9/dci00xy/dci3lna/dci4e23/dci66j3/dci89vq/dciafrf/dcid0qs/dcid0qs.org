That'd just be trying to politcorrect-talk around people's sensibilities in order to be able to say the same thing, no? “I'm disgusted by x” = “I feel the emotion of disgust when I encounter x.”

Granted, that word /is/ also often used when people try to impose moral judgement upon the subject of the conversation, and I guess someone in OP's position /could/ go out of their way to choose such a phrasing that would decrease the chances of being misunderstood.

But then again, so could the opposite party give the person they're speaking with the benefit of the doubt --- which (to my observation, at least) is something the offend-able people don't do that much, if at all.

Hell, during [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/5kqcqd/no_spoilers_is_the_main_character_gay/dbps8bl/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=MrRobot][that discussion we're now talking about,]] OP stated multiple times that he's got nothing against gay people themselves and that he just prefers his stories to have straight pairings, and he still got downvoted and condescendingly called a homophobe.
