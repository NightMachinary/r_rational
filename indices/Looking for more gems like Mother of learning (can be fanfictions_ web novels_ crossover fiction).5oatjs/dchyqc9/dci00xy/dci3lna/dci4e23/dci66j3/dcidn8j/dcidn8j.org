I can sort of see where they are coming from. When I was 13-16 or so I tried to hold on to religion, and while I couldn't dislike gay /people/, I found the thought of gays kissing repulsive. Somewhere around 16 I discarded religion, and the revulsion just went up in smoke. I remember the split being genuine, though.
