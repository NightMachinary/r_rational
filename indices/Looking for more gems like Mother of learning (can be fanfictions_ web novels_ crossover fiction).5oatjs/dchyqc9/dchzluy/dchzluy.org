Plus it seems like an odd thing to specifically request when "male protagonist, includes romance" is practically the default option in popular media. Like, I get asking for stories with particular qualities that are uncommon, but this is not really something you have to explicitly seek out to find it. If anything, it's impossible to get /away/ from male protagonists with romance. To each their own, but I don't get it.
