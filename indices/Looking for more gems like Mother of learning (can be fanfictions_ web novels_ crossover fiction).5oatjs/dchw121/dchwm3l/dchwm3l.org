I second the recommendation for /Pokemon, The Origin of Species/. It is is very well written and worth the read. /Dungeon Keeper Ami/ is fun, but clearly amateur. Still worth the read in my opinion.

I'd also recommend /A Hero's War/, by jseah. It has a male protagonist and a little romance. /A practical guide to evil/ is also a lot of fun. It has a female protagonist, but satisfies all your other criteria.
