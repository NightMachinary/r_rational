As other people have said, Worm's MC is female but you almost never notice it at all. I guess it's fairly light on the romance side of things, but it has all the smart writing that you're craving. It's also a monster of a read at something like 12,000 pages.

A Practical Guide To Evil is another one with a female MC, but again, it almost never comes up.

Pokemon and the origin of species, as well as the uncompleted Game of Champions, are both awesome as well.
