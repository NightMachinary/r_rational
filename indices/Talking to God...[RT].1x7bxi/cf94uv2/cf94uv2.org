  He could have been a true telepath. No documented evidence exists of anyone ever having such profound abilities to date but it was a possibility. It would have explained how he could know my best-kept secrets. The problem with that is that it doesn't explain anything else! In particular it doesn't account for the answers he proceeded to give to my later questions.
