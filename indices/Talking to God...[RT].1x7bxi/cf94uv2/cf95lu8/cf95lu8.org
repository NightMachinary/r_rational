Yeah, I mean if this guy is an actual telepath with a very good understanding of the author's mind, he'd know the things to say to convince the author.

Honestly, the probability I'd assign such a guy being a telepath wouldn't be so high as the author's. Imagine writing a program to simulate that hypothesis. You'd have to completely describe telepathy (reading an incredibly high amount of information, the physics that allows for the actual transmission of thought, accounting for one brain to completely model both its own mind and the target mind, or whatever other craziness is necessary). And then you'd have to account for the rest of the situation. That'd be far longer of a program than one that assumes no telepathy and only relies on things like cold reading, mental health record access, standard old manipulation, suggestion techniques, and even life-long stalking.

So, it seems to me even the telepathy hypothesis isn't really necessary.
