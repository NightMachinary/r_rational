  If you knew more about AI, you would know there's quite an immense difference.
#+end_quote

/obviously/ there are different flavors of AI, ranging from "food-truck vendor" to "as close to a human brain-pattern as it gets" to "optimization engine" but they all have the same two things that label them as Artificial Intelligences. ...they are artificial. ...and intelligent XP so... is this bio-engineered, lab-gown child intelligent? obviously. but is he artificial?

  "In case of bodyloss without appropriate backup, please allow me to remain dead. I think it's really badass."

see, now this I don't know about. maybe its to do with my... set? of posthuman. I'm of the "so long as the brainwave stays mostly the same, it's OK" camp. in such a camp, you need a backup of some sort. and backups can (and by Murphy's law, will) fail.

  Controlled amounts of randomness can be introduced in order to ensure that the child is more natural than engineered
#+end_quote

if randomness is controlled, is it random? admittedly, biologic processes are themselves only pseudo-random, but that's kind of the point. we could undoubtedly mimic, but probably not exactly duplicate that specific algorithm of pseudo-random.

  I wouldn't want to create a child as a baseline human
#+end_quote

this is, again, displaying our differences in transhuman belief systems. there is something... special? about having an originally natural human thought-pattern. maybe it's just the instinct to propagate the species talking, but I, and therefore some later faction, would require some assurance that the child is naturally human.
