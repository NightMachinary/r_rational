So, God is a sex maniac who has almost no consideration of how many beings and civilizations suffer and die on the path towards His next aeons-long orgasm, and none of the advanced civilizations that have escaped His seemingly endless series of Great Filters have the decency to spare their less advanced neighbors from these dangers. This story uses the language of futurism and transhumanism, but it all boils down to the same old crap about pain and death serving some higher purpose.
