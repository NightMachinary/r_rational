let us imagine our race post-singularity. in the latest part of "stage 1" described here- where we have AI, and have decoded genetics to the point where it's basically just another programming language.

now, I don't know about you, but I'm not entirely satisfied with this body. I'd definitely want an intelligence upgrade, and also changes to make me stronger, faster, more difficult to kill, etc. but also cosmetic changes. in fact, I think I should be changing bodies like most people change clothes.

imagine most people took a similar route. maybe not to the extremes of cosmetics, as I intend to, but at least in terms of intelligence. one must keep up with the joneses, after all. at this point, death is extremely rare, but it happens. mostly on accident.

now let's fast-forward a stupid amount of time. because death is rare, but it still happens, our population is dwindling. because none of us have fully human bodies anymore, normal reproduction is dicey. we could, of course, bio-engineer a child, but what would be the difference between that and an AI? more to the point, would it really be human?

and so we have our "god's" problem- we want a /natural/ child, not an artificial one. sure! we absolutely could interfere, make the child come out exactly as we wished, save the potential lives of millions of sperm by bringing them all to maturity, or any number of other things... but what would be the point? it would not bring us closer to our goal of creating a being we consider to be similar to ourselves.

in case you missed it, I mentioned sperm because that's exactly how this "god" views humans- billions of consciousnesses, many of them being destroyed, and all for the goal of creating one.
