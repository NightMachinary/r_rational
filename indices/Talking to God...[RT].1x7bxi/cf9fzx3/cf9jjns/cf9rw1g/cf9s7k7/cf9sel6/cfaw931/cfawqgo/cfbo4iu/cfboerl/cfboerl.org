  if randomness is controlled, is it random? admittedly, biologic processes are themselves only pseudo-random, but that's kind of the point.
#+end_quote

Yes. Anyone who has taken courses in stochastic anything knows the answer is /yes./ Randomness with a known or learned distribution is still random; just because a normally-distributed variable is usually closer to its mean than to its tails doesn't mean the sampling isn't actually random.

  ...they are artificial. ...and intelligent XP so... is this bio-engineered, lab-gown child intelligent? obviously. but is he artificial?
#+end_quote

Plant the child in a real live womb if you like. Whatever.

Or rather, who says you're not artificial? I'm not going to be one of those "oh, where do we draw the line" hippies, but you're the one implying you've already uplifted yourself far beyond what we currently call a natural, baseline human. In some sense, /nothing/ you create can /possibly/ be natural; even a /nature reserve/ for baseline humans is a /nature reserve/ rather than /actual nature/. Actual nature, after all, suffers destructive crises quite frequently, whereas nature reserves have their ecosystems kept balanced.

  this is, again, displaying our differences in transhuman belief systems. there is something... special? about having an originally natural human thought-pattern.
#+end_quote

I think the fracture line here is our definitions of "human". I think of "transhuman" to mean, "Start with a basically human architecture, find the parameters we'd like to tweak, and tweak them." From that standpoint, it can easily be said that a child made with a human architecture, but having "scores" like Intelligence, Wisdom, Empathy or Charisma "preset" in some sense (including by randomly mixing sampled scores from the parents in deliberately mimicry of gamete mixing), is very much a human being.

(That is, a human being with high levels in cool skills and low levels in detrimental attributes is still human.)

You, on the other hand, think of it as shifting yourself completely away from a human architecture, and then wanting to create a human being out of sheer nostalgia, who is to be raised to repeat your journey from human to not-human.
