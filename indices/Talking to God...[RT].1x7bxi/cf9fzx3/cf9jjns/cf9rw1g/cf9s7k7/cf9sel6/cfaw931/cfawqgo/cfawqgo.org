  we could, of course, bio-engineer a child, but what would be the difference between that and an AI?
#+end_quote

If you knew more about AI, you would know there's quite an immense difference. The mind-design differences alone between a human being (no matter how upgraded), a semi-intelligent service agent operating a kebab truck, and a rational agent capable of maximizing utilities over human-Friendly terminal goals and all necessary subgoals are... humongous.

  at this point, death is extremely rare, but it happens.

Yes, I suppose some people would have written in their living will, "In case of bodyloss without appropriate backup, please allow me to remain dead. I think it's really badass." The numbers of such people will dwindle quickly.

  more to the point, would it really be human?
#+end_quote

Surely we'd have backed-up copies of baseline human genomes, or some "standard" set of transhuman upgrades that can be applied as we are creating a fetus. Controlled amounts of randomness can be introduced in order to ensure that the child is more natural than engineered.

  but what would be the point? it would not bring us closer to our goal of creating a being we consider to be similar to ourselves.
#+end_quote

If I managed to go full transhuman, I wouldn't /want/ to create a child as a baseline human. Screw that! I've had bloody well enough of Nature's harsh genetic whims for one lifetime! Make the child post-human from the start.

IMHO, one of the greatest things a transhuman parent could say to the child who is already their pride and joy is, "You'll have the privilege of growing up as whole as we always wished to be."

/You/, sir, are keeping your ideas trapped firmly at the biological level of survival, reproduction and selection rather than considering higher ideals.
