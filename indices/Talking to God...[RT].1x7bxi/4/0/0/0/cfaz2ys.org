Well, I was attempting to think about this in terms of comparing Kolmogorov complexity of the two explanations. I think it's ok to compare complexity (length of the shortest Turing machine which outputs the expected pattern) of the two explanations because it's simply a stricter expression of the two explanations that make obvious the latent assumptions that they are making. Saying "he was a telepath" requires more evidence than "he knew the author in extreme detail and manipulated him using ordinary techniques", and by thinking about the Turing machines that would describe the two scenarios, we get a firm grasp on the nitty gritty background details and evidence-requirements of the two explanations.
