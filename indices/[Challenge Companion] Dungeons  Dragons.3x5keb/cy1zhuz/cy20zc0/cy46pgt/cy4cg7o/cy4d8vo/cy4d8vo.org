Mostly, 3.5e classes are roughly stratified into different tiers of power level and versatility and game breaking capacity. There's a 'Tier system for classes' that people put together to rank classes, which you can see [[http://brilliantgameologists.com/boards/index.php?topic=1002.0][here]].

Basically, 'game breakingly powerful' classes include classes like wizard, sorcerer, druid, cleric, artificer, and archivist, and 'laughably underpowered' classes include classes like fighter, monk, healer, swashbuckler, ninja, soulknife, paladin, knight, samurai. If you know anything about D&D 3.5e, this basically means that the single book with the most variance in power level, with the most blatantly overpowered and incredibly underpowered classes and player choices is the Player's Handbook.

This makes sense, because they weren't playtesting each class's capacity to contribute to solving problems, and they weren't playtesting using abilities creatively or anything like that, but they slowly started learning how to write balanced, moderate-power-level classes as time went on. Pathfinder is functioning under the same learning curve as well.
