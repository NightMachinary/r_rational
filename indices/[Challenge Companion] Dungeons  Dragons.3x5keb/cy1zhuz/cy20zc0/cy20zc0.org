I think if you take any joy in building characters or playing a balanced game, you need at least a partial moratorium on using the internet as a resource, at least for those players who are just going to look up the most maximally efficient build for their chosen class. It's not really surprising that the game gets unbalanced when hundreds of thousands of man-hours are spent on unbalancing it. Unlike a videogame though, a company that's printing books doesn't have a great way to fix a problem, or even identify that a problem exists. Margins are also a lot slimmer, which means less playtesting gets done. So I mostly try to stay away from making optimal builds and encourage others to do the same, especially because I end up depriving myself of a fair amount of the fun of character building.

I'd suggest GURPS, but you've already said that you don't like it. All my other favorite systems are for other genres or are less mechanically deep.
