I normally assume that what we see in a game isn't really what happens, in the same way that when you watch a TV show and see the zipper on the monster costume, the monster doesn't actually have a zipper on it within the context of the shows' reality.

Game mechanics such as experience levels are the equivalent of the zipper. People in the game world cannot start making charts of exactly when they get certain abilities, and determine that they always get them in a specific order and that they have to kill a certain number of monsters between them. Within the game world, all that happens is "character gradually gains abilities"; characters of the same class gain the abilities in the same fixed order because we have chosen not to simulate the game world to the level of detail needed to avoid that. Millions of game world people don't /actually/ all gain abilities in the same order and by killing monsters.
