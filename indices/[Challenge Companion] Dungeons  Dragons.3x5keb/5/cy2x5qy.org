So I wrote some handbooks on doing some of the sorts of things that you see in post-scarcity fiction and in post-cyberpunk and things like that in D&D 3.5e. These might be useful for people. First, I wrote a guide on making transhumans using D&D 3.5e rules [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9NJIs751Af3i0IEIJwCkIp9H9YFiZYZ7u-wmYVaheI/edit][here]]. Next, I wrote a thing about making airships and powerful robots and sentient constructs [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zilT4WGOyHM0AfpG4-GmD2FkgDg1HZ9HC1cTleQHds/edit][here]]. And finally, I wrote a writeup of how to basically make a whole post-scarcity society using D&D 3.5e rules [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aG4P3dU6WP3pq8mW9l1qztFeNfqQHyI22oJe09i8KWw/edit][here]].
