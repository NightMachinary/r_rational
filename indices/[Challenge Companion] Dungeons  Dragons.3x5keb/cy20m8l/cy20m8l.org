I'm sure plenty of people here are already familiar with it, but there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]], where the main character is a munchkin from the D&D universe who gets brought into Harry Potter's universe through a spell gone wrong.

EDIT: Also, there's [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], which is rational fiction that takes place in a world similar to D&D. The main difference appears to be that the spell system uses mana instead of memorization.
