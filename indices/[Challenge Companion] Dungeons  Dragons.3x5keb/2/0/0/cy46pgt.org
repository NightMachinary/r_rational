On the other hand, the internet can help you avoid accidental unbalance. 3.5 in particular is notorious for its newbie traps and wildly unbalanced PHB. A good understanding of all the options and their relative power lets you choose more balanced options if that's what you want to do (in 3.5, the most balanced classes are relatively obscure).

As for what the game designers could have done, they could ensure balance at the expense of versatility by doing what they did in 4e: remove all open ended powers and design all classes using the same, video-game like mechanics. Whether that's a good thing is up for debate: 4e isn't very popular.
