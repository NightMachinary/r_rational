Here's a good start. [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?266559-Tier-System-for-Classes-(Rescued-from-MinMax)]]

The general principle of 3.5 is that spellcasting >> all else. Also, a lot of people who haven't read the internet much assume that Core only is the most balanced and that it's adding in random splatbooks which causes problems, but it's actually the opposite. The Players Handbook is the most unbalanced book in the game, containing 3 of the 6* Tier 1 classes in the entire game, combined with a bunch of Tier 4 and Tier 5 classes, including the infamous Monk. It also contains the majority of broken spells. By contrast, the last book printed, Tome of Battle, is generally considered well balanced (though in serious need of editing and errata).

This is mainly a combination of WOTC not knowing what they were doing early on since they didn't have any experience with the new system yet and their playtesters were idiots (rumor says that the Druid playtester didn't actually use any of its class features, hence why it ended up so ridiculous), and getting a better understanding as time went on. Also, a lot of broken stuff in 3.5 was ported from earlier editions.

Note that despite the claims of Pathfinder to improve balance, the 3.5 tiers are largely unchanged. Spellcasting is still far better than mundanes, they just tinkered a bit around the edges.

*7 if you include Spirit Shaman, which is debated. Also note that one of the other 6 (StP Erudite) is an online variant of a variant of a class. If you count classes that are tier 1 as originally designed, then the total is just 5 or 6. Also, note that every single Tier 1 class outside the PHB gets access to the spell list of Wizard, Cleric, or Druid.
