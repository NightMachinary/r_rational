I've played several One-Shots in DW.

it is frickin' amazing as an improv game and the mechanics are stellar. my favorite piece is that you gain XP from FAILURE -- which means that characters either play up their weaknesses to a level of a stereotype/trope for laughs and XP or the grouchy guy that keeps rolling (6-) ends up surprisingly more powerful for the final boss fight.
