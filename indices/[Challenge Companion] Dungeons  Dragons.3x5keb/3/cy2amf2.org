I should probably mention [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?222007-The-Definitive-Guide-to-the-Tippyverse-By-Emperor-Tippy][the Tippyverse]] as one example of someone taking the rules-as-intended and trying to make a setting that takes into account some of the things possible. I don't really agree with some of Tippy's starting assumptions (namely the ease with which people can get XP and using traps for beneficial spells) but it's an interesting exploration of the consequences of the rules nonetheless, without totally dipping into the insanity that comes from uncharitable application of RAW.
