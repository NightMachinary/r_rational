It depends... there are some paths of learning that are very obviously more powerful than others -- you can't throw away the rules entirely, they DO describe the world in a profound way -- and some sorts of combat styles or learning make more sense than others. And when in life-or-death situations, the methods that really really don't work tend to cause people to die, and they don't end up being kept. That last part happens historically too, with martial arts styles when they are still being used for actual life or death fighting.
