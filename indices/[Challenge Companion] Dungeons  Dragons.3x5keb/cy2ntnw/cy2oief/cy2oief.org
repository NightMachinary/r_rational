You'd need to define what you mean by munchkining.

If you mean it in the sense of what /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/ or /The Two Year Emperor/ do, or the more abstract exercises on the character optimization boards, then I think most of the appeal is in seeing just how far the system can be stretched. It's the same impulse that leads people to send jet-powered cars hurtling across the salt flats in order to reach a new top speed. There's a particular joy in optimizing within a bounded system, and in laying out a proof of concept. It's also a thought exercise that offer low-hanging fruit and easy optimizations that don't resemble actual intellectual work as much as is required in systems or settings less ripe for abuse.

If you mean /in game/, then I think that's mostly about "winning". D&D doesn't have to be a power fantasy, but it often is, so people want to accumulate as much power as possible.
