It's not just a matter of making numbers bigger - a lot of the fun in theoretical optimization is uncovering poorly worded rules and coming up with crazy tricks that noone has ever thought of before. After all, anyone can make Pun-pun, but there's still gems left to be discovered. Heck, even if a trick is completely useless, it can still be fun if it does something unique.

I like to think that I was the first person to discover the utility of illiterate Wizards or how the obscure spell Infallible Servant has completely unintended uses.
