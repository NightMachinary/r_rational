One thing you should think about is how the rules of the game affect the behavior of players and how that is useful to a gaming experience. You seems to think that the difference between rpgs is basically just how much attention you want to pay to rules but there are lots of differences that all make for a different experience. Does the game reward you for specific actions? In Adnd (the second version of first edition) Gygax states specifically that the reason that you are rewarded for accumulating treasure is because that is what the game is about, clearly the best way to learn things isn't violencing underground beings until you have enough money to buy a fucking castle, but that is the game he was making so that is how the reward system is set up.

There are games that reward you for rich detailed descriptions of actions, some that encourage inter-player interaction, some that punish intellectual laziness. There are also systems that give you opportunities to find specific kinds of moments. Whether it is paranoia leading the players to creating complicated webs of betrayal or one last heist letting you becoming secretly the best at something at a story vital moment or headspace having you weeping over a lost ally you never knew because you wanted to use a skill you didn't have.
