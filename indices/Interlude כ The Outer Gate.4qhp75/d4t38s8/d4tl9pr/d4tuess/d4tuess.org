John Young+Kenneth Mattingly+Fred Haise+Richard Nixon is the only possible combination of crew members that includes Richard Nixon where the syllables in their names add up to the number 13.

Edit: removed some unnecessary qualifiers.

Edit 2: Kenneth is actually his middle name. His real name is Thomas Mattingly. Doesn't change the syllable math, but it does mean there's someone on the flight who was faking something. A kabbalist would at least point out this, even if it would be trivial, so I have as well.
