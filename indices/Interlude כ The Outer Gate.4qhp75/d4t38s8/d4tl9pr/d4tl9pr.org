| Position             | Reality      | UNSONG            |
|----------------------+--------------+-------------------|
| Commander            | Jim Lovell   | John Young        |
| Command Module Pilot | Jack Swigert | Kenneth Mattingly |
| Lunar Module Pilot   | Fred Haise   | Fred Haise        |

It may be that the name "Young" is significant, or that somebody whose surname starts with "love" wasn't on UNSONG's Apollo 13. Maybe Lovell gave away all his possessions and Charlie Duke never contracted Rubella from one of his kids, or something like that.

I can't come up with any Kabbalistic explanation for favouring Mattingly over Swigert. Apparently Mattingly comes from Mattingley, which means "woodland clearing of the family or followers of a man called Matta". May be transformed UNSONG-wise into followers of Matthew, I guess.

Matting is also the process, and material used in the process, of forming mats. I, uh, don't have any real ideas there either.

It may be explained in a future interlude, one of those things (like "KNEEL" = "Neil") where a clever bit of lateral thinking can reveal the answer ahead of time. It's highly unlikely that I'll ever be that thinker.
