You and [[/u/redstonerodent]] are using different conventions for describing typos. Currently, the chapter contains this sentence:

#+begin_quote
  I believe that just there is a gate to Hell inside the Earth, so the edge of space may be an outer gate which leads to Heaven.
#+end_quote

when it should be this:

#+begin_quote
  I believe that just as there is a gate to Hell inside the Earth, so the edge of space may be an outer gate which leads to Heaven.
#+end_quote
