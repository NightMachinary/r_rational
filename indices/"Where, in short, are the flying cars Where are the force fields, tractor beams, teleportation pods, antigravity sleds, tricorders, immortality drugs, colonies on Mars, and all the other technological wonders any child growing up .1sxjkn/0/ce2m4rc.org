It bothers me that he keeps saying that "robot factories don't exist". They definitely do, and the vast majority of production is done by mechanical processes. Human labor makes up a relatively small fraction of production, and is only used in those cases where it's not cheaper to mechanize - which is rare. And this is about what you would expect, given a long tail distribution of work. We've got a saying in software development that the last 10% takes 90% of the work, and I have to imagine that's definitely true of mechanization as well.

Much of the other stuff, like teleportation, force fields, teleportation, anti-gravity sleds, etc. will just never happen. The reason we got that stuff wrong is that people saw scientific advancements as being additive progress in blocks of equal size. The Less Wrong crowd will often argue that advancement is exponential - in that more and more of it is happening faster and faster - but I would actually that it's an S-curve. Initial advancements caused an acceleration, and then eventually you've done the majority of the work that you can do and you're left making incremental improvements. People might have looked from Newton to Einstein and saw these giant leaps in thinking, but it's really a matter of /refinement/ rather than /revolution/.

And then to decry computation as a basically worthless consolation prize is just so ... wrong that I barely know where to begin. Basically the only thing holding robotics back right now is computation, and if we could get our "mere simulation" of chemistry working correctly, we would be well on our way to all of the revolutions that genetics still promise. He talks about not having a cure for cancer, but that's the same misunderstanding of things that pervades the whole article - "cancer" is not just one thing, and a "cure" is not going to be some miracle. The truth is, unless the Singularity actually happens, curing cancer will be a matter of curing single instances of cancer one at a time, and increasing survivability, and getting faster treatment. You won't be able to say "We beat cancer", you'll instead say "Cancer is not as common or bad as it used to be". But you probably won't even say that, because people will take the cures for granted.

A lot of this article bothered me.
