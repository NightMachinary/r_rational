A lot of this article bothered me too, but there were some points that I think require some thought. The bureaucracy in research is one point that I think can really be improved on. My supervisor at uni spent 3 hours a week talking to his students, 1 hour in the lab during non-term times only, and the rest of his time writing grants, proposals, teaching, editing papers and other non-directly research related tasks. This extreme, but representative of the problems.

A point I am less sure about is the general bureaucracy in life and the need to work. I don't know if our output is enough that most people shouldn't have to work, but I do sometimes wonder how much wealth is actually being created by all the people who sit at a computer all day. It may be that, yes the vast majority of people are actually contributing, but I can also imagine that if we could re-write the world we could remove a lot of jobs without any decline in output. Does anyone have any data/more knowledge (I'm just a student) on this?

And in terms of space exploration, we really haven't been poring in the money that was being expended during the space race, and this has definitely slowed growth. There are many possible alternative methods to get to space, but none have really been explored past the design phase so we're still lighting various chemicals on fire.
