What kind of bizzaro alternate universe is this person living in? We do have most of those things, and the majority of the rest either just lack funding and could be caught up to expected levels with a mantan project style effort in a few years, or make assumptions about physics that we wont be able to circumvent until we get some kind of sub-femtotech. Of the ones we don't have, for most we have good substitutes.
