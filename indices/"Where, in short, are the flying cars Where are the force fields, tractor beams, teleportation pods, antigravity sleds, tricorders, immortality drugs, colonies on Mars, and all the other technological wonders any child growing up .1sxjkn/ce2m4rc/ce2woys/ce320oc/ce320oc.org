Oh, I definitely agree with parts of it (especially the proliferation of beaurocracy).

The big reason that space exploration has stalled out is that there aren't big enough economic incentives. Getting to the moon required NASA to be roughly 5% of the federal budget - and didn't really have anything in the way of returns. The biggest returns available in space right now are tourism, helium-3 mining, and asteroid capture. These are theoretically profitable, but not profitable at current time. They are all enormously expensive to set up. The reason that we've basically stalled out in space is that we took a significant fraction of our national budget to get there, and once that was cut back we were left without the budget to go really go back. I think we're finally getting back to the point where we might be able to start up space exploitation again, and it's a combination of new designs and heavy automation that's going to get us there. Once there's proven profit in space, humanity will start going there with more regularity.
