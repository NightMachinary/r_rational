This guy is an idiot. I got pretty mad during reading the article, as this guy obviously has very little grasp of how science works and how it advances. Sure, it's easy to say "science isnt making much progress, why cant we do all the things that scifi said it would do in the 60s? Scifi was right in the 20s!" Well guess what? Science is really, really fucking hard. Sure, it was relatively simple to exhaust all the low-hanging fruit within our grasp, but that doesnt mean we'll just keep making such huge revolutions every few years. If this guy had ever actually tried going to some actual science classe, he'd realize just how fucking much we know about how things work. We aren't just sitting in some room staring at our dicks. But just because we aren't delivering new fundamental theories on how everything works every decade, doesn't mean that it gives some new-age hippie the right to say that science hasn't done anything really important in decades. Anti-gravity, force fields, flying cars, and teleportation pods are all either ruled out by our current, vast knowledge of how the universe works, or they are so impractical at the moment that they aren't even worth considering. Sure, asking someone in the 50s, they would be surprised that we dont have any Data-esque androids walking around doing our jobs, but then again that same person has absolutely no fucking clue about how hard artificial intelligence is to actually produce. In order to actually make something that can think in any way like a himan, you have to completely reverse-engineer and understand, at an incredibly deep level, the most complicated object that humanity has ever discovered. It really is not as simple as this guy seems to think. If he really wants the world to advance so much, learn how the shit you criticize works, then improve it yourself. Yes, it is hard. That is why any average guy off the street isnt producing a modern miracle every tuesday. /rant
