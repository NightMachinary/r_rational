Hi all, I've been lurking for a while, I figured it was time to finally give everyone a link to my story since I'm almost done with the first book.

Delvers LLC is the title of my "transported" series. I was tired of of (what I considered to be) lazy writing in some of the escapist genres I like, so... I wrote my own!

Delvers isn't perfect, but it doesn't just wave away world building. I also did a lot of research to make some of the trope twists and world limitations plausible.

Thanks for your consideration!
