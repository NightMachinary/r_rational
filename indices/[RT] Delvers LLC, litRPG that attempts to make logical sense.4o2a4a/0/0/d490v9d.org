All advice that isn't just slamming is constructive, IMO.

I'm almost done with my story's first book. I'm planning a deep edit prior to publishing where I am going to (vigorously) address everything, but the first few chapters in particular.

This is my first real novel, so my growth as a writer is really obvious, especially between the first 50k and last 50k words.

Right now some people will like it, some people won't, and that's unfortunately the best answer I can give to your comments.
