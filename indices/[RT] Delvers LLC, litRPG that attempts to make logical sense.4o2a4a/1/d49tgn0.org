Thanks for writing something! I read the whole thing

I like your overall story. The characters are succeeding at thinking about the situation they're in, and in general, everyone has dimensions to who they are.

But...

So, normally I might try to write down what I don't like but I don't think that's helped in the past. Instead -

I found myself skimming a lot. I wanted to see what would happen, but I didn't feel any desire to read every word. This is fine. Just, if you feel an inspiration to make something into a beautiful use of words... indulge!

The combat focus. You've succeeded at putting them into a situation where it makes sense to seek out that danger (no money to hire someone else, need the literal loot), but if I were those two... this comes to mind: At SpaceX, apparently, every time you wonder if you should do something, they ask themselves: Does this take us to mars? For these two, it should be: Does this help us unite the continent?

With that goes - Every problem has been solved by violence. I really, really wanted to see them walk up to the dungeon and /barter/ their way in. ([[http://www.critical-hits.com/blog/author/multiplexer/][Read about the economics of murder hobos]]). Make the next plot about one of those topics, maybe?

*However, your biggest problem? The one that is making your story suffer the most?* You need to pass the bloody [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test][Bechdel test]]. You should do this *as soon as possible*.

This is not because feminism yadda yadda patriarchy. It's because you've got some amazing characters that haven't had a chance to shine. The deep, interpersonal conversations between the male leads have been great; they really establish their characters and give them a distinct voice. Do the same for your women.
