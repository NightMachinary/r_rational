Excellent points, thank you!

This is some of the best feedback I've ever gotten - no lie.

I plan to add a few chapters before publishing and I definitely want to have at least a chapter fleshing out Kinwe-na-ibbi and Uluula some more.

As for solving problems without violence, book two is going that direction. :) If you're caught up to the latest chapter on my website, you can probably tell that something is brewing with the orks.

I really like the idea of subverting fantasy tropes. I'm working on it, I promise! I guess I'm just not moving fast enough.

Thank you again for your feedback and I'm honored you took the time to read my work.
