Ugh, I hope this doesn't sound too mean, but I'm not too impressed. You tend to put exposition dumps in the middle of dialogue, and your descriptions seem similarly cluttered.

Dialogue in general seems to be the biggest flaw, neither of the main characters seem "real" to me. I even had trouble telling them apart, and that was just in the first couple chapters. I have no clue if your character writing gets better later on, but if it does you might want to consider rewriting the start of the story, because it's turned me off your book entirely.

I'm sorry my advice isn't really constructive, I'm not a writer myself, but I hope it helps regardless.
