As a whole, yes. There's a reasonably interesting cast, consistently clever storytelling and a remarkable courage to change genres and tone as the plot progresses.

Looking specifically at the rationality criterion, it's alright. Beyond being consistently clever, it's /mostly/ grounded and sensible about it, if we accept the starting assumption that the kids that form the main cast are unnaturally mature thinkers, with only the occasional hiccup along the way.
