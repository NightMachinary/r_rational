Thank you for posting. I extend the same request to you as I did to /u/gbear605, to spoiler-tag these chapters to hide the thumbnail.

With all that bickering in the middle, I was sort of afraid that would be all this chapter had, but they still managed to squeeze in a reasonable amount of plot in the end.

Also, I'd almost forgotten, but there's still a huge chunk of exposition hanging in limbo here. The pen cap they found just before setting the rebellion in motion apparently gave them a large wealth of information that hasn't been shared with the reader yet, except in vague terms like "So that's what 'The Seven Walls' means". I'm looking forward to hearing what that's all about.
