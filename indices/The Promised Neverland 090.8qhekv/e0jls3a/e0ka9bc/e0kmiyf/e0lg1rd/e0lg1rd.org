I quit ~10 chapters ago, since it had felt dry and the characters flat for a while. The start promised much more than I feel it delivered, and at times it seemed merely clich√©. IMO this hasn't been particularly rational; there have been the typical manga-esque bursts of creativity, but most of it feels more along the "social stereotype" version of intelligence than it does "cognitive work".

I seem to be an outlier, since upvotes on the posts have been [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=promised+neverland&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new][pretty much flat]] since the series started, so there hasn't been much attrition.
