I think the writing is pretty high-quality, and the beginning is hooking enough. That said, you need either a proofreader, or pay more attention to certain types of typos.

1. Unnecessary capitalization after hyphens, colons, and semicolons.

   #+begin_quote
     But, if you asked someone who didn't know him too well, but still sort of did -- *A* casual acquaintance, perhaps
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_quote
     You know: *You're* rooting about in the garden and wander too close to their hive
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_quote
     You feel somewhat assured; *Surely*, if you wait there, things will become clear
   #+end_quote

   "A", "you're", and "surely" respectively do not need to be capitalized.

2. When using, or failing to properly use, ='s= to show possession.

- 

  #+begin_quote
    After all, a tool, however pretty, had no dignity when deprived of *it's* proper job.
  #+end_quote

  * its

- 

  #+begin_quote
    The distinct way each of them operated, the ways the gears were organized and linked, and what that said about the *creators* mindset
  #+end_quote

  * creators'

- 

  #+begin_quote
    Don't let yourself get wrapped to much in other *peoples* narratives
  #+end_quote

  * people's

I noticed that these mistakes appear frequently in the text, which is all the more off-putting considering the (high) quality of the rest of it.
