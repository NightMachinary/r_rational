Ah, yeah. I'll admit I make a lot of those sorts of mistakes, especially in the earliest chapters, which were written a while ago now. Since I'm an English speaker, it's nothing but pure laziness on my part; I need to make more thorough editing passes.

I'll go back and fix at least the earlier examples some time later today.
