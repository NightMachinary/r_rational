Feel free to be blunt with any impressions! Because the nature of the story as one where even the very minor details are important, I've ended up rewriting the early parts several times as I've tried to strike a good balance between being entertaining enough to hook and conveying all the important information, while still coming across as organic. It's at the point where it's tough for me to read objectively, so I'm not above going back to parts just yet if it fails to be intriguing on one level or another.
