Thanks for your interest!

Without spoiling anything, the story is sort of structured such that there's an overarching greater mystery, and a bunch of smaller "cases" along the way. Expect each of those to last something in the realm of 10-20 chapters, of course being internally solvable, and offering some catharsis. The first nine or ten chapters are sort of introductory, though, so I wouldn't quite count them in that regard.

The length of the entire thing is harder to say. I've sort of set up the story so elements can be stripped or wrapped up quickly should I want to change plans along the way, and my update schedule could potentially speed up or slow down based on my circumstances. But it will probably go on for at the very least well over a year.
