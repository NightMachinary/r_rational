The last angel is about an AI built by humans that survived after they were all killed by aliens. It's still mad and is fighting a 2000 year long, one ship war.

IMO it's a bit slow paced, with lots of flashbacks and perspectives from all the different sides. But there's also a lot of [[/r/hfy][r/hfy]] to it.
