People on this sub often discuss the idea of rebuilding a modern civilization in a different universe or a timeline or after being sent back in time.

This book is technically not fiction, but it has the same kind of vibe as "The Martian" and "What If", so I think you guys will like it.

Also, I've just started reading it, so I don't know how good it is, but it looks really promising.
