This is my favourite non-fiction book, super interesting. All sorts of neat knowledge in there that leads to a better understanding of the underpinnings and tech tree leading to a modern civilization. Gives insight into all the things that might be necessary to bootstrap an industrial civilization (on Mars say) and all sorts of neat science and history. Highly recommended.
