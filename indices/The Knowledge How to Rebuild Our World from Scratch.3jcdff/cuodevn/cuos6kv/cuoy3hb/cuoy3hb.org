True, but that's not the point. It's too small to be a complete guide, what it does is provide a glimpse. It samples interesting and useful pieces of civilization and provides a broad overview.

It's written to be interesting and enlightening and a worthwhile read. If it was really attempting its joke purpose it would be a maximally dense information dump of key facts that would require hours of thought per sentence.

After reading the book I got a lot out of it. I learned about many things I never thought about before (eg production of base chemicals like saltpetre and quicklime). I revised up my difficulty estimates for building a self-sufficient civilization of any kind (Mars or Earth) and increased my understanding of Earth's civilization.
