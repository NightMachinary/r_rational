In a post-apocalypse, even without an industrial base, you can still salvage much-larger-than-naturally-occurring quantities of pre-refined materials, like metals and solvents. (Heck, life on Earth is already one "apocalypse" down, and we depend heavily on the much-larger-than-naturally-occuring pools of hydrocarbons that resulted.) I would expect the guide to take advantage of such a thing, and for it to thus not translate well to a "pristine" planet like Mars.
