Mars is the most interestingly different because you can use arbitrarily advanced technology to get set up but you also have the highest level of tech necessary to survive. On Mars you need integrated circuit production (the pinnacle of difficult industrial process requiring fabricating tons of other base tech and materials) just to set up a new habitat with air, not so on Earth.
