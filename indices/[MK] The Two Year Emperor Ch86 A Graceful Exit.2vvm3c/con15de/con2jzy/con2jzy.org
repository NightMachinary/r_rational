I'm glad you liked it. The Overgods didn't tell me what they are going to do with the Mantle -- they may argue about it amongst themselves for a while, but I'm sure they'll come up with something.

If you aren't going to continue with your metafic, I encourage you to post a final chapter announcing that fact and laying out whatever plot elements you'd had in mind -- give people closure, in other words. Also, mark it complete on FFN and put a warning in the summary that it's abandoned.
