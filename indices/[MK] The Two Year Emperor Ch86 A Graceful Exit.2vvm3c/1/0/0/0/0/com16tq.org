That's part of why I haven't written it. I've never come up with a way for him to win, especially now.

I suppose I could write an epilogue and play straight -- have him actually get sent home. That feels like a losing bet, though; either he loses all his magic stuff and enhancements, or I have to write another novel about him Munchkining the real world.

Hm.
