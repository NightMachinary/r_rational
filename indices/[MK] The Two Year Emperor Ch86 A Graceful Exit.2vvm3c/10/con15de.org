Haha. I'm fine with the ending, honestly. Was a little sad that we don't get to see more of Death-Suze but I'm also happy she lived, so there's that. Also, question: What's going to happen to Death's Mantle now? I"m assuming that the Overgods have it in their possession right now, ready to bequeath it onto another being, be it another mortal or a God, but that's just an assumption? What're they gonna do?

Also, my 2YE metafic has stagnated pretty hard. It's a symptom of my disease. My plot bunnies all get cancer. They'll last for 2-3 chapters worth of decent stuff. And then die off, never to be resurrected. This isn't the first time it's happened, and it probably won't be the last. Sorry. I do have a basic point-to-point of how I envisioned the plot going though. Let me know if you'd be interested in receiving it via PM.
