So now I'm considering doing it, but the problem is not overpowering him. It's easy enough to say that his stat bonuses continue to work, but "Jake wins because he's really strong and smart" isn't the kind of story I want to write -- that's been done.

What I'd like to do is have him bring a few magic items with him and they continue to work. The problem with that is that if I gave him a standard loadout (one of those Handy Haversacks that Ellen picked up) then he's too OP. I never made a complete list of what's in those things but it is, at a minimum:

  Each Handy Haversack was filled with dozens of Portable Holes that were in turn full of food, literally tons of gold pieces and expensive spell components, maps, traveling gear, scores of healing potions, hundreds of magic items---even a full set of elegant furniture for a good-sized house! Whomever had put the gear together had been clever enough to include an itemized list of the contents, which container they were in, the purpose of each magic item, and all necessary command words.

  The Belts of Many Pockets were similarly equipped---full of nuts and dried meats as flavorful food, a Bag of Everlasting Rations for sustenance, plentiful amounts of gold and silver, healing potions, and yet more Portable Holes full of treasure beyond dreams of avarice. Each Belt even had a few empty pockets for whatever the wearer might choose to add.

I estimate the gold at about $4.4 billion USD. [1]

Obviously overpowering Jake this much is not an interesting story. So, Jake brings just a few magic items -- one or two at the most. Which ones, and why didn't he bring the entire pack? (I suppose I could go with "he /did/ bring the entire pack, but traveling between worlds wiped all but these ones because plot.")

Suggestions?

[1] The gold: Call it 200 cubic feet of coins (the Hole is 270 cu ft, but you lose some for the packing and this is a Fermi estimate), where one cubic foot is 546,514 grams or 17,570.8 troy ounces. Call it 3,400,000 troy ounces. Current price of gold is ~$1300 USD / troy ounce, so that's 4.4 billion USD.
