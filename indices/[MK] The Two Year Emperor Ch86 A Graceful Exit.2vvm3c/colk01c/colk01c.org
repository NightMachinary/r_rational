I loved reading this series and think your writing stlye is great but this just doesn't feel like a satifying ending. This story is about a random guy transported to a DND world to rule an empire, though I enjoyed reading Suze's story arc it just doesn't feel like an apropriate ending. I also wonder about the wisdom about killing Flobovian rulers seeing as

1) they could just mindscrape them to make them forget everything about Flobovia and maybe send them back to right after maybe even minutes after they were taken(though I assume there are ways for time travel in DND).

2) They may not have the means to even find their way back let alone lead an army with them. Jake is from a world where magic doesn't even exist or at least completely unuseable by anyone there and may not have been that unique among the rulers. Hell they could just mindscrape them to see if they have anyway of travelling back after being sent home and not kill them if they dont.

3) If they weren't planning on revenge they most likely will after they find out whats going to happen to them. They may even get allies by resurrecting the formers rulers that were killed(yeah I know what the languard said but after the revelations I think their being less than honest or are holding something back)

While we are on the subject of the languards deceit I wonder if the reason that Jake couln't level up, gain classes or be resurrected(or so they say) is because they did something when they summoned him there like when they filled his mind with Flobovian knowledge or altered his personality. Overall I feel that the ending of the 2YE should be about the end of emperor Jake's reign as I feel since it began with his rule it should end with it.
