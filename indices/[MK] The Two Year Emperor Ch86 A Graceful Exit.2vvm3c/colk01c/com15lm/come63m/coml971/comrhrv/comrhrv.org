I stood there for a moment before I looked around and began piching myself, everything looked and felt real so this couldn't just be a dream* "I assure you this is no dream so please listen to what I have to say"* I nodded for him to continue " You see when a Ruler is taken from his world to rule this kingdom it is by this lands law that they rule for two years and are killed when their reign is over no exceptions. This is done out of fear that the former rulers will come back with an army for revenge for taking them from their homes. So under the justification it is to protect the land the landguard have it in their oath to kill all rulers once their two year reign comes to an end. I was or the person whose mind and memories I come from was one these rulers, the moment I was brought here I scanned their minds and found the truth. Luckily for me they did not know I was a telepath so I hid it from them and for the two years I was here I tried to find an opportunity to escape but was unable to so I mind wiped a homunculus to have my memories and part of my mind then polymorthed it into a stone that I hid in the ground so I can leave a message to someone like you my name is Orm by the way."

I stood there analyzing everything he said wondering if he is telling the truth. Obviously having read my mind he showed me his memories about his discovery, his reign as the then ruler and his death at the hands of the landguard. I couldn't believe it and I didn't want to so I asked him questions hoping to catch him in a lie.*"Wait a minute instead of killing the rulers coudn't they just delete our memories of our time here or make sure we actually have a way to come back. I was brought here with magic which doesn't even exist in my world and my people weren't anywhere close to discovering interdimensional travel"

"It doesn't matter, when the law was made most of the landguard at the time were worshipping a god that aproved of those kind of things if it was in the name of the land and offered the slain rulers as sacrifices. Though the landguard have changed their views since then the law was in effect for so long it became a part of the kingdom and a holy tradition for the landguard who as you know are fanatical when it comes to the law and protecting the land. Even though the landguard of today would probably disaprove of even considering such a law like they have made an oath that they will follow even if it means their death, they will not escitate to kill you when the time comes."/He looked at me and probably saw the depressed look of betrayal on my face/"If it makes you feel any better they feel pretty terrible about having to kill you"

I was desvastated at the revelation though not that suprised considering how fanatical they are to the point that they would kill themselves if ordered and Thomas outright stating he would kill me for the good of the land.* "Wait a minute you knew that these guys a bunch of high level highly trained paladins who number in the thousands and were basically superhumans would eventually kill me but didn't tell me *after* I made them all literally dozens of times deadlier and more powerful." I said this with a 'are you serious face' which didn't go unoticed/"For your information my range is as far as the castle and you came up with then implemented that idead when you were in another land."/He stated in a matter of fact tone before continuing* "Besides I needed to make sure you met my standards and made sure you could actually help me before I took a risk in revealing myself to you."/He then cocked his head to the side/"What did you think I would just help you without asking for anything in return?"

I looked at the telepath wondering what he could possibly want I mean he is already dead what could he possibly.../"Let me guess you want me to bring you back to life"/I simply stated which brought a smile to his face/"Yes but the thing is a normal resurection just wont work since like you I am not from this world, they make sure of that whenever they summon a new ruler."/ Of course it makes sense, if their gonna kill a ruler just because they think they will seek revenge their are gonna go the extra mile and make sure they can't be brought back to life.*"Before you even think of refusing I believe I should let know now that first off I am the only person outside the archmages who knows the ritual to take you home and second if you refuse or are caught I made it so you will forget this ever happened." Orm stated in finality

Obviously I have no choice but to help Orm if I want to make it of here alive and make it back home, something that he is perfectly aware of. "Hold on if you are telepath couldn't you just use your powers to force me to do what you wanted?" I asked "I had the ability to yes but in my world learning those skills was highly illegal and would lead to the execution of anyone caught learning it so I never took the risk of learning them. One of the reasons I picked you is because I could erase your short term memory without any visible damge the second is because you seem smart enough to actually pull this off but you are on your own until I am alive again." I opened my mouth to speak. "And no a wish spell is not enough to get you home or resurrect me, the archmages went to extreme care to make it so we coudn't use any of this worlds magic to go home only the ritual will work and since we dont have souls normal resurrections dont work. I should warn you now that the landguard will be more careful now that your reign is coming to an end and will scan your mind when you go to sleep like they have been doing these last two years so I will erase your memories right after you go to sleep tomorrow so you have one day to come up with a plan."

Damn it, I knew it wouldn't be that easy but just one day to come up with a plan is not enough time especially against physically and mentally enhanced supersoldiers multiple class levels, I am seriously regretting coming up with that damned FLEA. "Okay I seeing as I have no choice I'll do my best to get raised, so do you have any idea why people like us cant be resurrected or at least not easily" Orm closed his eyes as he went through his creators memories. "It appears that is because we lack what you and the people of these lands call souls. You see the people of this have two forms their physical form that connects them to this world and their spirit form or soul which is the core of who they are. When they die their soul enters an afterlife leaving their body behind, but we are different we have only one form our physical bodies which house our core being meaning their are no souls to bring back from the afterlife hence we are not technically alive by this worlds definition." Orm stated while I listened intently.

So not only do I have to escape the landguard but I also need to bring Orm back to life with a method I must come up with in just one day. I spend the next two hours going over everything Orm said and the resources that were available to me trying to come with anything that has even the smallest chance of succeding. Then I focused on something Orm said about us not having souls and technically not being alive and just like that I came up with a plan that may be able to work. So me and Orm spent all our time going over every single detail of the plan making sure we didn't miss anything realizing this was our only shot.
