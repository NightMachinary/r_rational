To quote a large number of my reviews: "Great chapter! Looking forward to the next one!"

Is Orm an Aquaman reference?

Two minor nits:

1) The Landguard are actually level 101, not 60. Being as they were the ones running the FLEA, the Landguard took a slightly larger share for themselves. They are all paladin/wizard/sorceror/cleric of the True God/archivists now -- 21 in paladin and 20 in everything else.

2) There's actually no psionics in Stupidworld (because I loathe psionics) so psions wouldn't be a known thing, but I don't see why we couldn't just assume that this is a mutant-powered Charles Xavier expy.

You should take this, brush it out a bit, and post it as a metafic of 2YE. I'd read the rest of it.
