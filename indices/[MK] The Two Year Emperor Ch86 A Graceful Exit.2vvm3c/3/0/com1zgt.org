Thanks. :>

Back when 2YE started, I knew I was going to want to kill some characters. The problem with that is that death is ridiculously cheap in D&D, and I wanted a way to make it stick. I asked [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?306515-How-to-kill-someone-permanently][over on the GITP forums]] and got a series of suggestions on how to make it work. There were only a few that fit in my ruleset and that I actually believed would work; this was the most straightforward and morally un-ambiguous of the options.
