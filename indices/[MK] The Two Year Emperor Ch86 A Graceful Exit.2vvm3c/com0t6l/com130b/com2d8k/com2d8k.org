How about Jake wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to the kitchens to get a glass of water, and overhears some off-duty landguard saying it'll be a shame to kill him after all he's done for them, but tradition and law so what can you do.

And then he has someone send a message to Suze to set up a private meeting, he explains what's going on and Suze helps him escape.
