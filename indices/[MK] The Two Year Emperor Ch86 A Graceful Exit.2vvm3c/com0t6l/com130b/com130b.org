That little plot bunny has been churning around in my brain since I hit the first key, but it's never come out from under the couch. I have no idea how Jake discovers what's going on, escapes, etc. So, nope, probably not going to get written, sorry. (Although, I'll write practically anything if someone throws enough money at me.... ;> )

  Hermione / Avengers

Most likely it would have been a one short novelette / novella(*) showing a slice of life on what it's like for Hermione to be a member of the Avengers. More about the wacky and the fluffy instead of the battle-y and thunder-y.

(*) Then again, I never expected 2YE to be 350,000 words, and my so-far published Kickstarter stories have ended up 50% and 100% over length. Apparently, I suck at writing short.
