I'm glad you liked it; sorry you didn't like the ending, though.

Mindscrape is technically outlawed in Flobovia, but otherwise your points are all granted.

As to the Landguard...nope, they were being straight up. Jake stands outside a lot of the rules of the world -- he has no alignment, no ability to gain levels, and can't be resurrected. I don't think he has a soul, actually.
