/It was past noon when me and my bodyguards/future muderers were going down a not too crowded street heading to the destination of my choosing. I had spent the whole morning writing some very, very and my mean very bad plays, the kind that you would die of embarrasment if you were just caught reading the script let alone attend the actual play. I had made sure to have the landguards read the whole thing at first and then just the ones who dared looked at what I was writing asking for their opinions. Looking at their faces when they read at was just priceless especially as they were looking around to make sure no one saw them read the scripts. It got to the point that they would avoid looking at what I was writing altogher which is exactly what I was hoping for./

/We finally reached the destination that I needed to get to to set my plans in motion. It was on a corner on a street that happened to be close to a plaza, on the corner was literally a pile of wish scrolls. It was just what I needed so I walked up to the pile and reached for a scroll with my pen the hand I was reaching with then 'accidently' dropping my pencil in the pile and taking out a scroll. I walk back to my guards and hand the scroll to Thomas for later use then try to write more plays only to realize I 'dropped' my pencil in the pile so I run up to it and put my hand inside. At which point I lightly grab a scroll and as quietly as possible say "I wish I could write down my wishes" hoping that it works(truth be told I could have just skipped this part but if I was heard I had an easier time explaining my actions in a non incrimenating way). I then 'trip into the huge pile hoping it looks convincing and as stealthily as possible sneak a scroll into my coat before the landguard pull me out of the huge pile./

/As me and the languard walk back to the castle I once again begin writing down my terrible plays and again the landguard began purposelly ignoring looking at my writings. That was when I set things in motion, I carefully took out the wish scroll and put it between the papers I was holding at which point I write down on a blank piece of paper "I wish to be put in a looping time stop spell only I can cancel" and just like that everything around me stopped. I look around and make sure the time stop spell worked, I look to see everything even the landguard frozen in time Iand make sure the spell really affected them. I ran back to the pile of wish scrolls and go over the plan and to make sure I didn't miss anything crucial. When we had the scrolls made we put in measures so they couldn't be used to be used for evil purposes and we made absolutely sure they couldn't be used to cause harm to the landguard. Acording to Orm the landguard took measures so that I couldn't escape using the scroll and covered every scenerio so I was limited to what I could do. Still I was preparing for this very moment for hours and had planned out exactly how I would get around them, so I took a deep breath and started the most crucial part of the plan "I wish..."/

/I woke up to find myself in a cave in a deep crater wondering how I got here then the memories came to me. It was my last day as leader of Flobovia and I was lead to outside the castle when suddenly everything went black... well at least they made it quick and painless. I looked around to see where I was, it was just a dimly lit cave at the bottom of a crater that used to be Herrun's old temple that I destroyed. So looking around I see a chest appear out of nowhere which I immediately rush to, I open it to find one hundred wish scrolls. I take one out and make my first wish "I wish for the body of the former ruler Orm to be brought before me" a humanoid body then appears before, though skeleton would be a more acurate description. I then make my second wish "I wish for this body to be in the condition it was right before the ruler Orm reign came to an end" the skeleton before my eyes is restored to life./

/Orm slowly stands up looks at me for a few seconds then delved into my mind, after a few moments he asks me for boots of teleportation which I wish up. He puts them on then teleports, I spend the next few minutes waiting the minutes feeling like days until he finally returns./ "I was able to keep my distance by connecting to the hommunculus and got what I needed without being dicovered"/He paused and I held my breath/ "The plan worked they think your still dead and don't have the slightest idea what our plans were"* I nearly drop to the floor in relief at the news not believing that the plan actually worked.*

- The plan was actually quite simple rather than trying to escape from ridiculousy overpowered paladins/archivists/archmages supersoldiers I simply let them kill me while I made so that I could come back to life afterwards. It all began with the idea that since I didn't have a soul I wasn't technically 'alive' by the rules of this world and couldn't be resurrected with a resurrection spell. That meant two things one if I died the landguard would never assume that I could be brought back to life with a resurrection spell and would assume I was dead for good and two I might as well be no different than a golem and there was no rule saying you couldn't wish a broken golem repaired neither did the rule apply to me. So all I needed to do was make it so that my body would be teleported to a specific location no one would have any reason to go to after a period after being buried then use another wish to 'repair' my body after it's teleported and tada you have the perfect disappearing act. Of course I can't forget the hundred wish scrolls that nobody will miss, I turn to Orm waiting for him to speak*

"well?"* I look at him with a face that says get on with it*"Do not worry with these scrolls we almost have everything we need, now we just need a few archmages to do the ritual"
