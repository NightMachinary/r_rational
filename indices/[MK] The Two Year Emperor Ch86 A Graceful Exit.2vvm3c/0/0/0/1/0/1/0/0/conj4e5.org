As someone who is considering getting into writing as a hobby I appreciate the criticism and will seriously consider reworking this metafic to work with the RAW of the 2YE. As for Orm there are actually two Orm's the original and the construct which only got the memories of the original and an incomplete copy his mind leaving him somewhat mentally handicapped. Because of this he somewhat lacks a personality, has problems emoting and has difficulty recognizing his sense of self as evident when someone tries to remember how construct Orm looks like they just have the concept of an average man but not any features.
