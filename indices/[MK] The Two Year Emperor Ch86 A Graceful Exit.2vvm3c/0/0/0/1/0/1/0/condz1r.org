I have to say, it gives me a smile to see a metafic of 2YE -- thanks for doing this. :>

You asked for feedback, so here you go. Let me preface this by saying that this feedback is offered as though this were an actual story that you might post on FFN. If that's what you intended, then the following advice applies. If what you intended was a quick omake just to provide closure without worrying too much, then you can ignore all of this.

1. Spelling and grammar needs work -- do a copyedit pass. The use of italics is odd too; I think you may have gotten some asterisks in the wrong place.
2. 2YE works off of strict RAW (Rules As Written), and Wish does not work this way according to RAW. (See below.)
3. The resolution is rushed -- basically, you didn't earn your finale.
4. The character of Orm is never developed at all; even in his dialogue he feels a bit flat, with no particular distinguishing characteristics to hang a mental picture on. A few ways you could improve on this would be to provide some physical description (brown hair, tall, etc), talk about his physical expressions/body language (slumped, shrugged, frowned, sighed, looked away, etc), or give him some sort of verbal trait -- sarcasm, humor, a particular choice of phrasing, etc.

Re: Wishes. There's [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/wish.htm][a defined list of things that Wish can do]], and 'make it so that I can write my Wishes' and 'move my body somewhere after I die sometime in the future' are not among them. Wish /does/ have a clause saying "You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)" which is probably what you are basing these wishes off of. Since this is your story you can certainly do that, but I would suggest against it for two reasons: first, the elastic clause on Wish requires DM judgement, which automatically takes you out of RAW and into RAI. It's your story so it's certainly fine to do it that way, but be aware that you are leaving the RAW of 2YE behind. Second, if Wish can do anything then there's no way to have tension in the story and it's not engaging for the reader.

If you go back and rework the above items and post it on FFN I'll be happy to read and review. In the meantime, thanks for doing this.
