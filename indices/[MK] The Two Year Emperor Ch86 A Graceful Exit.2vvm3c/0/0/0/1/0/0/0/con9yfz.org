Thanks for the praise and feedback I apreciate it.

Truth be told the name Orm just came to me and I couldn't really remember where I heard it from it may have come from that character.

As for your second nit Orm like Jake is from a different world where telepathy is normal and like Jake is living a completely normal life. I actually considered having Orm be from another DND world where psions were hated by the majority the same way the DND fans did though never having played psion I was afraid I couldn't do it justice.

Anyway I already finshed posting Jake's escape from the landguard in the comments please tell me what you think if you get the chance to read it.
