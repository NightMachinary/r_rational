So if Jake doesn't have a soul then that must mean he isn't tecnically alive by the DND sense which explains why he cant be ressurected. Though that means he just can't be ressurected by conventional means and since from a scientific view humans are just biological machines one could just make a wish to restore that machine to a living or 'working' condition. You know I just came up with a way for Jake to escape and am going to write about it in the comments please tell me what you think.
