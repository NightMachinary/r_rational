First person point of view from a character who acts like a dumb teenager. Yes, I know there's an in-story explanation for why she acts like that, and also she /is/ a dumb teenager, but it was painful and mentally exhausting to read people drive themselves off a cliff.

At least there's fanfiction to soothe the burn afterwards.

Mental exhaustion applies to the sequel too, btw.
