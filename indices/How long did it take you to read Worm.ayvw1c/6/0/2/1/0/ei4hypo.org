There's also the factor that the major asset that was mentioned was temporarily out of play. Personally, I think it helped that I found the individual scenes themselves absolutely riveting. But I do think that the /sequence/ is a major candidate for "things Wildbow would have rewritten if Worm were a regular novel instead of a web series". It has the sort of feel I get after running an arc in a tabletop campaign, where the players have defeated the salient combat threats, but never really understood what was happening.
