Not everybody can just stop following a series. For utter crap that is Bleach after volume 3 (manga, fantasy), I can do it easily. For a mediocre that is The Game of Throne (HBO TV Series, fantasy), I can only did it last season. It involved a series of disappointment, and OP might be worried he'll hurt.
