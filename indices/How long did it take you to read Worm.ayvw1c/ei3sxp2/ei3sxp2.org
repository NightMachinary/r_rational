I read it the first time in a weekend, but like, the entire weekend. I couldn't put it down. The second time through I took it at a more leisurely pace and knocked it out in about a week.

But don't let anyone else's reading speed influence you. Just start reading it. Read a chapter. If you're still invested, read another chapter. If you're getting bored of reading, take a break. The whole thing is there, you can just read it in your own time.
