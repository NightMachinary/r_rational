  I can't imagine why someone would want to continue reading something that they do not in any way enjoy.

I'm still reading Worth the Candle even though I stopped really enjoying it a while ago, mostly because I've invested lots of time in reading it and feel a sort of "itch" to see where the story goes, but I basically skip whole paragraphs and read only what I consider to be the story-essential bits.
