Outlook recommendation: Don't read something for the sake of 'having consumed it'. Even if you finish and know what others are talking about, if you didn't enjoy it enough to keep reading for its own sake, it probably wasn't put the time you put into it.

​

Try reading a little, and then if you keep wanting to read more (including 'finding out what happens next'), do. Reaching the end of something worthwhile should, ideally, be a little saddening (though also satisfying) rather than a relief.

​

To put it another way, let reading-some-more-of-it be a pastime to savour rather than a challenge to tackle, and if you find reading it isn't enjoyable enough to do that then don't.
