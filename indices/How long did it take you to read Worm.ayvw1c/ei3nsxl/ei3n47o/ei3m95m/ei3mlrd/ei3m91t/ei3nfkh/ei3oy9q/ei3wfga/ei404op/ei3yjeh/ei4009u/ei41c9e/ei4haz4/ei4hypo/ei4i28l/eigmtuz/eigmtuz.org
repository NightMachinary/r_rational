It's been awhile since I read it the second time, but here is what I remember. The first time I read it, it seemed like Coil just had the idiot ball for narrative purposes. On a second re-read, though, it seemed like a legitimate win. Coil has a few weaknesses; he tends to split realities multiple times a day. He's egotistical. He tends to split realities as soon as he feels it is safe, even if it isn't. And in this particular case, he was up against a time crunch so he couldn't just have one timeline where he tried to off Skitter and one he could collapse to if it didn't work out.

As soon as he split a timeline to help kill Skitter more efficiently, it was over for him. Skitter's ability to think creatively and improvise with her power (with, potentially, a little bit of help from QA. I'm going to need to reread Worm again after some of these revelations from Worm about how shards interact) beat out the ability to see the short-term consequences of two different actions so she was able to escape.

And then, of course, Lisa had been playing the long game in a way that his power could not predict. That was the final blow, but the path to getting there was entirely in character and was not just him holding the idiot ball because the plot needed him out of the way.
