I think I did it in about 6 or 7 weeks over the course of several evenings and a couple dedicated reading days on the weekend.

Frankly I think it's best not to try and rush it. Worm has a lot of high pressure situations back to back and not a ton of downtime once it gets going. Ie. There is almost always some emergency. Taking it slow on the reading can be a good way to lower the intensity a bit.

But if you're interested give it a read. It's a great story. If you're unsure then try to set your target at reading the first 8 arcs instead. That about covers enough setup plus parts that show why people love it so much. Arc 8 in particular is a doozy.
