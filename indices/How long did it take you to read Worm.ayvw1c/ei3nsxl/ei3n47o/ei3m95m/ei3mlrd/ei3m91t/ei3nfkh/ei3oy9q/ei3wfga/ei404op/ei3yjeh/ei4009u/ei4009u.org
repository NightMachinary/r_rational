Spoilers for Worm

Not the guy you're responding to, but I had trouble finishing Worm. For me I just got kind of tired of the constant peril that had Taylor an inch from dying but making it out alive. Obviously that's a pretty common predicament to put book characters in but at a certain point it just felt like too much. But more specifically there were 2 main developments that had me stop reading for a while before coming back.

The first was when they defeated Coil. It was just so unbelievable to me that the writer would have Taylor defeat this villain with the same reactionary, by-the-skin-of-her-teeth style as she beat every villain. With Coil's power and information, if he's making the first move there should be absolutely zero chance he fails. He could ask his precog for the stats on any assassination method he wants to try and he can take as many attempts as he wants to get it right. This really should have been an opportunity for Taylor to outsmart him and his power in some way, but instead Coil has to be given the idiot ball for a couple of chapters so that he can try and fail to kill her.

The second time I stopped reading was the big time skip. The way it just glossed over the Endbringers as a threat (2 more are introduced as basically an afterthought) and Taylor's efforts to reimagine her image as a hero was just very jarring. Obviously the books would have been even longer if the story had taken its time with that 2 year gap but it's just really poor pacing in my opinion. Maybe Taylor should have spent less time as a villain so we could see a bit more of that story, and maybe they shouldn't have introduced 2 new Endbringers who have essentially no impact on the plot beyond maybe being a misdirection to make you think the world is going to end differently than it does.

And at the end of the day I still don't know what's up with the Endbringers. The story suggests that Eidolon is responsible, but how exactly? And if his power is waning how does he make 2 more? And if he's responsible then why does the Simurgh censor information about the true nature of the Passengers to keep it from getting to Dragon in one of the Interludes? I think for how significant the Endbringers were to a lot of the story these kinds of questions should have been addressed with some satisfactory answers.

Also, I haven't really been able to get into the sequel either, I just don't much care about any of the characters and nothing very interesting is happening with the plot.
