The thing is, it doesn't feel that long. When you're reading it, you're not "like gosh i still have so much left", its like "all this awesome stuff has gone down and I still have 2/3 of the book left? great."

I could have finished in about a month reading on the bus and during weekends instead of playing videogames. However I accidentally spoiled a major piece of the ending reading the worm wiki and have been stuck on the last 5% for about a year just prioritizing other books since i already know the final resolution. Even if you forget who a character is don't go to the wiki if possible.
