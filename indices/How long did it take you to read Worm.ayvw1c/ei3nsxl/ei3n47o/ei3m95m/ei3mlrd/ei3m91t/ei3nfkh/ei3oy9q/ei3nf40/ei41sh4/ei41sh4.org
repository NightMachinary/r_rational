If you are worried about the length, I'd just like to say: Don't be.

Why?

Because thanks to a consistent sense of progress in the story, nearly every single moment is very enjoyable.

So if you view it as a collection of books, just sit down with the first one and see if you want to keep reading.

In my own experience it was one of those really exciting books that made me downright crave more after every chapter.

Every page made me want to read the nect to see how things go and at the end I really wished there had been more (and then it turned out that the fan fiction scene is amazing).
