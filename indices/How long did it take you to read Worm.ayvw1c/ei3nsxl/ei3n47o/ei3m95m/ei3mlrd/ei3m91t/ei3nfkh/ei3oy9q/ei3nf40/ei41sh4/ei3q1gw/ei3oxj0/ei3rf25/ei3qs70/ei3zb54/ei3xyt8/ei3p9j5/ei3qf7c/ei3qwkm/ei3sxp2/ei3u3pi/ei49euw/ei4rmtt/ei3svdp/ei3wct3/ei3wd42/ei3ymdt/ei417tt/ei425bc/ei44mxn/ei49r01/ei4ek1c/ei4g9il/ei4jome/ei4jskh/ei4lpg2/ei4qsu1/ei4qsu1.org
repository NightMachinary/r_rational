I no longer have the information saved for how long it took me to read Worm, but I'll extrapolate off of Ward since it seems reasonable that my reading would have been roughly similar for the two.

With Ward it took me 41.89 hours to read up until the end of Arc 11, which was 1,075,020 words. Worm has 1,778,057 words, so just extrapolating the known information into this would put it at 69.29 hours. According to Moon+ Reader I read at an average speed of 329 words per minute, so adjust those numbers by your own reading speed to get an approximation for how long it'll take you.

This is inexact, but I decided to post it because it always irks me when people give answers like "one month" to your kind of question, because there are so many variables that go into how much reading can be done in "one month" that it ends up being a useless answer to me.
