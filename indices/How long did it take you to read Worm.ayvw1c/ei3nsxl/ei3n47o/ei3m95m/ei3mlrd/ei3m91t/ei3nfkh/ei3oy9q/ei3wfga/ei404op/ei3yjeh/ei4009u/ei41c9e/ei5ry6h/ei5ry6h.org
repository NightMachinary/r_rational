It's clear in the story that Eidolon's shard was one of the most important to the function of the entities. If you think of him like a codex, basically able to rifle through every available power, and when you consider that the primary drive behind the distribution of powers is conflict, it would make sense that he was the conduit through which the so-and-so's were born, in order to serve the ultimate purpose of the entities, which is what every cape was really doing.

Of course, if you really want to get into it, there's always the possibility that he /wasn't/ creating them, and that Scion just knew that /telling/ him that he was would confirm Eidolon's incorrect suspicions. After all, there's no rule saying that Path to Victory requires it's user to tell the truth. A perfectly timed lie would be just as devastating as the truth.
