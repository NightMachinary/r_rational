Ward hasn't updated from the superheroes being real and the end of the world.

Worm was interesting in how the ridiculous "cops and robbers" was purposefully maintained.

The villains were great, the world was deep, the characters all felt lived in.

Taylor's actions all flow logically and we get to see how she uses her brains and a weak power to win.

Ward doesn't have the same feeling.

The economy doesn't make sense. The world ended but apparently there are enough surviving fashion designers to give everyone crazy costumes. Wildbow will describe a detailed silk lattice with armour and greaves as a costume and then later describe starving refugees.

We see all the great cosplayers on Reddit and how much time, effort, and money that takes.

Now imagine all of the great cosplayers on Reddit were doing that in the middle of modern Syria.

It doesn't make sense.

The story is about the parahumans not keeping to the cops and robbers from worm.

They start engaging in patented wildbow nightmare fuel which is great... But no one is questioning why these people in a New Orleans two years after Katrina are still wearing costumes and making up cool nicknames that explain their own powers to possible antagonists.

The old parahuman order should be breaking down by having more and more parahumans not bother to wear capes and make up names.

But no.... It doesn't and the story doesn't explain why these people who are worried about surviving through the winter are still concerned about having the right team name.

Also, the current arc has our protagonist, who can lift cars and fly, repeatedly fail to use any effective methods to combat her antagonists. In worm, we got to see Taylor use her power in novel and effective ways and were impressed.

In Ward, our protagonist repeatedly fails to do anything to her antagonists.

She wants to be non lethal when she's throwing concrete blocks, they're throwing molten glass, and others are using 12 foot telescoping razor blades.

Wildbow is writing fight after fight where we are essentially, as readers, told to watch 20 people have a non lethal gunfight. (The antagonists also use guns). Yet, our protagonist, when fighting people who have guns refuses to match their lethal intent.

In the last arc, a flying parahuman was throwing molten glass at an incapacitated teammate from the air.

Our hero caught her, put her gently on a hill, and told her not to do it again.

Because the villains are just lovable little scamps.

Wildbow's amazing body horror is there in what the villains do, but our protagonist doesn't respond reasonably or effectively to it.

It destroys the suspension of disbelief.

In Worm, you would wonder how Taylor and the undersiders could possibly win and Wildbow would surprise us with sometimes brilliant.

In Ward, you see exactly how our protagonist and her team could win and Wildbow surprises us by having them do something dumb.

I hope it gets better, but it's been hard.
