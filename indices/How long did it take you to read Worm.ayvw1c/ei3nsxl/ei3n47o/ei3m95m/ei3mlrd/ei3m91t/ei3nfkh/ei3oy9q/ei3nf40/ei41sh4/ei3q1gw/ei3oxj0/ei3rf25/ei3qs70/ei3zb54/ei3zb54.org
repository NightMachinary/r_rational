Depends on where you put starting it and finishing it, I read up to arc 27 in my first read, then kind of dropped it, I picked it up again about 4 weeks ago and smashed through it in 2-ish weeks, and then immediately moved on to Ward, which I actually like /more than Worm/.

The worm audiobook project was a life saver in this, as it meant I didn't have to listen to the Google text to speech voice for the whole thing, though I used it for the arcs where I wasn't fond of the voice actor or couldn't understand them. I also was simultaneously listening to the We've got Worm podcast, which is basically a 2-4 hour analysis body each arc, depending on length, so that definitely slowed my reading.

After downloading the whole audiobook I can vouch for the fact that it is 180~ hours long, so if you read as fast as a voice actor that is a number, though they usually read rather slow for clarity.
