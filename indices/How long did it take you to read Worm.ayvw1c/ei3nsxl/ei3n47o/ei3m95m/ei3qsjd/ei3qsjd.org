Hmm. I learned a new verb today.

Maybe that's my problem, why I haven't been reading as much as I know I should. I've historically been very unlikely to begin reading a new book unless I'm in a position to "no-life" it. Maybe I should relax on that a bit, and take whatever one-hour or two-hour chunks of time without aural obstruction that I can find.
