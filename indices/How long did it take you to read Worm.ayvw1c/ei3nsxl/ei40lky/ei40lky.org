  If you've ever read a really engrossing book, something you couldn't put down, something with a really engaging climax that you just had to read right-the-hell-now - then imagine that feeling persisting for the entire length of a normal novel. That is what is crazy about Worm.

This is exactly how it felt. I started off slow, just a chapter here and there, but by the end all I did was get home and go read worm until I fell asleep. Same thing happened with twig.
