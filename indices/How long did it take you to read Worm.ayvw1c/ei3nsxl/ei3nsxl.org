I was in sophomore year of college when I read the whole thing, I read it for a good two hours every night before bed and almost every spare moment during the day. Once winter break came, I was reading a lot more. I think all said and done it was a month or so? I read fairly quickly, but it's looooonnnggg.

The real thing about Worm that I feel no one warns you about is that you're (probably) reading it on a computer, so you aren't holding a huge physical object that lets you feel how far you have left to go. What that means is that you'll think 'Oh wow I'm so close, let me just try to finish it tonight so I can be done.' But you're actually still half a million words from the end. If you've ever read a really engrossing book, something you couldn't put down, something with a really engaging climax that you just had to read right-the-hell-now - then imagine that feeling persisting for the entire length of a normal novel. That is what is crazy about Worm.

It's really good though, I highly recommend it. Just be prepared for it to eat your free time for the next while.
