I must be going on 3/4 of a year, at least. It's become a part of my life.

I just took a break during the Echidna battle's interlude chapter (Blasto) to wrap up Crystal Society, which I was reading simultaneously. (There's a Vista and a Myrddin / Myrodyn in each. Confused me each time I ran across them.)

I'm also an avid player of Disney Heroes: Battle Mode, where various Disney movie characters battle a horde of infected creeps / clones in a city surrounded by water, so there's another bit of synchronicity in my life. I imagine Skitter with the visuals of The Thief from the game. I ended up being the Noelle of my guild on server 3, directing us to a surprising level of victory in PVP play... and a surprise battle against the top guild. It felt like going up against the Slaughterhouse Nine; we were wiped out almost to a man.
