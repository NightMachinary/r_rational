I have no concrete information since I partially read it as it came out, but it took me two weeks to get up to date (while at the same time attending university), to get to shortly before the first timeskip (I think).

A good estimate would be 30 min per chapter , judging by Pocket's duration estimation for the last couple arcs, but there are a few outliers with 90 min estimated reading time. The earlier arcs have much shorter chapters.

If word counts give you a measure, the chapters were 5000--8000 on the average.

Another comparison: /A Song of Ice and Fire/ / /Game of Thrones/ 1--4 are 1,350,000 words altogether; Kobo estimates 112--123 hours for that.
