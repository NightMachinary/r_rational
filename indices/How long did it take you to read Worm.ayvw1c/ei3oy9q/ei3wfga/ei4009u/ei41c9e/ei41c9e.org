Honestly from a rational standpoint i totally agree on the coil thing, narratively though it felt good though so i overlooked it

The timeskip was pretty bleh, i think everyone agrees on that

The eidolon thing didn't bother me though, I presumed his power just awakened what was already there (we see in the entity interlude eden created the endbringers and was going to awaken weaker versions to challenge the parahumans)
