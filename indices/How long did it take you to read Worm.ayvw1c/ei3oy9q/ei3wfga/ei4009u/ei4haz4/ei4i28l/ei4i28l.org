I get that for the ultimate resolution at the end with their confrontation, but Taylor getting that far alive in the first place speaks to incredible incompetence on Coil's part.

I was hoping that they would concoct a plan to get around his power, but instead we just have him using it flippantly in a confrontation with some very resourceful supervillains (which is especially confusing since we had an interlude dedicated to how he was being even more careful than usual with his power to leave nothing to chance).
