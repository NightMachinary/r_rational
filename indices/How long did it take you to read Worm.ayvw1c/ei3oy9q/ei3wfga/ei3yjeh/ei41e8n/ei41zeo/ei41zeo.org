That's one of the dangers of posting on a fandom specific sub, instead of a generalized sub like [[/r/books][r/books]], [[/r/scifi][r/scifi]], [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]], or [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]]. All the hardcore readers sub there to discuss the work years after it has been completed, while the casual readers move on to other things.
