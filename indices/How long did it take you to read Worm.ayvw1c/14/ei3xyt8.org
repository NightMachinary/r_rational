iirc about a year and some in total -- it was decent, but not /that/ good, and by the end I was reading it more out of a sense of obligation to the story than anything. Tried reading the sequel and dropped it after a dozen chapters

as a point of comparison, I read the first ~35 discworld books in about as many days, which extrapolating from [[https://imgur.com/a/ybHmR][here]] would have a hair under 4.5Mw

(had a lot of free time my first semester of college, taking a relatively small number of credits to ease the transition from HS, and they were all intro classes, so I read 1-2 books each weekday evening... nothing on the weekends though)

for further context, I'd say Wales' content is the most readable on this sub -- I made it through the first ~60 chapters of WtC in about a month, and e.g. The Dark Wizard of Donkerk in an afternoon. Something like HPMoR was more like Worm, rather slog-y by the halfway point
