I do not recommend you read it in 5 days. I woke up, read, ate at cafeteria, and read. It was slack week for first quarter finals.

At some point I just kept reading looking for the end and didn't really internalize what was going on. I only really started to enjoy the worm universe when I found the fanfiction community.

Speed reading didn't give me enough time to be able to look past overarching issues with stuff like pacing.

I'd say read through Leviathan ish and then take it easy from there.
