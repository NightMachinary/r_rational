Superpowers can come from magic, or it can come from technology so advanced it might as well be magic. I don't think the actual source really matters (unless that source ends up being part of the plot like Worm) as long as the application is consistent.

To use Worm again as an example, Taylor didn't just receive powers because she was the main character. Because triggers required immense trauma to occur, characters in worm always had their powers tied up to their histories and personalities, which made it easy to justify actions and world building.

If you don't want to tie powers to direct character details, another good example is Super Minion, another popular superhero story. Super Minion demonstrates how super powers can be intrinsically entwined with world building. Powers are caused by an event called Odd Summer, in which any living organism can become empowered at random. Because of this, humanity has had to retreat to a few megacities, as super animals roam the wild, and are under constant threat from super viruses and super bacteria. Though it doesn't do well at explaining why super villain groups are just allowed to exist, it's a good example of how super powers can go beyond just being a character trait.
