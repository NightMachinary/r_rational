Of course. Beyond that, though, is the source going to turn out to be part of the plot, or will that never be addressed? If it's the former, it may need certain additional aspects in order to be interacted with by characters in ways other than granting powers. If it's the latter, it can be very nearly anything as long as it doesn't change.
