I like James Nicolls old idea:

Super powers can be learned. The techniques were once the province of secret cults, sacred monasteries and so forth, but post enlightenment, and the printing press, all the paths got leaked into the public domain good and hard, and in the modern era, every power anyone ever mastered has its training path laid out in excruciating detail on the internet.

However.. every power you want to learn is a major, major effort. We are talking a "A bachelor degree" in terms of hours put in per power. And how good the version of the power you get is, is also rather like that bachelor degree. Put in superlative effort, and cut no corners, and you can learn to fly so fast that the limit is not killing yourself with wind-chill right through your biking leathers (No required secondary powers. Sorry, those have to be trained separately), half-ass it, and you can fly around at like, 80 kilometres per hour.

Some powers are, of course, straight up a professional qualification. If the local law pays well enough, the cops have between one and three powers, a degree in medicine is half learning some useful technique, ect. But anyone can learn, and some powers are just out right popular. Particularly flight.
