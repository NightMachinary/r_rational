  At least one way to make a fully hard magic system is to set everything in virtual reality. It may be a disatisfying answer, but work on it enough and you could make it interesting. Eg. There's this russian vr novel where under certain circumstances ppl get stuck in the game they're playing. Many people who are close to dying decide they would actually prefer getting stuck in a game where they won't die from old age. MC does the same.

Hmm. I've actually been thinking of extending it the other way. I did a little reading about idealism in philosophy, and I was thinking of some sort of Universal Mind or Super-Mind leaking into the multiverse. Which actually is great in justifying 'weird' dimensions - how else do you justify Jack Kirby-eque dimensions with physics?
