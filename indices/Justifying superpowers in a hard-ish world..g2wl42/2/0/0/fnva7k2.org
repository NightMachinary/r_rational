If we're being honest about it, superhero powers are not rational, period. Anything we construct is not an analysis at all, it's an arbitrary justification for our fantasies. If you want a rational magic system, decide on some modification to physics, do the math to determine what effects this will have, and conclude that the result will not be a world full of superpowers. You could create something like Worm did, but it's honestly not necessary for a satisfying system at all.

I'm sure you've found magic systems that are fun and interesting that don't explain everything. If you want to make your magic /feel/ rational, then don't even bother explaining the troublesome parts of it. People, by and large, HATED when star wars introduced midiclorians as the explanation for the force because

- It brought the problem to attention of viewers
- few people cared about how the force worked, and the explanation using midiclorians did nothing to alleviate their concerns.

They were fine when they said nothing.

Instead, start with something useful that is assumed true, and make everything past that rational. eg. "sometimes people awaken a power, many causes are speculated, but no consensus exists", Then make sure your powers all follow some interesting and unique rules, and it'll feel satisfying.

For example, you could say that it's been this way for the last dozen or so millennia (or perhaps all of time), and show how that shaped the course of history. Put enough effort into building up a world that is integrated with your magic, and less focus will drift to the mysterious cause of magical powers.
