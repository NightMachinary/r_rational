Thinking about it more, there are some ideas that you might like.

At least one way to make a fully hard magic system is to set everything in virtual reality. It may be a disatisfying answer, but work on it enough and you could make it interesting. Eg. There's this russian vr novel where under certain circumstances ppl get stuck in the game they're playing. Many people who are close to dying decide they would actually prefer getting stuck in a game where they won't die from old age. MC does the same.

I had this idea with sounds a bit like yours: there are spirits which grow by collecting xp from their surroundings, and from the corpses of other spirits. Due to their competition, they find an effective strategy is to symbiotically attach to another creature. The spirit can offer its abilities to the creature and when the creature comes across another spirit (or a creature with a spirit) then it can hunt them to feed the symbiotic spirit xp. This is nice because it means that the humans or animals in the setting can be baseline normal, and it's only the spirits that contain all the magical elements. It also answers why humans would have access to magic. Unfortunately though, this just pushes the question of how magic works back another step.

Dungeon Engineer by hoophy does a cool thing to generalise magic usage. Runic inscriptions are used to cast magic, and the mc finds out that animals have 'learnt' how to use magic by evolving to create molecules in the shape of the runes. Which just makes perfect sense in every way. I think it's implied that the runic patterns are baked into the definitions of the world.
