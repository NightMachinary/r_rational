I wouldn't justify them in any depth.

Consider, for comparison, the question of "why is inertial-mass always proportional to gravitational-mass?" as it exists in our world.

What happened was that, decades before we were born, some extremely smart scientists worked on the problem. They pushed the explanation back a few steps ("well, things are made of protons, neutrons and electrons, and those have the following properties...")

Then, after a few generations of science, all the easy stuff was solved. There are some difficult-to-test potential explanations, but work moves slowly. And eventually there's some stable mental model that non-scientists use.

If you lived in the Worm universe, something similar would happen with your understanding of powers.

Some of the easy stuff would be known ("powers come from this brain structure!") and past that, people would know a vague 'guess the teachers password' style explanation for how the brain structure works.

But none of your characters are going to be casually pushing the limits of human knowledge, for much the same reason that they're not solving my question about mass.

So, your onscreen discussion might happen, but it would reach a stopping point once the functional questions are answered
