Jinnetic algorithms got me thinking. If a being such as djinn etc exist, i was thinking how reality would be kept from being altered too much without the hyper literal or jackass genie tropes being forced to be true. Then i came up with the idea that genies aren't malevolent or all indifferent, it's that they need to interpret wishes in ways that least impact reality in some way. What comes to mind for you when you consider this directive that all djinn could be under?

So perhaps instead of a djinn outright denying your wish, if it's simpler and causes less problems (or based on the djinn's morality) the person wishing for a world which is drastically different than our current one would be teleported to a copy universe with the changes they asked for, while the person making the wish is replaced with a copy that was never exposed to the djinn in the first place. Or, if it's a Jackass djinn, they automatically reinterpret it in the way that causes you, the individual the harm, but everyone else is left relatively alone except those affected by the wish.

The second idea is the concept of a 'backup' universal state, similar to how people backup files using the git version control tools.
