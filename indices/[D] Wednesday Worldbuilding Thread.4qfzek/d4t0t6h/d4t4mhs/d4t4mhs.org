I like the relatively friendly djinn that is like "Well, sorry but for /reasons/ I'm just not going to grant that wish, please ask a different one instead" because it prevents a certain kind of gaming. The "anthropic principle: djinn-friendly wishes edition" is actually really sad, but makes people happy. I like it.
