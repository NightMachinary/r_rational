  The humans have previously received a public first contact package, followed by a secret message to various governments detailing characteristics of the alien races that would be unacceptable to the human public.

Who decided what went in the public and what went in the private packages?

In order to decide that, you'd need a pretty good idea of what humans are like; which means that either:

(a) Whoever put that package together studied humans a /lot/ first (and got it all incredibly right) or: (b) /Everything/ was in the "secret" transmission except "aliens exist and are communicating" (which could be publically broadcast by simply having a flying saucer drift over a major city) and the various world governments sent out their own releases of info to the public (redacting those things they thought the public shouldn't know)

Remember, humans are as alien to the aliens as the aliens are to the humans; to reference Three Worlds Collide, the babyeaters are proud of their babyeating and would put that in the public message if they sent one.
