The alien races have each went through some form of technological singularity, so with even limited observation, they have put together a surprisingly accurate overall picture of humanity.

  Everything was in the "secret" transmission except "aliens exist and are communicating"

Just about this... the aliens gave some general indication of each alien race that exists and that they have prime-directive type rules about interfering.

  Remember, humans are as alien to the aliens as the aliens are to the humans; to reference Three Worlds Collide, the babyeaters are proud of their babyeating and would put that in the public message if they sent one.

Because each alien race is so different, they have a pretty good idea of this concept because of their interaction with each other, hence the prime-directive type rules and the limit of the public first contact package. Their secret message is a mix of seemingly perfect understanding of humans, hilarious attempts at expression of the races' cultural aspect into a human context, and disturbing/surreal misunderstanding or differing values/goals (they actually understand well, but some of their values lead to what seem like misunderstandings from the humans' perspectives).
