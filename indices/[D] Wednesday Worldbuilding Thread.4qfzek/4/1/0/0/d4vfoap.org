  The alien races have each went through some form of technological singularity, so with even limited observation, they have put together a surprisingly accurate overall picture of humanity.

Thinking on this - let us assume a race of rocks, that never move, but can sort of hover and telekinetically manipulate the nearby environment. Let us assume that they spend a long, long time invisibly studying humanity. They are /not/ going to have an easy time figuring out what gyms are for.

I guess they /could/ get it eventually, but - to turn to the other side yet again - at least some of the aliens should ideally have some behaviour that's odd enough that the human characters /never/ quite figure out what it's for (there should be a reason, behind the scenes, which an alert and /very/ lucky reader an at least guess at, but it should never be fully explained, even if it can be predicted).

  Their secret message is a mix of seemingly perfect understanding of humans, hilarious attempts at expression of the races' cultural aspect into a human context, and disturbing/surreal misunderstanding or differing values/goals (they actually understand well, but some of their values lead to what seem like misunderstandings from the humans' perspectives).

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
