  let us assume a race of rocks, that never move, but can sort of hover and telekinetically manipulate the nearby environment. Let us assume that they spend a long, long time invisibly studying humanity. They are not going to have an easy time figuring out what gyms are for.

The rock race would have about 7 other alien races working together with them. One of them might have muscles or something analogous to it. The rock race might also have the computational resources to brute force simulate possible biochemistry for earth based life using the spectral analysis to get a general idea of what earth's chemistry is like as a starting point. They then analyze human appearances in different contexts compare it against the context different appearances show up in, use some general speculation about our evolution and reference it against other alien species' evolution (some of which do have genders/sexual differences) and they could figure it out. And that is before they exchange analysis with other races, one or two of which might be more similar to us. I intend on hinting at the reader what kind of analysis was put in just to get a basic background understanding of us.

  - at least some of the aliens should ideally have some behaviour that's odd enough that the human characters never quite figure out what it's for (there should be a reason, behind the scenes, which an alert and very lucky reader an at least guess at, but it should never be fully explained, even if it can be predicted).

I like that, I'll try to balance the explained stuff against the totally out their stuff and have explanations ready if [[/r/rational]] wants to guess at them and happens to get it right...
