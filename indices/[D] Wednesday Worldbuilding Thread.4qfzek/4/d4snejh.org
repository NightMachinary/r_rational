Looking for help with how to deal with a lot of backstory/worldbuilding information without going into infodumps or talking heads. Or if I do need to use exposition techniques like this, doing them well.

The idea was discussed two Wednesday Worldbuilding threads ago [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o7qu0/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d4aawjt][here]]. Right now I have about 5 pages worth of worldbuilding notes that discuss 8 different alien races, that are each about as weird and unique as say the aliens in Three Worlds Collide. They are having a diplomatic/brainstorming discussion with a team of human diplomats and scientists about how to deal with a threat of another alien race. The humans have previously received a public first contact package, followed by a secret message to various governments detailing characteristics of the alien races that would be unacceptable to the human public. Minor quirks, prior relationships, subtle one-level higher than plotting, differing value/goal systems, and differing ways of thinking color the interactions the alien races have with each other and the humans.

So if I communicate too much of what is going on, it falls into the standard problems with pacing that infodumps create. If I communicate too little of what is going on, a lot of the alien's actions and communication is going to be borderline nonsensical to the reader.

I've thought about limiting the perspective to the human team, and just communicating what they now, perhaps flashbacks to the first contact package or briefing and planning meetings the humans had, perhaps having them theorize and communicate during one of the break session, perhaps giving the perspective of one of the more aware humans.

Alternatively, I was thinking about interlude sections to fill out worldbuilding. Perhaps right after a confusing chapter, an interlude from the first contact package that clarifies things or provides hints? Or an interlude from one of the alien's perspective, showing how weird their mind is while simultaneously clarifying something that seemed bizarre or nonsensical as having rational motives and purpose? Or giving interludes of the planning meeting between the alien races themselves were they discussed how much technology to share with the humans.

Overall, I am trying to create tension as the alien races propose a lot of weird to outright horrific solutions to the problem of the alien races that is planning on invading. The human team should feel pressured to come up with a solution or pick a solution before the story reaches its final resolution. Not giving away anymore because spoilers, but this should indicate the feel in the reader I am trying to create.
