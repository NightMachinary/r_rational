For me the way I do world building is starting with a what if scenario towards a worlds governing laws and then think about what the implications of it are.

One of my past times is to develop worlds usually around a concept and then let them evolve through further ideas and input in some cases I have had worlds that merged together taking idea elements from both as well as multiple world scenarios that split off from a common source such as is the case with my three main fantasy concepts I have been working on. In this case each one is quite distinct as their world structures are no longer alike at all. :)

Then I have also tried out seeing what it would take to rationalize a archetype of fantasy that is abundant online and make it work in a realistic framework rather than being pure wish fulfillment and luck

For instance I have been developing a world that is based on the premise of a rational version of the typically irrational subgenere of Re fictions with reincarnating protagonists and "evolving" monsters. It relies on the concept of the reincarnation being a method of reproduction for deities with the presumption that without recollecting energy a deity will eventually fade in according to thermodynamics. If all beings in the world are able to evolve up to dieties but have a finite lifespan then would it not be advantageous to retain memories? Then furthermore if producing progeny is an organism's goal then "cheats" can be explained as the deity donating a small part of themselves in order to produce offspring. As of now it is a WIP but I think it might be doable the only mechanics that have been more or less removed is the status screen/rigid leveling unless the premises assume that the world is developed from a game that has been allowed to self modify its code and operating system via random selection.

This part as well as the general history up to the stories present is quite easy for me as I am always thinking of ideas though many just end up getting lost forever.

Now I only need to write stuff down instead of having them float around in my head...
