I'm interested in deconstructing Ascend to a Higher Plan of Existence, based specifically on the example from the movie Her. What kind of discovery did the superintelligent AIs make that allowed them to leave humanity forever and why did they decide to do so? If this is normal, rational behavior for a superintelligent AI, then what implications does this have for humans?

The only story I've heard of that explores this concept is The Culture, which I haven't read, where the titular civilization could Ascend whenever they want but choose not to because they don't want to leave everyone behind. But what does that say about everyone who already has Ascended? Though, personally, I'd rather find out where the singularity is taking everybody.
