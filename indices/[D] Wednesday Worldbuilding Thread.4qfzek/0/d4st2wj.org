I've started a quest on Sufficient Velocity that includes a bit of worldbuilding as part of both the quest itself and things I've written into the background [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/national-spirit-an-empire-quest.29956/][(link)]].

I'm still working out the kinks in the worldbuilding, but the basic premise is that Magic exists and can be done by many people with the right training. A well-trained wizard can make little light shows, maybe zap someone with a little jolt of electricity, or start fires by looking at logs, and that sort of thing. Real, powerful Magic requires using energy from the ley lines that run beneat the world, and can do things like disperse hurricanes, predict the future, construct or fortify cities, and so on. Things like teleportation or moving between planes don't exist, but sending messages, raining fire and brimstone on your enemies, and other horrible physical forces can be brought to bear by Magic. A better mage is more likely to be able to pull off complex magic, and she can reach greater heights and do more things with a particular setup, but the setup is more important than the mage.

The more diverse ley line Magic you gather under your command, the more powerful the spell. The problem is that there's no way to reroute a ley line far away to bring its energy to your current location. Instead, you have to gather dirt and stone from near that ley line and ship it to your current location, since the magical energy leaks into the soil around the ley line. The actual energy manipulation part of these spells must mostly be done via magical devices. For a relatively unfocused use of Magic, like launching a projectile or setting something on fire from afar, the magical device is small enough to be handheld. For more complex uses, or anything that interacts with the platonic nature of objects (increasing the wall-ness of a wall, for example), the magical devices can be as large as warehouses. Any grand spell, then, requires infrastructure that only a powerful polity would have.

What kind of implications does this have? Well, since wizards are much more common (and wizardry is non-hereditary) than powerful polities, and can't operate without them, it's much more common for wizards to be in service of a nation, than the other way around. No magelords here, unless they are also good at being lords in other ways. Taking over a country just on your personal skills in Magic isn't hereditary. Also, since Magic allows for some industrial and combat uses relatively easily, but doesn't allow for things like mass production of devices everyone can use, it represents a sort of time-limited malthusian trap. How? A nation that spent a few centuries focusing on technological development would eventually develop tools and weapons that would destroy any nation that focused only on Magic, which has limits. No nation actually does this, though, since in the short run Magic is really good. Ideally, you'd want to be able to focus on both, or be so strong that even though you're focusing on technological development, nobody can defeat you.

So, based on this, I decided mages would be a powerful and influential but not all-controlling group in most nations, similar to organized religion in the west during the early feudal era. Mages as an institutional force can't really exist or operate without big organized states, so this works out reasonably "well" for everyone involved. Also, the world is basically trapped in a feudal tech level for the time being, especially since the roman empire expy collapsed a couple hundred years ago.

  Chances are---no, he'd seen it, so it was certain---there would never be a feat like this in the history of the Empire. Magic works her wonders and discloses her secrets at great cost. Supply lines, infrastructure, devices, rare ingredients, ships to carry them and merchants to buy them and ship them to the capital, strange designs and more were all required for Magic to work. The peasants may think a mage can just wave his hands and create fire and wield power, and this is true---to an extent, at least. As centuries of efforts on the part of Zorwan's predecessors have shown, though, anything beyond a small light show requires the constant use of large and complex machinery with parts and ingredients formed out of stone and gathered from the soil of geographically distant locations.

  What's more, the use of this machinery wore it down, necessitating constant repair and replacement of parts. Now, at the apex of its power, with all the civilized world under its command, the Empire could afford great wonders. The stormaton, which could diffuse the great hurricanes of the western sea; the vansealer, which could create walls no onager can crush, and no soldier could easily climb; the surveyscope, which could conduct financial analysis of distant lands with little more effort than surveying one's own garden; all these and more were only possible with the constant application of ingredients, parts, and expertise drawn from all over the Empire. None of this would be possible without the great reach, wealth, and power of the Empire.

  Magic, at least the sort that changes the direction of wars, raises cities, and brings bountiful harvests, is the enterprise of the state. A skilled wizard can use more complex equipment or coax more out of lesser devices; certainly, a skilled wizard is needed to design and oversee the maintenance of magical devices. There is always room for a skilled wizard at court. That much is certain. When people misunderstand Magic is the moment they think the wizard is the crucial component in the recipe. One wizard is much like the next, and the Empire had millions of subjects, many of whom had the spark. No, the important part of Magic use is the infrastructure. The great machines, the massive buildings that are themselves foci for spells, the thousands---no, the tens of thousands of men who work for the state one way or another organizing, cataloging, and administrating the massive projects that bring this all together and maintain it---these systems alone cannot be replaced. Magic is an institution, and an individual wizard is but a cog in the machine.

  Zorwan was a powerful cog, though, and he had the Emperor's ear. He may not have been able to convince the Senate to undertake the changes necessary to avert the coming darkness...

Let me know what you think! Also, if you want to play, we're still [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/national-spirit-an-empire-quest.29956/][taking suggestions]] for realm governments. The character sheet in this campaign is basically the realm, which includes things like institutional parameters for all the powerful groups in the governments and their respective strength, institutional legitimacy, and flexibility/adaptability.
