I would think diffusion would be the easiest interpretation to describe the transfer say if teleportation bates the transported material with the energy from the ley line used then it would make sense for the magic to diffuse with the transferred material thus slightly polluting the ley line used for teleportation as well as the transferred material.

Sort of like how if you moved distilled water to another location location with a cup that formerly contained salt then the remaining salt in the glass would diffuse into the water.
