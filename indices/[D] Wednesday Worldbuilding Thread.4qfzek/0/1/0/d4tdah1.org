Hmm, this is a good idea. Alternatively, using magic to move stuff "infects" the stuff with the ley line of the used magic, so if you used movement magic on magical materials, their type gets diluted or becomes movement type or something. So, you can use movement magic to move movement-magic-related fuel, but not other kinds of fuel. This still allows for a lot of value exporting rocks from near a leyline that has movement properties, but doesn't turn it into a natural center, instead making all the other leylines more valuable since they also have access to movement magic fuel. does this seems like a good solution?
