I am using the United States of America because I live there and it is the most familiar country to me. I also trust that the Americans to be a rational actor if rather self interested, furthering Pax Americana which is essential to world peace.

I do not think nations getting powerful due to trans-dimensional access to resource and get uppity against the current order is good for peace.

I doubt giving everyone the design and ability to build trans-dimensional travel is necessarily a good idea, especially if it is 'easy' to do so. Especially if they travel incautiously, subjugating natives, and doing other things inviting disaster and other unpredictable consequences.

I will not write about aliens rather than humans, because thinking like aliens is already stretching ambitious level.
