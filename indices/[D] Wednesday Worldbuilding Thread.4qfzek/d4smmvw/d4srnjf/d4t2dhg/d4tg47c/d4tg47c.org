Hmm realistically rather than going to the government I would think the best choice would be to develop a patent claim for the discovery and publishing the results in academic journals. with the patent you would hold sole ownership of the rights to the trans-dimensional travel technology and by publishing in academic circles you could greatly speed up the technologies development through the scientific process as more heads are better than one.

This of course assumes that the character has invested some time in effort and developed a device that possesses these abilities.

Simply going to a particular government is a dangerous move as by lacking the public data release this technology could be manipulated by a single nation which may or may not have the best interests/ethical protocols.

As for transdimesional travel you might like one of my science fiction concepts where our world is accessed by another parallel world where the end Cretaceous extinction never happened and life was able to recover from the slump thus eventually leading to a sentient and technologically advanced species of theropods that evolved from a manoraptoran ancestor. The idea revolves around how different the two species would be in regards to basic solutions and viewpoints on what constitutes intelligence as well as ecological impacts on regards to the meeting of life that diverged 65 million years ago.

The real fun part is thinking about how different the events after the divergence could be using the parallel worlds view of quantum mechanics where each possible outcome creates its own branch of the multiverse.

On one hand you have a technologically advanced species that has for the first time found a species that might answer the question of how intelligence evolves their reaction to this find when coupled with their startling discovery of our environmentally fragile world. Some of them decide they want to help us others want to simply study us in order to gain insights into their own evolution and then humans naturally have their own reaction to these visitors...
