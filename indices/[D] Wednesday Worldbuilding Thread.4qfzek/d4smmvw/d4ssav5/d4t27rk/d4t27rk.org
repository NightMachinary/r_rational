/I'm currently working on a short story... I am trying to develop snippets around the interesting parts and cool bits of worldbuilding to get myself started. Not sure if this is a good approach, though, as this is my first story after all./

The easiest way to worldbuild for me is to actually write a story or fit it in some sort of narrative structure.

It's hard for me to sit down and just write dry explanation.
