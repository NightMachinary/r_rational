  Instead, you have to gather dirt and stone from near that ley line and ship it to your current location, since the magical energy leaks into the soil around the ley line. The actual energy manipulation part of these spells must mostly be done via magical devices.

You need to make a rule that magically transported soil leaks all its power before it can be used, otherwise, the first mage to camp on a ley-line good for rapid mass transit could regularly transport material from other ley-line locations and basically get unlimited power. Or you could leave this loophole in, but make it very hard to actually get a setup going, and use the first one to create something like this as an excuse for a magic industrial revolution.
