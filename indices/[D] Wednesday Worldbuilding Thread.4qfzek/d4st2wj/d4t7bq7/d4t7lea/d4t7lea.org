Thanks! That's a lot of what I was going for with this magic system. I wanted a system that would solidify the power of the state and be dependent on the power of the state rather than the reverse. I also like the idea of the lost magic of the ancients to actually be intellectually still understood, just not logistically possible in modern times. Like a manual of "how to learn Python" in the hands of a society that lacks the infrastructure (but not the expertise) to make transistors, or even vacuum tubes.
