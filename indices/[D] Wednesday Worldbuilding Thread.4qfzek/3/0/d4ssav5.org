  Earth, a magitech fantasy, a virgin planet in some other dimension, and a junkland.

  it shouldn't be some alternate version of Earth and so forth.

You could limit yourself to 4 useful worlds. All the near timelines, civilization got wiped out by nuclear warfare. All the far timelines, life never evolved pass single cells so there is nothing useful besides algae. All the near dimensions are just mundane things... endless volumes of water, fire, air, etc. All the far out dimensions are so bizarre the character can barely comprehend what they experienced. The character manages after some very close calls, to find the 4 hospitable worlds that you decide to restrict the story to as the character doesn't want to risk traveling farther.

  it seemed much harder to write without worldbuildings or characters to bootstrap myself on.

I'm currently working on a short story... I am trying to develop snippets around the interesting parts and cool bits of worldbuilding to get myself started. Not sure if this is a good approach, though, as this is my first story after all.
