Perhaps you could delay bringing in the government on the basis that your character thinks he will need definitive proof before bringing it to their attention.

Depending on how easy it would be to contact a government official and demonstrate this trans-dimensional travel, it would make sense for them to want to wait until they had some surefire means of ensuring they'd be taken seriously.

If you wanted to push this angle, you could also mention that there have been other instances of people claiming to travel to other dimensions in the past which all turned out to be hoaxes or delusions. So in order to avoid association with these crazy people, the main character has good reason to explore the new world on their own and find some way to substantiate their claim before bringing it to their government's attention.
