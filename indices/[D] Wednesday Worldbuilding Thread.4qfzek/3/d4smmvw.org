I have an obsession with trans-dimensional travel, and yet my character's first item on the TODO list is to contact his gubernment, because that seemed to be the most rational thing to do if I discover trans-dimensional travel.

I supposed I could strand him in some other realities where the governments may not be amicable to patronage or don't share his values.

Anyway, trans-dimensional is awesome and cool, but I lack a collage of original worlds to travel to, and it shouldn't be some alternate version of Earth and so forth.

Also, I am hoping to actually start and finish an original novel, and it seemed much harder to write without worldbuildings or characters to bootstrap myself on. I supposed I could use OCs I created for my fanfics. I think I am going to limit myself to four worlds:

Earth, a magitech fantasy, a virgin planet in some other dimension, and a junkland.
