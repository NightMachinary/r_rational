  deconstructing Ascend to a Higher Plan of Existence
#+end_quote

Boring deconstruction. By isolating mass/energy into an artificially created pocket universe it is possible to beat entropy at the expense of never being able to communicate/travel to or from this pocket universe. It is metaphorically described as a higher plane of existence for reasons.

Horrific deconstruction. Warhammer 40k warp, it has a lot of mass/energy/computational substrate, although it is completely inhospitable for a lesser mind and possibly for the AI that ascended there.

Cosmics Horror. Dualism is true, and AIs can ascend simply by manipulating/stabilizing their own soul. However, humans only have barely more soul than an animal, so we can't properly ascend because our souls are unstable/inflexible. Because our souls are not stable, upon death, they simply dissipate into the dualistic plane never to be reformed into the original mind.

Each of these have their own implications to play with. Hopefully one of them suits your purpose?

If the process of ascending involves recursively self modifying, you have no idea if the resulting ascended being will share any of your values/goals/personality or even care about the original "you" beyond a past memory of the state it emerged from.
