Unlikely. Their response to Renegades has been harsh, but not panicked and thoughtless. Renegades get the death penalty because they're considered a clear and present danger to the established order, which in turn represents a danger to the masses of people whose safety depends on captured and conditioned Pokemon. When that danger is looming over someone, it would be quite inconsistent to forbid them to defend themselves - even defend with lethal force. After all, the law demands the Renegade's death anyway. And this doesn't seem like the kind of world where such plainly inconsistent laws about using force would go unchallenged.
