My arms are getting tired from hanging off this cliff for so long /s

The mewtwo plot line is turning out to be one of my favorite in this whole story. I was wondering how it'd deal with all those dark pokemon, and I wonder now if it will simply out-speed the fliers or if there will be some light airborne combat. I look forward to finding out! Though I wouldn't be surprised if after this we don't hear much about mewtwo except maybe a scene where Giovanni flips his lid about losing something so valuable. Illegal greatballs for everyone!
