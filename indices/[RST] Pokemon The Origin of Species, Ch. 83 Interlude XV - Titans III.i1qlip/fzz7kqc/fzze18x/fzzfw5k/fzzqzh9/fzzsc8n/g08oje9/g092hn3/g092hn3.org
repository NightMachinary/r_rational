Oh it definitely does. It's gonna be a huge problem for Red and Leaf's deconditioning TM plan, especially if they can actually override only a subset of the deconditioning. They're trying to do the opposite of what a Renegade would, by only leaving "don't attack humans" conditioning in released Pokemon, but obviously if they're able to do so it suggests that someone could use an analogous method to only /remove/ that conditioning.
