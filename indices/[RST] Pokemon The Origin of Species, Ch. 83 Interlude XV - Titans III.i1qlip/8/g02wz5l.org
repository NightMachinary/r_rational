This is my first time commenting on your post, even though I've been reading this fanfic for over a year now. I just wanted to say that [[/u/DaystarEld]], you've made an excellent piece of work! I regularly look forward to the first of every month so I can get more of this story.

I felt that this chapter was a nice conclusion to the 3 part Hoenn saga. After thinking that the Hoenn protagonists would remain silent throughout their appearances, it was nice to see them discuss strategies with the champions. Now that megas are officially a thing in this world, it'll be interesting to see if they have any future storyline related to them.

MG's part of the story was a great thriller section, especially since we already knew about the Renegade killing people inside. Loved the Galar reference with " By Calyrex's bobbly crown,.."

I had a question about who the pink haired girl in MG's story was? I was thinking Yancy from B2W2, since she's an idol who might make songs as well, but I'm not sure.
