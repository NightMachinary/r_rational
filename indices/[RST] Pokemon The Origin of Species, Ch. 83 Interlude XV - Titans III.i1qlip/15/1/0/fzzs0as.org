The more I think about it, the more likely it seems, but that seems like a great deal more violence than what we've seen from him. Also, the skill he displayed strikes me as far above what we've seen from him, though that might be from his training with Sabrina. In addition, although it might be that the experiments they were talking about in the Mewtwo scene weren't other meetwos, (i.e. Porygon and Ditto) I took it as a signal that one of the others "like [Mewtwo]" were either going to show up soon or one played a role in the chapter. The second would be more likely if Mewtwo is killed next chapter. Chekov's gun, and whatnot.
