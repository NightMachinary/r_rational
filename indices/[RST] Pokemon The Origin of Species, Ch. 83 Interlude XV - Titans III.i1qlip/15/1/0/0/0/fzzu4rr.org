Yeah, being in the middle of the city, and having another artificial pokemon in the same lab space both strike me as incredibly dumb, although I didn't catch that until I thought about my conjecture for a little bit. but I still can't really grok Red going full Skitter or HJPEV on us. It strikes me as a little bit extreme for him. I'm also thinking about Cerulean cave. Is Mewtwo going to fly there? Will he make it? Maybe one of his less-controlled siblings already escaped.
