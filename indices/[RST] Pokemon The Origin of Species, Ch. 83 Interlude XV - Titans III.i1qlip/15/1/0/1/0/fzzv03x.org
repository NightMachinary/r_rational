It's been a while since I've watched pokemon media, but I was under the impression that there was a movie with two Mewtwos with different mega evolutions. Guess I was wrong.

I think if Red did it, which he probably did, then he won't be telling people about it, at least not without some reluctance. I'm not sure that he'll admit it to Leaf.

Really hope you're right about Mewtwo. My prediction is that /if/ Mewtwo dies, then there is or will be another another one; someone needs to be at the end of Cerulean Cave.
