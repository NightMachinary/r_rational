Not sure if I should be giving you metta knowlage which may feel like spoilers, (so stop here if you don't want it) but in cannon there is only one Mewtwo, I strongly doubt we will have a second functional mewtwo in this story when it doesn't fit narratively (mega is the same pokemon). Also think almost definitely it is all red, he already proved that saki can work (and easily) and induced it in his charmander who was much more deadly than normal. The renegade would 1. Not expect it and 2. could have been attacked mentally by red at the same time. I was kinda expecting red to burst out from behind the renegade though, your right that the vulpix itself felt a little too little, but now that we know there wasn't anyone else think its def only him.\\
I recond mewtwo def survives the suit, he has had so much time off-screen with literally 3x his brain power working on these problems, I would think that he would have thought of pretty much every contingency.
