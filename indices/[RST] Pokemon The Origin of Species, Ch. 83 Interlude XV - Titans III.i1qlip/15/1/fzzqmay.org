I put 95% odds that its Red - after all, MG and Red do know each other, and it was "familiar" to her. She just had no idea that Red was in the casino! I think the money right now would be on Red /sakki/-ing the vulpix to go for the kill while the lights turned on for a distraction, though its far from certain right now for sure (hopefully we do get a textual conversation where MG asks "wtf happened" and Red-or-whoever explains).
