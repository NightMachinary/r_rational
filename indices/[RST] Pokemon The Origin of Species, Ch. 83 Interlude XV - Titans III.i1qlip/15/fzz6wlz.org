Prereading prediction: another cliffhanger.

Thoughts after reading: Well, /Fuck./ So I'm thinking there's another Mewtwo under the Casino, maybe one of the Megas? It's probably the thing that temporarily deprogramed the vulpix and killed the Rocket Grunt that, or Red was naughty. I need to reread that section, because I can't figure out what captured the Grunt's pokemon. The Mewtwo section went about as we thought it would. Really hoping that he can survive without the suit. Also, I hate being right. Y'gotta resolve the threads at /some/ point, daystar.
