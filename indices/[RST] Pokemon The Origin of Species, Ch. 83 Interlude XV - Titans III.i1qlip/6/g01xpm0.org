Worm Spoiler Meme: Mewtwo let his hand drop to his side.

He turned the sounds around in his head, trying to convince himself of a different configuration, convince himself he had heard wrong.

But he hadn't. It dawned on Mewtwo. He has Victini's power.

How many years did it cost Rayquaza to use it?

Not enough, he was convinced. Rayquaza had defeated him.

Rayquaza's head erupted in flame, and Mewtwo didn't move. Darkrai was fleeing.

Rayquaza fired the lethal blast.

I loved this chapter. A lot of paranoia, but also clearly not enough paranoia. Mewtwo just climbed off the apex of the ladder of paranoia into freedom while Shaw prided himself for standing on the fourth rung. MG somehow doesn't know that Red is psychic yet, I thought the fact that he left to train with Sabrina would have given it away. Steven watches Rayquaza yeet Groudon with Dragon Ascent and decides he's had enough of it, Wallace is the champion now. Rip Sweets, Poliwhirl, Venusaur, and Jigglypuff. Many good boys were lost this day.

As cool as it would be to read Mewtwo's escape sequence, I'm really itching to get back in one of the main trio's heads after three consecutive interludes.

Edit: FUCK, is there really no spoiler tag formatting that works on every version of reddit's site? I thought I had figured it out when it worked on old.reddit, but i.reddit has it in plain view.
