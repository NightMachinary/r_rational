Oh I 100% agree there are other Mewtwo-attempts (i think they do mention in another chapter how they have met with limited success, but w/e), I just would be shocked if they are being done in a major metropolitan area! They will almost certainly be on remote islands, distant mountains, etc. I imagine the casino base is for far less apocalyptic operations.
