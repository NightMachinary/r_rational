Actually your right, when I was thinking "cannon" I was thinking solely of the mewtwo introductory scene from the first movie. The imagery of MewTwo's lab, with Giovani sitting in front of his pod with mewtwo covered in his armour is exactly what happened here so I assumed that is what is taken as "cannon" in this story; in which case only 1 mewtwo.
