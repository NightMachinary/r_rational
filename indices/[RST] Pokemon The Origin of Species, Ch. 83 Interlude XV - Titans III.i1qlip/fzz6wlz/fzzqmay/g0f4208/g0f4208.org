I'm not sure that MG and Red know each other. MG should know /of/ Red, but she was never introduced into the story until Blue's first chapter after he and Red split, well after Red showed his /sakki/ technique to Blue's group.

Lizzy probably should've thought of Red when it comes to psychics she knows though. It probably would've clinched it if she saw MG's vulpix lose its conditioning temporarily, but unfortunately she missed that.

It was also very lucky MG and Lizzy were both psychic-sensitive enough to receive impressions from Red. I don't remember off-hand if there were any passages in the story that mentioned how common sensitives were in a population.
