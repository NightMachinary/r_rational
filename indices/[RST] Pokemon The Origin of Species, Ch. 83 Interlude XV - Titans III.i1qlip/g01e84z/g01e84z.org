I, for one, welcome our new Mewtwo overlord.

ETA less shit-posty comment: I'm loving the tense action scenes, and I hope Professor Oak gets to tell Blue how he inspired a plausible plan to capture a legendary. I wonder what Mewtwo's long-term goals are. Maybe he'll spy on normal people for a year like Frankenstein's monster and then devote himself to wrecking Giovanni's life out of spite.
