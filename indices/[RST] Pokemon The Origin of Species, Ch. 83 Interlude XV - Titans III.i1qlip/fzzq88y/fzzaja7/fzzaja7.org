Red simultaneously directing Lizzy and MG with his powers really shows how far he's come. I loved finishing the casino interlude from outside his point of view, and of course we're all anxiously waiting another month to see how the aftermath shakes out.

So exciting to finally see Mewtwo leaving the nest! Sabrina will be so frustrated that the key to his perfect lying was discovered right as this disaster came out of nowhere.

Keeping my fingers crossed for Leaf and Blue; they've shown no signs of life yet and I'm not confident that they'll both survive. Anyone want to work out the posterior odds on their survival after seeing that Red's alive and will probably stay alive through the aftermath?
