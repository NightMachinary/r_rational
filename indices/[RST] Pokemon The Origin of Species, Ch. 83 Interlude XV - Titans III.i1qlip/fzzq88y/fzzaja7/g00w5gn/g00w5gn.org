MG, after they all meet up again: It was insane, my Vulpix suddenly attacked and killed the renegade! Like it lost its conditioning all of a sudden!\\
Red: Haha wow, what a wacky coincidence!\\
Leaf and Blue: o__o

So did our MC just kill a man? Red is amassing a pretty impressive “moral crises” collection. Or more accurately “horrific trauma” collection.

I'm very curious towards where Red was that he couldn't help MG and Lizzy himself. Maybe he just wanted to get some pokemon over there ASAP so he could kill the renegades himself (either to protect the others from having to do it or just to get the danger out of the way)? If so, that is one hell of a cold calculation, and I doubt he's ever gonna confess to anyone (unless a situation I joked about above actually happens). In any case, I am very excited for the next Red perspective chapter, whenever it is.
