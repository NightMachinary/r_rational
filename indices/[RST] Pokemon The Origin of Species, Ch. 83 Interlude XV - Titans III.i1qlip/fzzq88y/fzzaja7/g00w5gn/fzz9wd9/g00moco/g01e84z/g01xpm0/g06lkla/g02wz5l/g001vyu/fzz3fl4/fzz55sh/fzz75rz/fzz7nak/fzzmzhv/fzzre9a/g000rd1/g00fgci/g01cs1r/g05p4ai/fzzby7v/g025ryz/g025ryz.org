Mewtwo uses the word “autopsy” twice --- is this a typo, an intentional use of more colloquial language on your end, a sign of Mewtwo's unfamiliarity with the distinction between [[https://grammarist.com/usage/necropsy-and-autopsy/][an autopsy and a necropsy]], or a hint that Mewtwo considers themself to be human?
