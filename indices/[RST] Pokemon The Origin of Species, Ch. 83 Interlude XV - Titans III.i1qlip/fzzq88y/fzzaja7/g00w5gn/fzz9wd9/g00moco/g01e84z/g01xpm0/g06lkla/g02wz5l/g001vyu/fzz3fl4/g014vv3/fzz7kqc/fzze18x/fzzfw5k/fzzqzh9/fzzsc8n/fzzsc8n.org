Also--for the duration of their existence, Renegades have had to train their Pokemon to kill (or at least in the time of pokeballs, prevent them from getting anti-kill conditioning). There's a sort of built-in premeditation in-universe.

But Sakki subverts that expectation; Red can insta-decondition the Pokemon. I'm sure it thoroughly breaks whatever the standard legal framework is. It's also unclear that this instance would count as intentional murder on Red's part (isn't he just "letting the Pokemon do what comes natural?") although it certainly seems like an intent to harm, which again is justified in this case.

They'll probably get some deniability out of the fact that the Vulpix was so recently caught--"guess those conditioning programs haven't fully done their magic yet!"
