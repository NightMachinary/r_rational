Definitely agree he's not gonna be psyched about it.

Blue was arguably going on less self-defense info when he worried about being branded a renegade. A graveler exploded near him, Leaf said "surely there's a reasonable explanation", and then Yuuta tried to peace out with his Abra and Blue had Maturin fire on the Abra Yuuta was touching relatively preemptively. Yuuta only gave the slash command afterward. Of course, Blue was right, but it was pretty reckless based on a feeling, and if he were wrong and Maturin hit an innocent Yuuta, it'd have been bad. I think Blue was mostly worried he could be wrong.

Red was broadcasting MURDER at MG, so he's presumably been psychically monitoring this guy wandering the building executing defenseless disaster victims. So I'd say this is way more justified self-defense based on the information.
