That's what I think too. Red is in no danger of being branded, there's almost no evidence pointing to him.

But if I understand what “being a renegade” means correctly, he is one? When Blue was defending against Yuuta, he was sweating thinking about how even his actions were too close to being a renegade, and he was 100% on the defense.

But even if not, our guy just killed a man, and it's going to eat at him.
