I don't know how frustrated she'd be. As far as Mewtwo could tell, she did care about it. She was concerned about its ability to lie, yes, and wanted to work out what its real motivations were; that's just sensible. But to someone genuinely concerned about Mewtwo's wellbeing, not just its utility, a mostly non-violent escape is not such a terrible way of finding out what it wanted.

If it had gone on a killing spree, then yes, I expect she'd feel saddened that she didn't solve the problem in time. As it stands, though - what could she have done if she'd learned what it was really thinking? It just would have meant that she became aware that their captive was not actually happy in its gilded cage. Giving her the choice between knowingly oppressing a sapient being, or killing it. I know that canon Sabrina was a sociopath, but this one doesn't seem to be, so I don't think she would have liked that much.
