Everyone in universe: Oh god our dangerous experiment has escaped and is putting the lives of everyone here in severe jeopardy, this is a disaster

Everyone reading: KICK THEIR ASS MEWTWO WOOO YOU GO TULPA-BRO

Otherwise, loved MG's section - presumably Red guiding her and Lizzy for a simultaneous light bomb and also Killing Intent'ing the Vulpix (current theory, ill admit its not clear) is some intense psychic upgrading also a bit of a moral event horizon there (a justified one, but still). I really enjoyed MG's...I will say autistic-coded thought processes as well? Fine if that's not what was intended, that sort of imagery-association patterning is just what resonated with me. Not everyone should have a "unique" approach but side characters just organically being themselves is one of the things this story consistently delivers well.

I do still though stand by my opinion of "some of the Hoenn content should have happened off screen", its a lot detail on characters and a world we don't know and, presumably, won't be very relevant going forward to the main cast. With Blue's team & Red's psychic crew the cast has already expanded a lot. I think the narrative could have benefited from the Hoenn story being told in broader strokes as I find it hard to be asked to care about MG *and* Steven anew in the same update. Time will tell though of course!
