Right, but that's the viewpoint of "the bad guys" in whose eyes M2 is an /experiment/, and I suspect it was put there on purpose to be depersonifying, to make the reader feel how little they think of his personhood/rights.

The "personal pronoun"/"it" distinction is a person/non-person distinction (regarding mind (or similarity to human psychology)), not a human/non-human distinction (regarding biology).

I think that every non-human person with perfect knowledge of English would choose something else than "it."
