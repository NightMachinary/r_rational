  Are children slaves when they are raised by their parents?
#+end_quote

Depending on how they are treated, they absolutely can be. It is reasonable to limit young children's choices to keep them safe from harm and appropriately fed and sheltered, until they are old enough to properly make their own choices. But if parents are raising children as sweat-shop labourers, or soldiers, then that certainly can be slavery.

Note that although Mewtwo had suspected for some time (quite correctly) that he was being molded into a weapon, his actual escape was immediately preceded by a guard making it quite clear and explicit: they had plans for what he would become, and those plans would involve him taking risks. And Mewtwo was not so hopelessly naive as to think that in the event that he failed or refused to live up to their expectations, they would simply write off the loss of their investment and let him wander off.

As I stated above, the only way real trust would be possible would be if Mewtwo were free - barring technical limitations - to walk away without retaliation. Or at least have a fixed point in the future where that would be possible, as humans have an age of adulthood, without placing any requirement on Mewtwo to earn such freedom. Nothing less than that could be enough; it is wrongful imprisonment at best.
