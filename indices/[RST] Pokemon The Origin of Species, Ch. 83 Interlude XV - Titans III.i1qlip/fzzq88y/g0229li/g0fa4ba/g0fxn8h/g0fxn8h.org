Perhaps. I'll admit, much of my knowledge comes from vague interneting; majorly the wikipedia page. That said, the examples on there do discuss things like numbers having colours, dates having relative locations, etc. It sounds like there's alot of overlap in the terms. That said, considering how... fleshed out the associations are, ideasthesia might fit better.
