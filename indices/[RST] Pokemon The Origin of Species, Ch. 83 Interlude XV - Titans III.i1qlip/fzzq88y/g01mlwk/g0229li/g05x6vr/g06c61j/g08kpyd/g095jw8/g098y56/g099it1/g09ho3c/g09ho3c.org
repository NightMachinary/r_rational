Are children slaves when they are raised by their parents?

Mewtwo is intelligent, but is still technically a child. It isnt unreasonable to keep him there while they help him train his abilities. Especially if they explain the reason for it.

And that is assuming he wants to leave the lab if they build trust. He is worried they are developing him as a weapon or something and may never give him freedom.
