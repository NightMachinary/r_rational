  "It" has derogatory connotations in English.

When applied to humans, sure. But having a fully sapient non-human being is new ground. If Mewtwo expresses a preference, I'll use it; until then, applying typical gender pronouns seems premature.

("They" would actually be a reasonable choice, not because it should be used as a gender-neutral singular - it's plural, and using it as a singular is a not-really-correct workaround because of the implications of "it" - but because Mewtwo has something like a group mind. Until Mewtwo makes a statement, though, "it" is the only pronoun I've seen used thus far, so I'm just going to be consistent.)
