When Mewtwo's entire life has been spent with a gun to its head, I assert that it has the right to free itself from that environment. In the end, it even did so without hurting anyone (beyond kicking the Pokemon that pounced on it, nothing that would really injure them).

And it /had/ to be sneaky. The slightest overt indication of a desire to leave and they would have pulled the trigger.

If a human were raised from birth with an explosive collar around their neck, by people ready and willing to detonate it if s/he expressed any desire to be free, and s/he was expected to spend a lifetime in deadly combat at their direction, but then circumstances conspired to give the captive a way out, would you really side with the collar-owners?
