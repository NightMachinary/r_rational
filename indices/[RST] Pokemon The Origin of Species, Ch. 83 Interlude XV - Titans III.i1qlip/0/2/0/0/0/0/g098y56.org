Yes. But if they had trust, Giovanni wouldnt need to keep him prisoner as much. He has so many measures from paranoia of M2 not working to the same goals.

Mewtwo has social interaction. If they arent worried about him flipping out or running they could be more homest and give him some outside time. He woulsmt feel the need to go away given the implications of his existence on the rest of the world.
