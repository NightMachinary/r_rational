Personally, I was on the security team's side. Mewtwo was scary when they became bitter after Giovanni dropped the ball and failed to retain their loyalty, and then became significantly more terrifying when their tulpas decided to make WinEverythingForever.exe on their own. At this point I'd love to see the Mewtwo that isn't this value-shifted perfectly selfish psychopath, since I'm pretty sure Primary!Mewtwo hasn't reassembled yet.
