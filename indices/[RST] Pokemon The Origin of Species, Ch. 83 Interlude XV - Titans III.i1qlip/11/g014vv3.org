Ah, I didn't think that Vulpix was directed by Red. I just figured that the unnamed, untrained Vulpix would just not have been correctly conditioned yet to be a harmless little kitty or know its own strength. Though the cursive (so Red's) line "horrordenialanger .... .... .... .... N" might imply something. I have absolutely no idea what N has to do with this. Only Leaf knows him and Leaf isn't part of this Skype call. N offered to hack/investigate the casino, but what is his name doing in Red or MG's consciousness?
