Way more than halfway decent is the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/57134-jean-le-flambeur][Jean Le Flambeur trilogy]]. It's actually pretty much brilliant, the best hard sci-fi I've read.

Simulations within simulations, warring post-singularity gods, distributed quantum hive minds, von Neumann missiles, Dilemma Prisons for reforming criminals, you name it!
