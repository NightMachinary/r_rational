Only about half my readers came to the conclusion that the end of chapter 7 was literally real. The other half assume it's a put-on job by PI, and that the rest of Cyberspace chugs on along. I was deliberately vague about that but it's surprising how strongly people seem to be attracted to one interpretation or the other.

In any case, since I've promised a sequel (even though its muse remains stubbornly slow) the put-on job is canon according to some guy who wrote the thing.
