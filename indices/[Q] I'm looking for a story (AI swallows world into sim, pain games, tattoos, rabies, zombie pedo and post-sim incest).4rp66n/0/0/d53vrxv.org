  I felt it grew a bit self-indulgent with all the torture porn
#+end_quote

Maybe it's just because I found this story at a period when guro was interesting to me, but its torture porn elements and especially the setting in which they were happening (voluntary pain games, complete recovery from all physical damage, etc) were what made this story special to me.

  I disagreed rather vehemently with its morals

The story improves somewhat if you view its often conservative and moralistic narrative as that of the protagonist herself (though there's still the problem of individuals being able to change the AI's rules simply by talking to it).

  [..] [[http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2010/12/10/metamorphosis-of-prime-intellect/][Caroline was an old soul,]] whose whole worldview was turned upside down by the singularity. She could not find a new purpose for herself in the new reality. Her whole life was about hard work and sacrifices. That's what she got off in her pre-change life. She denied herself simple pleasures and instead poured all of her energy into rising kids, helping out the community and etc. That was the only thing that gave her a sense of accomplishment -- hard work and self-sacrifice were her go-to drug. She was one of these people I wrote about here. No hobbies, no interests, no imagination. She seems like the kind of person who would dread the weekend, and purposefully fill it with with mind numbing household chores, rather than sitting down, enjoying the life and doing something creative with her time.

  But, in the new post singularity world she couldn't even do that. Why do you think she kept her personal space featureless and empty? You could argue that this was because of some sort of rebellion against Prime Intellect's rules but personally I think she just didn't have it in her to design something interesting. She was just dull as a brick.

  What's the only time in the whole novel when Caroline is happy? It is at the end when she is doing back breaking work, and playing village mom passing down moral judgment on her offspring from up high, censoring their access to knowledge for their own good. Caroline is the kind of person I would hate in real life: dull, ignorant, self-important, holier-than thou, busy body. Fuck her, and the high horse she rode in on.

  Caroline and her ilk are just not wired for post-singularity life. They would probably never adapt. Nor should they be forced to.

  But some people can and will adapt. The novel even contains passages that suggest that not all inhabitants of the virch-world were as jarred and disillusioned as Caroline. For example, what about the 20-something kid that challenged her in the first chapter? What about all the other kids that were born after the change and never even knew a world without immortality could even exit? Are they just as bored and sick of their lives as Caroline? I doubt it.
