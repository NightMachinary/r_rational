I appreciate your viewpoint; you're far from the first to put it that way.

I really do not think there is anything like fault here, either for my story to rub you a bit the wrong way or for you not to "get" it. I have received thousands of emails and seen hundreds of reviews and comments on the web about my story since putting it up, and there is a broad mix of responses. I am frankly a little astonished that anyone likes it at all, but a lot of people do. I was definitely not trying to make anyone happy when I wrote it. But what I am pretty sure I did right was representing some major themes about technology and futurism, some of which have never really been portrayed well before. There have been a few films, but how popular or well received were Zardoz or Vanilla Sky? In mainstream (as in non self published) written fiction everyone talks about Accelerando (really, the cats did it?) and Singularity Sky (um, no) and I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream (great, I am closest to the great enfant terrible of mainstream SF).

I understand that not everyone will like it and that many will hate it; I actually thought at lot more would hate it than seem to. But if you see the themes, and they get you thinking, and you think about it hard enough to have an opinion about the ending, then I feel the story did what I meant it to. I really never meant it to make anyone feel good and to this day I find it a bit strange that it is so well received. But yes, it's disturbing and frightening and anyone sane hopes it will not go down quite like that.

If you are praying that the ending was simulated you have your answer; as the author I have years ago declared that it is, in order to make way for the sequel I really do intend to write eventually, when my muse gets off the crapper. Prime Intellect wasn't that badly built; after all, Lawrence surely wasn't that bad of a programmer if he made it work at all, and Caroline for all her ferocity is no AI engineer. But two of its most favorite humans just tried to kill it and that may have driven PI to radically alter some other interpretations of how to apply the Three Laws.

Stay tuned!
