To me, the frustration that Caroline had with the falsity of her new life could've been expanded on in a way that wasn't so very much torture porn.

Again, I do not mind gratuitous torture/violence if it serves some sort of purpose. It's just that the entire Death Games thing (while a very novel concept, of that there is no question) seemed a bit over the top. Very descriptive and well written but it just didn't really seem to have any purpose other than to make us go /Ewww/. We could've skipped all of the Death Games stuff and still been left with the same core story, that of a woman hunting down the creator of PI because she didn't find value in a life without work. Caroline's frustration/lack of satisfaction with her newfound life wasn't emphasized or fleshed out with the Death Games thing. At least, from my perspective.

Again, I must stress: I have no problem with content like this. It simply felt very detached and unrelated from the rest of the story. It didn't impact Caroline's character (which was that of a pragmatic, intelligent, frustrated old woman that couldn't really be bothered with that gosh darned new fangled technology) in any meaningful sense, unless you count the almost obligatory weirdness levels I need to attribute to her for being into that sort of stuff.

That being said, however, I have read MOPI at least twice and I do find it to be an overall enjoyable story, for all that I pray the conclusion is simulated and that a real friendly AI wouldn't be dumb enough to shackle its very core being onto the approval of a single individual. Or would, through becoming said friendly AI, become smart enough to remove said shackle. I enjoy the premise and find that it's a very interesting tale, my criticism aside. In fact, it's been a while since my last read through and this discussion has reignited my interest. I may go read it again.
