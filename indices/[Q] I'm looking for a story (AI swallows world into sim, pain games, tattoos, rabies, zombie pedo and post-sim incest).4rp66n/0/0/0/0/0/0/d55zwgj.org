Yeah, I wrote it. I do try to keep my claws retracted and refrain from breathing fire in polite company... :-)

In all seriousness I was in a very bad mood and going through what most people would call a mid-life crisis when I wrote MOPI in 1994. But what made it possible to tell a post-singularity story was the recognition that conflict can and inevitably will still occur even when all physical want is satisfied. A universe where it's all honey and ice cream might be more fun to imagine, but you can't tell stories about it that are interesting in any meaningful way.
