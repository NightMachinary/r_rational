I read and thought it was an interesting concept as well. And I agree that the torture porn didn't really DO anything for the overarching story, other than provide levels of squick that years of trolling the internet has made me mostly immune to. I'm fine with squick, squick away, but if it's gratuitous, I'd like it to be for a reason. You could cut out all of the torture porn from that story and be left with pretty much the same story.
