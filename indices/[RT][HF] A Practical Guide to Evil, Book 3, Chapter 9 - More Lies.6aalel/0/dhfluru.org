... the casual implication that Ranger just traipses into Skade every new season to pluck the eye out of the Fae equivalent of a Calamity in order to wear it as jewelry is just... whoa. Like her game of inviting the Kingdom of the Dead wasn't badass enough!

I too think that "All if forgiven" will come back to bite Cat, especially if we discover that the Fae have been doing some sketchy stuff Cat and Co. don't know of yet. I also wonder if Masego's implied asexuality is going to completely trip up the jealous Fae lover, or if Masego will somehow get drawn into their story against his will.

  And just like that today's game of /this does not feel like a coincidence in the slightest/ had found a winner.

I'm not sure I understood the meaning behind this... anyone able to explain?
