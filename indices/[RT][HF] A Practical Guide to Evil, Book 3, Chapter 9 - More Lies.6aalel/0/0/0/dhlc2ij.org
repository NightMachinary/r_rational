  Implies that Cat's and her team have been manoeuvred into an existing story? Manoeuvred by the King of Winter (or whatever he's called) who assigned them this courtyard.

I have to think 'Chiaroscuro' is relevant here. It was immediately assumed Heiress was behind this because it seemed Cat got the short end of the stick with major incursions. But we learnt from heiress viewpoint and 'Lies' that Summer has the heavy hitters military wise and Heiress did not set this in motion.

While the Winter/Summer kings likely have their own motivations and could be the source of the plotting there are other potential sources:\\
Black or the Empress could have some long game (supported by the fact that Cat /should/ have an easier time than Heiress)\\
This could be a gambit by First Prince to weaken the empire as she's shown willingness to destroy Callow in pursuit of the goal earlier.\\
Ranger's intentions are a mystery and her agents keep popping up at convenient times. Additionally she has access to the areas/people needed while it has been unclear how other actors would do this.

My current guess is the Fae got wind of what Heiress is planning, through one of the above or on their own and started attacking. Winter is using the cover of 'Summer is at war so we must be' to gain a foothold in the mortal world as always wanted.
