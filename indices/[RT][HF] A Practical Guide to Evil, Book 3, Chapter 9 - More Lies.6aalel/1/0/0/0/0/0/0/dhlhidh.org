Yeah, this may all be a red herring. We haven't seen much of how oaths/promises/curses/lies are handled in the fae world. Given that Adjutant has a Role, I think he can still be a player independent of Cat, assuming fae existence is a stricter version of Roles in general. I think the fae officer running after Cat's assuming the hero mantle, however lightly, speaks to that.
