Sure, that logic could apply, but we know nothing about Fae court rules. If this Fae works like the Dresden-verse Fae, Cat is screwed. If backing interpretation with force of will is more important then she can bull her way through things entertainingly.

I'm leaning towards the latter because that's how Roles seem to work, and the Fae seems to be Roles taken to the nth degree. That would make Cat incredibly powerful as she is able to "walk through walls" so to speak. It would explain why the Fae haven't conquered everything despite their seeming overwhelming power. However it would also call into question how much agency Fae higher up the food chain have.
