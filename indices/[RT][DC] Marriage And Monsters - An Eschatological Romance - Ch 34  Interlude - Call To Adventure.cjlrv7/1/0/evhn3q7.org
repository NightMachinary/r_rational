Confession- the black text for that final line in Matt's interlude is not a shift to Sean's narrative, it's a CSS error. I got overzealous with my find-replace while highlighting the next section. Embarrassing and dangerous in a story where the subtleties of narrative control are important!

But I /am/ super happy that people are starting to pick up on those shifts.
