#+begin_quote
  We've really got to get out of here” he said
#+end_quote

Missing comma.

Oh, Haley is going to come back to such an unpleasant surprise.

#+begin_quote
  “Listen, there's another contingent coming in from France, they apparently made contact with the English last night and they've got something they want you to see, they say it's urgent-”
#+end_quote

Close call.

It seems like Haley has set up some contingencies she doesn't trust herself to know about -- that, or she's already been colonized by an antimemetic SCP or such like.

I'm looking forward to seeing how Haley's romp in the Vault-Tec future goes. Maybe she can bring home a Pip-Boy.

Edit: you fixed that missing comma right off, cheers.

One more (pinging [[/u/FormerlySarsaparilla]] since this is an edit):

#+begin_quote
  “ VOLO INGENIUM
#+end_quote

Space before VOLO.

Edit edit: Misspelled SarsAparilla, whoops
