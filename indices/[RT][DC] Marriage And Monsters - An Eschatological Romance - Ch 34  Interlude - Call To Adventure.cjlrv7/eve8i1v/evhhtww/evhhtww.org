So has Sean taken control (or will take control) of /The Cauldron Stirred/? The fact that we're getting an outside perspective that's still black text makes me think so, not to mention Hermione being a voice of reason in regards to Harry/Snape. Or, more mindbendingly, Sean had control the entire time. Maybe he escapes that world and confronts Harriet before she even has a chance to narrate it, and he actually ends up narrating the entire thing (bonus comedy points if Harriet isn't even into slashfic in the first place). I wouldn't put it past this story to introduce a causal loop like that.

I have no idea what to make of the shift to black text on the last line for the soldiers stuck in Volo Ingenium. If anything, I would've expected the shift as soon as the portal shut down.

Honestly, [[/u/FormerlySarsaparilla]], if your goal was to create the most meta piece of fiction ever conceived, I'd say you're getting there, and I love it.
