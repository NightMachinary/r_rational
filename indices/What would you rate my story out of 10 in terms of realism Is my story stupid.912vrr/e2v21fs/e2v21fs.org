I think that this would make a wonderful piece of fiction. There's a kind of beautiful internal dreamlike logic to the idea that juice is okay, but water isn't, and the idea of a girl trapped in a bubble shielding her from the world. Like, this is a really great piece of magical realism. Check out Wicked, the book - it has some scenes you might draw inspiration from, with the main character (Oz's Wicked Witch of the West) also allergic to water. Depending on how you write it, this could definitely be an excellent rational or rationalist story, with Heidi (and the name is good - any name is okay so long as it does what you want it to) and those around her discovering and working around the rules of the water allergy. Or it could be a character-driven tragedy, or a romance, or whatever you want. Just know what you want your story to do, and do it - and really consider closely what elements of realism you can keep and which you should discard in the service of that.

All that said - no, I can't see any way to make this story "realistic". You could make up some technobabble about how Heidi has an epithelial autoimmune response to any liquid with conductance below a certain level (pure enough water), but at that point you're letting the constraint of realism get in the way of the story you want to tell - a beautiful drama about a girl who can't touch water. Please don't do that, that would be a shame.

(if you want to see an excellent example of hard sci-fi, where you start with a concept like "space vampires" and then make it all absolutely realistic-feeling and /terrifying/ and dramatic, see /Blindsight/. It has /citations/.)
