Make a Shadow Clone Henge of Gaara. Henge'd Clones have the characteristics of what they become, according to information we were given earlier in the story. Use the Gaara-clone's Sand Release abilities to stalemate Gaara, use other clones to overwhelm him. Realize that this power allows for instant ability acquisition. Take over the world by default.
