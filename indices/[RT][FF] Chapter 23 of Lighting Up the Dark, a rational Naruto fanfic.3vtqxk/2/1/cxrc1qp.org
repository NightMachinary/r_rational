The premise is that the player character is a Genin in a group of ninja who have been forced to become missing-nin due to unfortunate circumstances. Their village of origin is after them because they're missing-nin, and everyone else either considers them a threat to be eliminated, a resource to be dominated and exploited, or a tasty source of foreign village secrets to be extracted through capture, interrogation and probably torture. The players must find a way to survive in the rational!Narutoverse, and ultimately elevate their faction to a position of power.
