It's obvious that we'll still be at Stage 2.5 during the next chapter. So, knowing that these chapters are already written, please let that be the last one. Sakura's chapter, this week was Sasuke's, next is Naruto's. Any other interesting characters that need to be shown, let them take the other half of Naruto's chapter. Any OTHER other characters that haven't been introduced, isn't there a month between stages 2 and 3? That's a whole month of time to introduce characters in. Have 5 chapters of that, if need be. Just let the Forest of Death end.
