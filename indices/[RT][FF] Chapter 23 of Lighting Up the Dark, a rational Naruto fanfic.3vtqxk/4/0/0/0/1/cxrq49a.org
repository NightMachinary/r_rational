Err...what? I've been on the board constantly, I just didn't hear anything happening. I'd been expecting to hear another scheduled time for discussions, or something.

[[/u/FuguofAnotherWorld]], [[/u/AugSphere]], [[/u/Velorien]]: I'm fine with FoAW doing background work, although I'd like it to be on a "recommendation" basis instead of on a "requirement" basis. Three authors to coordinate is already a lot -- witness the time it's taking to get started.

On that subject -- what remains to do?
