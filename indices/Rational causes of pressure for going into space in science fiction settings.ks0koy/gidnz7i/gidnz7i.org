1- Earth is devastated by bioweapons and robots run amok. High-tech war leaves our planet literally less inhabitable than Mars. On Mars, the planet isn't /actively trying/ to destroy you.

Which is more pleasant to build a house in, a desert or an active war zone?

Example: /Perilous Waif/, William Brown.

2- There was a political or religious conflict. Your side lost.

Give up your beliefs - or go to space?

3- maybe certain technologies can't be done on our planet. Many novels suppose that FTL travel only works outside the Solar System, or that the laws of physics become more favorable to Cool Tech in a different part of the galaxy.

Stick with an easy life on Earth, and build nothing new - or go the hard road in space, and get the true frontiers of the possible?

Example: /Fire upon the Deep/, Vernor Vinge.
