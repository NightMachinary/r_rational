Some of these were mentioned by other people but I will consolidate:

- Wanderlust
- Scientific curiosity related to things not easily studied through a telescope
- Scientific curiosity related to things that cannot safely be created on earth (e.g. AI
- Desire for resources after the ones on earth become uneconomical
- Escape from persecution
- Desire to move somewhere that you can persecute others (e.g. ethnostate, religious colony)
- Creation of things that cannot be easily produced in gravity (e.g. certain alloys)
- Living space when desirable land on earth becomes too crowded
- Climate change eliminating arable land and water resources
- Desire to dodge a foreseen extinction event
- Frontier spirit ("I want to work with my hands and carve out a living off grid")
- Desire for limitless energy
- Green industry (move all the manufacturing into orbit = essentially no climate impact from manufacturing)
