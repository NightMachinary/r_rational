The biggest reasons for colonization in history have been availability of resources and escaping political/religious oppression. Space offers lots of resources, metals, cheap solar energy, lots of unclaimed space, that aren't easily available on earth. But the biggest reasons have always been when one group of people tries to tell another group of people how they can live their lives, so the second group just up and leaves.

One of my favorite sci fi stories has a plot line where the countries of earth signed a treaty that included a ban on individuals proselytizing. It was actually illegal to talk about your religion unless the other person asked you first. So both muslim and christian groups went off and built their own colonies on different planets so they didn't have to agree to that. Beliefs like that can be so strongly held that they are worth giving up all the creature comforts you talk about.

Lesser reasons would be scientific research and outside pressure. That's likely how it's going to happen for us, we'll build a scientific colony on mars that will slowly grow over the years as it gets cheaper to go back and forth. In sci fi, you could also have a pressure of either an impending natural disaster, or outright invasion. Given enough time, earth would surely expand simply out of a sense of self preservation. In another sci fi story, advanced aliens place a bubble around earth that slows down time at a rate of years per second. Earth reacts by throwing together a colonization mission to mars, which builds an entire society over thousands of years which takes place in minutes on earth.

Lastly, we can turn to the reason we went to the moon, in the words of John F Kennedy,

  We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
