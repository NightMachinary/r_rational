Everyone already said everything else, so I'll just say two more things.

A meteorite too big to destroy clashes, we're all dead. Better spread out to more planets and we have a chance to survive (as a race).

The sun is going red giant in, what, 5 billion years from now? We might need to find a new planet before them, because, you know... I like sunbathing, but if there is such a thing as too much sun bathing, the earth being immersed in the sun, that's definitely it.
