There's actually a new geoengineering tech: olivine mining. There's already a natural mechanism to remove carbon from the atmosphere - the carbonate cycle - but it happens really slowly. So the idea is to mine lots and lots of olivine - a superabundant mineral in Earth's crust - and crush it into sand and spread it on about 2% of the world's beaches, in tropical areas. The sand dissolves into the ocean, and removes carbon, ultimately filtering down to the seafloor where it slowly sinks into the mantle.

Cost : $7/ton CO2 (or carbon... can't remember.)

I have a source for this but I'm in bed and lazy. If you want it though I can link you. Should be pretty searchable though.
