In the short term people will be incentivized to live in space in order to capitalize on space mining and manufacturing. That doesn't necessarily get you a very sizable population of people in space however. Once technology (primarily automation) advances to a certain point however (and this needn't even be close to AGI), suddenly the dynamic changes completely.

Once you can have self replicating machines mining planets ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4aXmnQzJ0o][say Mercury]]) and asteroids to pump out massive numbers of satellites made mostly of a thin foil solar sail, suddenly scarcity becomes almost nonexistent for most essential goods. Moreover individual people can afford to commission their own stellaser to send out massive numbers of Von Neumann probes. Importantly this also flips many of the sorts of scarcity you mention on their head. Suddenly anybody can potentially afford their own O'Neil cylinder with many square miles of space and live like a king in space, but particularly as the population grows the value of land /on Earth/ will skyrocket.\\
VR/Mind Uploading/AGI also create massive incentives to move into space: Since resources are cheaper in space and if you already live in a simulated world the physical location of your body only becomes relevant insofar as it comes to lightspeed communication delays. Hell digital mind could just alter their perception of time (and run speed) so hours of lightspeed lag wasn't bothersome. Digital minds also change the colonization dynamic, because they may just send out lots of Von-Neumann probes prepare systems for their arrival and then just transmit over copies of their mind.

An important takeaway is that people will probably start colonizing other star systems /well/ before post-human civilization is close to fully utilizing this solar systems resources. Since sufficient automation and resource/energy abundance makes such tasks accessible, and many people/groups will have motivations for such colonization with the isolation likely being considered the whole point.
