I associate greenwashing more with corporate style interventions and it lacks the cognitive dissonance for effective measures vs own highly mobile lifestyle, but thanks!

I do also agree that climate interventions should be carefully researched beforehand. Its just no-one does that, its taboo to even finance small scale studies. The last study for algae burying via iron fertilizing was done in the early 2000s.
