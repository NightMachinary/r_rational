  This side of - again - radical changes to human biology and anatomy, we need Earth-like gravity, we need sunlight, we need open space and air, and we need some serious radiation shielding, or our little primate brains start go cuckoo and our bodies break in various ways. So basically it all goes back to that.

Once you reach a certain tech level it's still much cheaper and easier to support even baseline humans in space habitats. We don't know whether even Mars gravity would be enough to support human health (without having to set up an entire spinning mars habitat), whereas spin gravity can be customized for every preference. Planets are nice for radiation shielding, but lots of rock or ice along with an artificial magnetic field will do the job just as well. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcXBuYwm3xk&feature=emb_title][For scale note that it would take about the output of a large nuclear reactor placed at the Lagrange point between Mars and the Sun in order to artificially shield the planet replicating a natural magnetic field.]]\\
Hell if the population keeps rising most people may actually live in low earth orbit rotating habitats, with those remaining on earth being poor and packed into megacities, or so rich they can still afford land on earth. Since space on the planet it /fundamentally limited/, whereas in orbit everybody can have their own O'Neil cylinder with many square miles of unpolluted nature.

PS: You could also shield the Earth with a massive electromagnet just like mentioned for Mars, and people may want to do that so as to shield satellites in higher earth orbits from solar radiation.
