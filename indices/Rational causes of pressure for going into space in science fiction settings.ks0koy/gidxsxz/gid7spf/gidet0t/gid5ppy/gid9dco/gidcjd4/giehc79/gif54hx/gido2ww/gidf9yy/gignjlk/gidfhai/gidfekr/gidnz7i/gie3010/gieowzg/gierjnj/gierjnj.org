1. Population pressure
2. Lack of resources
3. Development of cheaper space travel (fuel or technology)
4. Exploration of options (coughArmageddoncough)
5. The Final Frontier/A man's romance etc
6. Discovery of other habitable planets

I'd say the two top reasons are fear of something going wrong with this planet, and a very human desire to expand and explore.

All the advantages that you mentioned could be lost to meteor strike, alien invasion, nuclear war etc, and the disadvantages can be overcome with technology OR are lesser disadvantages compared to alien invasion or nuclear war.

So yeah, advantages and disadvantages are very much dependent on the situation NOW, which could change at any time, leading to the pressure that you mentioned.
