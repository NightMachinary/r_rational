  I associate greenwashing more with corporate style interventions and it lacks the cognitive dissonance for effective measures vs own highly mobile lifestyle, but thanks!

Yeah, but if you consider how corporations and politics mesh, I'd say you can reasonably argue that silly steps like "let's abolish single use plastic straws" are probably pushed in the same vein. Good optics at a minimum cost (for the state's coffers, at least). Note that we probably /should/ do that at some point, it's just by no means even in the top 10 most important things to do.

  I do also agree that climate interventions should be carefully researched beforehand. Its just no-one does that, its taboo to even finance small scale studies. The last study for algae burying via iron fertilizing was done in the early 2000s.

Eh, I can see the problems though. They're not just scientific and technological ones. Weather knows no bounds. Suppose you perform an experiment here and it ruins the crops of the next nation over, how are you going to explain that? Note that it's still going to happen, very likely (in fact I read something just days ago about China performing geoengineering experiment to increase rain). There's lots of geopolitical risk involved with these actions. And if someone started performing geoengineering on full scale, stuff like reflecting away sunlight to cool down the planet, then you're by definition doing something that affects everyone else too. That could only be done by international collaborations. And right now it seems like things are taking the opposite road, with many countries focusing each just on their own interests. And I suspect that's not unrelated to the climate change problem, among other things. Many seem to gear up for a very short-sighted approach of "fuck them, I got mine", especially countries with latitudes high enough they can reasonably think to still have good agricultural production or even gain something from a +2/+3 increase in global temperatures.
