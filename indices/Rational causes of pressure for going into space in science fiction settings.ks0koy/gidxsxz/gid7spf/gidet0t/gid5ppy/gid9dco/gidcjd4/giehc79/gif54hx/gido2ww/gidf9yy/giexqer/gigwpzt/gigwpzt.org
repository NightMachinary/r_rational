Option 2 is actually a safe good bet unless something halts technological progress. Once you've begun the path towards being K2 by having lots of automated machines pumping out lots of satellites/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statite][statites]] you automatically get access to cheap relativistic propulsion via mirrors and stellasers. However I think you underestimate this scenario because you were thinking about methods of propulsion which are internal to an interstellar ship. So let me propose an alternate scenario from the one you put forth:

Pretty much every part of the colonization process is automated. First small probes are sent on relativistic flyby trajectories to provide reconnaissance (or just use the sun-diving probes described later). Next you either send a Von-Neumann probe with an engine able to slow it down on arrival, or you send a series of potentially hundreds of small relativistic sun-diving probes. These probes would use their massive sails to help slow down, but would also collect solar energy and beam it back to the probe behind it. Thus each probe in the chain would get slowed down until the remaining probes are slowed enough they can establish stable orbits. In either case the probe(s) would begin building up a Dyson swarm in the new system which could then receive digital minds via transmission and use lasers to slow down any ships entering the system. Additionally these [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDR4AHYRmlk][interstellar laser highways]] have a /lot/ of advantages compared to basically anything other than FTL. By having dedicated lanes of travel you can make sure it is clear of any debris without requiring every ship to have a massive amount of hardware for detecting and avoiding/destroying interstellar sand/gravel. Plus a small number of well maintained lanes can also allow for much higher resolution scanning of dust grains and thus higher speeds. So in principle this allows you to cheaply send ships with very little of their own fuel along highways at most of the speed of light.

As for human civilization, if it isn't controlled by some singular superintelligence it's probably going to splinter into more nations than exist now (not less) well before there's time for major interstellar colonization. After all even within the solar system it's likely not feasible to prevent millions of new cultures from breaking away particularly if they are isolated [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Bx7y0syxc][say in the Oort Cloud]]. So through isolation as well as genetic engineering, cybernetics, etc I suspect we will splinter into hundreds (or more) of alien species well before we encounter true aliens
