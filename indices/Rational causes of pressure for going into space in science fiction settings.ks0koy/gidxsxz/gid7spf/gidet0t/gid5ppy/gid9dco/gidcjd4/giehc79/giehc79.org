Everyone else is focusing on getting off of earth, so lets talk about what causes travel once people are /already/ in space.

First of all, travel is cheap cheap cheap. Once you have an industrial base on the moon, you're more than halfway to anywhere. Asteroid belt, oort cloud, the moons of the gas giants, the sun, all of them are relatively easy to get to.

If you've got the tech to make O'Neil cylinders, then most places in the solar system are the same as any other. In fact, through the use of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycler][Cycler Orbits]] pretty much any ship/station can be turned into a trade city as it efficiently transports wealth between the major/minor bodies of the solar system.

Second, there are trillions of dollars worth of value locked in the rest of the solar system. Yes, metals will be vastly devalued /relative to the dollar./ But water is both necessary and cheap, and if there was a bottleneck in water the productivity in the economy would drop massively. In the same way, the /value/ of metals would not change as they have the exact same uses as they did before. The difference is that they'd be freer to be used both in necessary and less necessary ways. While metals would be worth less, the total economy would explode in productivity.

Finally, you need to consider the role of technology. Try to forecast not only the needs of our current society but the future needs and abilities of humanity.
