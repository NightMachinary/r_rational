Have you studied project rho?

Among the featured reasons:

- "build it and they will come" approach, seems to be what Mr Musk is going for, eg if marginal costs drop low enough applications will pop up.

- military applications, SDI satellites

- new space race, might be between private entities (musk/bezos)

- Special space ressource - Helium 3 for fusion being the typical example, though moon ore mining is not feasible due to low yield. For this you'll want gas giant aerostat mining.

- noble metal asteroid mining has always been an evergreen. Might become even more relevant in the coming decades when en-masse electrolysis capability is being built (platinum used as electrode material). Offset by fossil car cat recycling.

- escape from nation states, eg. religious reasons, think Utah in space, or maybe transhumanists that want to escape the worldwide human fetal modification ban.

- asteroid hit and subsequent standing asteroid redirection capability - what happens if Chicago or Denver or Rome are wiped out?

- we have a couple windows the next decades to redirect 100m asteroids into stable close earth orbits, Apophis - subsequent mining makes it a great basis for the rest of the system.

- new drive tech that takes the distance out as a factor. Eg. plasma magnet sail works only sol-outbound but can very cheaply get up to 400km/s, you "only" need a way to brake.

Any way you cut it you need some way to drive cost down A LOT, laser launch/linear accelerator/reusable rocket/launch loop/canada uses north pole to get clean(ish) orion drive or something to even start the process.

EDIT: I forgot one that actually works somewhat well: rich space nerds. There are a lot of high pay jobs that can be done remote, software as the leading example. So a small minority might prefer owning a tunnel in phobos instead of owning a house in silicon valley. Just takes a rather minor extrapolation of launch cost falls and SF house price increases.

EDIT2: one thats /actually/ realistic. Humanity as a whole has decided it'd rather bear the consequences of global heating instead of cutting CO2 emisions drastically. There will be a time in the near future where it'll be cheaper to engineer the climate instead of dealing with the consequences of heating. The current cheapest plan to do that is dumping 100k tons of sulfur into the upper stratosphere, seeding clouds, reducing incoming solar energy but brings acidic rainfalls. That runs to 5e9 $ yearly, pretty cheap - but politically infeasible in current eco-hippy atmosphere. The one plan that can be done unilaterally without running afoul of my very cynically modelled eco-crowd is solar soletta plans.
