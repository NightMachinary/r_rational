One reason why some people are opposed to studying geoengineering may be that they think that having that way out - however risky - could encourage us to simply stop caring about blowing CO2 into the air, thinking that "we can fix it later anyway" (even though we're not sure we can). But then again we're still blowing CO2 into the air. At some point we'll probably start a mad rush to geoengineering in a panic, and somehow fuck it up. Frankly I think we're just over our heads, as a species we've hit a point where problems exceed most of our cognitive abilities both in scale and complexity, and sadly our collective intelligence doesn't seem to be much better at these tasks - if anything, it seems significantly worse than the one of most above average individual humans.
