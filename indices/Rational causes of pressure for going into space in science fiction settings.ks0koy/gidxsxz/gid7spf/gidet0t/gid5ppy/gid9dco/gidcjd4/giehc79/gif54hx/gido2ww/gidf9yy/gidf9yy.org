One of the main drivers for relocation in the past has been competition. If food, housing, healthcare, and opportunities rise beyond the cost of moving into space, then people will move into space. That could be because of war, famine, massive overpopulation, class stratification, you name it. People will pack up looking for greener pastures, even if those pastures end up being in space.
