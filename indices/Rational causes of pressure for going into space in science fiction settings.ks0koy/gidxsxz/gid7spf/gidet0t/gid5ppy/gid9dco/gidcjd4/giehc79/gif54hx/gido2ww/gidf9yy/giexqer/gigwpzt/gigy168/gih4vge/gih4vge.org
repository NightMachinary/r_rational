People with life extension tech and digital minds will help in that regard, since we'll have plenty of immortals /some/ of whom will think long term (maybe even to the heat death of the universe). To colonize the galaxy and local group you don't necessarily need to have any ships going on century long voyages. A K2 civilization could expand entirely through shorter interstellar voyages and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxwCIeWaU3M][through moving entire planets or stars]]. Plus one can always send out lots of Von-Neumann probes to rapidly expand and build Dyson swarms (and interstellar laser highways) around every star in your local group way faster than you could colonize directly (unless you're a digital civilization which can have insane population growth if people are running very fast).

PS: When it comes to time and energy requirements the key advantage you have once you have space infrastructure and automation modestly better than our own is self replication. If you have machines producing satellites/statites [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4aXmnQzJ0o][on Mercury]] and they can self replicate then you can potentially take advantage of massive exponential growth as each statite/satellite produced provides energy to more rapidly build machines.
