The question is if space can ever get greener. I see three options:

1) FTL travel is impossible, as we suspect now, and there are no revolutionary propulsion systems to be discovered. It may never get greener. Generation ships might be possible, however really expensive, and sending them into the unknown without any idea of whether there are inhabitable planets on the other end would be suicidal. Interstellar space travel might never be a thing unless first we manage to significantly extend human life or reduce the requirements for survival (e.g. cryostasis, sending just brains in vats instead of whole bodies, sending brain uploads, etc.).

2) FTL travel is impossible but there are propulsion systems that can allow you to reach relativistic speeds quite cheaply. In this scenario, people can leave and go visit nearby stars within their lifetimes, as long as they're ok with never returning to the Earth they left, as decades or centuries will have passed back home. Still no possibility of a unified human civilisation / empire / federation / whatever, but someone would definitely bite the bullet and give it a try. Some would die, some would thrive. Sparse human colonies form, each ending up diverging along its own culture and customs.

3) FTL travel is possible, or even better, wormholes and such can be created and exploited usefully. Then sky's the limit - actually, no, not even that. In this scenario we go full space opera and likely start to spread all around the galaxy like crazy, wherever there's a suitable planet.

These are in order from most probable to most improbable. I don't think anything we currently know we don't know in physics suggests room for either 2 or 3, so it would have to be something we don't even know we don't know yet. Hard to fathom what would it be.
