I'd distinguish between travel in the solar system, which is at least physically practical and could conceivably become economical, and interstellar travel, which would (barring a revolution in physics) require decades of transit time and years even to send a message. For the latter, you really would need some motivation that amounts to a desire to be permanently separated from the rest of humanity, plus a lot of cash or equivalent resources. For the former, eh, there's fudging room in there IMO.
