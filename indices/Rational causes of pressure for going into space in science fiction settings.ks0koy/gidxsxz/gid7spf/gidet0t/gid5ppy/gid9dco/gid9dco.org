As a species, humanity should feel a need to spread as far and wide as possible in order to delay our extinction. Some day, disease or an asteroid or our own stupidity or, failing the above, our own sun dying will wipe out all life on Earth. If humanity hasn't spread to other worlds by then... Then that's it. We're done. We know it's going to happen eventually. Now, that argument might not be much help to the poor individuals selected to go, but someone has to do it.
