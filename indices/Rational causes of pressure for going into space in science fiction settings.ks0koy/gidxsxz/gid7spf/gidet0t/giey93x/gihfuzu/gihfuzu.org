  In the vast majority of recurring-space-travel stories, the cost is reduced by orders of magnitude. People often buy tickets from one planet to another, or even between star systems, for the cost of a few days or months of labor, what might be ones or tens of dollars per pound in today's money.

Just to add to this point, it looks like OP's figures are out of date and probably using the Space Shuttle as the launch vehicle ($12,000/lb.). However, prices have been steadily decreasing, and as of 2020, the Falcon Heavy can put a pound into low Earth orbit for about $430. SpaceX's Starship project is planned to be able to put a pound into orbit for under $10, and supposed to be ready for manned test flights by 2023. I'm not certain how feasible that goal is, but the fact they've even set that as a planned goal makes me think that getting below $100/pound within ten years is probably very feasible.
