  No, it wouldn't. If the Earth's climate shifts even 5% towards Venus' climate, Mars would probably start to compare favorably. And that's just considering our solar system; in any story with interstellar travel you'll eventually find a planet or gas giant's moon with a climate and atmosphere more hospitable than Earth.

The problem with that reasoning is, if you had enough energy, knowledge and resources to ship the entirety of humanity to Mars and terraform it or make it liveable, you'd have hundreds of times more energy, knowledge and resources that are needed to geoengineer Earth back into whatever the fuck you want it to be. I agree with OP's view if you apply it to full migration of the entire species. That sort of plot is usually nonsense. See Interstellar, where somehow they decide moving to another planet is the best solution to some kind of /crop disease/ - never mind that it would be tremendously easy to just carry the disease over in whatever seeds, seedlings, soil, or even air they bring over from Earth to initiate agriculture on the new planet.

The thing is more, when it comes to /regular/ space migration, there might be a ton of reasons for people to do that. Maybe a bunch of Mormons want to found Space Utah. But that would still leave the bulk of humanity on Earth.
