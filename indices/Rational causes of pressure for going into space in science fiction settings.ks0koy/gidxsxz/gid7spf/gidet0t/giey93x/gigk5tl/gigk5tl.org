You seem to be assuming that people only pursue solutions that work for everyone. Most stories present the scenario that a small minority of people are going to Mars, in part to escape the crowding and people of Earth.

It's much more viable to get .1% of us living on Mars than 100%, and that's enough reason to "go into space", regardless of how many people they leave behind.
