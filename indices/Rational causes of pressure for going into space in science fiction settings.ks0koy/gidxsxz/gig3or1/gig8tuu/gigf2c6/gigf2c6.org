In fiction you can tailor your whole universe to suit whatever story you want to tell. The sheer number of departures from reality to tell one of mass human interstellar migration makes a rational justification one of narrative and not science.

Certainly everywhere within reach in reality, and everywhere close enough to actually look at in enough detail to tell you in how many seconds an exposed human would messily perish on its surface, would be worse than surviving on Earth. We have a ready supply of oxygen here, even if we have to filter before breathing it. The atmospheric pressure means that a leak won't evacuate your section's entire supply or swiftly flood you with pressurised toxic gas. And while the temperature can rise or fall to the point of wrecking our biosphere and rendering certain portions of the surface unviable without a ready and reliable source of energy, it will never be truly uninhabitable without direct interference from the sun. Every habitat we've designed for surviving on other worlds would be much more effective put to use on a ruined Earth.

A planet that is already suitable for human life in terms of temperature, gravity, atmosphere (diurnal cycle is a crapshoot, expect worsening jetlag forever) will have life already on it (as indicated by all the free oxygen). This presents a major ethical problem (what right do we have to disrupt this world with alien organisms) as well as a host of biological hazards we have no way of preparing for, and in most cases no way of treating. Infection, parasitism, predation, major allergic reactions, and everything in between. We'd likely still hermetically sealed environments both for our safety and for the native biome. Again, it's not fundamentally distinct from living on a ruined Earth, although the previously described planetary habitats might not be rated against wildlife, which is unlikely to be a problem in most apocalyptic Earth scenarios. We can do it once we arrive, but other than the pleasure and potential benefits of studying an alien ecosystem we don't actually gain anything in terms of survival and quality of life compared to remaining on the scorched Earth.
