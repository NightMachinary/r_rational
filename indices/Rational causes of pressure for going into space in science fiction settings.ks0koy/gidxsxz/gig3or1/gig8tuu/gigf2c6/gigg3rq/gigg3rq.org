I'm not really sure what the point of this is. Basically you're saying that the elements that make science fiction work should be non-fictional?

I mean sure, there's a limit to how outrageous the setting should be, and should be grounded in reality. But to say that literally no planet should support human life, even if only for ethical reasons, because that's rational (when it really isn't) seems like you're going in that direction as well.
