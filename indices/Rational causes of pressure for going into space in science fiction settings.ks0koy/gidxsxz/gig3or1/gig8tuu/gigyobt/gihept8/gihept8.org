This actually perfectly encapsulates why I don't think people will want to colonize other planets except as a vanity project. Since it's easier to just artificially create an earth-like environment in a rotating space habitat, rather than trying to reshape an entire existing planet or being forced to live in a sealed habitat anyway while also having to contend with a massive atmosphere and gravity well making travel difficult.\\
Plus asteroids and airless worlds are much better suited for automated mining machines than the complex and comparatively mineral poor environment of an earth-like planet.
