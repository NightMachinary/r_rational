You've created scenarios where everything on Earth is basically perfect so there's no reason to leave. Most times, people leave because things aren't going well them. And your listed reasons to stay they can be easily flipped to much more realistic reasons to leave.

| Reasons to stay                                                                                                 | Reason to leave                                                                                                                                                                     |

| It's easier to stay in contact with friends and relatives.                                                      | Overpopulation, overcrowding. Or maybe you're persecuted (race, religion, politics, etc.) and surrounded by enemies.                                                                |
| You get the latest and greatest (medicine, technology, goods, etc).                                             | Scarcity of resources, either because they've been used up or you can't afford them                                                                                                 |
| You have access to the most options, the most stores, the widest variety of products on offer.                  | Wealth hoarding, people can't afford products/services                                                                                                                              |
| The air is immediately available for breathing, and water is widely available.                                  | Environmental disasters, contamination/degradation. Polluted air/water. Depletion of aquifers.                                                                                      |
| Valuable mineral resources are right beneath your feet, and don't require enormous airtight operations to mine. | Mineral resources are depleted, but abundant in space. Or there are too many regulations for it to be profitable, while you also don't have to worry about in space                 |
| Life support is not necessary and not a worry.                                                                  | Earth is inhospitable (climate change, nuclear fallout, disease, environmental disasters, etc.)                                                                                     |
| It doesn't cost $10,000+ a pound to go somewhere.                                                               | There's nowhere /to/ go (either the Earth is dying, or you're too poor, or because of war or persecution, etc.). e; Also, the actual cost is about a quarter of that, and dropping. |

The mineral resources reason is actually true - we're running out of easily accessible minerals, like high quality ore that is close to the surface. You have to dig deeper to get a worse product that you would get a few decades ago. I remember at a workshop hosted by Vale Inco (a large mining company), the company guy flat out said that they were tapping mines that a few decades ago they wouldn't have even though about because they were such poor quality.

Space mining is supposedly the next big thing. many countries are preparing for it. Also, It doesn't necessarily need to be airtight to drill/mine. For smelting, yes, but that's a different story.

  Even if overuse of resources makes the earth a wasteland, even if climate change turns the earth into a very hot planet, it would still be magnitudes more habitable and economical than going to another world.

That really depends on the world in question. Most stories focus on finding/travelling to a world that is similar to Earth, or terraforming a planet to be habitable like Earth. The "Is it worth it economically?" argument also depends on the state of Earth. Many stories have people leave Earth because it is simply unlivable, for whatever reason.

You can even look at real-world examples of why people leave their homeland today. Look at what the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_boat_people][Vietnamese]] did at the end of the war. They got in boats and tried their luck (800,000 left, 200,000-400,000 died) rather than stay in Vietnam. Or the Syrians just a few years ago. Regardless of how risky it is, people will leave if they believe there's a better life somewhere else.
