If you haven't already, look into Robin Hanson's posts and talks on the subject, which agree with you (as do I - all these unrealistic sibling comments who so wish that space colonization is plausible just because they like reading fiction about it! But sadly for them, your argument is correct - space colonization (at least by humans) is not a good investment and likely not something worthwhile). Perhaps he has mentioned some things which he thinks might motivate earlier-than-usual space exploitation.

One thing that I saw him mention in a brief look is military use.

Also, one piece of fiction you might like on this subject is Passages in the Void [[http://localroger.com/]]
