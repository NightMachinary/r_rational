If your objective is long life and creature comforts, then yes I would agree space travel is for the short term not a rational, and perhaps even logical stand.

However rationality is not the execution of a logical goal, it is the method in which an objective is reached. I could have the objective of being the man to balance the most spoons on my body, and the daily training I go through and iterate on as I learn new techniques, perhaps even contacting and learning from the others in the world with the niche skill, is rational. It would be irrational to call up the Guinness record keepers and demand a judge without a day of practice.

Now, on a personal note on the reasons for space exploration and the want to spend ungodly amounts of time in a tiny tin can, breathing in recycled air, drinking recycled piss, and fearing that a single failure in the delicate systems keeping me alive? I can only blame personal [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH3c1QZzRK4][wanderlust]], I want to be there, and even if it costs me my life at least be confident that I've helped move Humanity forwards.

Every colony effort in history has been paid in bodies, and space will be no different.

On the long term, I've got the objective of getting my own black hole to place an Instanced copy of myself in orbit of very near the event horizon, watch the Universe die just to see it. A little grandiose I admit, but better to dream big than not at all I think.
