*Capitalism.*

Space if full of rare (on Earth) metals and ores. In time, it will be more economical to mine the asteroids and moons rather than the Earth, and whole industries will be moved there.

This will encourage people to move with the jobs, since automating the economy at these distances would be awkward.

Soon enough, there will be a whole industry in making space habitats for space employees, and not late after we will realise that these habitats can be made objectively better than living on Earth, since you can design them from first principles.

*Politics.*

Space is the final Frontier, if you hate your government, and have enough money to build a habitat on say, Ganimede, you can just fuck off to Ganimede and spend the rest of your life as a Space Libertarian Cyborg Corporate Baron.

Now, if you merge Capitalism+Politics into one, you have helluva incentive.
