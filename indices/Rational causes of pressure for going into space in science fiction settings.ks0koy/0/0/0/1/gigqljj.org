The massive problem you're missing is just how difficult it is to colonize other star systems. If you have the necessary technology to colonize other star systems, then you also have a staggering abundance of energy and resources with which you can easily live in luxury in artificial habitats. Plus colonizing other planets with existing biospheres is harder and less worthwhile than generally depicted. Since people likely won't be able to breath the atmosphere and they definitely won't be able to eat any of the native life (while also having to worry about dangerous wildlife and dealing with concerns about damaging an unspoiled alien ecosystem). Habitable planets are also harder to mine for resources and much more costly to transport goods on and off of (before you've set up major orbital infrastructure).

TLDR: From a pragmatic standpoint the tech and resources required to colonize other solar systems makes living on planets unnecessary and colonizing them nothing more than a vanity project (not that those won't exist).
