  That's doubtful. There are 40 billion Earth-like planets. Some of them are probably good enough for human life.

Additional potential problems: do they already have life on them? We're so picky about our biochemistry, we need molecules we eat to be of the right chirality or we can't extract useful nutrients from them. I find it really hard to believe we could survive on living beings from an alien biome, and farming with our crops a planet that's already dominated by a different biosphere sounds like a very uphill battle. So basically you need planets that are both very hospitable and also happen to not have anything on them yet.
