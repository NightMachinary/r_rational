At the very minimum you'd want some space presence to deflect asteroids which may impact Earth.

  Even if overuse of resources makes the earth a wasteland, even if climate change turns the earth into a very hot planet, it would still be magnitudes more habitable and economical than going to another world.

You only need to make an asteroid habitable rather than an entire planet. Not to mention space has the advantage of no weather or storms. If the life-support is reliable enough, then space can be preferable to Earth.

Not to mention that humans may augment themselves to need pretty much no or minimal life support or send AIs into space instead.
