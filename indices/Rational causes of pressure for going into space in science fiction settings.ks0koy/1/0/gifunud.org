Perhaps another American model for a rational reason for going to space would be to look at the religious settlers of colonial America, who struck out to find a space where they could be themselves without interference from larger competing cultures.

I expect that once space habitats become affordable for groups of middle class people pooling money together to acquire, all sorts of cults and semi-affluent disaffected young adult groups (beatniks, hippies, would-be Galts, etc.) will want to set up shop on their own little "island" in space. You could also see some groups we haven't seen before, like transhumanists looking to escape the "Luddite pearl clutching" of bioethics regulations against experimentation on enhancing their children.
