Yeah, I'm very much a techno-optimist. I rely on this optimism because of this talk, the speaker is optimistic that current climate models are well enough understood to somewhat safely do geoengineering. The tradeoff in known risk from rising temps to unknown risks with artifically lowered temps seems to be good. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWI2w2F1gMg]]
