Humans are genetically[edit: I suppose it could be a memetic evolution as well though the point still stands] wired to want to explore (and colonize) new places. If that wasn't the case humanity would have spread throughout the entire planet. Without any other information than the fact that humanity spread from Africa to literally everywhere on the planet almost no matter how inhospitable I would predict that they had a want of colonizing space as well.

Rationality doesn't have anything to do with the goals you have only the method you use to acquire them and what you are listing are simply challenges to overcome to achieve the goals..

Given that it's perfectly rational to have an intrinsic goal of exploring space for the sake of exploring space. If you're looking for instrumental reasons to conquer space you have to tell me what intrinsic goals you're trying to reach. One example of a goal pair is: if one had a goal to safekeep humanity it might be useful to colonize space in order to avoid the descruction of a single planet(i.e. by a big meteor) to destroy the entire species.
