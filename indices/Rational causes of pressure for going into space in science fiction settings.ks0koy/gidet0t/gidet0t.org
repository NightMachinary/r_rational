You don't seem to have thought through the flaws in your own arguments, which is mostly a prerequisite for being ready to incorporate the sort of feedback you're asking for here.

  even if we were to get more efficient with developing mechanisms for space travel

  cost $10,000+ a pound to go somewhere
#+end_quote

In the vast majority of recurring-space-travel stories, the cost is reduced by orders of magnitude. People often buy tickets from one planet to another, or even between star systems, for the cost of a few days or months of labor, what might be ones or tens of dollars per pound in today's money.

  Even if overuse of resources makes the earth a wasteland, even if climate change turns the earth into a very hot planet, it would still be magnitudes more habitable [...] than going to another world.

No, it wouldn't. If the Earth's climate shifts even 5% towards Venus' climate, Mars would probably start to compare favorably. And that's just considering our solar system; in any story with interstellar travel you'll eventually find a planet or gas giant's moon with a climate and atmosphere more hospitable than Earth.

  Valuable mineral resources are right beneath your feet, and don't require enormous airtight operations to mine.

The cost and danger to mine lithium and coltan go up every year as we exhaust the easy to reach deposits, and we need more of them every year for high tech industries and products. The cost and danger to mine the asteroids go down every year as we get better at space travel. Those two curves will cross far before reaching the future settings of many scifi stories.
