Early space colonization (read: now-ish if SpaceX and Artimas work out) is basically a loop: get cheaper launch, build space industry, get cheaper launch, get cheaper space industry, repeat. You're basically colonizing space to make it cheaper to colonize space. The only resource that space has in particular abundance is energy (mostly Solar), and getting that to the ground with any efficiency worth the cost is beyond what we're presently capable of.

Most of the advantages I can think of could be accomplished in part by better colonization of Earth. And the past century and a half leave me doubting that people would be especially interested in doing that on the scale necessary to make a difference.

There comes a point when space-travel gets cheap enough that enough people will say "Why not?". What I keep running into is space-pessimists assuming that the pre-Starship launch costs are either insurmountable, or costly enough to surmount so as to effectively be insurmountable. Yet we have more billionaires than ever, and they keep getting richer. Whatever other things that might mean, it does mean that the costs for the lowest-hanging fruit in launch cost reduction are becoming affordable to /someone/. I would assume that space colonization futures are those in which the likes of the SpaceX Starship actually work as invisioned, because as invisioned, a fleet of those, plus light industry on the Moon, /will/ bring down costs to the point that space tourism becomes affordable to far more people than at present. And even if SpaceX and Starship specifically fail, the concepts are sound.

The question then becomes: why live on Mars? ... I really don't know. Sure, you can have resources from the ground, rather than shipped in ... but Mars will still need /some/ things shipped in (nitrogen?). If you have that, then you're just as well burrowing into an asteroid and building a custom habitat without worrying about sandstorms. Colonizing Mars without being dependent on Earth requires colonizing several other places, even if the other places are just exploited by robots. There is plenty of space within the orbit of Earth's Moon, and you can ship in materials from elsewhere in the Solar System without sending people there.

Colonizing the Moon seems more likely than colonizing Antarctica, because Lunar industry makes everything in space cheaper, but beyond Lunar orbit, I see it being mostly Musk-type motivations that get things started. Maybe it snowballs from there, because without Earth, it kinda has to. But Earth will remain the heart of civilization.

In summary: costs can be reduced a great deal, if someone wants to badly enough. Industrializing the Moon opens up affordable exploitation of space resources, and that makes everything cheaper. Colonizing Mars still sounds weird, but rich eccentrists gonna eccenter.
