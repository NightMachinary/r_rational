The idea that civilizations would primarily expand through finding other planets like earth to colonize, or through terraforming other planets to be hospitable to humans is a silly and unrealistic sci-fi cliche. It's much easier and more profitable to colonize asteroids and airless worlds like Mercury (see the PS added to my previous comment). Since airless worlds are vastly easier and cheaper to export goods from until you have very substantial orbital infrastructure around a planet.\\
When it comes to interstellar colonization habitable planets become even more unnecessary: After all it's easier for non-sentient Von-Neumann probes to just build lots of O'Neill cylinders in preparation for human colonists arrival via laser highway. Ultimately for a post scarcity civilization (at least by current standards) habitable planets just aren't all that economically appealing, and they require a vastly higher upfront investment to colonize because of the massive infrastructure needed to counteract the massive cost to getting things out of a big gravity well and through an atmosphere.
