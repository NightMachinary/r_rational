  It's much easier and more profitable to colonize asteroids and airless worlds like Mercury (see the PS added to my previous comment).

There's a big difference between industrial/mining colonies and autonomous living colonies though. What you say applies more to intra-Solar colonisation. This side of - again - radical changes to human biology and anatomy, we need Earth-like gravity, we need sunlight, we need open space and air, and we need some serious radiation shielding, or our little primate brains start go cuckoo and our bodies break in various ways. So basically it all goes back to that. All space colonisation might hinge on transhumanism of some sort - or simply might be carried out by robots smart enough that we might consider them a lifeform of their own and in some way the continuation of humanity itself. As we are, we have limits on how much we can do, where and for how long.
