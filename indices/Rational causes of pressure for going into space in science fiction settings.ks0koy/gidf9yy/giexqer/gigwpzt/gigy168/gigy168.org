That sounds legit, though I still don't know about the energy and time requirements. My argument about lifespan in 1 (that applies to this too in part) was due to the fact that any of these projects - using probes and such - would require times that compare with the lifespan of a single individual, except for the closest stars. We're not super great at keeping our resources and attention focused for that long, at least not with our current cultural mindset (though we did manage to build gothic cathedrals at some point, so obviously 100-year long projects aren't completely out of the question). In that sense, I think having a longer perspective would increase the probability of people engaging in longer term plans.
