Could you clarify a bit on your rewards? At the moment the 12$ reward looks more attractive than the $25 reward in some ways, in that you get a cameo. The rewards that are cheapish should probably propagate up the chain somewhat so that higher values look more valuable. None of the higher up rewards get thanked, for example.
