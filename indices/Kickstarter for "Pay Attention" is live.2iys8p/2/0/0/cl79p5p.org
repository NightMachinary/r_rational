Add more elements in the high level rewards is my suggestion. 24 of your backers are level 1, 13 of your backers are level 2 are level 3, none level 3 or 4, one level 5 since it's a high reward. There's a sharp drop off for higher levels. So it'd be good to have extra rewards for the existing higher tiers to attract people to the higher price points. Cheap rewards that don't waste much of your time preferably.
