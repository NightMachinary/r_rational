Hey everyone!

[[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention][The Kickstarter]] that I've been talking about is finally live! Please take 90 seconds to check it out; I took me 46 separate takes to make a 35 second video, and I'm going to be very sad if no one watches it. Oh, and if you felt like reading the text and / or donating while you're there, that would be very cool.

If you don't want to give, please take a look anyway and give me your feedback -- I intend to do more of these, and I can't improve without criticism.

Again, the first 48 hours of [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention][a Kickstarter campaign]] pretty much determine its success (bandwagon effects for the win!), so if you think you might want to donate it would be very appreciated if you'd do it today.
