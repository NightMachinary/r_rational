I just discovered Kickstarter won't accept Paypal, and I don't have any credit cards. I'm glad to contribute ten bucks in exchange for the $10 tier rewards if you could direct me to a suitable email address to send it to, but raising the green bar to $300 is apparently not in my power.

I don't have much of a critique- I think the video was short and to-the-point and the whole Kickstarter seemed equally straightforward. I am curious, though, about how your plot can adapt to having one of several different word counts. Granted, it sounds like a really cool idea for a reward, but when you say that 20,000 words could potentially be added to the story, would that affect the nature of the plot, or would it be roughly the same story with five times the breathing room?
