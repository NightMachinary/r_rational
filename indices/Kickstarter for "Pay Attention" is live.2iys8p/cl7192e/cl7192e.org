For some of the higher rewards it might be good to have some extra rewards for $75 and above. The name in the story thing for example- you mentioned that they might be researching the monster so it should be easy to work in a short user submitted description and a name. Or mentions at the end of the book. Maybe some more rewards at the higher levels would help draw people out of the 5-10 dollar ghetto.
