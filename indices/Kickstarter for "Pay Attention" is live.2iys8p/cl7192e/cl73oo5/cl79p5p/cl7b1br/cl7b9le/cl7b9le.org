How about a new reward for each tier above 5 dollars? One that lazy people could enjoy.

10 dollars. Your name at the end.

25 dollars. Your name at a special thank you at the start.

50 dollars. A cameo.

75 dollars. A minor character, name and description.

100 dollars. a protagonist.

If you wanted additional rewards, perhaps a villain one would be good? Perhaps someone could help write a villainous scene, if they've always wanted a villain to do something, or at the very high levels offer some input. Evil options are good.

Edit. Now I'm imagining a horror story where people bid to suggest actions to the protagonist and villain, or offer aid. Like the hunger games.
