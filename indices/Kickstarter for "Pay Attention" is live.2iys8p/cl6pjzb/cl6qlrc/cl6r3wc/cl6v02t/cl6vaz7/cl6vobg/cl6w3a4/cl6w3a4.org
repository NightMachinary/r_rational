  You've already given me hours of entertainment with your stories, I'm just paying time for time :)

Fair enough. :> Have you read "One Hot Night"? If not, PM me your email and I'll send it to you.

  I'm one of those guys that yells at the tv about how stupid the protagonists are in horror stories.

Me too! That's a big part of why I started this whole thing.

Although, actually, even if it weren't for horror movies / TV, I'd still be going to the special hell. At a movie, I tend to lean over and whisper to my friends when I think of something funny, or when something stupid happens, or etc. I'm very quiet about it, at least.
