You've got a pretty good world and pretty interesting characters, so I think you've got plenty of material that you could work with. Besides, usually when you think of a society with magic, you think pre-renaissance levels of technology and society. Seeing a magical society that actually /uses/ the magic to boost themselves up to post-scarcity... That's pretty innovative for fantasy, and a lovely thing to see.
