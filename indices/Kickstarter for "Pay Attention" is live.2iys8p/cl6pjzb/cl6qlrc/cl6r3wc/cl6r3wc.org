  I just discovered Kickstarter won't accept Paypal, and I don't have any credit cards.

Yeah, Kickstarter only accepts Amazon Payments. Which *really* cheeses me off. Not only because they are a non-standard payment provider and most people won't have an account with them, but because I found it a pain in the butt to set up my merchant account with them so that I can receive money through Kickstarter.

I admit though, it was easy to set up a personal account on Amazon Payments. I'll give them that.

Anyway, you can use this email to PayPal me: *[[mailto:dstorrs.payments@gmail.com][dstorrs.payments@gmail.com]]*

I just now set up the PayPal account, so it's possible that it can't receive yet but, if not, it will be able to in a couple of days.

As to the plot thing...there's a lot that I could do here. Writing it as a 5,000 word short story requires keeping everything really tight. Writing it as a novella would mean I could explore the characters' backgrounds a bit more, as well as the cause of the supernatural goings-on. I could also extend the number of bad things that happen and spend more time on the psychological deterioration it will cause. So, there's advantages at every length.
