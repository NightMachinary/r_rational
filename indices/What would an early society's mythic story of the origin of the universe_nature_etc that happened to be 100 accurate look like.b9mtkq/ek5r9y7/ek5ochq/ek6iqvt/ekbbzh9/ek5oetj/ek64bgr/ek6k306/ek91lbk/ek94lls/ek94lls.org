Alright, I'll update from "you might be right" to "you're absolutely 100% correct that the /most/ appropriate place to pose the question would have been the Wednesday thread."

However, the question was posed like 10 hours before the Friday thread was posted, so OP /could/ have just waited a bit and posed the question there, which would have been /more/ appropriate than posting it as its own thread even though the /most/ appropriate option would've been to wait until Wednesday.
