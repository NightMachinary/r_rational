Have you read [[https://qntm.org/structure]] ? It describes a signal that encodes the laws of physics and metaphysics within this universe. Perhaps the priestly classes don't have knowledge of the order of creation in human language. Instead, they have a Song, which has been passed down from one celebrant to the next in the finest of oral tradition, where the Song encodes something akin to Fine Structure's Eka script. Celebrants sufficiently in tune with the cosmos can discover new syllables to append to the Song, with error correction coming from the fact that any layperson can listen to the celebrant's singing and intuit whether the sung song is truly the Song.

Or in Tolkien terms: The Ainulindalë was a metaphor for creation, and priests can sound out the song sung by Eru Ilúvatar. Incorrect singing is blatantly obvious.
