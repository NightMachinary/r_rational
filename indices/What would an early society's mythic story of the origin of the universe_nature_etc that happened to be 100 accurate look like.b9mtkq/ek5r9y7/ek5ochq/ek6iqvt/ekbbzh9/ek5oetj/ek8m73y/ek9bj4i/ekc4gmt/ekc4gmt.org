I don't know if any such account can be 100% accurate. Our current divulgative scientific texts aren't 100% accurate; in order to describe the complexities of cosmology in a way that can be grasped by the human mind intuitively, without advanced understanding of the maths involved, they need to make a good deal of simplifications.

As for less than 100% accurate, but still far more than the various accounts of Gods creating the world... I was always impressed by how close to home some Greek philosophers seemed to hit. Anaximander talked about /ap√©iron/, a shapelessness from which the cosmos emerged with things differentiating themselves. He also believed that many worlds existed, and many inhabited, and that they died and were born all the time. That sounds... pretty bang on, if you think about it, for one dude who just gazed at the sky and thought about it really hard some 2500 years ago. Then Empedocles, who said the universe was dominated by two forces he called Love and Strife, one trying to bring it together, the other to tear it apart, and that it cycled eternally between the victory of one and the other, with life possible only in the middle, where the balance was such that complex things could exist. And then of course there's Democritos, who outright didn't give a fuck and imagined and described atoms, to the point of coining the word, because he could. Though TBF the closest thing to what he called 'atoms' would really be electrons and quarks, aka fundamental particles. I imagine such a myth would probably sound something like this, using metaphors and analogies to what we can understand that try to evoke the general sense of what is being talked about.
