I can think of two ways of doing it.

One explains all the stuff that the primitive tribes care about in a more or less correct manner while leaving space for science to fill out the rest. It never contradicts the correct order, but often leaves gaps with vague phrases about stuff happening over an indeterminate period of time.

The other would be the spinning of a full creation myth. To keep people at all interested you may have to anthropomorphize things like Quarks and other particles, but you make a chapter for each major turning point that leads from the big bang to the birth of humanity and you phrase it in a way that makes it clear to future scientists that it all maps almost one to one to their own discoveries.
