Perhaps take inspiration from that post and base it on how Christians and Muslims say that their scriptures are actually in line with scientific discoveries (at least that's what Muslims say, I'm not sure about Christians). The claim is that you just need to translate the stories correctly and read them from the perspective that the goal was to inspire the listener by showing them the majesty of God rather than give them a precise science or history lesson

Examples: - The "seven days" is a mistranslation and it was actually seven eras. Also, seven (at least in Arabic) is a word that is also used to mean "many" instead of exactly seven. - God created everything and all life on this planet, but it doesn't say /how/ he created them. Evolution & big bang are perfectly valid means for Him to use

More esoteric examples you may want to use: - Calling mountains "pegs" (like tent pegs) since a big slice goes deep into the Earth anchoring that area - Life created in water before it was created on land

The table of contents of this book may offer further inspiration: [[https://www.islam-guide.com/bqs/]]

You may find more examples if you look into other religions as well
