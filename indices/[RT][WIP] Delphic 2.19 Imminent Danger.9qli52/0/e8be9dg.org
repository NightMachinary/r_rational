I enjoyed the chapter. I just wonder how everyone thinks Delphic was able to surveil the interior of the holdout building if there weren't monitoring devices he could have theoretically suborned.

It feels like his direct and continued assistance in this matter could have been a significant flaw in his concealment. Pointing out their location, sure, he could have traced them there any number of ways. Views on the interior?
