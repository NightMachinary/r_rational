Replacing the video card is, (on a desktop), one of the simpler upgrades one can perform. Two Phillips screws to open the case, one or two screws to free the old video card, then it's just pulling it out of the slot and replacing with the new one, which is only slightly more difficult than swapping an N64 cartridge at an angle.

Actually identifying if a given card is compatible with your motherboard, cpu, and power supply, and small enough to fit in your case, is actually much more work, all told. You have to consider the wattage (and whether your power supply has enough to spare / has the right power connectors), the PCIe slot setup of the motherboard, and whether your CPU has enough PCIe lanes.

If you want to download [[http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html][CPU-Z]], a program that will give you information on your hardware, I could take a shot at helping you sort all of that out, if you're interested.
