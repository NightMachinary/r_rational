I got my hands on Witcher 3: Game of the Year Edition months ago and /finally/ found the time to play it, only to find out my PC doesn't meet the minimum system requirements. My graphics card doesn't have enough Dedicated Video RAM and there doesn't seem to be a way to increase it on Windows 7.

The whole reason I waited this long to play the game was that I can't afford a console and am too frugal to spend full price on a game. Even if I was willing to fork over $200 on a new graphics card I don't know how to install it or whether it would be compatible with my desktop. So I'm *really* frustrated right now.

I started reading the Avatar fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6417590/1/What-I-Learned-at-SRU][What I Learned at SRU]], which transplants the characters into a fictional university in our world with no fantastic elements. It's basically the college version of a high school AU, which I picked up literally the day after I graduated from college myself, and so far I'm loving it.

It's characters I already like just living life and facing mundane conflicts while being really friendly to each other. It makes me happy and it's very well-written for a slice of life story, so I'm recommending it after just a few chapters. It may even qualify as rational, but I don't really care about that right now.

I've been considering watching anime with subtitles instead of sticking to English dubs, but I want to mentally acclimate myself to it by sticking to ones with slower, more prose-esque writing. My biggest concerns being distracted from the visuals by constantly looking down or the dialogue coming too fast for my puny pleeb mind.

My reason for this is...oh screw it, I just want to watch Re:Creators. I know there are plenty of great shows out there to binge, but this is series has caught my attention and is making me seriously reconsider my dubs-only policy. Is it a good gateway show, and if it isn't then what is?
