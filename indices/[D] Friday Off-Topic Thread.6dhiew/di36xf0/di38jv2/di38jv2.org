  So when someone asks about enlightening articles, I can name-drop Meditations on Moloch and not have the whole group say "yeah, yeah, of course, but besides that?" And when I say that free will is the qualia of intelligence in a deterministic universe, half the group will go "but what about quantum randomness?" and the other will go "wtf is qualia?" and I can decide if I want to go low-level or high-level.

  I really like to teach this stuff, is what I'm saying. But I don't have a ton of original thoughts, so I have to rely on my audience not having read the exact same things I did.

I've had that kind of experience too. Never really found what I'd consider a satisfactory way to approach it. You can try reading even /more/ esoteric stuff, but it can be hard to find ones you'll like. Then there's the risk of going to far that direction, and ending up interested in topics that can't really be covered in a normal conversation...
