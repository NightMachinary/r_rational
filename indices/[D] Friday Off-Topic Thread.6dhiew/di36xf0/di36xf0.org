#introspection

Back when I lived in Brussels, I ran its LessWrong meetup (now defunct) and it was fun enough. On moving to London though, I found that I couldn't make myself join the local one ([[/u/philh]]). Initially I thought it was just that it's much bigger, and I've got the autist/introvert/anxious thing going.

But yesterday I went to the second big [[http://waitbutwhy.com/][Wait But Why]] London meetup, roughly as large, and had a good time.

I think the relevant difference is that while WBW touches the same topics as the rationalist community, its fanbase is almost entirely disjunct, and also somewhat lower-level in general knowledge.

So when someone asks about enlightening articles, I can name-drop [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Meditations on Moloch]] and not have the whole group say "yeah, yeah, of course, but /besides that/?" And when I say that free will is the qualia of intelligence in a deterministic universe, half the group will go "but what about quantum randomness?" and the other will go "wtf is qualia?" and I can decide if I want to go low-level or high-level.

I really like to teach this stuff, is what I'm saying. But I don't have a /ton/ of original thoughts, so I have to rely on my audience not having read the exact same things I did.
