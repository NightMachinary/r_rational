I'm fairly certain that I've trained my body not to respond to melatonin through repeatedly ignoring the siren call of sleep; I've tried supplements in varying quantities to stimulate it, but they have little to no effect.

I do eventually sleep regardless, but it takes being REALLY tired to do so.
