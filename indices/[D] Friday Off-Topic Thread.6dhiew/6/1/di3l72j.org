The only way you can really aclimate yourself to it again will probably be setting a set time and ritual for when you go to bed :/ Melatonin also only needs to be taken in sub milligram ranges to have the full effect, anything more will leave you groggy.

Do you have any morning obligations that force you to keep a schedule, or are you rootless?
