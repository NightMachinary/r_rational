People on podcasts and youtube videos speak really unreasonably slowly, so I started to speed them up. 1.5x speed seemed to do the trick.

But then I increased the speed to 2x, and that was really nice because now I can eat podcasts at about the same rate that I can read the transcripts (or a little slower, but not so much that it's frustrating). I'm kind of annoyed that my iPhone won't go for x2.5 speed, because there are some podcasts that are still slow enough by default that I could handle the increase.

On the rare occasion that I listen to a podcast on a slower speed (usually because I'm taking copious notes), everyone sounds strangely lethargic.

EDIT: Wow. This is getting a lot of attention for what I thought would basically be an interesting curiosity for maybe one or two people.
