I think it must be a matter of signal processing in versus signal processing out. We can intake information far faster than we can output it, and once you realize that you start to wonder why you'd ever want to limit your intake to someone else's output. I find it especially noticeable for unscripted stuff, because people have to think about what they're saying, which further slows output. That goes double for a Let's Play, where a fair amount of effort is being spent on playing the game.
