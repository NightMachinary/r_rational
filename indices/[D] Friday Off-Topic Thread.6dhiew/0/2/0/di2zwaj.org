I listen to RW at x2 speed, which is my default for unscripted content or audiobooks (I play movies and television at normal speed most of the time, because usually someone is paying attention to the pacing, timing, and information density).

(I mean obviously I've already heard what we have to say, but I'd listen at x2 speed regardless.)
