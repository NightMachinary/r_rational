I'm not much of a podcast listener, but I do that most of the time when I watch youtube videos that aren't music. Less with, say, vihart or the vlogbrothers, who already speak pretty fast.

Really, this is one reason I prefer text. I can move on from a sentence as soon as I'm done with it - and no sooner, if it's something that takes awhile to parse. Speeding up and occasionally pausing a video helps, but it's not as natural.
