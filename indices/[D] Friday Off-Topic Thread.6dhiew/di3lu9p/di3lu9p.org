I was searching for books that took place in magical academies earlier today. I came across [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3972188-vita-nostra][Vita Nostra]]. I'm already about half way through, though it did have a rough start. I think I'll finish it tomorrow. I was wondering if anyone else had read it? I couldn't find a legal method of obtaining the english version and had to resort to libgen.
