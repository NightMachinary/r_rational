Currently about 300k words in and I'm really enjoying it. Though the pacing is quite slow. Like we're 300k words in and we've barely gotten anywhere. For a fic whose summary says it's about Jasmine exploring her sexuality, we are taking too long to get there. The wait feels believable and well written but still.

Despite that criticism, I'm still ereallyenjoying it and hope it's complete soon.
