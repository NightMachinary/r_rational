I can tell you what I got out of it, as someone who specifically asked for ongoing posts: I view it as an experiment, which he mentions a few times is pretty much what it is. When you perform an experiment, it helps to have regular documentation made public to stake your claims in the public sphere, both for personal accountability and for the integrity of the experiment. It allows you and others to look at it and say "This is what the goal is, this is how they intend to do it, now we know what to look forward to." It's even more useful in the retrospective, to see the evolution of a project.

Also, it's a handy way to get critiques, which he also mentioned being a motivator. Wanting something to succeed means wanting to ensure that you get every scrap of potential feedback you reasonably can.
