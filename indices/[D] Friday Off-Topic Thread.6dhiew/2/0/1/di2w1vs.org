Mhhh... interesting. I'm not done reading yet, but I already have a few points.

Quick question: how final is this supposed to be? This feels like a working draft, where each chapter has a coherent philosophy, set of priority and "A leads to B leads to C" structure unifying every sentence, but the whole document doesn't have a coherent structure unifying every chapter.

EDIT: Also, who is this document intended for? If it's for the people in your house, then I'm not going to be one of them, and they already know most of what you're writing. What message are you trying to pass other than "I'm doing this, wish me good luck"? I mean, it doesn't have to be more than that, but then again you say it's a charter and you format it like a charter, so I wondering who is supposed to read it.
