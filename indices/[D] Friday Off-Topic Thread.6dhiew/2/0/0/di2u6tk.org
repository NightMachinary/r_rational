It's an interesting idea. I've been in a handful of more structured living scenarios, and one can definitely see how I approached the values of the group, and so the idea of such a group where the values seem about as close to ideal as can be hoped for is actually pretty exciting.

Were I single I would be seriously considering what moves I'd have to make to be in a position to apply. As is I doubt I could hack it, and prior commitments leave me unable to even consider it, I think.

Get back to me in 25 years, tho, and we'll see which way the wind blows.
