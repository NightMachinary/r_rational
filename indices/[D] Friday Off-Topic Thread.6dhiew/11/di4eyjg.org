I'm trying the pomodoro technique for studying and I'm having problems with managing breaks. Either I'm ignoring them and work ith no break (which hurts the outside view i guess) or I end up taking at least 25-30 min breaks but less often (make a sandwich, boil water for tea, read RSS in toilet, that kind of things). What am I supposed to do during short breaks?
