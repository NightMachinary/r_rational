I use beyondpod. 1.8x is about my comfortable speed though some podcasts I bring up to 2.25 or 2.3. Still I've got a ridiculous backlog :(

(The stupid 4-6 hours per week of Survivor podcast I listen to, even on double speed, gives me a backlog by the end of the season. Now the finale's happened it'll go down to a more manageable 1-2 hours a week and I will no longer be perpetually a month behind!)
