I don't watch Hearthstone anymore, but when I did I had to find those few players who actually did some editing to cut out thinking/waiting time, and even then I watched with the speed turned up. There are some games where editing is basically required if it wants to be anything other than background noise. Kaizo Mario levels and Hitman are two more that come to mind, especially since quite a bit of Hitman is waiting around for enemies to path into the right position.
