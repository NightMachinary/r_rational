It was largely created as a defense against a sense that people within the community were aligning against it/me from a straw understanding, the idea being "well, if people are going to hate this, let's at least have them hate what it /actually is./"

The intended audience, then, is primarily "people who are socially only one or two steps removed from people who will be in the house." I share it here on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] off-topic just because I suspect people might be curious and because it contrasts interestingly with how I'm writing r!Animorphs characters' sense of cooperation.
