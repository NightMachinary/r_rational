That image only shows the CPU, which is only a small piece of the puzzle. The program I linked in my other comment will give a more comprehensive readout.

As an aside, I typically have random internet strangers send to my local The UPS Store, which charges like $3 to recieve packages. I'd find one nearby and find out their policy / charges, but it's usually a very painless procedure, and a means of obfuscating all but the general vicinity of where you live.
