Hm, well it seems to say it's a Dell XPS 8500 with [[http://www.barebonekit.net/dell-vostro-470-8500-yjpt1motherboard_i_mbdellyjpt1dh77.aspx][this motherboard]]. From a quick google on other people attempting the same upgrade, it seems like it would fit just fine in the case it comes with and work with the motherboard, but the PSU is not going to cut it. You'd need to get a new [[https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153232&cm_re=600w-_-17-153-232-_-Product][Power Supply]] somewhere that's at least 600w.
