I don't think Amaryllis edited Joon, though I did independently wonder when he suddenly started thinking about how he should be more effective like she would want him to be. It's just too dangerous and unnecessary. I could see it if she is a DMPC, but who knows then.

Student council girl was really irritating. I don't agree with him not just calling her out. The professor would be quite pissed off, and it would weaken her ability to mess with him further. Who knows what he missed.

I'm also unconvinced that she wasn't actually in the meditation room with him editing his hearing to get him eaten by a memetic horror. The skeleton meditation was super creepy, well done.
