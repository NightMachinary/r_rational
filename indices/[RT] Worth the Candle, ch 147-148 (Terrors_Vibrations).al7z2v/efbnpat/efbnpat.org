A few things:

- I really am trying to have chapters out a little more frequently and not just sit in my basement writing more without publishing them until they're in almost-too-big chunks like this. I'm just not doing a very good job. (For this one, I thought that the chapter that came immediately after these two would be best included together, but it would have probably been another week, which would have turned into another two weeks, and that's always what gets me into trouble.)

- Special thanks to everyone who's put in work on [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki][the wiki]], which now has enough stuff on it that I can start reading it as a resource/refresher. If you'd like to contribute, [[https://discord.gg/9htcTuc][there's a channel on my discord]]. (I don't have anything to do with the wiki myself, since it's one of those things that would eat into writing time too much.)

- As always, thanks to everyone who [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][supports me on Patreon]]. I generally exchange that money for goods and services like food and healthcare.
