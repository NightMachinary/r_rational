Excellent stuff, as usual. Though it kinda clashed with my personal interpretation of the story, at one point:

#+begin_quote
  Special Liaison on Existential Emergencies
#+end_quote

Wait what, this is an actual title that Amaryllis held? Like an actual job that makes sense, back in Anglecynn?

Lets back up to Chapter 7, when Joon and Mary sit down and reintroduce themselves properly:

#+begin_quote
  She held out a hand. “Amaryllis Penndraig, tenth of her name, Special Liaison on Existential Emergencies for the Kingdom of Anglecynn, long may it stand.”
#+end_quote

I thought this was a joke. An Amaryllis kind of deadpan joke, being a princess stripped of power. A "Well, I guess my job is guiding this madman around, now" kind of joke.

With the setup being paid off in chapter 13, when Joon meets fireteam Blackheart:

#+begin_quote
  “So who the hell is our mystery girl? ..." Asks Fenn.\\
  “Amaryllis Penndraig, Princess of Anglecynn, Special Liaison on Existential Emergencies,” I replied.
#+end_quote

Joon repeats without thinking about it - being a blithering idiot - and nobody moves to correct him, given the tense circumstances.

I guess /that/ explains why nobody moved to correct him. Huh.

Edit: Wait. The joke still works, just on a higher level, I think? Now it's a cosmic kind of joke. Wales you cheeky madman.
