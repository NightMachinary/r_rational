Does anyone use these kind of things to ontologically define something?

I understand the issue from a boxes won't fit perspective but I'm not sure how often you need to shine red light to see the puzzle clue is going to make people decide that any light that reveals the clue is red.

Your point as to why that is dumb is accurate but I've never heard of anyone using it to find objectivity.

Whereas its existence might for example reinforce the gender binary or the light spectrum binary or anything else you want is another complaint. But as long as it exists in universe as a concept then I don't see why a sword maker couldn't have chosen their best interpretation of woman (or perhaps like you said the easiest interpretation to implement even if it is clearly wrong for somethings).

Then the point is more about whether or not you should design worlds where people can create enchantments that don't and can't map perfectly.
