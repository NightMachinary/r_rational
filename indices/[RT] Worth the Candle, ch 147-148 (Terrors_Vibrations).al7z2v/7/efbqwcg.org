Discussion from the earlybirds chat touched on these points:

Amaryllis edited Joon in some way when she was inocculating herself against the meme, with various small bits of evidence for this theory.

Still magic should allow Joon to basically walk on air by freezing his feet or shoes and pushing off then. Would require some decent timing to use in combat, but would allow quite a lot of mobility if feasible.

A mage circus idea would be pretty funny.

Joon shoots down Valencia's comparison of S&S to Hogwarts, and then had a study session in which two guys and a girl write essays on magic, essays measured in inches, and the girl then criticizes the guys' essays because she's the "smart one".

The Urquhart stone is named after the castle near Loch Ness.
