I don't think it's completely implausible, I just don't think it's that likely. While the fawning over Mary directly after she touched him is a bit suspicious, he is twice the soul mage she is, it's a deep breach of trust on a number of levels, and he would likely reciprocate romance if she initiated it meaning there is little reason to risk all this when she doesn't particularly need to. I could see it if she modified him to be more disciplined, more goal oriented, but the risk reward for making him like her more through soul magic just doesn't make sense here.
