I would be hesitant about that. Since I strongly suspect that akrasia aka lack of motivation is a result of tasks not being enjoyable enough for the amount of effort being spent on them, and/or insufficient positive reinforcement for doing those tasks. System 1 relies very much on immediate positive and negative reinforcements, likely because it uses a lot more file compression than system 2 and so has to be constantly reminded of details that have been compressed out of its map of reality.

That's the same reason couples tell each other "I love you" even if they technically already know. Because while system 2 already knows, system 1 needs reminding sometimes.

Basically, if you're not including system 1, then you won't have the drive to get things done. Artificially removing akrasia through brain editing is a permanent solution for a temporary problem. Or do you think that those who don't struggle with akrasia have magic superman mutations that let them be more productive? If that's the case I would encourage you to read the "The Simple Math of Evolution" as well as "Are Your Enemies Innately Evil" on lesswrong.

Since basically all humans are extremely genetically similar. Only reason for nature to have so much bigger impact compared to nurture is because humans are bad at nurture. Case in point, the education system is crap, and hardly any parents have any idea what they're doing and they dont bother to take teaching or developmental psych classes so that they can have a better idea, even though those subjects are a core part of what parenting is all about!

So yeah, any time you consider whether editing a human brain is a good idea, consider whether you could accomplish the same goals by learning the right knowledge skills or ways of thinking instead. Because most of the time unless you have a disease or a brain injury you could learn how to accomplish any goal without brain editing, assuming you had the time resources and assistance necessary to learn the requisite skills knowledge and ways of thinking.
