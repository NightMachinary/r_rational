  Why would a DM even need a character to edit Joon?
#+end_quote

He wouldn't, but a DMPC doesn't necessarily share the same motivations as the DM. The DM is still trying to play a character, it's just that they designed the character to have a certain effect on the story. In this case, maybe the effect he wants is to have Joon realize that Mary tweaked his values at some point in the future and have him experience a sense of betrayal that he wouldn't have experienced otherwise. Betrayal is great for story-telling, and the DM wouldn't get that if he edited Joon directly.
