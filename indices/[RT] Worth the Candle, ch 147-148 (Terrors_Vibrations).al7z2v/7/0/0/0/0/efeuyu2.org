I don't think the changes were as broad as some posts have speculated. Manipulating Juniper into liking her would be absolutely insane - any change that robs Juniper of his agency would be a narrative death sentence.\\
Making Juniper more ambitious toes that line. I'd rather the ambition and cheerfulness be a reaction to having Fenn's death lifted from his conscience.

Assuming that Mary /only/ helped get Juniper past Fenn's death, its possible that she gives Joon some time to enjoy the change then tries to talk him into maintaining it himself.

I think there are also situations where the change is permanent (accelerating the natural process, or loyalty + spirit + soul) but Joon needs to find out at some point so all paths lead to the same endgame.

Agency has been a recurring theme of the story, and this particular self-editing conflict developed in the time-chamber and has yet to be resolved.
