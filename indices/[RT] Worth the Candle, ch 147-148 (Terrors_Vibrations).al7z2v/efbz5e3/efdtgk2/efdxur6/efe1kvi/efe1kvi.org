An ice cream truck is parked at the side of the street, a cheerful, subdued song winding from its speakers. It is a warm summer day, dappled with roadside shadows. You approach the ice cream truck. Inside is a burning man, clad in armour. He is swearing softly to himself he cleans the melted remnants of ice cream from his gauntlets with a sopping wet cloth. He looks at you, and his eyes are sharp, white, hot. "Just a second, please," he says. "I'll haunt you and fuck up your brain in a moment or whatever. I need to get this ice cream out of my armour or it'll be sticky for /eons/."
