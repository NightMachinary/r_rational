I mean, you don't have to think about the burning man. You can visualize your most awkward date or something silly you beat yourself up about.

Unless it turns out that it was the burning man who sold you this damned ice-cream. Or you had to ask the burning man for directions. Or if you crashed into burning man's car.

You know, if you start thinking about the burning man, in any circumstance, you should probably stop.
