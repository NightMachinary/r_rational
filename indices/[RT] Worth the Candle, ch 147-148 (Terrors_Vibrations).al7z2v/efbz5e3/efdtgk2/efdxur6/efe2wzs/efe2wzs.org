The hazardous part is not necessarily the exact idea of a "burning man". The burning man could be a mere /expression/, a door or a seed, a small part of the larger entity which, if allowed, would channel or generate the rest of its being in the victim's mind. Potentially, it instead can be expressed as a broken lightbulb in the hallway, as a sick bird in a flock, as a slave-trading nation in an utopian world, as a dead pixel on your computer screen...

In general, imagining "the wrongness of the world" as a concrete entity, focusing on it, putting it in a "calm" environment, potentially letting it interact with you mentally... That doesn't /sound/ safe, if you're worried the Narrative is out to get you.

Sure, it's probably safe now. But if [[/r/rational][r/rational]] gets trapped in a horror movie, many of us will probably die even /faster/ than h-zombies, since we'll be too busy admiring the abomination.
