[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%B6d][Ch√∂d]] is a thing that comes /kinda/ close, but other than that?

Long term meditators may experience a resurfacing of traumatic memories from the past, probably due to relaxation of defense mechanisms. It's called Dark Night of the Soul.

In the even that happens, a practicioner is supposed to face those horrors the same way they faced their practice till now- with nonjudgemntal, calm awareness. While difficult (and requiring support from an expert), it's very cleansing.

So it makes sense to try going through a (far, /far/) lighter version of it.

Actually, there is a cartoon that did this concept very well- Steven Universe's song "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rds7V5Sxu-4][Here comes a thought]]".
