I don't think I've ever noticed reminiscing about a different dead person being a death flag. In fact usually that's a flag that the dead person is going to come into play in the story - that they're going to find out something new and material about them or they put something in motion that would affect the main characters post mortem.

If they sleep together, that's a death flag.
