  I hadn't really been keeping abreast of the research into Val's powers, on the thinking that Amaryllis wasn't likely to miss anything that I would catch. My attempts at putting some distance between Valencia and myself seemed to be working, at least as far as her attachment to me went. I knew that her sight into the hells was a bit limited, not enough for surveillance, though we had infernoscopes for that if we really needed, and if we didn't want to look at anything too far down.
