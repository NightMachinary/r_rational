She is getting scary. She's like an abused parent perpetuating the cycle of violence. And in her house they better not disagree with her verbally or even in their dreams because she is always watching.

She has quite a poor moral position. She was abused and threatened by Uther and now she perpetuates the cycle of violence and threats by 10x. Sure there was a sexual component to Uthers abuse but she admits it didn't bother her in the slightest.

She felt abused by Uther and her solution is to kill, threaten, maim, torture etc everyone. She doesn't want honest apologies she wants submission and if she can't find the perpetrator she will find someone close to him. Then she can feel secure.

In the beginning, she demanded they be on her side, not because she is in the right - overall shes not, since she wants them to overlook her own similar behavior but not Uthers. And not because they are friends - because at first, they were strangers. But just because of threats of violence.

The sad thing is it works for her and has got her everything she ever wanted. Violence got Uther what he wanted, and now it's getting her what she wants which is tenants.

What can they do about it though? Perhaps take her power away and show her they still want to live in her? That's assuming she has human psychology I guess.
