  It was some other Reimer, essentially the same but from a completely different culture, and with none of the shared history. I wouldn't have wanted the real Reimer, let alone this imposter. But if Lisi had sensed weakness and latched onto him, then he was a liability, and if he knew things about the previous version of me, then he was an asset. The only logical thing to do was to keep him close, as much as I didn't like it.

Juniper's reading of Lisi's intentions feels wrong.

Let's look at Amaryllis's description of their friendship:

#+begin_quote
  “Motivated friendship,” said Amaryllis as she started walking. “It wasn't the first time, but it was definitely the least subtle. I don't know what she thought I would get from her company, but she was abrasive in a way that I never found entirely appealing. We Penndraigs are destined for politics and governance from birth, but not all of us are suited to it, and Lisi ... there's a reason that she's studying to be a combat mage instead of doing something a bit more prestigious. In another ten years, she'll be a multimagus, but she'll still be sitting outside of the traditional spheres of power within Anglecynn.”

I think Lisi was abrasive to Amaryllis, and Amaryllis stopped being friends with her. Lisi was abrasive to other important Anglecynn royalty, and found herself shuffled off into a do-nothing position. Lisi regrets how her friendship with Amaryllis ended.

I think Lisi is trying to improve herself. I think she's trying to strike a friendship with Reimer for the sake of improving her ability to make friends.

With that, I'm going to register a prediction:

Text: Lisi offers an apology to Amaryllis; Amaryllis judges the apology to be sincere.\\
Timeframe: I predict this will happen within two chapters.\\
Confidence: 80%
