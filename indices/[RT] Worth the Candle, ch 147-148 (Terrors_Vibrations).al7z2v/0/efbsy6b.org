Ethics professor is off to be the sacrifice for the Demonblooded Festival, I guess.

 

The code phrase Ms Name Generator used is somewhat more suspicious now that we've heard about the Pathists in, like, the /chapter immediately afterwards/:

#+begin_quote
  “Are you a traveller on the path made by others?”
#+end_quote

Raven /really/ shouldn't have tempted fate about 'dead cabals' like that.

 

I would've thought Valencia would bring up Snape as the stand-in for the Slytherin professor when Joon explains she's not /actually/ evil. The same thing can be said about Severus, after all - a non-evil conspirator who looks and acts evil as needed.

 

The final part of the chapter can be briefly summarised as "Joon takes some time out to go to Burning Man with a bunch of fellow students." He's managing to get a great college experience already, I think.
