Ohhh...

I felt it was suspicious somehow and thought maybe Amaryllis suggested this foolhardy course of action because she was in a very roundabout way trying to get Joon to snoop around her soul and see that she had removed the Joon-love blocker.

But this explanation actually makes /much/ more sense.

Interesting that we all more or less independently found the whole scene suspicious. I also thought it was eerie how Joon focuses on the last conversation and sight he saw, as if he's not going to see them again.

I wonder if Raven sensed Mary's intentions and that's the /real/ reason she hesitates to let her alone with Joon, all romantic plots being a red herring.
