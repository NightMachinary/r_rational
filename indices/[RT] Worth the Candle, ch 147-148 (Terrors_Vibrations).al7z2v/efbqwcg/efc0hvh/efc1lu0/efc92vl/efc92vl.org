I think there's ways that wouldn't be a deep breach of trust, particularly given the implications that Amaryllis' interface is entirely unlike Joon's. At least, I think that was an implication? Joon sees something like expanded character sheets, but the other soul mage descriptions (as far as I remember) aren't like that.

If someone reached into my mind and reduced my akrasia, I would probably go, "Oh! Good idea." That's one example. If I really go looking, I can find more - but basically, there are things in all (most?) of us that we are unable to do anything about - even to ask for the help of others - even if those things are small and otherwise unnoticed.

Amaryllis knows Joon really, really well. One of Joon's biggest issue is the issues he has with all of his issues. If she just poked something inside to let stuff flow and shift - well, I'd be in favor of that. And I can think of at least one thing Joon desperately needs but I think would never be able to ask for: Feeling like he can forgive himself for his mistakes.

Or, to more clinical / SCP - some memes are parasitic (aka, harmful) and self-reinforcing (you believe that you should maintain the meme because you believe you should maintain the meme). Not only do you need outside help to deal with them, you literally cannot recognize, ask for, or accept that help.
