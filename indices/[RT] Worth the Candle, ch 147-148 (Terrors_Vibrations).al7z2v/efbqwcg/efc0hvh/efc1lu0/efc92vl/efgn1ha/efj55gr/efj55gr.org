"Akrasia": "the state of mind in which someone acts against their better judgment through weakness of will."

I think that correlates with tasks not being enjoyable enough but isn't caused by that, and I both do and see people avoid tasks against our better judgement even when they actually ARE enjoyable.

  That's the same reason couples tell each other "I love you" even if they technically already know.

I really, really disagree. I say that because I want to express what I'm feeling, and I love hearing that because it tells me what my partner is feeling. I guess it overlaps some with positive reinforcement, and has positive reinforcement effects, but... PR is definitely not the primary effect of those words in my life.

  so much bigger impact compared to nurture

AFAIK that's not the case, it's a 40/40 split?

  humans are bad at nurture

I also really don't think this is the case. I also don't know what bar you're measuring against to think that could even lead to de-selection in evolution.

Most people know the education system could be better. It's already better than it ever has been in the past (AFAIK, on average), more parents have more of an idea what they're doing even if they don't aggressively pursue that knowledge just through cultural osmosis, and the rest of our civilization's support structure can (but not always does) step in to contribute.

  same goals by learning the right knowledge skills or ways of thinking instead

I would say that that is (generally) HOW you edit the human brain. There are sledgehammers in the way of pharma, but AFAIK literally all of those work way better when combined with the "natural" editing methods. Air quotes cuz this strikes me as similar to the GMO debate, actually.

Finally, akrasia might still be a bad example. I was trying to ask: Imagine that there is a thing that is acceptable to use non-consensual brainfuck magic to alter. What are the characteristics of that category?
