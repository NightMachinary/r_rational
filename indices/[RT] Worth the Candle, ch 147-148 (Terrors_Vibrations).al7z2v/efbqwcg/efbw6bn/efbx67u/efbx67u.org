I personally think it was mostly fitting evidence to a theory, but specific things mentioned were how he started thinking rather positive thoughts about Amaryllis almost as soon as she touched him, how he isn't grieving as much for Fenn even when he thinks about her, and purposely not calling an athenaeum a college.

Edit: college was crossed out in the earlybirds link to the chapter, but isn't on AO3. I'm assuming it just didn't survive the copy paste.

  Also, you know, asshole teacher, teacher suddenly disappearing because they're arrested, main character doesn't know a ton about magic... Valencia is totally correct and will probably come up with some theory that ends up being way too relevant in retrospect.

I don't think that that is as distinctively Harry Potter. They kinda fit, but they're not particularly unique to HP.

Also, who's the asshole teacher here? Still mage lady is shady both figuratively and literally, but hasn't been an asshole, Mr. Handy is a soldier but not rude or anything, human dude is a stereotypical professor, and Ms. Horny was nice enough. I think there are HP parallels for each of them to different degrees, but I don't see any as an asshole.
