  Amaryllis edited Joon in some way when she was inocculating herself against the meme, with various small bits of evidence for this theory.

  Joon shoots down Valencia's comparison of S&S to Hogwarts, and then had a study session in which two guys and a girl write essays on magic, essays measured in inches, and the girl then criticizes the guys' essays because she's the "smart one".
