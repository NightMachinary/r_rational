I agree, I would be massively surprised if Mary did something so obviously stupid and self-defeating. Especially since she knows all she had to do is wait and not alter herself and they're almost literally fated to be together.

I'm trying to think of circumstances that might accelerate her need to do this, and the only thing I can think of is she's insecure about Raven swooping in. But even that doesn't make something this extreme feel natural.
