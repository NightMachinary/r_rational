Was the burning man inspired by [[https://www.xkcd.com/1582/][this xkcd]]?

The "what about multimages" question felt far too vague, it could have been interpreted in quite a few ways, and it felt a bit out of place.

Asking if there were any common synergies would fit the response and topic far better, maybe mention how several volatile compounds can be detonated at range by even a novice.
