  Atoms are not subjective
#+end_quote

Modus ponens, modus tollens. Women are not subjective either. My bringing up atoms like that was to provide a reductio.

#+begin_quote
  If we admit physicalism and a fundamental mathematical model, an approximate formulation of that model, in a limited range of situations, as a model of weakly-interacting local degrees of freedom... is a thing that exists regardless of anybody's idea of what they want to find in that model. (This needs qualification --- in particular, we shouldn't be speaking about a single formulation, but about a family of related formulations for different possible values of “approximate”, “limited” and “weakly”; but it is morally true.)

This is rather abstract and hard to unpack, but to try my best to put my position in opposition to this. Mathematical models themselves do not define anything - they need to be put in contact with the world via our scientific methodology and practice, which needs to be interpreted at the base level by our human perceptual capacities and capacities to act. It is this whole network - starting from our basic capacities, building up into the ability to create and use and interpret tools that manipulate and measure, which we build methodologies and theories upon, as well as our ability to communicate and socialize with other humans as epistemic agents - that constitutes our understanding of scientific objects such as atoms.

Any objectively existing thing must be understood via a perspective such as this, and there is no escaping from it, and only partial and lossy abstraction from this. It is a mistake to then conclude that because our understanding of atoms is dependent on all of these very human things, that atoms are subjective, because, as I note in my first comment, this deflates the meaning of "objective". "Objective" of course does mean something, we use it successfully all the time, so that deflation only begs the question of what we meant by "objective" in the first place.

An alien which completely different capacities as a human can understand atoms, but we can only understand the alien /as/ understanding atoms via our own understanding of atoms. An alien can similarly understand what a woman is.
