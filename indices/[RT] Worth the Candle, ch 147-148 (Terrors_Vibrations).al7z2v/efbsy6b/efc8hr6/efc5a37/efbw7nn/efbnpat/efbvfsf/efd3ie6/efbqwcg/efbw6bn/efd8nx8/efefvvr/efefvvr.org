I just wonder what the actual plan would be though. Since it's clearly stated that they don't touch each other often, these changes would just revert.

Unless she also plans to simultaneously increase their amount of physical contact (which is certainly possible given the particular change that she made) then it wouldn't actually work long-term.

I suppose that maybe repeated lowering of his already naturally diminishing grief would perhaps be easier to take hold in his soul than a change which wouldn't have happened naturally.

edit: Also, doesn't it take a lot of concentration to mess around in someone's soul, especially considering she's only at half Joon's level? If she were going to do this multiple times Joon would likely notice what she was doing. And I don't think Mary is shortsighted enough to risk doing this only one time, when simply being patient would likely produce the same results.
