I was skeptical at first, but after a second reading am convinced it happened.

Before:

  Fenn and I,” my voice caught, even though I'd tried to steel myself, “We always talked about what it would be like for us to go to society balls with you, how much we would like stomping all over everything, and all the nobles would have to hold their noses, because we had superior firepower.

After:

  “Fine,” I said, still giggling. She just looked so serious, and then had that ridiculous mustache on. It was a little crooked, which just made the whole thing funnier. Fenn would have loved it, and for a moment, that thought wasn't accompanied by regret and loss.

  “She would have loved this, you know,” said Amaryllis.

  “Yeah,” I said, and then I started laughing again, because she still had a mustache on her face.

Juniper was nearly unable to talk about Fenn but is laughing in the same sentence only a few paragraphs later. Mary probably turned down the sense of loss. The change might not even revert since it would happen naturally over time.

There is additional evidence, the strongest being that Mary continuously brings up Fenn throughout the chapter. (Is she gauging his reactions?) From a narrative perspective, June and Mary have already clashed on the topic of self-improvement without reaching an agreement so a revisit shouldn't be surprising.

I do not think Mary performed any selfish changes, only what could be described as compassion.
