Sorry just to help me understand Tiff's problem with the woman sword thing is that in her opinion gender is at the very least a continuum and as such a box will always be bad because the minuscule difference between the edges will never be justified.

The same way a sword that say lit up when exposed to red light wouldn't work because the point where red stops being red is in some shaded area that no one can place.
