Only started reading this recently and blew through it pretty quickly. Is it normal for the author to take this long between updates? It feels like ~20 days is a pretty long time. Definitely not complaining, the story has been great so far, just want to know what to expect going forward. Stories like wandering Inn and practical guide that update multiple times a week set expectations unfairly high for other serials.
