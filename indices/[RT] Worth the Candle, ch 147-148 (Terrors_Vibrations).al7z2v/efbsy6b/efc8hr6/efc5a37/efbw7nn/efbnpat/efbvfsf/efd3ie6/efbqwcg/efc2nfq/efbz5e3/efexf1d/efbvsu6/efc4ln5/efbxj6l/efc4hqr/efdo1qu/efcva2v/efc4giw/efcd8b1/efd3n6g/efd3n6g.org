If narrative works, loot doesn't matter. If the threats are properly scaled (and they were for Uther), then it doesn't matter whether Joon has zero entads or thousand entads.

It's ironic, given the 'blah blah politics' joke. Politics got Fenn killed and that's the only meaningful thing.

Also, Joon has a crapload of quests, he can't do them all at once. Some quest or other will always be delayed. He should prioritize companion quests, probably, if he knew how to even start the only one he got atm.
