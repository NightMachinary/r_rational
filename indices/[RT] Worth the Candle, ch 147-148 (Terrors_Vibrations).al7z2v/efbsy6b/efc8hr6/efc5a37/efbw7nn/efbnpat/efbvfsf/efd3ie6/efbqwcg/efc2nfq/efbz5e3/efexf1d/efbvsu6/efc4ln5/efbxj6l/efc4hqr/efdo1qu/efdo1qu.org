i just realized having a dangerous meme which you've become immune to in your soul is exactly like being a carrier of a virus in the population remaining after a plague culling. it's a symbiotic relationship, which the host can weaponize if a hostile species/soulmage comes along.

if you could “endogenize” the meme into your bloodline via reproduction that would be a) a really interesting take on souls and b) very helpful for your genome's reproductive fitness in a world where the mind isn't sacrosanct.

i will be disappointed if the existing meme doesn't save juniper from hostile soul-editing at some point later on, as a last-ditch defense.

ps: you write a good hermione
