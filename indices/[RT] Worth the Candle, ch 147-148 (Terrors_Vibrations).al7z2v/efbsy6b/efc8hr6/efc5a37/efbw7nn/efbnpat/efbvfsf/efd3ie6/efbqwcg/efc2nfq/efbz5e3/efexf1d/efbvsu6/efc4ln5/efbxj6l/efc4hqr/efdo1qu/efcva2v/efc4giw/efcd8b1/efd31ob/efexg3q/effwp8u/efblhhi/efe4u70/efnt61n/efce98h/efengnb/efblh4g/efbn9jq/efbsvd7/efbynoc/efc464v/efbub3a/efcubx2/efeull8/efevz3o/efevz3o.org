Missed the double negative, should have been “can ... no” or “can't ... any”.

I always thought that “whatsoever” couldn't be used with an article, only with /no/ or /any/. Looks like my (foreign) English was faulty: [[https://corpus.byu.edu/iweb/][iWeb]] says it's possible, just rare (~0.5% vs no+any). Should've looked there before posting, sorry.
