I'm looking forward to the character realization that delayed quests will continue to rise in difficulty while dropping in benefit.

Twice now we have seen a quest be delayed untill it was forced. The first was the quest to meet other dream skewered. Which, if it had been done when Joon was weaker, would have been an infodump, with some helpful NPCs and a pile of very high level loot. But delayed, it became a high level encounter that cost a party member and required a lot of careful RP to get part of the previous reward.

Next, finding the body's origin. If done early, Joon could have reconnected with people more easily, and maybe gotten effectively a actual rule book. But delayed, now trust issues abound and any information they do get must be coerced or bribed.

The only remaining early quest is God Brother, where he is to meet one of the gods,and maybe join their ranks. Following the pattern, if done early he might have met on good terms, had his divine yada yada awakened by a god that viewed him as some kind of apprentice or lackey, or maybe even friend, but at minimum Ally. Now, he is a contender, any god on the hex is more likely to try to cut him off at the knees than help him.
