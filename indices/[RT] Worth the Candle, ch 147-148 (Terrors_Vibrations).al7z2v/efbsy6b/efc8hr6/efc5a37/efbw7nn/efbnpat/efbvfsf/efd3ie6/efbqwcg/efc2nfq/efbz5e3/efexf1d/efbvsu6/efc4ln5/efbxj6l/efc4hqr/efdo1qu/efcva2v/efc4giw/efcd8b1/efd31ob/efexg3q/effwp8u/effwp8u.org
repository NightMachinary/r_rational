A point which has not been brought up so far - The fallen super-intelligent precursor civilization is almost certainly an entirely bog-standard exclusion.

Some member of their race was conducting research on how to make their mental self-buff magic even better, succeeded, and got hit by the exclusion hammer, resulting in species death. So there is, somewhere on Aerb, an unmapped exclusion zone, containing the remnant survivors of this first exclusion, who are even /smarter/ than they were historically, and likely also fairly cranky about the whole thing.
