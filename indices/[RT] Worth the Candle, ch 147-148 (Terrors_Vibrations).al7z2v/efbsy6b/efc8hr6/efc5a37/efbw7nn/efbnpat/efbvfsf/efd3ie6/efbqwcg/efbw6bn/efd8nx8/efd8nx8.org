  What's some of the evidence?

I was skeptical at first, but search the chapter for Fenn and it starts to look likely:

  Fenn and I,” my voice caught, even though I'd tried to steel myself, “We always talked about what it would be like for us to go to society balls with you, how much we would like stomping all over everything, and all the nobles would have to hold their noses, because we had superior firepower.

And right after:

  “Fine,” I said, still giggling. She just looked so serious, and then had that ridiculous mustache on. It was a little crooked, which just made the whole thing funnier. Fenn would have loved it, and for a moment, that thought wasn't accompanied by regret and loss.

  “She would have loved this, you know,” said Amaryllis.

  “Yeah,” I said, and then I started laughing again, because she still had a mustache on her face.

June was nearly unable to talk about Fenn but is laughing in the same sentence only a few paragraphs later. Mary probably turned down the sense of loss. The change might not even revert since it would happen naturally over time.

The key is that Mary would have seen this as compassion, not manipulation. I don't think Mary would make selfish changes for the many reasons outlined in other posts.
