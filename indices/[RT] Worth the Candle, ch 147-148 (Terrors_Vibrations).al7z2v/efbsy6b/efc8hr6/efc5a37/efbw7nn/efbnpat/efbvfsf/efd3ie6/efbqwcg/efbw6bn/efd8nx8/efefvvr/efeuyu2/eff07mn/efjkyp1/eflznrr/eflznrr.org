I am now in a mild panic about whether the following narrative arc is destined to occur:

- Mary and Joon start dating
- They have a fight
- Raven comforts Joon and things get physical
- Mary obviously finds out
- Joon knits things together, possibly ...

  - Obviously leaning on SOC, to his existential discomfort
  - Overcoming his puritanical midwestern impulses
  - An IRL flashback to his relationship with Tiff
