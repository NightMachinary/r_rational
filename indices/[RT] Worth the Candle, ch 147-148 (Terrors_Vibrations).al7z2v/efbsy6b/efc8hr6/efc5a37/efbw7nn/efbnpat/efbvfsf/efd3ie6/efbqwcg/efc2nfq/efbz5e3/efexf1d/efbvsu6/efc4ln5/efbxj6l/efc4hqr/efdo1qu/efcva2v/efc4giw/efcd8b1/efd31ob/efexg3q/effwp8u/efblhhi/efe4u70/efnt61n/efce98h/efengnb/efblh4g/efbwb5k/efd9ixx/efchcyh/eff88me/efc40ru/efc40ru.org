Man, that Tiff argument this time is some real [[/r/badphil][r/badphil]]. There is nothing about "woman" that makes her argument special to the concept, so the argument applies to all things. Atoms aren't real, whether we call something an atom is just convention. The conceptual boundaries between what is and is not an atom is purely convention. Everything is convention and interpretation, there is no thing for which you can say that thing is real. You can't even say what is real is some undifferentiated uninterpreted mass of physics because "undifferentiated" and "uninterpreted" and "physics" are themselves conventional interpretations placed upon realty. Reality then becomes some thing about which nothing can be said.
