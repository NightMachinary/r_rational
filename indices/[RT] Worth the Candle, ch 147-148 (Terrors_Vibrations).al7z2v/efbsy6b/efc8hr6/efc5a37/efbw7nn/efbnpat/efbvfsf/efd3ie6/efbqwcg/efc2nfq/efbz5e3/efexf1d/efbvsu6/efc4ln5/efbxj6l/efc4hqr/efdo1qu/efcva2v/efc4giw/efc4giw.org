  “I don't know,” I said. “The way things have been going, there could be booby-traps everywhere, the kind that we could never see coming. Like, if it were me, and I wanted to create drama ... you have binary explosives on Aerb, right?”

  “No,” said Amaryllis. “Or rather, we could easily make them, but it's not an entrenched concept like it is on Earth.”

  “Well, I was thinking that if I were a total bastard, what I might do would be to create a binary meme, consisting of two memes that are safe when separated, but deadly when mixed together,” but even as I was saying it, I was frowning to myself. “Seems inelegant though, at least as a way of artificially creating drama, and raises some questions about where each of the half memes came from, and how they got their properties.” I noticed that Amaryllis was rapidly writing something down. When she was finished, she looked up at me with a scowl.

  “Could you not?” she asked.

OP, please please please write something for the SCP antimemetics division hub someday. You've got the best grasp on the concept outside of anyone I've read but qntm. Maybe even over qntm, as their focus when discussing memes is somewhat less on mechanics and more on interpersonal drama. So many wonderfully terrifying innovations.
