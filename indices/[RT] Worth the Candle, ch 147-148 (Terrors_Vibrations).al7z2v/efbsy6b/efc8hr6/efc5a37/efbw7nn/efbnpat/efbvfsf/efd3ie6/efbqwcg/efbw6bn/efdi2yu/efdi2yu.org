I'd like to publicly register that I think Mary doesn't soulfuck Joon in this chapter. 80% confidence.

Couple reasons: Mary rightfully demands full disclosure of Joon, down to his erotic worldbuilding details. She also is a strong advocate of narrative. Opening up a narrative trap of this party shattering magnitude isn't NOT in character for Mary. There are meta-narrative reasons why she might be doing it, but the evidence weighs against.

Joon's love for Mary flares when they are in close proximity? Thats not new evidence and happens all the time.
