I think you've misunderstood me here.

I'm not arguing the social baggage around the concept of “woman” should /do/ anything; certainly not force anyone to discard the concept.

Further, I'm pretty sure Tiff doesn't know what she wants, other than to object to the notion that a magical sword can authoritatively tell someone who believes they're a woman that they aren't one.

Trying to create magic that operates on non-reductive concepts in a reductive world is pretty inherently difficult. Having to make authoritative statements about how /the magic/ classifies things is necessary in the same way that a decidable algorithm that doesn't have a deterministic output is in most cases useless or even harmful to rely on.

Reimer was right that there should, eventually, be a “way the sword works” and if you run enough tests you should be able to determine the algorithm.

Tiff was right that the existence of that classification isn't definitive, it's just the magic's interpretation among many many other interpretations. That privileging it is dismissive, even harmful, to people without any real benefit other than disambiguation.

Joon was right that creating such a magic item in your game is more trouble than it's worth in more ways than just the difficulty of drawing hard boundaries around fuzzy things that have no attached social baggage.

They were all right and all still arguing because they all cared about completely different things.
