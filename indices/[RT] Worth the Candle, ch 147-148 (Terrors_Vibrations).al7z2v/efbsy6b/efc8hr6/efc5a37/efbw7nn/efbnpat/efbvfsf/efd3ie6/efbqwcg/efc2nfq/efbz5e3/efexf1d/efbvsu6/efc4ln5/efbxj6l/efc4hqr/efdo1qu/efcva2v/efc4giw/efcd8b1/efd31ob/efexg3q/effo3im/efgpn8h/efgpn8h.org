Sorry, that was vague. I meant his overall commitment to leveling as a means of reaching godhood has sunk hard post-soul/spirit-edit. In recent chapters, he's been distinctly expressing his reluctance to do the quests that he doesn't like. That works if his goal is that of a tabletop gamer maximizing fun. But if we're getting into theological territory, there's no room for squeamishness in a would-be god. Besides what it reveals of his psychological readiness, I can't imagine him playing god better than the reigning DM when he hardly has any conviction to buckle down and do the less pleasant chores and choices that inevitably come with divine governance.
