  I could see it if she modified him to be more disciplined, more goal oriented, but the risk reward for making him like her more through soul magic just doesn't make sense here.

There's an entire paragraph where it basically implies she is doing that. From the story:

  I found myself wondering what I was waiting for. Why hadn't I tried to make a better case for myself? Why wasn't I trying harder to be the person that she wanted me to be, especially if it was the person that I wanted to be too? Uther was my point of comparison, and while I didn't want to be him, the things that he'd accomplished before leaving were so far beyond what I had managed to do that they seemed more like myth than reality. Amaryllis ... left to her own devices in a parallel timeline, she had conquered as much of the world as she possibly could have, with only a slight bit of cheating. I wanted to be with her, whether as a friend or not, and I knew that if we were going to keep things copacetic between us, I would have to be more like her, more driven, more ambitious. I knew that I should be anyway, even if she wasn't around.

  I should have gone home and faced whatever terrible thing the Dungeon Master had planned for me there.

I think that Joon is likely going to evince no desire to closely look at his own soul to check that his values haven't changed or been forcibly altered - because that's probably the first thing Mary changed, before she did anything else. Right after that, she made sure his desires to see her own motivations / mind was less than his ethical prohibition against it (see later on, when he hits her mind and decides not to look at it b/c he's been made to view it as an invasion of privacy). If she was really cunning and clever, she might have hit tertiary desires. Like, make him want to be different (see paragraph excerpted above) and ease back on his worries about self-editing (which Mary has already been doing herself) so that he makes the direct major changes she wants him to make to himself - giving the other party members a plausible narrative and excuse for Joon's eventual major personality edits, that Joon himself will tell them, when Joon 'changes himself'.
