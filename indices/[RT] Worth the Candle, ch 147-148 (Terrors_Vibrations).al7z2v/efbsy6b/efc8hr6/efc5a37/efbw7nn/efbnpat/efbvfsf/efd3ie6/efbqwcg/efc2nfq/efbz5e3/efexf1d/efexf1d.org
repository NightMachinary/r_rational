I recently reread the whole thing. I noticed a couple of things:

- People on Aerb cannot see to the bottom of the hells. But Valencia can see all 9000? I would think that would make Mary and Jorge interested.
- Mary never mentions Narrative with regards to her and Joons romance. But she is clearly thinking it. She wants to keep an unresolved romance thread going, this is the real reason she is sending such mixed signals (which is not like her). It seems like a solid plan to me.
- Many parts of soul magic are excluded, like changing age. Joon says that most things that can be done with soul magic can also be done with spirit magic. Does that included the otherwise excluded changes? It seems like some good exploits Joon should examine. The fact that there are less users means that it may have less exclusions.
- They promised to give the tattoo book back to the tatooist if he told them the truth - and he did. But Joon is still using it? (or maybe he just copied it)

And a couple of less insightful observations:

- They should harness Reimer to help think of exploits, luckily it looks they are going in that direction
- When Uther & Raven found the woman in the wine barrel it was the medieval equivalent of women in fridges. And it was the DM saying that women will be in fridges either way. Ok, that was probably obvious to most people but I missed it up until now.
