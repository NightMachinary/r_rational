The idea that she did it knowing she'd soon tell him is definitely a lot easier to swallow. It makes more sense as a plan.

Though I'm still not 100% convinced that Mary would risk something like that. Afterall, messing with someone's soul behind their back is a major breach of trust. Even if she did convince him to alter himself in the process, it's possible that the damage done once he found out would be way worse than what was gained.

It just seems like a big gamble without much benefits. Especially considering that Joon was pretty obvious that he's still into Marry and just needed a little time.

The risk/reward ratio seems all off on this one for someone who is as careful and calculating as Mary. But I suppose I could be wrong.
