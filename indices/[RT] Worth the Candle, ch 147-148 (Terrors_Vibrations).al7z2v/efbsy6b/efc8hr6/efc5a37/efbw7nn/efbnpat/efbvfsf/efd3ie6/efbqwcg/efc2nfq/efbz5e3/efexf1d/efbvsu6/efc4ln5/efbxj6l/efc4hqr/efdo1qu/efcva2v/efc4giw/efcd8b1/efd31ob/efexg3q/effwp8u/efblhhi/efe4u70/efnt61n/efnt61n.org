I'm surprised no one's brought up the huge hint Joon offhandedly mentioned: that Fel Seed is based off of the manxome foe, i.e. the Jabberwock. And the manxome foe is slain by the vorpal sword in Lewis Caroll's poem. There's quite a few problems with taking it literally: it seems lazy, it could just be another false lead that can't actually permakill Fel Seed, does a vorpal sword entad even exist, how would they know a sword is /the/ vorpal sword when the canonical sword has nothing to really distinguish it. But still, Occam's razor. The game states Joon /knows/ how to kill him, and this is the best (and only) lead.
