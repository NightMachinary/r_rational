Too many convenient pieces of evidence that are difficult to explain via other means, and the theory explains/resolves a number of details

- the entire paragraph about suddenly wanting to be more like what Amaryllis wants him to be
- explains why they hadn't tested on "D-class personnel" first (because Amaryllis didn't want to be immune to the meme so much as she wanted to soulfuck him and it was just the excuse she used)
- the inexplicable loyalty level up makes sense if you consider she's more loyal to joon because she'll get to edit him more to her liking, or at least recognizing the unquestioning trust of him giving her free access to his soul without suspicion
- her wariness when woken back up suggests she was worried she might have messed something up (joon laughing could have made her concerned that something she had done had caused it)
- wanting privacy to do it, walking to get the plate when it wasn't necessary. Her hesitation and care and extra time taken when asking to get access to his soul and distracting him by mixing the request with a different topic that Joon himself recognized wasn't a debrief for the purposes of a quest and out of character since she doesn't generally talk about her past
- brushing off Juniper asking whether they should consult Raven and invoking the narrative to persuade him to just do it because she knows he doesn't like talking about it
- immediately being able to recall fenn without twinging when just prior to Amaryllis being in his soul he was
- this line: "Back near the beginning, when we weren't so close, I'd had some fantasies about Amaryllis, fantasies that I'd done my best to squash, and *fantasies that were returning, unbidden*." It is in her interests that Joon is more positive towards her, and the phrasing of "returning, unbidden" is pretty interesting.
