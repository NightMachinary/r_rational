Psychopaths/sociopaths who are a danger to everyone around them. But it would only be a last resort, when there are no other ways to keep them from hurting people.

I think we shouldn't be so quick to abandon or discard deontological ethical inhibitions. While in chess there are circumstances where you might want to sacrifice a queen for a pawn, the vast majority of the time it's a really dumb idea. Likewise for non-consensual brainfuck magic. While there are circumstances were there aren't any better options, if there's a better way which doesnt involve non-consensual brainfuck magic then you always should go with that instead.
