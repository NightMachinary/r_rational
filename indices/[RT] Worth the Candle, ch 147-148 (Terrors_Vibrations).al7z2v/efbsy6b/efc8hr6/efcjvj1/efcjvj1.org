Agreed! I didn't even consider it, but now that it has been brought up, it feels like exactly the kind of red herring that the author would put in to make us scramble to argue about it. She didn't do it though! That would be waaay out of character, especially with her mild trauma from what the elf did to her, and their is no way she would think she could get away with it, if Bethel even heard a tiny breath of it, she would be somewhere between mince meat and dust in moments, Bethel already doesn't like her, giving her an excuse to act on that disliking by callosaly breaking Joon's trust like that, No, that is waaay not her.
