Before reading the thread /my/ first hypothesis was that she really wanted Joon to snoop in her soul so he would see that she loved him without her telling him. But that would be out of character. I think her editing him to be more of a hero is totally in line with her character.

At the end of the day, the eerie narration surrounding it (Joon making note of the last thing he saw, etc) and the fact that Mary of all people rushed into a memetic hazard with no prep, consultation with others, or testing, /and/ the unexplained loyalty boost when he consented, /and/ the flash of disappointment followed by relief about the mustache, needs to be explained. I don't know what's going on but I feel that something is going on.
