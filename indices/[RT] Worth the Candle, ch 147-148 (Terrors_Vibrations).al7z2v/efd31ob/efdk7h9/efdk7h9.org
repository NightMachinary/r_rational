I think Tiff is replying to an argument along the lines of "the sword lights up when touched by a woman, so 'man' and 'woman' are real ontological categories in this universe."

The counter example, following your analogy, is that the sword isn't tapping into any "true" notion of redness. It's just lighting up when exposed to light with wavelengths between X and Y. Then the narrator describes that behavior as "lighting up with red light" because that's how people talk.

So using the first sword to come up with an objective definition of gender is like using the second sword to find a true meaning of "red."

You're not leaning a "true" meaning. At best, you're learning some swordsmith's implementation of his opinion of red.

Like, it's possible that the particular spell used to light up on red will also light up on responsible to bursts of X-Rays because (magic technobabble here). The correct conclusion is, "huh, that spell is buggy and weird" and not "X-rays are red in some deep and meaningful way."

So, swords have a decision rule, but not an objective or privileged one.
