I liked how Mary's loyalty increase came about from kinda the inverse situation of the first night she and Jun traveled together. In that case he completely blew off "watching her back while she was asleep" to go play with his shiny new litrpg mechanics, whereas in this case his offer to watch her back was something she could count on.

Which is maybe evidence that the loyalty increase mechanic is governed by his companions' thoughts rather than Jun's actions? Maybe it was Mary's recollection of Jun's initial unreliability contrasted with where they were in the present, and her recognition of the progress he'd made, that triggered this loyalty up. (Which is evidence for the Six-Eyed Deer being sapient, if true.)
