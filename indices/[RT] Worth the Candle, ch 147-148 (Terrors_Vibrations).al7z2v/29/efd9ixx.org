I'm onboard with the whole Mary editing Joon theory.

Sure, it's a breach of trust. It's also Mary's highest priority to save Aerb, and if it took killing Joon to do so (let alone editing him) then she would.

There're some more benefits to having Joon malleable to Mary: her worldly ambitions, for one; the well-being of the people she cares for; her personal well-being; and his well-being. I dare say Joon being a bit more focused and ruthless would make him significantly more useful as a tool for Mary.

Also, there was a stark difference in how Joon felt towards Fenn before and after the editing. I'd say Mary edited his despair towards Fenn.
