Tiff's argument irks me to no end, but we've also heard less of it than needed to actually engage with it; that is, I'm itching to scream “wrong!”, but I don't actually know which of a couple possible weak points it actually has.

This argument, though, now that's something I can engage with.

Not going to defend the atom analogy, as I don't think it's good either. The social baggage argument, however, looks wrong to me.

Specifically, one doesn't get to discard a notion because there's social baggage attached to it, no more than one gets to discard a piece of physics because it was done by a Nazi, or a piece of medicine because it was discovered by making holes in people's skulls. (If that helps, I also think that the measures described in /Delphic/ 's “[[https://delphicserial.com/2018/03/25/interlude-stevens/][/In re/ Stevens]]” would, in the real world, be wrong and actively harmful to humanity, regardless of how depraved the real-world Dr Stevens were.) Yes, the baggage attached to “woman” is quite a bit heavier than being discovered by a Nazi, but the principle stands: one doesn't abandon a piece of truth about the world because of social issues incidentally attached to it.

The claim, then, would have to be that “woman” is a notion that does not represent a piece of truth about the world. That... would require a lot of justification, I think. My purpose here isn't to argue one way or the other, only to point out that “has social baggage attached” would be orthogonal to such an argument. Still, here's a list of other points against that wouldn't work:

- Pointing out that it's not the ultimate truth: the test is having a relation to the truth, not encompassing it completely, otherwise progress would be stuck; in particular:

  - Pointing out that the boundary isn't completely well-defined: something that's true even, say, 60% of the time is still telling us something;
  - Pointing out that it conflates several things into one; the fact that they did get conflated also tells us something, even if realizing that there is in fact several separate things is extremely enlightening;

- Pointing out that it's a social construct: just because something exists in people's minds doesn't mean it's not real (if possibly more mutable); how it got there is also bound to be an interesting topic.

Note, however, that something being related to truth doesn't have anything to do with it being related to morals, being suitable for usage in law, being suitable for a first introduction to the subject, and so on. These all need to be argued separately.

Which brings me to another baffling (in-universe) thing about the original argument depicted in WtC, because whether a magical sword that classifies bearers into women and non-women is feasible in a particular or any fictional world, whether building such a world is a good thing to do, &c. are all good and non-obvious questions, while whether there exists a well-defined class of people that includes most people commonly called such and excludes most people not commonly called such... seems to be trivial, along with the fact that the /exact/ description of any such class would have to be long and not in any way simple.

As to why I think [[/u/yagsuomynona][u/yagsuomynona]]'s atom analogy isn't of much use: the way it equates the subjective fuzziness of “woman” and “atom” only works against trying to categorically exclude any fuzziness at all, or any subjectivity at all, but not against trying to exclude unreasonably subjective fuzziness. /Atoms are not subjective/. If we admit physicalism and a fundamental mathematical model, an approximate formulation of that model, in a limited range of situations, as a model of weakly-interacting local degrees of freedom... is a thing that exists regardless of anybody's idea of what they want to find in that model. (This needs qualification --- in particular, we shouldn't be speaking about a single formulation, but about a family of related formulations for different possible values of “approximate”, “limited” and “weakly”; but it is morally true.) That we currently suck at finding these formulations except by following our preconceptions doesn't make them any less objective.
