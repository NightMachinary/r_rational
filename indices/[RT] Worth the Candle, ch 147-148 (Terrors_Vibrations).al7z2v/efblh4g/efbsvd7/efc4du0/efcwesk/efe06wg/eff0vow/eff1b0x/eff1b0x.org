(Yeah, this confused me too; I think the conflict is between perceiving 'transgender' as an adjective versus a verb (with consensus settling on adjective). I /think/ all the rules are consistent under that reading, so long as you don't ascribe verbness or nounness to the adjective like so many of them have.)
