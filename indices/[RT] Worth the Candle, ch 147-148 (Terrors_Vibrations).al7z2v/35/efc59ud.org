  Amaryllis held the glove out and a hand mirror popped into existence. She stared at her reflection for a moment, then looked back up at me with a raised eyebrow. “Really?” she asked. For a brief moment, she seemed disappointed in me, but then her eyes went down to the mirror again, and she cracked a smile. “You're ridiculous,” she said. She gave me a skeptical look, then her eyes returned to the mirror again. “You didn't even draw it right!”

  “I didn't want to spend a bunch of time on it,” I explained.

  Amaryllis set the mirror down. “You know that this means retribution, don't you? A Penndraig is not to be trifled with.”

  “Wouldn't be the first mistake I've made,” I said, smiling at her.

  “She would have loved this, you know,” said Amaryllis.

  “Yeah,” I said, and then I started laughing again, because she still had a mustache on her face.
