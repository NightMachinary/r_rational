Sorry if this is this question is easily answer elsewhere:

So the label for this story is 147-148. However the top of the chapter is labeled 147. There does not seem to be a chapter 148.

I just want to confirm that the last chapter really is chapter 147. And if it isn't where can I find chapter 149?

By the way, I love the story! Are there other Rational Fic works that you've done that are finished?
