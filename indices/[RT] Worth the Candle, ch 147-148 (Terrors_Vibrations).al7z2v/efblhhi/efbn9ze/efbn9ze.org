Placing my prediction here - Amaryllis altered Joon's soul values in chapter 146: 10%

Amaryllis believes in narrative and that most/all secrets are going to come to light at some point; this would be a colossal mistake from that standpoint. Amaryllis is unlikely to be able to make any changes permanent as she lacks the Spirit virtue Joon received. Amaryllis is taking a huge risk that Joon doesn't just check his own soul and see the changed values. Amaryllis is risking all this to...make him more likely to complete a side quest? (Unless she can make permanent changes his ambition would revert back by the time any further quests are due to be underway and, honestly, the changes would revert back before this current arc is even done and the side quest is underway seeing as she would only be able to slightly modify his values if she wanted it to go unnoticed).

The change of heart Joon has while Amaryllis is within his soul is also entirely plausible as a sign of character growth, helped along by the conversation he just had with Amaryllis and a desire to be the sort of person Amaryllis would respect, seeing as he has feelings for her.
