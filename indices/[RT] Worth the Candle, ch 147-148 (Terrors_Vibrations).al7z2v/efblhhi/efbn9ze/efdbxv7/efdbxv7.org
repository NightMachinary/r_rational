I haven't done a close reading to check if this is likely at all, but it occurred to me:

Maybe Amaryllis was just /undoing/ changes she had previously made?

Suppose that she had reduced Joon's feelings for her as a misguided attempt to give her blessing to his relationship with Fenn, and also to allow him to function better despite her distraction. She later decides that was a mistake, and undoes it, but much less cautiously because putting something back doesn't feel as dangerous as changing it in the first place.

Just an idea. It could be wrong in a half-dozen ways.
