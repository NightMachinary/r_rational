  “And finding him, or at least finding out what happened to him, is also a step toward godhood, at which point I can do whatever I want, including installing you as grand monarch of Aerb, if that's what you want.”

  I wanted to meet other Juniper. I wanted to talk to him about what his life had been like. Reading Reimer's notes ... well, Reimer didn't focus on the things that I wanted him to focus on, but I could still get some sense of the other Juniper peeking through.

  Why hadn't I tried to make a better case for myself? Why wasn't I trying harder to be the person that she wanted me to be, especially if it was the person that I wanted to be too?

Joon struggling with those New Year's resolutions (or just being a rational decision-maker). He wants to take a step towards a nebulous future of godhood, but doesn't want to do quests to get there. Wants to meet the other Juniper and find out what his life was like, but doesn't want to "go home" and meet the doppelgangers. Wants to be a better person, but can't find true motivation since he's barely crawled out of the homeostasis of depressed, heel-Joon. Hopefully all the fan speculation of Amaryllis soul-editing Joon isn't true, or the moral of the story would be "seek pharmacological help." Which is further corroborated by his noticeable improvement in the interpersonal department after those SOC points, though I guess the more psychologically helpful moral would be to "seek help" in the first place and /want to be the change/ he wants to see in himself or Aerb.

P.S. Is it just me or is there a running theme of only being able to know/commemorate (dare I say memorialize) someone secondhand? Cypress, doppelganger Aerb-Joon, Arthur-as-Uther, Urquhart Stone-as-Uther, teenage-Arthur-via-vignettes.
