Well.

I have to thank you for introducing me to /kalatet/ (ignoring the infohazard aspect of it :P).

It feels so obvious now- since core of meditation is disconnection from reaction to stimuli, wouldn't it make sense to focus this attention on unpleasant thoughts?

I will incorporate it into this into my meditative practice.
