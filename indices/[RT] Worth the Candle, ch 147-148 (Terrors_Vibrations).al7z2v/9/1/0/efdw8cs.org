There /is/ a practice called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%B6d][Ch√∂d]], that focuses on overcoming fear (and other emotions) by dwelling in burial grounds and other haunted places.

In general, Buddhism is quite big on overcoming [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleshas_(Buddhism][Kleshas]]) (mental states clouding the mind, be it fear, anger, desire).

So, no, I don't think author tried showing a specififc technique. Yet, the practice itself makes perfect sense.

Also, it adds to the paranoia- "Is it a real technique, or just a memetic trap?".
