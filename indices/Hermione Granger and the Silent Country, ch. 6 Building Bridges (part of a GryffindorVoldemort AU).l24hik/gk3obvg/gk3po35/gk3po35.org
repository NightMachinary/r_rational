  Without the real version isn't it more likely he'd say there's no year minimum? It makes way more sense to divide it by years than age after all

Yeah, that's much better. Changed it.

  Were goths really all that popular in 1995 or whenever this is? Especially in France
#+end_quote

I've had trouble finding information on France, but it was fairly popular (to the degree that it was ever "popular") in the U.K. (it started there, actually, somewhen between the late 1970s and mid-1980s depending on how you define things), and between Hermione still having some light connections to the U.K. and France being just across the Channel, I figured it was plausible that Hermione would know what a goth was.

(If anyone has hard data on France, though, that'd be much appreciated)
