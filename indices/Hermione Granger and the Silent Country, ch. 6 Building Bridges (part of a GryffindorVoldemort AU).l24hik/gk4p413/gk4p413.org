  he invariably handed it off to the black dog that lay at his feet
#+end_quote

Is that...

#+begin_quote
  In a corner of the Great Hall was a house-elf, dressed in a bright motley of clothing and carrying a jeweled casket.
#+end_quote

Dammit, Riddle, stop making me like you.

#+begin_quote
  anyone whose conduct brings shame on themselves will besmirch the reputation of us all, and be remembered with disdain by each of our schools
#+end_quote

Hmm. Refusal to participate obviously falls into this category; I wonder what else would. With that duel we witnessed, I don't think "fighting dirty" would qualify.

#+begin_quote
  disqualification will mean expulsion
#+end_quote

Welp. Hermione's definitely participating.

#+begin_quote
  Unobscured by student bodies, the Goblet of Fire flickered white-blue and the flames rose high, reminding her of Peregrine Derrick's body and the torture---the sheer damage that Haywood had inflicted on him. Even when she turned away, nose deep in Hogwarts: A History, she could hear crackling of the fire, and though she had to be imagining it, Hermione could even smell the burnt-meat charcoal-and-sulfur of the arena stage.

  The prospect of eating in the Great Hall was frankly unappetizing, and would be for as long as the Goblet of Fire remained there
#+end_quote

Come on, Hermione, /talk/ to someone about it. This is not healthy. Trust Fleur. Trust Maxime.

#+begin_quote
  Wolfsbane Potion was made freely available to any werewolves to wanted it, and for those who didn't, monthly portkeys were created to send them to “island reserves,” stocked with game and forbidden even to many members of the Ministry. Aristocratic estates---including Malfoy Manor---were seized. The Muggle-born Protection Act was enacted, and the first abduction-adoptions were carried out almost before the ink had dried.

  The Wizengamot hadn't neglected the goblins amid all this. Most relevantly to Hermione's current topic of research, Riddle had overseen the Chattels and Remainders Law, which provided that the laws of the goblin Redeguild would retroactively take precedence in all economic dealings with goblins and wizards.
#+end_quote

Dammit, Riddle, *stop making me like you.* Even in a paragraph with "abduction-adoptions," it's hard not to like you.

#+begin_quote
  Unbidden, Hermione's mind conjured visions of the duel, and Haywood standing triumphant
#+end_quote

In the nicest possible way, Hermione: GET HELP.

#+begin_quote
  Her father worked as some sort of freelance handiwzard
#+end_quote

That seems reasonable, given his talents (though there's a missing 'i' in "handiwizard"). I wonder why he isn't working at his old job. Fewer people pranking Muggles, less enforcement of the same, or a dislike for Riddle? Given Ron's tirade about Bill, probably the third of those.

#+begin_quote
  Her eldest brother, Bill, was a Curse-Breaker at Gringotts Bank
#+end_quote

Sounds legit.

#+begin_quote
  Charlie, whom Hermione had seen sitting at the High Table during meals, was the assistant professor for Care of Magical Creatures
#+end_quote

I can see that. I imagine he'll be just as thrilled as Hagrid was if the dragons show up.

#+begin_quote
  And Percy, the first of the Slytherin Weasleys, had joined up with the Department of International Magical Cooperation
#+end_quote

No big surprise there, except maybe that he isn't a new-style Gryffindor, since he's working for the Ministry. Although maybe that's the point. Canon Percy was sorted into Gryffindor, despite seemingly being more suited for Slytherin, possibly due to his parents' prejudices; maybe the reverse is true here.

#+begin_quote
  “That's Padfoot, the headmaster's dog,”
#+end_quote

IT IS!

#+begin_quote
  At least cats kept themselves clean.
#+end_quote

I wonder what happened to Crookshanks in this timeline.

#+begin_quote
  “He teaches two classes. It helps that they're both electives, and that Werewolf Studies combines all four houses, but he still spends more time teaching than anyone else, and he's the Gryffindors' Head of House, and he's out of commission for a couple days every time there's a full moon.”
#+end_quote

Was the second class a deliberate omission?

#+begin_quote
  “I just said the Ministry isn't---At least Percy isn't dating a Death Eater!” Ron said, close to shouting.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that tracks with Bill working for Gringotts.

#+begin_quote
  “Sometimes there's no other way to head off an argument, you see?”

  Fred drew his wand back for a moment. “And I'm Vice-President Also Fred Weasley, but you can call me ‘Al!'”
#+end_quote

It's nice to see that some things remain consistent across all possible timelines.

#+begin_quote
  “You don't know this because it happened after he killed you, but eight years after your duel, Mulciber was accused of...improprieties with his house-elf.”
#+end_quote

Did... Did George just make that up? That does not seem like it adheres to the spirit of the rules of Portrait Club.

#+begin_quote
  “You had seven, Thaddeus, and you transfigured them into hedgehogs!”
#+end_quote

Ooooof. I imagine this might have been a lot more fun if it weren't so one-sided.

#+begin_quote
  Poliakoff and Viktor had never really stopped talking, but now they brought Hermione into it. “Her...mee-oh---” Viktor started, and Poliakoff punched him lightly in the shoulder and whispered something. “My? My. Her-my...oh-nee?” he said and, when no second punch came, he repeated it with more confidence. “Hermione?”
#+end_quote

D'aww.

#+begin_quote
  Madame Maxime---disappointed. Professor McGonagall---”I told you so.” Fleur---sad, shocked.
#+end_quote

And, then, of course, Fleur enters the tournament.

The next chapter ought to be good; we pretty much know who the three champions are (unless there's a twist coming), but will there be a fourth?
