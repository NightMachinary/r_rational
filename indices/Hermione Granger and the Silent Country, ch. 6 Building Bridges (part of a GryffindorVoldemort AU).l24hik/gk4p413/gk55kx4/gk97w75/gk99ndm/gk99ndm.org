  I don't remember that being covered in a previous story, so I'm guessing we'll get more details on that later?

Yep! It happened after Riddle took over, if that helps your speculation in the meantime. >:]

Re both that /and/ Bill/Charlie/Percy, I'll definitely have those on my list of edits during this brief hiatus.

  If there really were points that Thurkell could have scored to salvage his dignity at the expense of Mulciber's

Oh, in that sense, it really was one-sided. The allegations were (probably) false and Thurkell knew nothing about them because he died before they came to light.

(On the other hand, they did know of each other before then, so Thurkell might be able to scrape together some "evidence" on the fly, which would probably make the scene better. I'll have to think about that.)
