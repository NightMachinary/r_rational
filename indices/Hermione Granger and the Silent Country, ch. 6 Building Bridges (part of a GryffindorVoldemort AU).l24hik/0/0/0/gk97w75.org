  Arthur...ran into some trouble a few years ago.

Iiiinteresting. I don't remember that being covered in a previous story, so I'm guessing we'll get more details on that later?

  To clarify: Ron's actually mad about Charlie (who works directly for Riddle, as an assistant professor). Ginny brings up Bill because he's "making something of himself" without working for the (Riddle-linked) Ministry.

Ah. That makes the “Not the whole family” thing make more sense, if Ginny is referring to Charlie (who works at the school and could therefore join them) and Ron is pretending she isn't. But, it wasn't obvious; my instinct from canon was, at first, that Ron was mad at *Percy*, but that went out the window with the "Death Eater" line, so I had to go back to try to figure it out.

  George was just prepared.

In that case, you might want to make that clearer. There's the allegation, Thurkell pouncing on that bit of gossip, the denial, and then the rest of the show we saw was almost entirely a one-sided beat-down of Thurkell by Mulciber, with the fact that the former resorted to violence to try to win the argument only reinforcing that impression. If there really were points that Thurkell could have scored to salvage his dignity at the expense of Mulciber's, it would have made it more interesting (IMHO).
