I'd remove the ability to share experiences between people.

Most people would agree that a rose and a stop sign are similar colors, and that grass is different. A red-green colorblind person wouldn't, though. My idea is to give each person a /unique/ form of magical-color-blindness across all axes of analysis so that communicating the properties of the phenomena becomes impossible beyond "the beam that Bob creates".
