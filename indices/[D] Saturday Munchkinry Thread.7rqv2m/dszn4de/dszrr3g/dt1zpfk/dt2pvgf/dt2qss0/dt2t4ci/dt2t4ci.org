  But then they'd still all see the gold ring afterwards?

Yes. All mundane effects (such as an iron ingot or a gold ring sitting on a desk) would be unaffected.

  That doesn't seems like it would enough to keep the workings of magic a secret.

You would know that Bob can transform iron into gold, but wouldn't have any idea of how to start reverse-engineering the spell.

Also, Bob would not be able to /teach/ you how to cast the spell. As a feature I'm adding right now, each person's way of /interacting/ with magic is unique as well. Bob's particular focus is star-based sympathy. He took an element formed by exploding stars (iron) in the shape representing merging (a 1x1x2 block) and turned it into an element formed by merging stars (gold) in the shape representing explosions (a ring). Alice /could/ theoretically learn how to cause the same effect (32 Fe -> 4 Au + 18 H2O + 21 O2, maintaining all subatomic particles) but it would be almost impossible and wouldn't benefit from Bob's teaching at all.

At this point I'm basically describing versatile superheroes rather than mages, though.

  You'd have to treat the sensory effects of the spell as a black box, sure, but you still uncover any lawfulness inherent to the process as a whole.

With my addition that each person's magic is unique, "the system as a whole" is mostly one person, which doesn't help advance society very much.
