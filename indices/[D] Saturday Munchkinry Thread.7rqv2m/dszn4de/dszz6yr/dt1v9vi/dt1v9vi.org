I think that would make humans unable to develop, since they wouldn't be able to learn things as a baby, and If you limit the effect more it basically becomes confirmation bias itself and we more or less manage to do science .and what's surprising for one human isn't surprising for another so people would be able to notice the effect, and try very hard to do science anyway.
