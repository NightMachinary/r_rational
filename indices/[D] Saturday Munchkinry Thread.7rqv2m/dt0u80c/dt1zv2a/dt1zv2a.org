you know there is a thread in the xkcd forums whith the same premise and people there reached absurdly bigger numbers , until Eliezer came and broke the competition whith his.I didnt se this in time but i would have just did basically the same thing as eliezers numbe and liked to the article in the gogology wiki([[http://googology.wikia.com/wiki/Yudkowsky%27s_Number]]) .As far as I can tell that's not against the rules.,since it wouldnt be looking into other people's answers to this competition , and is basilly the same as using something like a mere akerman function , or xkcd number.
