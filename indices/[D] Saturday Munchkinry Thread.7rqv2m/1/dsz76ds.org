*Edit:* I've declared winners in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7rqv2m/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dt0u80c/?st=jcp714il&sh=fba47f48][another top-level comment]].

Alright, let's have some fun! You have 10 characters in which to express the largest finite number you can think of, and 100 characters to explain your notation. The winner is the person who writes the largest number. [[https://www.lettercount.com/][Here is a website]] that counts characters, for your convenience.

Rules:

- Put your number and explanation in spoiler tags.

- Do not read other peoples' answers until you have answered, unless you are not participating. No retroactively changing your answers. Do not discuss people's answers unless you enclose the discussion in spoiler tags.

- Your number must be expressed via a computable function (or a composition of computable functions, which is a computable function). So Busy Beaver function is cheating. For non-mathematicians, if you're scared by "computable function," note that almost any well-defined function you are likely to think of will be a computable function. This includes the standard multiplication operator, exponentiation operator, etc. The wikipedia page will probably tell you if something is not computable.

- *Edit:* ASCII character strings only

- You may use any pre-existing notation, constant, operator, or computable function, as long as it has a wikipedia page. In your 100-character explanation, link to the wikipedia pages of all pre-existing functions/notations/constants used. Links do not count towards character count. If you devise your own notation/function/whatever, it must be fully explained in your 100-character explanation.

- No max/min/inf/sup or other optimization operators, unless these things are embedded in a known computable function with a wikipedia page. No self-reference or meta-level tomfoolery; e.g., no saying things like "Consider the set of all 10-character ASCII strings which express computable functions..." No referencing other people's numbers and saying "That person's number plus 1."

- There is no explicit constraint on the format of your 10-character string or your explanation. You can write something like "F(G(4))" in your string, and in your explanation, write, "F is the sine function, G is the cosine function." The implicit constraint is that your function/number must be well-defined, and a reasonably competent English-speaking mathematician who is already familiar with the concepts you are referencing should be able to figure out precisely what you mean from your string and your explanation, /without/ having to follow the wikipedia links (to rule out explanations made out of single-character links that only make sense after looking at the link). You can save characters by removing parentheses and spaces, for example.

- Full example: [[#s][Number]], Character count: 3, [[#s][Explanation]], character count: 29. Since I have no idea how to put working links in spoiler tags, I guess just make links as you would normally, but the '[](...)' part doesn't count toward character count? Also, if the functions are obvious like sin/cosin, I guess it is okay to omit the link. Please list your character count separately somewhere, for convenience.

- Since there may be specific cases I missed, I will judge by the spirit, not the letter, of the law. If you have found an extremely clever way to munchkin these rules, I may let it pass, but do this at your own risk.

- [Optional but strongly encouraged]: Please record your level of mathematical education, so that it is possible later to give separate accolades to the mathematicians vs. non-mathematicians, if this seems necessary. Mathematicians will have a significant advantage.

The window to respond closes within 24 hours of when this comment was posted. I will edit this comment with the winner(s). This post is kind of an experiment to see if this works. It could just turn out that whoever has the most obscure knowledge of mathematical operators will win. To be honest, for some of the larger numbers I have no idea whether judging which one is larger will even be possible. I will probably need assistance (feel free to post comments with spoiler-tagged commentary; just mark the commentary clearly as such).

If this is popular, we can do it again in the future (presumably after ironing out the bugs discovered in this run).

((I would post this as its own discussion thread, but I am not sure if the moderators would consider it topical enough to rational fiction.))
