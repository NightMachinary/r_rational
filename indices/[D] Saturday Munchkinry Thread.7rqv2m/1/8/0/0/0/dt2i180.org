No need for spoiler tags anymore, since the competition is over. So by the standard definition of a function, the output cannot change on different runs of the same input. A function is a set of ordered pairs, and a set is a fixed object. I take it you are thinking of a function as a "computational process" that may or may not involve randomness, but that is not what is normally meant in mathematics. (The "computability" condition means that there must indeed be some associated computational process, but that process must not give randomly varying answers). The number you specify must be "well-defined" in the sense that any number with the properties you describe must be the same number. Since there is more than one possible number, well-definedness does not hold here.
