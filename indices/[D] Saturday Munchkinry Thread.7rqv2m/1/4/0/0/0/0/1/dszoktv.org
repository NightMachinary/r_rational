Well, maybe I'll add a rule like that in a future run of this challenge. But this time, if someone's answer is unclear, I may ask them to revise their answer or give a short proof of well defined-ness. I don't know if the function you have given is well-defined. Assuming it is well-defined, I'm pretty sure it is still utterly swamped by the other available functions for producing large numbers.
