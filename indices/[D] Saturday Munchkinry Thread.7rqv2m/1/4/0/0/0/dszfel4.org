"Known" means that someone has previously given it an exact definition on a wikipedia page. If you create your own function, that's fine, but there must be enough information in your explanation to define it, within the rules (no min/max in your explanation). Creating your own wiki pages violates the spirit of the law. Unless it is a high-quality public page with citations that is potentially interesting to people and not taken down after, say, a week. I would be impressed if you did that.
