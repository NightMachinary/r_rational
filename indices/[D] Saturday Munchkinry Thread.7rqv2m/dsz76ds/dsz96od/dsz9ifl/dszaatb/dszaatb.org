GCSEs are prepared for from the ages of 14-16, done at the end of the summer of the last of the two years. AS level is in the 16-17 school year, the exam done in the summer. There is one more year of school in which you do A-levels, which are just an extension of AS-levels.

This system is used in the UK, although I think that AS-levels are being phased out everywhere except Northern Ireland.
