Oh okay. I'm still trying to munchkin this, because there's no way in hell I can beat the mathematicians by playing this straight.

  No max/min/inf/sup or other optimization operators, unless these things are embedded in a known computable function with a wikipedia page.

Define "known computable function". If I create a computable function, I clearly know it. So it is a computable function that is known (by me)! /Creates wiki page for created function, with arbitrarily many characters and optimization operators to explain it./

Wait this totally violates the spirit of the law doesn't it x_X.

Uuu...
