CHALLENGE ACCEP- no no no I wish lol.

Ok I still haven't found a way to munchkin, but I just thought of another rule you should add: the player must know how to express their answer using basic math. It can be an arbitrarily long equation, like 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 ... for 3^{3^{3^{3}}} trillion more characters, but the player must somehow show that they know how to express it that way.

Otherwise players can give you all kinds of horrible answers that they don't know the actual values of, like this one:

[[#s][number]]

[[#s][explanation]]

[[#s][commentary]]
