I intended the ASCII constraint to apply to everything, but that doesn't matter much for [[/u/GaBeRockKing]]'s idea. Using unicode just allows for a bit more compression of concepts.

Anyway, I don't think adding arbitrary accents works anyway. The problem is that I'm not going to bother counting the accents after about 10, so you're going to have to just write the number of accents next to the character, and at that point you might as well just use ascii.
