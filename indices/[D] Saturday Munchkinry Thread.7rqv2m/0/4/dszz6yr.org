One simple way to do this is to screw around with confirmation bias. Apply an innate magic debuff on the entire world, that makes it hard for sapients to recall or observe phenomena that they do not expect.

Since this only affects their minds, our technology and our laws of physics are preserved just fine. The scientific method however, is shot to hell, since we wouldn't be able to properly perform experiments. Every experimenter, even a double-blinded one, has some expectations about how an experiment will end up. Those expectations will mess with his ability to observe and recall the actual experimental results, heavily skewing them towards what he was expecting. Scientists would be drowning in false positives and false negatives, making it utterly hellish to advance using the scientific method. You would still be able to advance science via theoretical calculations, but that only lets you go so far with respect to advancing the world technology.
