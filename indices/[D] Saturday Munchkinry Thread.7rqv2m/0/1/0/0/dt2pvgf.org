The sensory scrambler I'm thinking of would only apply to magic.

As an example, imagine that Bob casts a transformation spell turning an iron ingot into a gold ring. Alice would "see" a reddish beam shoot from his hand. Barry would "see" a ghostly glow in the shape of a ring. Carol would "hear" a C-major triad. Donald would "smell" the overpowering scent of lavender. Evan couldn't detect anything magical.
