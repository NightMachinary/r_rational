I think that's pretty much the limit of it. It'd have to be something where the cornerstone of the world would run on amnesia, randomness or a mix thereof. I think any consistent system where data is allowed to accumulate would be figured out so it either needs to be inconsistent or data needs to not be allowed to accumulate.

The former can be accomplished through randomness, the latter through either memory wipes or memory limits (e.g restrictions on book permanency).

Or you can just brute force it by giving the bad guys superpowers--make an anti scientific method sect and give them superpowers and favors based on how much global scientific literacy there is. Then give anyone who uses the scientific method leprosy, with burning letters in the sky that point to them and say "I'm a terrible god who forbids doing things like this, so don't".
