You are in the right track of trying to find a way to add layers o recursions,instead of making the thing bgger which only makes thigs look bigger to people . You can try yourself but if you just want to know how to continue ,there is a long thread in the xkcd forums whith a competition like this and people found ways to reach so munch further that that that your number of layers of recursions is basically 0 in comparison."Just" recursively get more layers of recursion wont even approach you to the medium sized numbers of the xkcd thread, let alone to the winner.
