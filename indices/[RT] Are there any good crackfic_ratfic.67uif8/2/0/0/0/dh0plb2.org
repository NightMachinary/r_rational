  From his perspective, it is though.

From any protagonist's perspective their decisions are rational, unless they're making excuses for them. Twilight isn't made rational by that argument, so neither is Harry Potter and the Natural 20.

  he guesses things correctly more often than you'd think.

Guessing doesn't matter. Any decisions he makes on the supposition that the world is a story that turn out to be true are happenstance and coincidence; more of the decisions he makes under that supposition turn out to be wrong than correct, anyways. I think the biggest thing that disqualifies it from being rational fiction is that, for the most part, the story doesn't have long-term consequences for mistakes being made. It's hard to remember those mistakes even exist, because they're relatively small in comparison.

Not like it matters; not everything needs to be rational, particularly not comedy. Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is great and hilarious, at least in part because Milo's decisions are at odds with what the readers know about the world of Harry Potter.
