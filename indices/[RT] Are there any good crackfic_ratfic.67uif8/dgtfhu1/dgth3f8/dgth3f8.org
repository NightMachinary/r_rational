A crackfic is, essentially, a piece of fiction (usually fanfiction) on crack. It's difficult to define beyond that, besides generally being humorous, but the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackFic][TVTropes page]] does a decent job.

If you've read Worm, I'd highly recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-techno-queen-iii.311201/][THE TECHNO QUEEN */krakathoom/*]] as an introduction to the genre.
