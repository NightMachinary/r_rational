My interpretation of the spirit of the question is more "is there any fiction that is a surreal satire of rational fiction tropes?"

Or possibly "is there any fiction that mashes setting-elements from disparate settings together incoherently like an inexperienced 12-year-old of an author is wont to do, and then attempts to thread a character through that setting, that---while possibly 'rational' under scrutiny---is also still performing the sorts of acts an inexperienced 12-year-old author would have a character perform."

My own simple take on this would be to imagine a rational character having semi-lucid dreams, with "their" actions being rational, while "the dream-world's" actions are surreal and silly---and where "the dream-world's actions" also includes controlling them sometimes, in the same way a DM can dictate what a player does sometimes.
