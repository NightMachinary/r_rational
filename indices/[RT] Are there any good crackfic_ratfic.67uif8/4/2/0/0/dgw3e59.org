That's what I was assuming, which is why I was extremely surprised when you said it will probably be received as a crack fic. (I guess I usually associate the term "crack fic" with silly, goofy humor.) And just to clarify, I meant soul-crushing in the sense that the happy ending we got in HPMOR was a trick, and HJPEV is actually in a much worse position than he was ever in during canon HPMOR ... well, I mean, he's basically in the same position of being completely at Voldemort's mercy, plus the emotional whiplash of "Just kidding, Hermione's still dead!", plus Voldemort can read his mind so he apparently can't even out-think him.

Anyway. I'm still eagerly awaiting more. You are awesome.
