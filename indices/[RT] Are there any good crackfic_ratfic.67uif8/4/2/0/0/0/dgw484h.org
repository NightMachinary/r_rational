Thank you :D

If you look at [[https://goinswriter.com/how-to-write-a-book/][this link]], what you've read so far is basically "draft 3." I've gone back and done a few more "draft 2"s, and at this point I have one that I feel comfortable taking back to "draft 3" status. I'm pretty sure I'll have something I'm comfortable calling "finalized" ready by June 1st.
