  TV Tropes says a crack fic is any story whose premise and events would be completely implausible in Canon. Fanlore dot org says crack has a fundamentally ludicrous premise, or otherwise includes a plethora of unbelievable, incredible, or just plain silly elements. I don't see anything about any of that which contradicts the characteristics of either rational fiction or rationalist fiction listed in the sidebar.

However, in a "rational" story, the "fundamentally ludicrous premise" would have to be extended backward throughout the entire setting, rather than merely appearing from thin air at the start of the story. This would entail a large amount of work for the author--and what if the "fundamentally ludicrous premise" turns out to be totally incompatible with anything remotely resembling canon?
