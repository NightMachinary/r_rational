That really depends on which definitions you're using for "crack fic" and "rational fic."

TV Tropes says a crack fic is any story whose premise and events would be completely implausible in Canon. Fanlore dot org says crack has a fundamentally ludicrous premise, or otherwise includes a plethora of unbelievable, incredible, or just plain silly elements. I don't see anything about any of that which contradicts the characteristics of either rational fiction or rationalist fiction listed in the sidebar.

From what I've seen, I think having at least Level 2 Intelligent characters (preferably Level 3) pretty much automatically qualifies a story as rational fiction, and nothing about a ludicrous premise precludes those characters from reacting rationally to said premise. In theory, there should be nothing preventing a rational!crackfic, though I don't think a fic has been written yet which /actually/ meets /both/ standards (and yes, I've read the other comments in this thread; HP and the Natural 20 isn't really crack, and Seventh Horcrux isn't rational, and the parodies were /pure/ crack (also, parodies don't automatically inherit the title of "rational" just because they happen to be parodies of something rational)).

I think you have to be /really/ intent on "showcasing 'rationality'" in order to write rationalist fiction, and I don't think that mindset is likely to decide a crack fic is the best way to go about accomplishing that goal. I think it's unlikely that there will ever be such thing as a rationalist!crackfic unless someone takes it as a challenge and decides to do it just for the sake of seeing if it can be done.

If you're truly interested in rational!crackfic, you might want to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11616203/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Irrational-Odyssey][watch this space]]. There's a rough draft of the first half of the first chapter acting as a placeholder there at the moment, but it'll be replaced by the real deal before June 1st. I didn't initially conceive of it as a crack fic, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be received as such.

For what it's worth, I prefer to think of it as a rational!candyflippingfic.
