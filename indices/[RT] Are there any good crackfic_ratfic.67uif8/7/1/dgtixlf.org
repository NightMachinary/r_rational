Humour-based stories that rely on absurd interpretations of characters/events to generate comedy. Done well, they can be amazing (see e.g. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/][Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies]] as well as some of Emerald Ashes' other stories).
