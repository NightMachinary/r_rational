Not strictly about romance, but [[http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1][El Goonish Shive]] is an anime-inspired teen dramedy that has had several really good romantic arcs. The webcomic is rational...after the first 180 pages when the author retcons all the stupid stuff into making sense, puts an increased focus on character development, and starts getting more creative with the plot.

This is my favorite webcomic, by far, and is the standard by which I measure all teen dramas against. The characters are very intelligent and talk to each other about the problems they're having even when it's awkward. When they don't, things go wrong and they learn from their mistakes.
