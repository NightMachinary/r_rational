Suggested reading: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5623923/1/The-Paladin-Protocol][/The Paladin Protocol/]], which might have redeemed /Big Bang Theory/ if it didn't contrast so sharply with the original.

And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][/A Cadmean Victory/]] is a really good take on Harry Potter as a darkish romance with more mature and independent characters. [[#s][ending]] Highly recommended.
