  I'm sort of still looking forward to a rational fiction that actually contains romance in a good and meaningful way?

- I'm not sure if it's rational, but OP brought up Unsong, which features a major romance and a love triangle.
- Twig /is/ rational, practically rational/ist/ at times, and also features romantic themes (I think they grow as the story develops, I'm only partway through.
- Yudkowsky's [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/post/151225261055/the-empress-and-the-rebel][fic]] he linked below I guess
- You could stretch "rational" to include /El Goonish Shive/, /Pride and Prejudice/, or an assortment of fanfics others have linked in this thread. I'd add the Culture novels that feature romance (mainly /Consider Phlebas/, /Look to Windward/ and /Excession/ I guess) to the not-quite-rational-but-pretty-close list.
