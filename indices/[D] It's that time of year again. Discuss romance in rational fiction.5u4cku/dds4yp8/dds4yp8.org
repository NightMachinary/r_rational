Most valuable lessons on romance I have ever learned:

- Jealousy is an emotion just like rage. Everyone can learn self-control and how to appropriately express feelings instead of blowing up and making horrible mistakes.

- Talk. Don't assume your partner is psychic and can deduce your intentions from body language and signals alone.

- Relationships are a two-way street. Both individuals should be taking the time to be proactive. Come up with ideas of what to do or how to have fun. Neither person should be passive or doing all of the work. The only exception is possibly the 'courting' phase when someone first asks another out on the first date. But even then it's better if the chase√© contributes in some way as well.

- Relationships are a commitment. Take the time to show/express your love for your partner and regularly spend time to enjoy each others company.

- Have a neutral party. If you have someone else not involved with the partner such as a friend or a family member, they can listen to your opinions on the partner and help you to understand/work out any issues you may be having. This way by having a neutral area, any frustrations can be worked out without having to hurt your partner's feelings. Venting and gossiping about your partner is surprising helpful in bringing subtle cues to the attention of the conscious mind.

- Be novel. Relationships can stagnate if both individuals fall into a routine. Not to say routines are a bad thing, but the best way to shake things up is to do something new and different on a regular basis. Learn a new skill together, travel to a new place, or just pop a random surprise on your partner.

What does all of this have to do with rational fiction? Everything that can be used to cultivate a mature and healthy relationship can be used to demonstrate the same thing in your characters!
