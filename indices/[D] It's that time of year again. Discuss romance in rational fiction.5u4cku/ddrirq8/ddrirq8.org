Ha! I'm currently writing a rational supernatural romance story. I'm not sure if it's going to be considered Good, and I'm not an experienced author or anything so it probably won't be, but I think rational fiction is such a broad category that we should try and get all the genres in there. I've noticed a tendency for rational stories to tend to involve genres or settings that you can munchkin (superheroes, sci-fi, fantasy) rather than stuff that's more "mundane".

Like, could someone write a rational buddy cop story? No reason why not. I'd like to see it!

Moreover, I think the demographic that tends to be here right now is "CFAR MIRI Eliezer Yudkowsky Fanboy" type stereotype, and that stereotype demographic tends to like stuff like Animorphs and not like stuff like The Babysitter's Club. And I think it's kind of a feedback loop - people see the sort of stuff that's posted here and write more of the same.

Aaaand now I'm wondering how to make a rational Babysitter's Club fanfic.
