My story is not uploaded anywhere official, though I'm soliciting feedback from beta readers at the moment, if you would like to help me out with that I'd be really grateful!

It's at about 30k words and the first "volume" is nearly finished (some MAJOR scenes are missing though!). I'm in that editing stage where everything needs to be kind of ripped apart and put back together so I'm not sure it's in the best place for "enjoyable reading material". I will post it on this sub one chapter at a time when the first volume is finished though!
