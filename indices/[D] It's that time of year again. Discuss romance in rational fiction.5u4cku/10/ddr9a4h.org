This is a parent's love for his child, not a person's love for his romantic partner--but it occurs to me that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715/51][this chapter]] (through "And she never disappointed.") in /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][In the Blood]]/ (my second-favorite Naruto story, after /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/) /definitely/ is among the most moving depictions of loving relationships that I've read. Have you (plural) seen any similar romances involving partners who so /thoroughly/ appreciate each other's awesomeness?

  "And our weaknesses?"

  "None, if we train hard enough."

Phew! It's as pulse-pounding as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/22]["I am /Sakura's aspect of light/... and your eyes have no power over me."]] in /Time Braid/.
