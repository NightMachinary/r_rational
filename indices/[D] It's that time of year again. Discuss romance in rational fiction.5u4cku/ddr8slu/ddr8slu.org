I like HPMOR's insistence on "it doesn't have to be about that."

While His Dark Materials is not a rational series at all, its take on the romance at the end was outstanding, especially the way it forced a sort of ... cascading reinterpretation? ... of the previous two books.

I'm sort of still looking forward to a rational fiction that /actually/ contains romance in a good and meaningful way? I haven't read All The Things, but most of the romances seem either perfunctory or unrealistic or Sue-esque, probably because they're often not at all the important thing going on.
