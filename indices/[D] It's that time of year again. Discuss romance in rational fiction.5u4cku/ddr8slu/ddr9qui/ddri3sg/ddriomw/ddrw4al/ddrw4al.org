I think he was trying to say that there is literally 0 romance in HPMOR. Even if EY intended it to be romantic, it just isn't. There are two prepubescent kids, brought together by isolation. There is no love, no attraction, absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.

There are a few plot points where everyone else wants them to be in love, but that's not a romance subplot in my opinion.
