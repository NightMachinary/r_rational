Spoilers All

Well, as a point of fact, Hermione /does/ develop a legit crush on Harry in the latter half of the story, hormones and everything. That initial first date was pretty much just her following a social script since a romance sounded cool and exciting to her, but it did develop to be real as she entered puberty. Harry isn't yet at the point where he is physically capable of returning those feelings, if he ever does, but I'd put it down as "very plausible".

But yeah, wouldn't call that a romance per se.
