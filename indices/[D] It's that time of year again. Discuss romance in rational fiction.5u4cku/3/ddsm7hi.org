What I want is difficult, but it isn't complicated; I want romance stories that aren't driven by the characters being cognitively inadequate, emotionally immature, or failing to communicate, including the characters' failure to deduce information that the reader could reasonably deduce in their place.

Come to think, I guess that's why /Komarr/ and /Paladin of Souls/ are the only romantic plots/subplots I can remember liking.
