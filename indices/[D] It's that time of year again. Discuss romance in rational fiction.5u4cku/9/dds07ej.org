I really liked [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/234937/fractured-sunlight][Fractured Sunlight]]. Fair warning, it's an MLP fic.

Without major spoilers, there was one scene especially that convinced me to post it here. The morning after officially starting a relationship, one character thinks she might not need her meds anymore because she's happy and in a relationship and that's how love is supposed to work. Her second thought is that that's really stupid and she takes her meds, thus heading off a long and annoying potential arc of dealing with her off her meds.

In general it's well written and conflict tends to be due to actual trauma or values conflicts rather than misunderstandings.
