I'm not sure that Heiress is an exclusively Villain role - It's a transitional name like Squire, and could quite easily fit within a Heroic story.

Then again, we've only known two Heir/esses and they were both Villians (But we've also only known 2 proper Squires, and we know that it can lead into White Knight as easily as Black - We're working with very small sample sizes)
