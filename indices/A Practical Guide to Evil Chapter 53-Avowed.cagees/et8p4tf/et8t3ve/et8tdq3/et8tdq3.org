It looks like Tyrant took them by surprise on the way out I mean we saw him leave but we haven't seen his army in response to the changes shown. It's especially noticeable when we have seen the Callow, Procer and Dominion Armies doing the thing so it somewhat follows that the plot would then move to the army we haven't had the viewpoint shown.

I'm not sure if the Squire name is up for grabs considering how convuluted its relationship with Cat is currently, we know that there was a broken transition at the end of book three and while she's definitely not the Squire right now, there isn't a lot to suggest that the reappearance of a Name is as fast enough to be relevant to our current situation. At the same time we've heard that the Chancellor name was coming up enough that Black and the other Calamities putting them down was notable so i dunno. I mean if we're putting other Names up for grabs we have to also put like Warlock, any of the Good Names of dead Heroes, whatever Hunter was, Captain, Cursed, Heiress i think? and Thief.
