People kept going for Chancellor /because/ the Calamities were trying to censor the Name out of existence (somewhat similarly to how Amadeus putting down Heroes preemptively led to them coming out too quickly for him to keep up, at least until his scheme to stop Callowan Heros came to fruition and put an end to it).

 

We aren't going to see a Squire for a generation. No "White Knight" Squire will come up until Hanno starts looking for a replacement (which he won't do in the middle of a war vs the Dead King) or dies. No "Black Knight" Squire will pop up partially because Amadeus and Cat have a thorny relationship with the Name at the moment but also because the "Black Night" Squire also has a clear relationship with the Heir/Heiress Name. And the Heir/Heiress Name itself won't show up not only because it has its own problematic claimant still extant in Akua, but because the Sahelians themselves are in no position to churn out another Name given that the losses from and the effort needed to clean up the clusterfuck that was the fall of Tasia were and are so great they aren't a political entity even now as Praes is coming apart at the seams.

 

While the Heiress/Heir doesn't have to be a Sahelian, the Name clearly has a significant relationship with that line. Akua herself, of course, but also the previous Heir (Ime owes Amadeus because he spared her [after she turned] when going after the Heir and his line, the Sahelians). And I strongly suspect that Subria Sahelian was herself Heiress before she deposed Dread Empress Maleficent. (Indeed generations of Praes became heirs and heiresses to the line and philosophy the crystalized on her ascension- "Iron sharpens Iron.")
