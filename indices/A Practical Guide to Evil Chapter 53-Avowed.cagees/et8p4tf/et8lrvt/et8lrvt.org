You know sometimes i feel like it's too easy to forget the remarks that can come so offhand "the errant participates that took their freedom by force" it makes a lot of sense that they would be of such a martial bent. That they would be willing to as a band of heroes would have been to bend in the face of a greater need. I mean on the one hand that was Grey Pilgrim to a hilt wasn't it? To make the sacrifices for the greater good? And haven't we been told that he follows in the Name and name of the one who founded their nation?
