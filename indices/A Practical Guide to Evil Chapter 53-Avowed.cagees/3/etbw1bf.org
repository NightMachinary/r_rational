(Prefacing this with the note that I am enjoying PGtE chapters immensely!)

Am I reading this wrong?

​

“COUNT them ALL, IN the SNOW

RED and GOLD and BLACK as NIGHT

COUNT them ALL, HIGH and LOW

SEven CROWNS broKEN by RITE

BROUGHT they FORTH, IN acCORD

PEACE, OATHS AND A SWORD.”

​

Something in my mind is screaming to replace 'broken' with something two-syllabled that has a down-up stress pattern, like 'accord' lower down or 'aflame', yet for 'aflame' the meaning doesn't fit and 'rent'(/cleft) (by rite) is one-syllabled and would break the delicious meter...

​

(Well, if people can make 'FertiLIZED by ClemenTINE' immortal then maybe I'm asking too much of a children's song.)
