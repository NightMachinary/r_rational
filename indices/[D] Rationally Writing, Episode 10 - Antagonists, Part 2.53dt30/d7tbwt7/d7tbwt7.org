All Star Superman had interesting take on themed antagonists. They were misconceptions and wrong takes on Superman. Atlas and Samson were dumb brutes forcing themselves on Lois. Kryptonians were colonizators feeling superior. Black kryptonite Superman was coward without powers, when figthing with stronger enemy. Zimbarro was outcast, couldn't connect with anybody around him.
