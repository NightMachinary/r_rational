I highly recommend all of the above.

Glimwarden is, apart from its fantasy elements, almost painfully believable, which speaks to either thorough research or an unfortunate familiarity with bureaucracy and petty politics. The fantasy elements and characters are also engaging and intriguing. It's one of the serials I read as soon as possible after each update.

Shadows of the Limelight is a very interesting setting. The "superpowers /but.../ tied to your notoreity" aspect makes it very different to the usual superhero fare. At the same time it does a better job of explaining some superhero tropes (e.g. the perpetually escaping villain) than traditional entries in the genre.

Pokemon: TOoS is excellent, though there are so many angles currently being explored in the story that it's hard to say what its eventual theme will be. At present it's a fantastic rationalist take on the Pokemon setting with engaging characters and writing, and has room to grow further.

I could gush about them more, but I think this should be enough.
