I've just read the first four chapters of Shadows and the problem I have with it is that the characters are almost completely defined by the roles they play, which makes them boring since they don't have any personality below the surface. It's like watching a reality show from behind the scenes, how do you write a compelling narrative when your story is about people who create false narratives out of their lives?
