Welcome back everyone! Today we explore how to match antagonists against protagonists, how villains should push heroes, and other ways to structure compelling antagonists and conflicts.

Also, if you'd like, stay tuned until the end for our first advertisement, which doubles as a book recommendation. It's after the outro music because we'd like to try to keep them unobtrusive, but we'll also be recommending a different book every episode to try to keep them interesting.

Thanks for listening, and all feedback welcome!
