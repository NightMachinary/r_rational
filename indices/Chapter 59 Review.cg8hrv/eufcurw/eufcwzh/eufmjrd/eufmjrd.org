I'm guessing she plans to kill the highborn. She knows a concerted effort by Amadeus would see her dethroned, so her best route to maintaining her reign is getting him back on-side. The best way to do that is probably to fulfill Amadeus' old dream of killing all the highborn. Furthermore, right now the highborn are in a rough place. Several cities have fallen with all their nobles slaughtered, and they all know they're probably safer in Ater, as far from the lines as possible. Even those who don't trust her won't expect ruthless mass betrayal, given that hasn't been her style and mass execution was always in Black's wheelhouse. If she invites them all for a special session of court and poisons the wine with something they don't know about and something they do, they'll all come with the expected antidote and die dramatically as Malicia smiles coldly, overseeing the culmination of her best friend's dreams.
