Is it weird that i'm kind of expecting an actual successful betrayal in order to take a position? I mean the closest we've seen upfront was when the guard captain gets knifed by the Scribe all the way back in Conspiracy II. We've seen a number of failures, but it's against my expectations that none of them have been successful.

Also Malicia is probably on the way out just from current losses, especially considering she's lost most if not all her Named support at this point. It stands to reason that a losing Dread Emperor/Empress doesn't stay in power for long. I mean she's lost two cities so far, and Praes have been pretty explicitly said to be unforgiving of any weakness. Do we know which legions are at least nominally under her command at this point?
