Ah, thanks for the clarification. I'm still not sure why Elsa would need to be thawed, so much as her fear-induced mental block removed.

Y'know, the more I think about it, the more the line "Born [with the power] or cursed [with it]?" seems to be the key.

Anna's the protagonist of the film, that's clear, for example the fact that she directs the two young kids' play despite Elsa being older, and generally initiates things throughout. So I got to imagining if rational-Anna had somehow overheard (and remembered or later discovered) that titbit, and realised that some people can /give people powers/...

...she would probably immediately decide to learn to be a witch (or whoever it is who can curse people, can't remember if that's specified).

For me the break-point with canon could happen much earlier; I'm thinking the first time little Anna knocks on Elsa's door, and perhaps doesn't take no for an answer (driven to solve the mystery of Elsa's radically changed behaviour -- noticing she's confused by it). Realising her head's been messed with would likely be a big deal for her (mental privacy and identity being big themes in rational-fic) and, her being a child, I can imagine a "why are they punishing us both when it was an accident?" "But when I fall off my bike Mama says I have to practise so I won't fall any more..." direction of her thoughts. Leading to experimentation.

Anyhow, not to tell you what to write; that's just how my thoughts went while I was mulling the idea over last night. Still some gaps, such as how to make Elsa her own person and not just going along with things.
