The power block isn't even remotely permanent. I was working from the fact that Anna's act of True Love thawed her heart/body /and Elsa's/. If Elsa's power had been the result of a curse, it would have dissolved right then, but since it is a Natural Gift it was simply rattled for a day or two. The story would only take one or two chapters to restore her powers, only this time in a form which doesn't accidentally freeze the entire kingdom's water supply at the touch of a toe.
