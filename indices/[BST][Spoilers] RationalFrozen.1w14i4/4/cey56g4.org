(Slightly off topic) Umm, why do you think pure water is harmful to drink? All I can find on a quick google is that you may need to supplement your mineral supply and that some reverse osmosis units can get (slightly) harmful bacterial growths.

I can't think of any reasons why pure H2O would be worse than almost pure H2O, apart from the mentioned lack of trace minerals which could be made up by dietary supplements.
