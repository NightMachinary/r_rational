Great idea! I have a compulsive desire to rewrite every movie I watch, and /Frozen/ is definitely rife with possibilities for rationality.

Ooh, a deconstructionist fic. I really like your ideas thus far. Are you planning on setting it in the same universe as /Tangled/? Just because that would be kinda cool.

Anyway, looking forward to reading it. If there are already deconstructionist Disneyfics, then I've not seen them; you'd be the first! Awesome!

In case you were wondering, btw, the giant guardian snowman is named Snowflake.
