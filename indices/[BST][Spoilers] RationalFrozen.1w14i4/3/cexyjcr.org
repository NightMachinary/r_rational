God dammit, I'm already writing this. I want to change a bunch of things, most notably Hans turning out to be a villain (as much as it makes the "Love is an Open Door" song delightful to relisten to. "We finish all of each other's--" "Sandwiches!" "That's what I was going to say!" No you weren't.), and address the question of just what the hell were Elsa and Anna doing for ~ten years locked up in a castle and not talking to each other. I also want to put in a lot of the missing elements from the original story the movie is every so loosely based off of. Especially the witch and her flowers and the thief girl with the knife.

Then there's the question of what happens after the movie ending. Elsa's military power is ridiculous, and the other countries would notice. I'd also like for the sisters to learn a Very Important Lesson about why it's a bad idea to cut off trade with another country just because their duke is a jerk.

And of course there's the question of where Elsa's power comes from, which bothered me the whole movie. If they had just said, "An ice fairy blessed her" one minute in it would have been fine, but they don't explain at all.

Anyone else think the movie was overrated? It was good but not great. The songs were fun but forgettable. Elsa was the main character and needed more screen time and more focus on her arc. This is not yet the second Disney renaissance that some people are calling it. Also, the faces for their female leads really bother me. The faces are too wide and the noses too small and pushed down. And the clumpy hair makes me feel ill for some reason.
