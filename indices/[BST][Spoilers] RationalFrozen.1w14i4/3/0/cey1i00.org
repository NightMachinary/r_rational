Since you're both coming at this from a completely different direction, I think there's room for more than one rational exploration of Frozen. And I approve of changing Hans to not be a villain. It really bothered me that the most competent person was the bad guy.

  Anyone else think the movie was overrated? It was good but not great.

It was pretty great, actually but just like every other Disney movie, you can't overthink it too much. Otherwise Aladin becomes a bad movie :-) The animation was amazing, the songs were fun (especially "Do You Want to Build a Snowman" and "Let it Go") and the characters were rather fun. And amazingly Olaf wasn't completely annoying.

The movie did have flaws, but so has nearly every movie. But during my first time watching it, I was emotionally engaged (even tearing up a little), I laughed, I gasped, I was amazed by the cool ice powers... And the story being about sisterly love is another plus.

I guess it depends on how you rate a movie. For me, a movie (or any story, really) is good if I'm emotionally engaged and don't spend too much time questioning it /while/ watching it.
