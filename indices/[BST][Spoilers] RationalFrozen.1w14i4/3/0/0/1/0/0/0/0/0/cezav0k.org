So if you at the sidebar,

#+begin_quote
  The characters are not stupid. No one holds the Idiot Ball (or at least not the main heroes or main villains).
#+end_quote

This is a staple of good writing.

#+begin_quote
  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Maybe if "intelligent" means "abnormally creative, especially in ways that other people find horrifying, because otherwise this is also a staple of good writing. I mean, what's the alternative? A deus ex machina?

#+begin_quote
  The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.
#+end_quote

This is a staple of the mystery and science fiction genres. Hell, people had basically solved the original Harry Potter series, and that's definitely not rationalist fiction.

#+begin_quote
  Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

Another staple of good writing, albeit one that is often discarded.

#+begin_quote
  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

Another staple of good writing.

So it looks like rationalist fiction basically amounts to "Well written science fiction and/or mystery stories." Which is a great genre, but I wouldn't call it particularly rationalist.

What is more likely to make something a rationalist story is that rational behavior and thought, especially as contrasted with irrational behavior and thought, plays a central role in the story. So HPMOR, HPN20 (Milo is saner than anyone), etc. Otherwise rationalist fiction seems to just be any kind of attempt to take a world's rules seriously and have a puzzle-like plot full of intelligent characters. /That's is a great genre/, but it isn't /rationalist./

Rationality (or munchkinry, same thing) should be a primary and the defining component of rationalist fiction. Of course, it takes more than that to be a good story. A story that has all the sidebar's qualities will be a good story, but not necessarily rationalist.
