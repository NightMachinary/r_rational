Good writing /=/ popular writing? How many people have tried to defend /Twilight's/ prose, pacing, characterization, etc?

I think it's weird and slightly unsettling that the definition of rationalist fiction apparently is generally understood such that "rationality" is not a required attribute of "rationalist fiction" but only a "bonus".

Even given the definition on the sidebar, my LoK definitely does not fit these two:

#+begin_quote
  The characters are not stupid.

  The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.
#+end_quote

And pretty sketchy on:

#+begin_quote
  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

So it still wouldn't belong on this reddit even aside from having nothing to do with rationality.
