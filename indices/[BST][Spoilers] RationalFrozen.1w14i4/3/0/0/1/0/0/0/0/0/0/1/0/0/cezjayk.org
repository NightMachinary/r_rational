Certainly, and I don't begrudge the creation of a reddit to fill a niche for smart fiction that makes a fetish of science and intelligence. Not being familiar with the community, I was (and will be in my head) drawing a line between fiction where rationality plays a key role in the story, and fiction that features attributes that simply happen to be popular with a community that calls itself "rationalist."

(This is typical community behavior, and for a guy who studies society, you'd think I'd see things like this coming...but I'm a social scientist, so obviously I can't predict for shit)

But still, while you can do what I want and I certainly shouldn't complain about linking to me fic since there's no point in writing it unless people read it (although I can't claim that it's a /good/ fic), there's very little about it that fits the style, tone, and themes of most stories that get linked to here. I keep reiterating this because it really seems like my LoK fic is a bad fit for this reddit. I only linked to it here in the first place because I wanted some guidance writing a character who needs to get way stronger than she is in canon without starting out that way. But, hey, link to it. It'd be irrational of me to complain....

If you're so desperate from ratfic for me, check out the one I just linked to today, which I think both fits this reddit much better and is also a lot better written.
