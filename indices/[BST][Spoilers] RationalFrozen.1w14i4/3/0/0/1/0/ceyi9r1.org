I guess I just get the feeling that anyone who wants to write basically intelligent or even just non-shit fanfiction is going to call their work rationalist fiction because where the hell else are you going to find a community of people who like intelligent non-shit fanfiction?

Rationalist fiction seems to me to imply more than intelligent characters lacking in idiot balls or a basically internally consistent world where everything that's happening should actually make sense according to consistent rules. These things are just good writing and should show up in stories that in no way aspire to be rationalist fiction.

Rationalist fiction shouldn't even have to contain these qualities in principle. Rationality is the same for stupid people as it is for smart people, after all, and a world that doesn't have exploitable, consistent rules for a rationalist to learn, master, and abuse could still be a rationalist fic. That would be quite the challenge. It's not much proof of one's rationality to pass trials that have already been passed, no?

Basically I would say rationalist fiction consists of rational characters doing things for rational reasons. They shouldn't /need/ to be smart, and the world shouldn't need to be full of dumb for them to point out, exploit, and correct. Although those qualities can make a story much more fun.

So the Korra fic I'm writing, for example, isn't rationalist fic even though it has some smart characters, internally consistent rules, and plenty of world-building because the main characters aren't rational. They're not idiots (well, Korra is), but they'll make all the typical mistakes humans in their situation tend to do, and no one's going to go on a rant about how they're doing everything prectibably wrong. Reversing that last quality seems to me to be what sets rationalist fiction apart from simply stories that don't have idiot balls, or stories that that advance the anti-death worldview, etc. Also I suppose to some extent it's a matter of degree.

In any case, I don't know why everyone's in such a rush to write rationalist fiction. HPMOR's and HP&N20 are made extra-fun by watching rational characters kick ass and teach important lessons, but what really makes this stories work is an engaging plot and characters. Without them, HPMOR would just be a guy trying to teach brain lessons in a fun way, and HP&N20 would just be a guy pointing out how exploitable D&D rules are (which I don't play). I mean, seriously, who wants to write genre fiction, for crying out loud?

Although someone needs to write anti-rationalist fiction where the main character learns about tacit and local knowledge, and, more importantly, learns about the importance of social skills and how in real life, adults aren't going to quietly submit to the sarcastic rants of children. A really rationalist character would treat charisma and social skills as if they're brain-hacking and master them accordingly.
