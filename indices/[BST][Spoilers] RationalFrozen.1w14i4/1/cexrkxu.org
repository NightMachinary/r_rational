This is very interesting and I like the idea of love as an quantifiable effect and further exploration in snow based AI. The main problem I have with the idea is how Elsa's power is disabled.

  This act of sacrificial love thaws Elsa's heart, disabling her magic

It is clearly stated in the movie that it is a gift rather than a curse and that the only reason why the power is a bad thing is that Elsa fears and fights it. I understand if you want to remove the power "at least temporarily" for story purposes but in that case it should be a mental block due to the trauma rather than a "curse lifted" scenario. It also doesn't fit with the fact that Elsa's heart "froze" due to isolation, trauma and stress and it was quite "thawed" when the sisters were children even though she had her magic then.

Another idea is that the snow golems could have some kind of core made of ice and magic that works as a heart and brain for them. This would also be easy to work in with the power of love as well as give a way for Elsa to still use some of her power. Perhaps Olafs or the guardians core is recovered and because it's fused with some of her power she can use it in some way.

Anyway, I hope some of my ideas helped and I look forward to reading the story once you start putting it out there.
