Yeah the ending definitely needs changing for a good story to come from it. I was just worried that it would play out more in the way that "and the love (read, good) made her lose her power (read, bad)" rather than "and the significant trauma of seeing her sister who she supposedly killed dying for real to protect her caused her to lose her power."
