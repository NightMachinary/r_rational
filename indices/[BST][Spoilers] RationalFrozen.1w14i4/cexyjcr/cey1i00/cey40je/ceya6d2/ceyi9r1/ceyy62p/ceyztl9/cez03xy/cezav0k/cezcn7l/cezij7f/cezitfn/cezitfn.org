If this subreddit was only for fiction having to do with rationality, it would be an empty subreddit indeed. That's why we also explicitly accept not only rationalist fiction, but deconstructionist/munchkinesque fiction, and smart works of fiction in general. Regardless of whether you think it belongs here, I'm making it clear that /I/ think it belongs here, and nobody would object to it being posted here. Is that what you're afraid of? Or is it just some moral issue?

And for the record, I'm still going to hold that worldbuilding bit over you.
