Have you seen the sidebar? That list of characteristics is the product of a discussion from [[/r/HPMOR]]. That's what a TV Tropes page would look like.

I have a quick critique, and that's that you keep mentioning HPN20 as a rationalist fic. While ... Hmm, how do I say this. I wouldn't call it necessarily rationalist. If you want some textbook examples of rationalist fiction, go to HPMOR or Luminosity or Rational Death Note (whatever that's officially called). HPN20 is more deconstructionist, in that it takes for-granted elements from the Harry Potter universe to their logical extremes and sprints with it.

So when you say

#+begin_quote
  A story featuring characters who have an explicit understanding that the world works in certain predictable ways and choose to exploit the hell out of those rules.
#+end_quote

It looks more to me like a description of deconstructionist / munchkinesque (there's an excellent word, /munchkinesque/) fiction than rational fiction. Whereas your later quip:

#+begin_quote
  Ultra geeky science fiction in a fantasy setting that takes its magic system way too seriously
#+end_quote

Well... Let's put it this way: What part of that definition do you think something like HPMOR /doesn't/ fulfill?
