I've tried to type this several times but, as usual, I'm proving awkward with translating my thoughts into words. This hits at my main points; not perfect, but it'll have to do until I think of some better way. If/when that happens.

It seems to me like the major problem I find with how you're thinking about this is highlighted in the following sentence:

#+begin_quote
  I mean, seriously, who wants to write genre fiction, for crying out loud?
#+end_quote

You're thinking of rationalist fiction as a genre, when it's really a trope. It's something we find /in/ works of different genres. And for that reason, /yes/ rationalist fiction is "simply" stories that don't have idiot balls and have consistent laws of reality.

You say that

#+begin_quote
  These things are just good writing and should show up in stories that in no way aspire to be rationalist fiction.
#+end_quote

That's right! What author /aspires/ to use a trope? You'll notice that a huge percentage of works we share in this subreddit weren't intended by their authors to be "rational" or anything like that. And, well, not everyone shares that definition of "good writing", as a cursory survey of best-rated books should reveal. So all we're doing here is giving a succinct name to the set of tropes we find desirable -- eg, as you pointed out, no random Idiot Balls and a consistent universe.

A piece of writing being "rational" isn't placing it in a genre, it's the implementation of a trope. And for that reason, yes your /Legend of Korra/ fic absolutely belongs in this subreddit. I look forward to seeing your posting of future chapters!
