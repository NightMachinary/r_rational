But absence of idiot balls and consistent rules is just good writing and you'll see it in quite a lot of fiction that in no way fits the tone of rationalist fiction.

Or, to put it another way, what would your TV Tropes entry for 'Rationalist' look like? Is it a character trope? A plot trope? A milieu trope? What's the entry say? (Someone should do this anyway if it doesn't already exist)

I see rationalist fiction as two things:

1. A story featuring characters who have an explicit understanding that the world works in certain predictable ways and choose to exploit the hell out of those rules. They think in ways that are very different from the way normal people think, but it works because it's rational (actually, that's backwords: it's rational because it works). HJPEV, Milo, etc.

and/or

1. Fiction that promotes transhumanism, lifeism, etc. This is more like "rationalist movement" fiction than rationalist fiction per se, since it could just as easily be a story about people who have no particular rationality skills.

I guess I worry that "rationalist fiction" could easily slide into any kind of story that has characters who don't do really dumb things all the time unless those dumb things are related to social skills in which case there won't be any real consequences anyway and who are into science and Explaining Things and going "Whaaa that makes no sense I must do science and explain teh magic." Ultra geeky science fiction in a fantasy setting that takes its magic system way too seriously /=/ rationalist fiction, IMO.

Which is why I'm not updating my LoK story here since it definitely doesn't fit my definition of rationalist fiction. Although yeah, you guys did help me and I did kind of forget about that, so sorry.
