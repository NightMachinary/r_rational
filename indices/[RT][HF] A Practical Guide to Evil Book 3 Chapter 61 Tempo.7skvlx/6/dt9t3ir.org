I can't decide whether Cat and Black (particularly Black) are underestimating Ubua now and setting themselves up for Cat's transition to Black Knight/Black Queen or if Cat is going to subvert the shit out of Ubua's plan. From Ubua's mind we see that this is her big play, and other plays are secondary. For all Ubua claims she is a different sort of Villian, Cat and Black are right to point out that she hasn't broken the mold with anything she's done so far.

Additionally Cat has two so far unaccounted assets in the city WRT Robber and Thief. Maybe one of them were the ones who mapped the defensive wards forcing Ubua to trigger her Trump card early, but that still leaves one to throw a wrench in the works at the right time for Cat.
