Implication is that Archer is as well. I don't think Adjutant or Archer is transitional Names. However, given how the theme of student surpassing mentor is apparently being played out, Adjutant might just transition to Captain and if Black's succession plan is to succeed that will undoubtedly draw the ire of the Lady of the Lake and the Sovereign of the Red Skies.

Who knows? Maybe EE is planning on telling a Narrative where The Woe has to choose Cat over their mentors/parental figures ending with each of them having to kill their mentors and possibly claim their Names.

It would fit the theme nicely of the New replacing the Old. Captain's death proves that the Calamities' time are done.

Fore what follows a Calamity? Woe.
