Would also set up the conflict between the Black Queen and the Dread Empress quite nicely.

Two powerful monarchs that are sharing a Knight. I don't think Malicia or the other Calamities would take too kindly to Cat having Sovereign control over Black but the alternative is him being permanently dead so yeah, not really a lot of choice in the matter. I mean he's already described as corpse-like, I'm sure he won't mind being an undead abomination. If he gains the Name Death Knight in the process, well that's just dandy.
