Diabolist using claim to take control of Cat and having her kill Black (likely by stabbing him in the heart like he did to her in Book 1. She ends him how he began her. There's a certain poetic symmetry to it and if that act is not enough for a transition I don't know what the hell is.) would tie things up nicely.

Diabolist's statement of Cat kneeling at her feet is fulfilled, Black's succession plan is also fulfilled and Cat transitions. Likely gaining an aspect that allows her to break control and kill Diabolist.

Remember, all the Old School villains are invariably killed by their trusted lieutenant/caged monster because of mistreatment (and forcing said lieutenant to kill their father figure strikes me as one of the ur examples of mistreatment). That Story has Weight and it nicely closes all opened plot threads.

This is a likely explanation for why Black only told Cat to come and not bring Adjutant or Archer even though the added numbers would be a boost when assaulting Liesse.

Masego, Warlock and Juniper along with the other legions are handling the plebs. Black not taking Archer or Adjutant with seems like he's holding the idiot ball but the priors for that are way too low. I believe he's enacting his succession plan.

Now how will Cat subvert this, I wonder...
