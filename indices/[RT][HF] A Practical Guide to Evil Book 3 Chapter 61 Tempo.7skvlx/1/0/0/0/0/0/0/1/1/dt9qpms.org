I'm going to go a step further. I think she'll necromance Akua after she kills her. The promise of grovelling at feet thing has to go somewhere.

In fact, if she does end up transitioning to a necromancy/Death Knight Name, I'm calling it that her power is resurrecting loyal wights that keep their Names. That is suitably badass power spike for the end of this book, perhaps even extreme enough to set up the real big bad for the series. I'm hoping the gnomes, they sound amazing.

If all of the hints about necromancy and dead king level rituals and so on have been red herrings and erratic has something else equally awesome but completely unexpected planned, I'll be very impressed.
