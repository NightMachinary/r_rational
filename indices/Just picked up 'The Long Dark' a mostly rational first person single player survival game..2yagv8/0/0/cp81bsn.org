I figured a game would be defined as rational in much the same way as a book. You start from a given point, and everything after that point has to make some sort of sense. The character stays alive by finding food and supplies in a frigid wilderness. The effects of the environment are reasonable. I darn near died of starvation before I figured out how and where to put rabbit snares. After that, it was still touch and go until I found a hatchet that I could use to chop meat out of frozen deer that had been killed by wolves. I've upgraded my gloves and boots with heavy fur clothing, and have taken over a logging camp office as my headquarters. I've got a nice stash of food stored up that is allowing me to explore. One can of bad pork and beans was resolved with antibiotics I scrounged, and three sprained ankles have needed bed rest to resolve. I've been extremely careful to avoid falls, but walking on ice on rocks seems to cause leg sprains.

The thing I've been most irritated with so far is the rifle. I need wolf pelts for a jacket much warmer than what I have. The rifle is terribly inaccurate. I've been wondering if the game creators actually know how iron sights are normally used. Then again, the rifle is damaged...
