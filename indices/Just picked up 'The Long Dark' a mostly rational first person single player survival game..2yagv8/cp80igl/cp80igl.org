I backed this on Kickstarter, long ago, and have decided to mostly forget about it until it is released, at which point it will be a pleasant and readily acquired surprise. So far it looks like they're delivering what they promised. I love the art-style.

However, I'm curious - how does a game distinguish itself as "rational"? Does it simply have to make sense?
