I had a detailed response written out, but I deleted it because I realized that I was wrong.

Realistic and rational fiction are very similar categories. Realistic works are close to a subset of rational works. (You can still have realistic works where the factions are not in conflict because of their values, or where the characters don't solve problems by intelligently applying their resources.)

However, I have a personal preference against realistic works. In my mind, an internally consistent work with non-realistic elements is more interesting than an internally consistent work that is entirely realistic. This is because I find it interesting to reason about the politics of, say, /The Culture/, but I don't find it interesting to reason about whether antibiotics will cure an infection.

So while this is an example of a rational work, it's also an example of a subcategory that I'm not interested in.
