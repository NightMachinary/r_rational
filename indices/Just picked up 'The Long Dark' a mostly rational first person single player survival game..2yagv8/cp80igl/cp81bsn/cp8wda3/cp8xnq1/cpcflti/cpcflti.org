I have just discovered that, where I work, the person who procures out computers buys them with one monitor. When they're deployed (and the deployment requests go through her), they're increasingly frequently requested and deployed with /two/ monitors.

She then gets mad at our deployer/stockman-colleague and the rest of us for not accurately tracking the monitor counts.

... this is, in reality the situation. This is how it is and, assuming similar behaviour on her part for the foreseeable future is a realistic assumption.

... I don't think anybody could really say her behaviour - or the situation - is rational.

Or, in other words: it's entirely realistic to assume, especially with evidence, that people in a situation are not necessarily rational.
