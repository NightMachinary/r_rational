Aaaaah yea I forgot about Shizune... Never mind. :D

edit: I'm not sure they are going to fight at all. They could have an audience with clones, while they would themselves be hiding in the trapped secret underground ninjutsu stash. They also have lots of ninjas in their disposal, so they might not even have to worry much anyway. Just send someone to ask them what they want first, make clones to go hide, and grant an audience with shitloads of guards.
