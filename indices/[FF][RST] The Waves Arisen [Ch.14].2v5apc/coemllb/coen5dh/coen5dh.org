Ahh, I thought of some failure modes for my plan:

- Kabuto would immediately realize Naruto is a jincuuriki, and know that there are others capable of resealing him.

  - This means that he knows Itachi is after Naruto
  - Similarly he'll be on the lookout for the knowledge to reseal a tailed beast, and have a way to defeat Naruto in the near future.
  - He does /not/ know about the backup shadow clones, so he will be less wary of trying that too early. Though he may very well suspect it.

- Sasuke is much less powerful than Sasuke + Orochimaru. He could be caught out in a lie easily enough.
