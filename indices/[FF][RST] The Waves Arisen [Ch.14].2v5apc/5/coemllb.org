Hmm, I have no clue what I'd do in their position. It comes off as a little too trusting for this environment but something like the following is probable:

Naruto: Kabuto, we need to talk.

Kabuto: Ok.

N: What do you want? Other than me not killing you that is.

K: <Says things>

N: <Sees how it can fit into plan for world optimization>

N: You can see why despite fear being a wonderful motivator. I would rather have someone like you on my side because they want to be.

and

N: That technique that I used to kill Orochimaru is a dead man's switch. Do anything that would otherwise kill me and it would automatically activate. Do anything that might kill my teammates and I will activate it. However I don't like to use as it erodes my will to want to keep other people alive. If I use it too much, I will want to literally kill everyone.

N: In that state I will have enough power that you'd need an entire army to stop me. Additionally, I become more intelligent and ruthless in that state. Knowing this makes you a threat to the psychopathic version of me, and as soon as I urn psychopathic I will find you, every Kage, and every administrator of note, and kill them well before anyone notices that I might be a problem. That way the chance of any group raising the army that would be needed to defeat me is radically dropped, and I can proceed to exterminate the human race at leisure.

N: The me of now does not want to do this, but rest assured that I will as soon as that dead man's switch strips me of any semblance of care for the lives of others. It is in your interest to keep me alive, and help me gain power so that others can't kill me. Likewise it is in my interest to give you what you want as there are costs to my use of that power, and there are many instances where the costs of my deference to you will be less than the cost of activation.

I expect this tactic to backfire horribly, but i'm not sure how. A lot depends on Kabuto's goals.

Also, holy crap, rereading that dialogue makes me keenly aware of why I'm not a writer.

Finally, Nuruto is creating backups, I hope he sends some to Jiraya for training. I'm quite curious how this one differs from the one in canon.

Oh god, Hinata's life is hell. However, I love how what Sasuke says makes perfect sense given his life experiences and a perfectly reasonable case of "extrapolating from a single data point".

Oh hey, the Sannin are here. Wonder what they want. I'd expect that if they run the Sannin could catch up (Even if they couldn't kill Naruto). So my best bet, would be to send susuke and hinata away with a clone, and go to talk to the Sannin.
