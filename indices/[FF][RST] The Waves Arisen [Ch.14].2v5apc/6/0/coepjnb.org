Mostly, I think. Basically everything I know about Naruto is from fanfiction and it's working for me. The one thing that isn't covered is the starting point; it's not much of a spoiler, since it's the start of canon as well, but I'll tag it anyway:

Naruto is the dead-last in the academy, the complete screwup. He fails his final exam, so he can't become a ninja. [[#s][At that point,]]

I think everything else important is covered in the text.
