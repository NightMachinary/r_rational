Yea, I know Hinata loves him.

She wanted to be approved of her clan before she got booted. Then she killed Neji. I'm not sure how it's been established that she wants nothing to do with the clan? I think she would have loved it if she was taken back, but obviously the situation doesn't allow that now, them being missing-nins and all.

We don't even know if she wanted to actually kill Neji. They never practiced killing anyone with the barriers, or Naruto would have known about it too and practiced them more and do it better with all those clones and all that chakra. She didn't have byakugan on, so she didn't see or hear what happened to Neji.
