No way. Just...no. I'm sure there will be more surprises, but this is definitely /not/ one of them. [[#s][She]] So unless you're suggesting that she's /actually not/ in love--which is an equally ludicrous claim at this point--she's absolutely /dying/ inside right now.

And hasn't it already been established that she just wants nothing to do with her old clan? My reading of her is that her first priority is to live, her second is to stick with Naruto, she's still trying to decide what the third should be, and revenge is maybe vaguely somewhere further down if it's on the list at all. Speaking of which, did her choice to kill Neji in cold blood strike anyone else as being totally out-of-character? I suppose she could've been just so fed up that she felt like she had to strike out /somehow/, and if we later learn that the experience rattled her enough to make her lose interest in further revenge, I'd be fine with that. Thoughts?
