  he says /to her face/ that there's no way he would ever /not/ think she's joking.

In other words, Naruto explicitly just informed her---paraphrasing---"I give a 0% credence to the idea that you could love me. No evidence I encounter can update me away from 0%. Therefore, presuming you continue on the path of providing me hints and clues, and even just attempting to plain-old /tell/ me that you love me, it will never work. If you really wanted to communicate that sort of thing, you'd need to try something more drastic, to make me change my entire model."

This is a really useful thing for her to know! Right now she's moping because he effectively told her that her current strategy is futile. But he just told her /why/ she's been failing all this time---that his model doesn't allow for her evidence to enter it---and so told her exactly what she /should/ be doing: thinking of a /new/ strategy involving /forcing/ him to believe her.

I think she was making a point about her clan in general. If you take her asking the "is the Gentle Fist style really weak" question as being for the sake of the /audience/, not so she could reaffirm her belief, then the whole thing is a demonstration that saying (in a very quiet, speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick way) that effectively, "I'm not fired; I quit. I can do a better job as not-a-Hyuuga then I ever could as one. They were just holding me back. In fact, they hold you all back. You, the branch house, they hold you back; rise up! You, the village, they keep you down; they're not invulnerable! They might know your secrets, but you could just kill them all, like the Uchiha! Don't feel so damn intimidated! I don't!" Etc.
