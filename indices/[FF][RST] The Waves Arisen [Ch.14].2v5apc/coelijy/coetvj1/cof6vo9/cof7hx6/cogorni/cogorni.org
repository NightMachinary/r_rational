IIRC, there was a point where she basically said she doesn't care what they think of her, and upon hearing it Naruto remarked (in inner monologue) that the self-confidence book he'd given her was evidently working. I suppose I could be reading too far into that, though.

If she'd wanted to avoid killing him, she would've had it on, watching for the point where he yields. Even ignoring that, she would've been able to estimate when the barrier got too small to properly contain a human, and I think it was pretty clearly stated that she crushed him into a solid mass, which would require radius shrinkage significantly beyond that threshold.
