They've completely screwed up assessing the motivations of various characters in a way that is known to the audience (the part of the audience that knows the canon. I think that meets the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony#Dramatic_irony][definition]].

In this case it is funny because they are assuming that the other Sannin most have been allies and thus are out to avenge Orochimaru and in no way have any interest in Naruto. In fact, the other Sannin's are enemies of Orochimaru in canon (and likely in this fic too if they know the type of experiments he does) and Jiraya is personally interested in Naruto.
