  This type of irony is the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OED][OED]] has:

  the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned; the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.

  According to Stanton, dramatic irony has three stages---installation, exploitation, and resolution (often also called preparation, suspension, and resolution) ---producing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon, the /contrary/ of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true. In summary, it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of.

  For example:

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Lights][City Lights]]/ the audience knows that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin][Charlie Chaplin]]'s character is not a millionaire, but the blind flower girl ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Cherrill][Virginia Cherrill]]) believes him to be rich.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_by_Northwest][North by Northwest]]/, the audience knows that Roger Thornhill ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant][Cary Grant]]) is not Kaplan; Vandamm ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mason][James Mason]]) and his accomplices do not. The audience also knows that Kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the CIA; Roger (initially) and Vandamm (throughout) do not.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_the_King][Oedipus the King]]/, the audience knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon and Jocasta do not.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello][Othello]]/, the audience knows that Desdemona has been faithful to Othello, but Othello does not. The audience also knows that Iago is scheming to bring about Othello's downfall, a fact hidden from Othello, Desdemona, Cassio and Roderigo.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cask_of_Amontillado][The Cask of Amontillado]]/, the reader knows that Montresor is planning on murdering Fortunato, while Fortunato believes they are friends.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show][The Truman Show]]/, the viewer is aware that Truman is on a television show, but Truman himself only gradually learns this.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet][Romeo and Juliet]]/, the audience knows that Juliet is already married to Romeo, but her family does not. Also, in the crypt, most of the other characters in the cast think Juliet is dead, but the audience knows she only took a sleeping potion. Romeo is also under the same misapprehension when he kills himself.

  Tragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary][Oxford English Dictionary]] has:

  the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned, the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_ancient_Greece][Ancient Greek drama]] was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend][legends]] that most of the plays dramatized. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles][Sophocles]]' /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_the_King][Oedipus the King]]/ provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest. Colebrook writes:

  #+begin_quote
  #+end_quote

  Tragic irony is exemplified in ancient drama ... The audience watched a drama unfold, already knowing its destined outcome. ... In Sophocles' /Oedipus the King/, for example, 'we' (the audience) can see what Oedipus is blind to. The man he murders is his father, but he does not know it.

  Further, Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused, not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself. Irony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox][paradox]] that arises from insoluble problems. For example, in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare][William Shakespeare]] play /Romeo and Juliet/, when Romeo finds Juliet in a drugged deathlike sleep, he assumes her to be dead and kills himself. Upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her, Juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself.
