Yay! This is totally the chapter where Team 7 takeover Sound smoothly and painlessly and reform it into a Rationalist Utopia where no one dies, ever, right?

[Written After Reading]:

Well, no butchery. Surprised that both surviving Sannin are being introduced so quickly. I have to think this is just them having become aware of Naruto and the shenanigans that are going in and around Leaf and coming to support him. At least, that makes sense for Jiraya. Tsunade is less clear. I'm not sure if she was in on Naruto being Minato's son in canon. Gonna be harder to conceal their presence in Sound from Leaf than Team 7's, though, if that's the case. Makes me wonder how exactly the Sannin tracked them to Sound, given that Leaf's dispatch suggests that Leaf doesn't know they're there.

Pein "Nighting" Akatsuki seems a little weird, but if he's being setup as a foil to Naruto, each taking control of Mist/Sound in their own way, I guess it makes sense.
