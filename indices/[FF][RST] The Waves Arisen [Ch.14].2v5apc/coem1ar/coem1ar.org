No one died this chapter? That is the first death free chapter in what, like 5 or 6 chapters?

Sasuke manages to be even more oblivious than Naruto. That section was hilarious.

  “Well I already told you how stupid that idea is, but I meant you should do something nice for her,” Sasuke said. “Something personal she can appreciate, you know? Like teach her a really deadly assassination technique.”

Wow. This topped off that little section perfectly.

Kabuto is a pro:

#+begin_quote
  Kabuto inquired about their familiarity with medical ninjutsu, while they walked. Naruto didn't think it would be revealing too much to admit their ignorance, and on hearing his reply Kabuto offered to give the three of them some instruction in the basics, on the way.

  He was really doing his best to be useful---Naruto could see why Orochimaru would have liked having him around.

  Naruto had planned to ask Kabuto to head back to Sound on his own once they'd arrived, so that the three of them could have some privacy to try out the new techniques, but Hinata's lessons were going too well to interrupt.
#+end_quote

So Kabuto basically is continuously ensuring that they will find him useful. He manages it such that they let him stay with them and he learns all the techniques that they take with them.

  It seemed inconceivable that the Sannin would have been sent after a group of rogue chuunin. They must have somehow found out about Orochimaru. They were after him, personally.

You manage to top the dramatic irony from canon knowledge almost every chapter.
