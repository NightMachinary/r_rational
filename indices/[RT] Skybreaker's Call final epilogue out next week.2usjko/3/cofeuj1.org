Everything is sharp with enough velocity!

Really enjoying these. I'm of a mind with the others that say the mental magic is under-defined, but that bothers me more because I'm really curious about what you think it'd look like. Very few authors go into mind details (Greg Egan and the opening for Diaspora come to mind), and no-one has written any rationalist fiction featuring any.

I'll see about writing a longer review, as I think I can meaningfully contribute to your growth as a writer, but ultimately it doesn't matter because you're good, and I'm having a lot of fun.
