Bit of a repost, but this and the preceding novel, [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/34751426243/doc-prologue][The Fall of Doc Future]], are excellent rational superheroes; I personally consider them vastly superior to Worm, but I find Worm's setting terribly unbelievable, so YMMV. If you haven't encountered these two before, I suggest starting with FoDF, which the author summarized thusly:

  This is the first chapter of a novel I wrote, The Fall of Doc Future, set in a world similar to the present day, except with metahumans. I consider it Science Fiction or â€˜Hard Fantasy'---there are unusual abilities, but I try to treat the consequences seriously and consistently. The main characters are Doc Future, the smartest man in the world, currently having issues with insomnia; his adopted daughter Flicker, a speedster and high functioning autistic; her best friend, Dr. Stella Reinhart, a mind control researcher who does a few other things as well; and Donner, a metahuman rock musician with an unusual voice. It's about 170k words.

Call will cover the details of how powers work significantly less than Fall, and spoil the conclusion of Fall very thoroughly, but otherwise can stand alone if you prefer.

Warning: Contains discussion of earworms, rape, and memetic hazards.
