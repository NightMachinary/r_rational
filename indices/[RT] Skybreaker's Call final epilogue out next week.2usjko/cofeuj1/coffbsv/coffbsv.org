Must... resist....at least a little bit...

Favorite narrative theme?

Real people with real powers /refusing/ to be converted into narrative elements... and having that refusal produce /interesting physical consequences/. That's amazing.

  Universe: Soooo you're a god!

  Doc: NOPE.

  Universe: Well... ah... I'm not really... This has never happened before. I don't know what should happen. Maybe... this? Sorta... maybe, that...?

Part you should work on?

(And I had to re-write this bit)... All of the main characters basically have - as both an aspect of their super-power, and because you're writing them as intelligent, stable, rational adults (with emotions!) - the ability to "turn on a dime" in their character arcs and ability to handle new information and situation.

But I'm left with a question: Is this normal for other people in this world? The world itself? Maybe show me more about how everything else in this universe handles these whiplash moments?
