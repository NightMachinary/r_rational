Read the first book. Definitely fun. More in the vein of Soon I Will Be Invincible than Worm.

There were some boring bits in the middle, but my main complaint is the violation of Sanderson's laws. If you're going to use mind magic to solve mind problems, either we need to understand it (either mechanically like you're probably thinking of, or in a dramatic sense where there's good foreshadowing and actions have costs that make sense), or it needs to be serving a vital moment of character development.
