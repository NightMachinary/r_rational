I loved the series so far, sad to see it go. Didn't get much press or response here, which is a shame.

The series was very well written, with a larger slice of life than any other superhero media I've consumed. Unfortunately, this combined with relatively short chapters and week+ release times to form a situation where not much plot would happen, for long periods of irl time.

The action that did occur was quite compelling and fun. I would love to see more of it.
