I got that, but people react emotionally to things before they react rationally. If you woke up blind, even in a world where you knew it could be fixed, you'd FIRST be TERRIFIED, then hopefully be reassured that it could be fixed. If your sister started cracking jokes about it you'd tell her to shut the hell up you're BLIND. It's not just Seti though, all the characters in this chapter have the same flaw. They don't react emotionally, so they feel flat and the reader loses relatability/empathy for them as a result.
