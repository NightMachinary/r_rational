It's not that the characters are irrational, it's that their emotional reactions aren't realistic/ are barely portrayed. Seti feels like. Welp, guess I'm blind now, better respond rationally to the situation, rather than HOLY CRAP. OH GOD OH GOD I'M BLIND. AAAAAGGGHHH. We're shown what the character thinks, but not what they feel. That's the unrealism.
