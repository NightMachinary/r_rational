I dont think you treated the topic of geas very well in your world. You establish that "everyone is scared of things they do not understand [geas]" , but your civilisation, capable of managing god level threats regulary while still allowing for advanced science and technology and a normal life for all citizens, cant take the most sensible precautions? What about putting a geas on all vivamances NOT to make geas? If they can remove them, put two identical geas on them that will kill them as soon as they remove a geas from themselves? Maybe checking up on them every few years?

That would be the sensible thing to do even if putting geas on other people with their consent would be socially acceptable. And I would imagine that there would be a large populace that would push very hard for such measures, given that the sensible and widespread fear of vivamancers mindcontrolling you prevents them access to medical treatment. That would guarantee such measures in a democracy and an authoritarian regime would love to control vivamancers for their own gain.

Given all this, I cant understand Setis and Cassies reaction at all. Why did Cassie act as she did? What were her goals? How did she think she could accomplish them with her actions? Cassie SEEMS to be in it only to help Seti and maybe because she thinks fear of geas is stupid and misplaced. But she knew that what she would do to was illegal and would likely get her expelled, especially if she did not ask first. And she did not want that. So why did she risk it? She had a few hours and could talk to seti about it. Maybe get a supervisor. Now, Seti kinda consented to having the geas removed, so why the fuck would she put a geas on him that would antagonize him and did not help anyway? what was her reasoning behind that? There is literally not rational reason do antagonize him at this point by putting the geas on him.

Putting Cassie aside, why the fuck did seti share details about his dream with someone that mindraped him litterally five minutes beforehand?? As far as he knew she was an enemy. He even thought that what she did was amoral and stupid and mindrape. And why forgive her so readily. Even if it happens to not be so bad, she still in his own words "forced yourself on me". You dont forget that so fast
