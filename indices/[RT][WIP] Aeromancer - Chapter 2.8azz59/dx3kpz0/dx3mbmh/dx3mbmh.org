Thanks for reading! My thought process is that the MC is the only one not taking it seriously because he received direct benefit from it (memories / wind light). Other players do take it seriously and give warning (sibling), as well as the final result of reporting it behind scenes (father to authorities). I will try to improve my writing skills to better show these types of stuff. Sorry for the confusion!
