No worries it wasn't so much confusion, or even anything improve-able about the writing. It's more that it seems indicative of the characterization of Seti and Cassie, or maybe just the values of the world, which might not quite line up with my own.

Like, I feel like free will is very core to the human experience, to the point where a sufficiently encompassing geass would be worse than murder (prevents you from experiencing a free life, while at the same time stealing your body from you). And so, for me at least, as soon as someone placed the first non-consensual geass on me, I'd be considering the best way to kill them when I get the chance, in the hopes that it would release any geass on me. And I mean, maybe that's just me, but...idk.

Part of it could be a lack of information on how geass works in this world. Cuz it seems that knowledge of the particulars of geass isn't ubiquitous (he believes the whole you-die-if-you-tell-someone thing), but it seems that mind control defenses would be something everyone would familiarize themselves with, unless maybe it's really not that powerful at all?
