Thanks for reading so far, the full fallout of the geas actions takes place at ch4, with that in mind:

#+begin_quote
  but your civilisation, capable of managing god level...cant take the most sensible precautions?
#+end_quote

Precautions are taken to the highest degree, and your suggestion is on point. There is a reason the precautions haven't reached Cassie, which will be addressed in ch4.

#+begin_quote
  What were her goals? So why did she risk it?
#+end_quote

Excitement in the opportunity (her excitement reason not yet disclosed fully, only shown by quickened breathing), and her goal better clarified in ch4.

#+begin_quote
  why the fuck did seti share details about his dream with someone that mindraped him litterally five minutes beforehand?
#+end_quote

Goal was to get his eyes fixed, and while Cassie was whack, she seemed to want that end as well. Hiding the dream holds no benefit for Seti.

Thanks for the thoughts you've shared. My lesson learned here is to better world build before advancing on events the reader would like to know more about. I'll try to do better.
