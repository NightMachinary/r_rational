I obviously have no idea, two chapters in, where the blindness arc is going to go. Even so, I've read enough to think you might need to read this: [[https://kbspangler.com/2016/04/20/on-blindness-and-rachels-character/]]

"Disability Superpowers" can be a problematic trope. Mind the pitfalls, when writing a blind character who can see without eyes.
