If I understand it correctly, the problem is with including a character from a group of people who have to deal with specific, difficult issues on a day-to-day basis, and minimizing those issues by hand-waving them away.

Everyone wants to read about characters that they can relate to, who share the same kind of issues and struggles and day-to-day life as the reader, and it's a bit of a bait-and-switch to put a character in who /should/ be that to someone, but isn't, because they /don't/ share any of that.
