I read the article and the TVTropes page, but I feel like I'm missing something here. Why is it dumb and insensitive? if someone can't see but are aided by some external source (implants, superpowers, magic, etc) aren't they still technically blind? It doesn't negate the fact that their eyes don't work and they can't see through them.

  "Disability Superpowers" can be a problematic trope. Mind the pitfalls, when writing a blind character who can see without eyes.

Care to elaborate? why are those superpowers a problematic trope? what are the pitfalls?

Sorry if this seems super obvious to everyone else but I'm not seeing what is the big deal :/
