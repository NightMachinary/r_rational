Thanks for the critique and for typing up your thoughts! I'll ponder on the conversational payoffs that you mentioned, as I've never heard of that before now.

I would like to address the math part, as I don't think it was building up to a math genius trope, but rather relayed that the counselor believed that numbers shouldn't be the absolute gauge for a power (where it was established that the MC was left wanting in that department).
