At the very least in its current state I don't see why this would be posted on rationalist fiction. As far as we can tell, the counselor is irrational. Either he has a good reason to recommend to main character or he doesn't, but if he does, keeping everything a secret seems pretty bizarre. The dream event is a completely random incident that falls outside of the world that has been described. There are no significant indications that anybody in this is a rational actor so far. Maybe once there is more meat to it this will become a great rationalist fiction, but at present I don't see how it could possibly qualify. With that said, it seemed reasonably well written if not arbitrary.
