Thanks for the comment! Though picture this as a rebuttal: someone goes to the hotel for a day and they wake up in the middle of the night. Their first impression is that they are at home, rather than a place they are only spending the night.

In the same way, I view that groggy moment of wake-stasis to be something where the character isn't as focused as us readers.
