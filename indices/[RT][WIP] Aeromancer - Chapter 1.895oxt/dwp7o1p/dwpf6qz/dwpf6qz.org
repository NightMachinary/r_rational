I object to this on the grounds that suddenly waking up blind would seem unlikely, so if I woke up and couldn't see anything I /would/ likely think I was in the dark for a few moments.\\
If the room I was sleeping in was really dark to begin with then I might think I was blind for a fair bit longer.
