I didn't really like this chapter. Trying to figure out why...

I'd say the chapter lack a proper structure on most levels. The chapter has an okay high level structure (protagonist introduces the world, meets the counselor, talks to the bully guy, gets the "Got your eyesight!" Call To Adventure), but each scene and dialogue is unstructured.

Ideally, each scene should have a setup -> build-up -> payoff curve on a fractal level (as in, a curve for the scene, and inside of the scene a curve for each exchange, and inside of each exchange a curve for each line of dialogue). But the scenes are all setup and no payoff.

The scene with the counselor sets up that the protagonist is special somehow, but doesn't pay off by explaining how (it says "the bully is afraid of you", but that's not satisfying, it shouldn't stop there). Same thing with the scene with the bully: the protagonist leaves with as much information as he started with. I'm not sure if the dream scene fits into my explanation, but I'd say it lacks build-up and structure: the sequence is just "confusion, confusion, confusion, HEY NOW YOU HAVE NO EYES".

Overall the chapter is really confused; I'd say you are trying to fit too many concepts at the same time without developing them, because you're trying too hard to subvert every possible expectation. For instance, the "what is a billion seconds" exchange feels like it's just trying to make you expect the "slacker protagonist turns out to be genius at math" trope and immediately go "nope, gotcha!", and the exchange has no point beyond that.

(keep in mind that I'm no wildbow, this is me doing very amateur literary critique; if someone with more experience writing/critiquing comes by, feel free to correct me)
