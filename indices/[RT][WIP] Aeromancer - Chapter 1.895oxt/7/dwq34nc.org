Interesting! I look forwards to future updates.

I think my main critique would be that I feel like I lack reason to care about/be interested in the protagonist. The counsellor scene felt like it was setting up some interesting/impressive quality of Seti, but it cut off too early, implying the existence of some interesting quality but not actually talking about it. And in the rest of the chapter, Seti seems fairly unimpressive and a bit of a dick. This feels like a bit of a showing vs telling issue, we've been told that Seti has something interesting about him, but not been shown enough evidence of this that it feels compelling.
