I was captivated by the counsellor scene.

Could you consider starting with the office door opening, asking for Tutt, Seti? The stuff before that doesn't add much, that we wouldn't learn in the dialog. Because honestly, I wanted to quit after the first sentence. And that would be a shame.

Maybe add a sentence how he is waiting nervously/annoyed on a chair in front.

Also, I guess he makes CO or a similar gas.
