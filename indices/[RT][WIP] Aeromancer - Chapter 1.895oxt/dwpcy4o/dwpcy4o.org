Interesting first chapter. Does he have emotion affecting wind? It's something he wouldn't notice on himself, and if he doesn't notice it he wouldn't control the effect, but anyone else hit by it would presumably be much better sutied to see the effect. And if other people knew, Aiden would be more wary of the guy who casually throws out emotion affecting abilities.
