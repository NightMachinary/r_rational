Well i just have to give my opinion now to nuance all those positive reviews. Basicaly it isn't for everyone. I personnaly hated the beginning enough that i didn't continue it ( and thats rare ). The heroine has no agency, the art and plot are too messy, and honnestly this isn't rational in any way ( but that gets a pass since we're having trouble deffining "rational" has anything more than "people on this subreedit might like this".)
