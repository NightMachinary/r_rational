Girl meets some enigmatic figure; the enigmatic figure pushes a magical thing made of light into her forehead. A little while later, you find out that the magical thing is not just /a/ key to the universe, but basically /the/ Key to the Universe, which everyone else wants and /will/ kill for.

As a side effect, she's transported to a bizaare world that she /really, really/ doesn't understand, that turns out to be the wreckage of Heaven, taken over by demon crime lords and drug barons.
