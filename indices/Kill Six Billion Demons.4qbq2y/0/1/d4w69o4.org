There is also an old MSPA forum series that sort of formed the protagonist in a different story arc. It was funny watching her and her situation take shape as people shouted suggestions from the crowd.

Sadly the MSPA forums seem to be down for maintenance or something, so I can't find and link to it.

Also, the author seems to have reset the character for Kill Six Billion Demons, though, so I guess it isn't that important.
