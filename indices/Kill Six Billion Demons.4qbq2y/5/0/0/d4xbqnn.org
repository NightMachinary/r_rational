Oh yeah that's me... I was following the story before it was a webcomic and just a forum-adventure.

Honestly if you do a net dive for that screen name you will find me scattered across the ancient strata of the internet going well into the early 2001s... I honestly Can't recall if that screen name predates the millenium or not and there are not going to be any solid archives of the things I used it on back then because the name got purged, the platform no longer exists or both.

At the very least I had a geocities account attached to it.
