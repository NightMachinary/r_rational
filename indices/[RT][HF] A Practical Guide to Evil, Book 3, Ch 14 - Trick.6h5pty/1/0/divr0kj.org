I totes called it! I'm thinking she's now a Duchess of Winter who'll have to fight Summer.

How coincidental that Summer is wreaking havoc in the south of Callow eh?

(I keep hoping she'll be a Fae Knight and bypass the whole having Black be forced to die thing but we know that's not happening)

Edit: I love how her new aspect is pretty much perfect for her. She encounters something troubling she either takes or breaks it. How Catherine is that?
