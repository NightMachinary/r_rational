I think she'll go to Duchess of Winter, not Fae Knight. Dukes have squires, so it's not an illogical transition. And given that her whole story seems to be about the /new/, about unprecedented things such as unifying Callow and Praes and about Breaking things she doesn't like, I don't think it would fit for her to have such a cliche' Name transition as Squire->Black Knight.
