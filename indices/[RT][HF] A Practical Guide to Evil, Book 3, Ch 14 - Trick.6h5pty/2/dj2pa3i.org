Take, Break... Make? Remake? Fake? Shake? Bake (Goblinfire, ho!)? I'm just going with a rhyming scheme here now :-P

While I do like that we get an explanation of what happened to the Penitent's Blade, I will admit I didn't even think of it until this chapter brought it up. I guess I just assumed it was left behind...? That's the problem when plot threads are left unmentioned for months on end - you forget they exist unless you reread! That said, shattering it into a hundred pieces and scattering them is just BEGGING for a hero to come along to reforge them. I'm honestly not sure what was meant by "I saw my death writ on its edge." Metaphorical? Literal? Tough to say.

I am curious what the difference between Cat's "Break" and Black's "Destroy" are. Is Break simply a lesser version of the latter, or is it a different concept? Because breaking the rules of the meta-game seem to be what both she and Black strive to do - I wonder if their abilities reflect that desire or do they force them to act within the Names and Roles ascribed to them? Out of the two, I think Break fits the overall goal better than Destroy...
