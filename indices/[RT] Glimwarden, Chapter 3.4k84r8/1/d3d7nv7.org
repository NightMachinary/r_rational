In case nobody writes a similar comment: I actually like Melanie a lot so far as a character, and, embarrassingly, gained a bit of perspective on a friendship of mine (with me as the Sander and my friend as the Melanie). Further, you managed to convey a bunch of information about Sander, and his strengths and weaknesses, without having Sander take the reader's attention off Melanie, or making him the focus of her PoV. Having him give a monologue full of new information, and then showing how that monologue is actually sort of inappropriate and indicative of the problems with their friendship, strikes me as a really clever way to deliver exposition and characterization for two characters all at once in an elegant and subtle way.
