  Her first comparison is to a story where some patsy gets stuck between two forces more powerful than himself and crushed by them. This is a road forward, ergo there must be something wrong with the road.

True, this was a pretty telling part of her character and perspective. It didn't feel like it at the time though. Hmm. Now I'm wondering why. Maybe there's a better way to make it more central to the chapter? I'd have to reread it with an eye toward editing to be sure, and I'm not sure you'd want to do such a big overhaul of the chapter if you already have something else planned.

  So yes, she's less compelling of a character right now, but I'm okay with that because that's part of who she is, part of where she's going, and part of how her temperament and philosophical outlook mesh with (and contrast with) the other characters. A Melanie that gets eager about things isn't the Melanie I need her to be.

Fair enough, I feel the same way about Leaf in my story. Just be aware that the dynamic may not come across as you intend: Phillip is definitely detached enough to make a second detached character like Melanie feel like a lesser shadow of him, until she evidences some uniqueness or insight to stand out in her own way. I definitely haven't been able to make Leaf's sections as engaging as I want them to be for everyone though, so maybe I'm projecting.
