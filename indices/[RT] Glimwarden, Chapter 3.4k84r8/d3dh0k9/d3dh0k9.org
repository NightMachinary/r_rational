Excellent expansion of Melanie's chapter: she has much more grounding and periphery characterization now, matching the other two primary protagonists.

That said:

1) Some of the info at the start of the second section now feels redundant. Maybe shift it to the early part of the chapter, so that it doesn't rephrase what we've already gathered about her and her life.

2) Her motivation feels like the weakest, when it should be the strongest. What I mean by that is I feel like there's lost potential here. Sander wants to be a Glimwarden because it "feels right," excites him intellectually, and for some lineage sentimentality. Phillip wants to be one for the potential challenges it contains, and possible power. Both are similar in that they don't /need/ to become Glimwardens, but want to be. They could do other things with their lives, their talents, and at worst are just bored with things as they are. Melanie, on the other hand, is fairly miserable with her life. She should have a fire lit in her mind by the chance to become a Glimwarden. She should be barely restraining her eagerness in front of her aunt, biting her tongue at telling Sander that she will be one too. Not only is this her chance to become a heroine from one of her stories, even acknowledging that stories aren't like real life, it's also her one real chance to break the shackles of the inn...

And yet she seems far too neutral, too reserved, for any of that to be felt. It makes her a less compelling character, in my mind, than she should be.

You probably have a different character/arc for her in mind, or maybe she takes some time to develop into things, but for now my perspective is she can use the emotive boost early, if possible. Regardless, looking forward to the next chapters!
