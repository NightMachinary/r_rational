At the risk of showing too much of how the sausage is made:

Her inward sense of motive is the weakest mostly because of how she's built as a character. Her first thought on hearing the offer is "this is a way out", but her /second/ thought is "I'm going to get fucked over somehow". Her first comparison is to a story where some patsy gets stuck between two forces more powerful than himself and crushed by them. This is a road forward, ergo there must be something wrong with the road.

So yes, she's less compelling of a character right now, but I'm okay with that because that's part of who she is, part of where she's going, and part of how her temperament and philosophical outlook mesh with (and contrast with) the other characters. A Melanie that gets eager about things isn't the Melanie I need her to be.
