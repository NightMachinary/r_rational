Hmm, some speculation on a time before lanterns and the first Glimwardens.

If the darklings are as dangerous as as common as it seems, then it seems hard to imagine a world with darklings but without lanterns - they go together. A lantern can be used to create a shadow... so perhaps lanterns aren't just safe areas, perhaps they also create the darklings in the first place!

I imagine it as a lantern being created as a weapon, a source of darklings - only those that survived found they couldn't turn the lantern off without dying to the darklings too. As time passes, for them to travel or expand their settlements they must create new lanterns; always with a ring of darklings around them.

I'm probably wrong here, but it's fun to speculate :)
