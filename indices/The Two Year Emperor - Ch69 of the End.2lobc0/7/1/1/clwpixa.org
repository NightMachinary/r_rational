For the record, a 1-solar-mass black hole has a radius of about [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=schwarzschild+radius+for+1+solar+mass][3km]] and takes 2 * 10^{67} years to evaporate, which is 1.5 * 10^{57} time the age of the universe.

1 billion solar masses evaporate in 2 * 10^{94} years, or 15 * 10^{84} universes.

One solar mass /might/ have been enough, but you can never quite be sure :D

Also, Wolfram|Alpha is the best.
