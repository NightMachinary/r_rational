Well that was super well thought out. I'm wondering if Suze is going to end up Empress in ~1.5 years. But I have the dreaded feeling that she's going to get too close to ascending at some point into the goddess of badassary and the other Gods erasing her before it happens.

Also kind of wishing that Suze was called Suzy instead. Then we could have gotten the line "Suzy do that thing!" before kicking Neklos into next week.
