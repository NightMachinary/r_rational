I really, really enjoyed the original Avatar (even though you're right about the ending, but eh. Kid's show.), but I can't bloody stand Korra. Watched one season of it, and just couldn't get into it.

She is. Very annoyingly so.

#+begin_quote
  is Korra as annoying as Aang with the whole "Thou shalt not do cool things kill"
#+end_quote

Not really. She's a bit of an opposite of Aang in this respect. Which ends up an annoying flaw, also, because she just comes off as a dumb brute most of the time.

But that's my gripes with it. I suggest you watch the first season and decide for yourself.
