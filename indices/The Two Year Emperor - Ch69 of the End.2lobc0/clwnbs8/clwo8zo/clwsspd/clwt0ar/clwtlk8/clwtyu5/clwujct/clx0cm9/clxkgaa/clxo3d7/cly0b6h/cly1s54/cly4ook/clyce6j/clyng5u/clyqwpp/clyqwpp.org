No psionics around, I'm afraid.

As to the Wish / XP / SLA thing -- if you need to have the XP in the ring, just Wish for a RotW that has XP in it and Bob's your uncle.

As to moving bodies...one of the tricks with D&D is that just having the knowledge isn't good enough. You also need to have the levels, which you only get through XP. Afi switched into an Ice Assassin of himself, so he didn't give up much (if anything) in the way of spellcasting ability (his body had the spell slots). Shifting into, say, a 1st-level commoner? Unclear whether it's the body's spell slots or the mind's spell slots that matter.
