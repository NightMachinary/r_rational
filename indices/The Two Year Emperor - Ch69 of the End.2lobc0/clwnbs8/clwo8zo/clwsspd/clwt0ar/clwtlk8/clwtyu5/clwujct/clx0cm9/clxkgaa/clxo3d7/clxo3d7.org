Well, liches don't age and are tough as hell to kill so, in theory, yes. In practice they /can/ be outfought and are still subject to accidental death. This usually isn't a problem for them because if killed they just regenerate back at their phylactery (where their soul is). The Afi-lifeboat-created-by-Mindscrape doesn't have a soul and therefore doesn't have a phylactery, so he can't....

Oh, hang on.

Humans can go through the ritual to become a lich and make a phylactery. So, if lifeboat-Afi PAOs into a human, he could do the enlichment ceremony, which would give him a soul and a phylactery.

That's just nuts. And I love it.
