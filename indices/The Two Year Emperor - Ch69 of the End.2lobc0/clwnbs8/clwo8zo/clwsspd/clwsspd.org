And that is why you never go into battle without [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/foresight.htm][foresight]] up and running. Brilliant plan

Im kinda confused as to why Ice Afi was needed though. Wish can teleport people regardless of local conditions across planes. Give 29816 a ring of wish, order him to stand somewhere on the material plane and wish Lich Afi to him in a day. That way Lich Afi only has to /programmed amnesia/ himself to remember when he gets teleported. No worry about losing his soul then.
