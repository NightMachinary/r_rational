Wait, so was this at all part of Jake's plan? She was acting by herself? I'd figured Jake had told her what to do, then Amnesia'd himself and her and etc. But if it was her own prerogative, then a Flobovian just out-munchkined both Jake /and/ Neklos. That's ... Wow. I look forward to what she does in the future.
