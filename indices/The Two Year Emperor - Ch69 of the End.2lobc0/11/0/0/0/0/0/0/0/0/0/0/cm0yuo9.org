Yes, the original plan was to use a singularity to time-dilate Neklos; they just didn't think that one person could do it. In part that's because they were contingency-planning for the case where Afi / other people attacked at the same time they were getting into it with Neklos. In part that's because they figured that Neklos would use Celerity to beat the initiative of whomever tried to cast the PAO and might be able to Celerity multiple times in a round, so they would need multiple people with Celerity in order to beat him out.

They did not anticipate that Neklos would take them all out in a surprise round at the beginning, or that Suze would take Neklos out in a surprise round at the end.

EDIT: She knew about singularities because back in chapter 68, just as they were getting ready to leave for their meeting with Afi, Jake passed around a piece of paper telling them what to do. The writing on it was not explicitly revealed, but it was something along the lines of "when I give the signal, you cast PAO 'thingy to singularity of one billion solar masses.'"
