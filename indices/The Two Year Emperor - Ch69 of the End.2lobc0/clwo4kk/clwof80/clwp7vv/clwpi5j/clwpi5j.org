As far as I know, /no one/ knows anything about what happens inside an event horizon. AFAIK, there aren't even theoretical treatments of it. (Kerr has a theory about being able to use spinning black holes for time travel, but I don't believe that he covers what's happening inside the event horizon.)

Since it's unknown, I chose this interpretation because it makes a good story.
