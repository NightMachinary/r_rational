Yeah, I'm not seeing how that didn't just implode the whole pl....

Wait a minute. Plane Shift. They were on a demiplane. Afi's base is on its own demiplane.

They just effectively annihilated it.

And that didn't kill Neklos right away, because if it did he would have seen it coming weeks in advance.

But when you are that close to an event horizon *time slows down.*

So if Neklos can see death 20 weeks in advance, the time dilation on that plane, within METERS of a 1 billion solar mass singularity must be on the order of millions to one at least. Anything inside there won't die - to the perspective of the outside multiverse - for centuries, even maybe millennia.

And the osmium, that was through FIRST, before the singularity took effect. So it will destroy the gems, and perhaps sever Death's hand, but not kill him.

Then the time dilation hits. The Plane Shift was part of the defining action, which Celerity was used in response to, so the Celerity effect happens a plank time length before the responding effect. That's not enough time for the gravity waves or time dilation to propagate to Suze/Jake, so they escape before it takes hold.

Jesus, this is a convoluted combination of real world physics and D&D magic action economy manipulation.

*Bravo.*
