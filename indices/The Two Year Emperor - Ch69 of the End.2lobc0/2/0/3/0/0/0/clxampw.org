You know, mayhaps I shall watch this show, after all.

I was a little put off by the ending of the original avatar (No, Aang. Sometimes, you needs to kills the villain. To death. So that he dies. Really.), but perhaps LoK will be less irritating.

If I might pick your brains, is Korra as annoying as Aang with the whole "Thou shalt not +do cool things+ kill", and/or is she annoyingly proud of being the Avatar? Those two are pet peeves, so I need to know how prevalent they are so I know how strong a drink to nurse with each episode.
