You really need to keep watching. Korra and the entire cast show great development. It's as if the events in their lives actually mean something to them. There's much less "I'm the avatar deal with it!" and more "Am I relevant in the present world?"

Each season has gotten better and fixed many flaws from previous seasons. I ain't watch TV while doing something else so I tend to not really see the flaws.
