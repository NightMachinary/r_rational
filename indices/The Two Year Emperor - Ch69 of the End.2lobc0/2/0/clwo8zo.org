GOAT move?

They survived because Suze totally speedbagged the rules. Specifically, here's what she did:

1. Pull a spell component from her pouch. (free action, takes zero time)
2. Cast Plane Shift (standard action, you only get one per round)
3. Cast Celerity (immediate action, provides a readied action to cast another spell)
4. Using that readied action, cast PAO to create a black hole.

The way readied actions work is that they interrupt another action zero time before that action happens. Because of this, a series of actions and readied actions resolves last-to-first. So, here's what actually happened:

1. The PAO went off, creating a black hole which would have trapped them in time dilation (which is what happened to Neklos)...
2. Zero time later, the Plane Shift went off, dragging Suze and Jake (whom she was holding on to) out of the room and back to the Prime Material...
3. Zero time later, as they were in the middle of Plane Shifting, she threw a piece of antimatter into the room.

Where did the AM come from? Well, every wizard has a [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Spell_Component_Pouch][spell component pouch]]. "[A] spell component pouch is assumed to [contain] all the material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for those components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that wouldn't fit in a pouch. "

The material component for the spell [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/majorCreation.htm][Major Creation]] (which is based off of [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/minorCreation.htm][Minor Creation]] and therefore has the same material component) is "A tiny piece of matter of the same sort of item you plan to create" So, if you want to use Major Creation to produce antimatter, that means that your spell component pouch somehow contains antimatter...but hasn't blown up because /rules/. A spell component pouch isn't magical, so it wasn't disrupted by the Disjunctions that the heroes were hit with back in the Receiving Room.

The reason for the AM was to destroy the gems that were trapping everyone's souls (and material bodies), and then to destroy those material bodies. With them dead, they can be resurrected from outside the hole.

Neklos isn't dead, and he will Plane Shift out of the black hole and back to the Prime Material next round. Of course, what he thinks of as "next round" will be several trillion years (or more) in the outside universe....

EDIT: I should have mentioned: the reason she was able to do all this before Neklos could do anything was because she caught him in a [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/initiative.htm][surprise round]]. He wasn't aware that she was a combatant, so he was caught flat-footed and unable to take any actions.
