Won't the time dilation slow down the time to their deaths too? The fastest death they would suffer would be from the energy from the matter-antimatter reaction reaching them in (distance from them to the antimatter when it starts reacting)/c which might be very small in terms of their referential, but would still be slowed down to infinity as it is inside the event horizon.

Or are we using here another definition of destruction due to antimatter?
