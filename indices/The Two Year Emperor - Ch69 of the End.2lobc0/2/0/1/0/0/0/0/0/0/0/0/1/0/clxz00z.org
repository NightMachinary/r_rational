I don't think the lichdom ceremony creates one, I think PAO does it.

Biggest hint I can see for that is that undead beings become susceptible to spells like programmed amnesia and mindscrape once you PAO them into a mortal body. I think those spells might work by altering the soul along with the mind since they can do things like change alignment. Undead normally can't be effected by these things not because they're /mindless/ (Afi would probably have a few choice words for you if you claimed that) but rather because they're /soulless./ So that might indicate that they get a soul when they're in the right body.

Another bit of evidence: Neklos is using PAO to create humans, and then ghouls to drain them and turn them into more ghouls. The ghoulification process and undead creation in general (especally the creation of intelligent undead like vampires, who probably make up the priesthood of Neklos) probably requires a soul to be consumed/corrupted. So the PAO-people probably have souls.
