  I think those spells might work by altering the soul along with the mind since they can do things like change alignment.

Technically /Afi/ is doing that. Neklos wants him to, of course, but needs to keep some plausible deniability. Even the other Death-oriented gods would jump on him if he were caught doing it himself.
