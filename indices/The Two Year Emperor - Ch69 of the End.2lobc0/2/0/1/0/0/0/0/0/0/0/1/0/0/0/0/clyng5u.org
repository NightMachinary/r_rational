Yeah sorry, I was assuming he'd have a ring of wish with extra xp stored in it. I dont know if sla wish would work since it says specifically that you have to make the phylactery.

Also thinking on it, I believe all Ice-fi needs to do to get out of the ice assassin restrictions is move to another body. The spell's effect is "one duplicate creature" so it might not follow their mind/soul if it moves out of that creature. Just as a /eagle's splendor/ targets a creature and doesnt follow that creatures mind if it moves. Of course ice assassin is is literally creating the creature and isnt an ongoing effect so that is a bit of a stretch.

Find a psion who knows /true mind switch/ and some poor smuck to stick in the ice assassin, do the mind switch shuffle, and you are golden.
