Well, it may not be impossible to get around. It says it cannot increase those things, not that it cant mess around with what it already has...

If we use the ritual of unlearning/vitality (savage species pg149), Ice-fi can turn himself back into a human (for reals) by losing the lich template he inherited from Afi.

Regaining it is a bit weirder as we will have to use a ring of wish to get around the xp needed for creating a phylactery, but no big deal to a uber lich. Ice-fi gets the lich template and his ecl goes back up to where it started, less some gp, plus a soul(?). Same ecl that we started at, same abilites, no increase.

However, that hinges upon the interpretation that when ice assassin says "more powerful" it means more powerful than at the time it was created. If we want to be mean we could read that to mean it cant become more powerful at all, period. That intepretation leads to weird things though, like being unable to prepare spells or not being affected by buffs, so I wouldnt go there.

However, still not impossible to do. We just have to make sure to never go down in power. Using class level rebuilding from PHB2 Ice-fi can just swap out class levels to get Walker in the Waste 10 which gives the dry lich template. If we are being really pedantic, just make sure the levels we lose are "more powerful" than what we gain so we end up at a net loss. The swap happens simultaneously so it should work. It sucks, but this interpretation leads to worse problems than that.
