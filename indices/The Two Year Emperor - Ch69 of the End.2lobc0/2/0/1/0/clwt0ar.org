The point was exactly to get rid of his soul. His soul is permanently bonded to the Godshard, which gives Neklos power over him. He had no way of getting the shard out on his own, and no way to get rid of his soul completely. Basically what he did was to make a lifeboat for himself by copying himself into a different body, then destroying the original one. The new one has no soul and so it can't regenerate at the phylactery the way Afi can. In fact, it can't heal /at all/, without the help of a complicated ritual that requires lab tools. Still, it's better than being permanently under Neklos's thumb.

Best of all, Neklos is /absolutely certain/ that Afi is dead; Afi's soul is sitting right there in his hand, after all. He'll never bother looking for a copy of Afi elsewhere.
