Basically, but my way leaves you with a hazardous portable hole that has to be disposed of, lest someone opens it and destroys the world. And Neklos can probably get Afi out, whereas your way /takes care of Neklos directly/ and no other gods are gonna intervene on his behalf. The good ones won't touch him, and the evil ones would rather take over his schemes for their own purposes.
