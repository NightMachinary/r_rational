I think it's mainly because this is largely a sub about sharing works, and it's much harder for a thread full of people to all read the same novel than to all read the same webpage.

The other reason is that it's a /really/ niche genre, so there are relatively few print books that fit. Sanderson gets brought up a lot here, mainly because of the way he approaches magic. And I think a lot of hard sci-fi (The Martian and The Expanse come to mind) could theoretically fit, but isn't discussed because of the web-fiction status quo.
