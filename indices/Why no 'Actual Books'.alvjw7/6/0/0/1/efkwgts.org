Limiting access to non-harmful luxuries does not make you a bad person. Could you explain your account of morality here in a little more depth? My interpretation is that you seem to be saying if one isn't a Good Samaritan then they must be a Bad Samaritan. It's a step that needs to be argued to equivocate aid with the fruits of one's labour, just as it is to equivocate watching someone drown with not sending all your non-essential income to charity.

I have a question for you: is it possible to possess /mens rea/ in the absence of any /actus reus/?

If you answer that with yes, I would love to hear an example. If no, I'm not sure how failing to publish books for free makes you a bad person. If you take the third option and deny Western legal tradition as representative of morality, then I take issue with your claim's "obviousness."
