  and someone for whom financial reward is a motivator rather than an enabler isn't going to write good literature anyway.

I can tell you this for sure, we'd have a lot less fan fiction and other types of internet fiction if authors couldn't think of it as practice for when they do write books and as a way to get an audience.

Also without donations and patreon you can bet updates and new chapters would come out much more slowly.

  Why do you equate ambition with selfishness or desire to make money? I reject that.

Why do you equate selfishness and desire to make money with being a bad person? I reject that.

There are basically 3 basic motivators, social proof and it's variations, resources money and the like, the need to fit in.

Charity = social proof, Fame = social proof, Being good = Fitting in...

By themselves they aren't evil or bad, what makes people bad is if they intentionally cause harm to achieve those things.

Wanting money by itself is not bad, it's an important resource, just because some people that want it are bad doesn't mean everybody that does is bad..
