I think one factor is that people here tend to like works that dig deep into their premise and examine every inch of it. This is more well-suited to longer works (like web serials) than it is for novels. In principle we could imagine a 'real' series fitting this quality, but for whatever reason, there aren't that many that fit into the rational bucket.

Also, mass appeal. People who write real books are usually going for mass appeal, and rational fiction is a bit of a niche.
