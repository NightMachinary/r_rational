Stories that update regularly also lend themselves to group discussions more than a book that is released as a complete work, since discussion threads can go up every few weeks, whereas for books there's not really a Schelling point for discussion apart from the book's release, which isn't really a great time to discuss the book since very few people will read a book cover-to-cover on the day or even the same week it is released.

If you wanted to discuss the latest Brandon Sanderson novel, some people might have read the entire thing the week after it's released, whereas some people might take several months to get through it. A 400,000 word Sanderson tome, read at an average rate of 300 WPM, is a 22 hour read. Compare that to a Mother of Learning update, where even a relatively long chapter (~8000 words) can be read in under half an hour at the same rate, which makes it easy for lots of people to be on the same page (literally).
