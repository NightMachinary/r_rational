He's technically the best current fantasy author out there. His work is consistently great and well reviewed. He's intelligent enough to be somewhat rational with his characters, and manage to pull plot twists while giving hints throughout the book without being too obvious to people of high IQ.

You shouldn't let your bad first impression, no doubt from him taking over a series you liked and not being exactly like it's original author, stop you from enjoying his work. He's a great author, worldbuilder, with very interesting and creative magic systems.
