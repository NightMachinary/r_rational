Going to have to disagree with your first sentence. The vast majority of webfic, even the webfic posted on this subreddit, would need major editing to make the grade for actual publishing. Second, there is a wealth of fantastic literature dating back hundreds of years - if your only criterion is 'good,' you're more likely to be able to read a new, good book than find a new, good webfic.

There are a few genres and subject areas that are pretty shallow in terms of extant literature that see a lot more treatment online, for example, AI. These also tend to be areas of interest that overlap a lot with 'rational' fiction and crop up here more often.

That said, /Neuromancer/ came out thirty-five years ago and while the AI aspects are only tangential to the main themes, as a work of writing it's yet to be equaled by anything you can find online for free, imo.
