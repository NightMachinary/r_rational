Your original comment was basically criticizing book authors because they limit the availability of their work on the internet to get more money. I therefore assumed you preferred the other types of fiction people enjoy here, but my point still holds and my arguments are still solid.

Besides these are all written as I think, sorry if some of the points aren't as comprehensive as they'd need to be 100% correct or at least close to it.

But we understand each other, and hopefully we are both better off after having this conversation =D
