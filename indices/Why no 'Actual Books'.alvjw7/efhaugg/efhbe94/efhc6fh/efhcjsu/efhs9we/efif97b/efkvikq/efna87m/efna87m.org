Fair, maybe I'm hooked-up to enough forums/sub/rss feeds that I have more good web-fic to read than I have time for any random paper book out there. I still think that the vast majority of books on the average Barns&Noble shelf follow a predictable pattern/narrative, which is why I got into webfic in the first place.
