  That has to be weighed against the author's ability to survive and achieve whatever other goals they may have

Well, yeah?

Like, for most authors publishing traditional books, it /is/ their job. They devote all their time to writing. It's how they make a living. I guess some successful authors are rolling in dough, but they are the exception. I think most career authors don't actually make that much. They need to publish for profit because they need to, like, eat.
