Your line, which really my entire post was aimed at, was that "obviously" it makes someone a bad person not to publish their labour for free. I know legality and morality aren't synonyms. You've missed my point. Our societal legal norms are a mirror of our moral norms. They're ostensibly aimed in the same direction and at the same purpose.

You can hold, as Peter Singer does, that it's a duty to maximize good by doing as much as possible. But the intuition of most people regarding duty is not so stark; you certainly can't espouse that kind of ethic in a discussion as if it's self-evident.

Maybe a more communal economy is a more virtuous one, but it's not the one we live in. If I can't afford car insurance, is it selfish of the auto dealer not to give me a free vehicle? No. Labour economics still apply to the arts, and your idea that to an artist motivated by money somehow either creates inherently flawed art or demeans the value of that art is a bizarre interpretation of quality.

Lastly, my point about "guilty" intent was only intended as a bit of a thought experiment designed to get you thinking about what metric a person's virtue is evaluated on. I'm sure I phrased it badly, so the following is an effort to make it more clear.

I'm not trying a crime and trying to meet the legal benchmark for guilt. It's more about the theoretical idea of whether one can be a bad person without the intent to commit a bad act. In cases of prevented crimes, the would-be perpetrator still has the intent to do a harmful thing. You can also do harms without or with different levels guilty intent (recklessness, negligence, and ignorance).

However the crux of my question was this: can you, absent an act or intended act, still be possessed of harmful intent? Keep in mind that a commitment to, say, withhold aid or not act is still an 'act' of sorts in itself.
