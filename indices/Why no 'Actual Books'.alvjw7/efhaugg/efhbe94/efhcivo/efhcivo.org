This gets at one of the reasons I'm asking the question. Most of your points boil down to 'people are lazy on the internet'. The points above boil down to 'availability and the upvote system'.

Some kind of monthly attempt to go through back catalogues, pick up X or Y old good book and look at it through this lens might be rewarding. This wouldn't even have to be community run - one individual could just start doing it- monthly summary post, their thoughts on the story, on the rational-rating, ending by listing what book will be discussed next month.
