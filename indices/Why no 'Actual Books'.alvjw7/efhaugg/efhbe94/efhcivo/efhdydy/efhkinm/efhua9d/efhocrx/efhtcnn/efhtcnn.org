I did that once with the book /Godel, Escher, and Bach/. We had a group discussion where I posted about each chapter and posted questions for everyone to discuss.

Here's the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2yys1i/lets_start_the_read_through/][link]] to the posts on the chapters if you want to look at an example of something similar to what you suggested on this subreddit. Just be warned that I dropped out four chapters from the end because I ended up having to deal with finals and then a hectic summer job.

Also, there's a page in the wiki about a short stint where for six months we had an actual [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/monthlybookclub][book club]].
