Mostly we discuss stuff we want to read. I've brought up things I was looking forward to that we're rational adjacent (The Monster Baru) and promptly panned it probably more than needed as others liked the direction it swerved away (biopunk and wierd karma magic/syncronocity) from what I like about it.

The other half is good hard Sci-Fi is rare or at least hard to find. Something new in the subs interest will be on the page, I'll listen to it before two weeks pass, but it'll often be popcorn compared to some of the serials the sub has followed.

As to the older stuff I'm guessing people think it's been discussed.

All of this is IMHO
