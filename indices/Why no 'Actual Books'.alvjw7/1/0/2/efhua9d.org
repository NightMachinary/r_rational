Last year there was a monthly book club that I ran with help from [[/u/callmesalticidae]], it was really difficult as people didn't discuss the books that much, even though we announced the book a month in advance. It wasn't perfectly organised of course, but I wasn't super motivated either because the uptake was so low.
