Well, because it's paid, I think.

I suspect a (free) pdf of the book would be realistically necessary for most of people who click on it to read it. (At which point a chapter by chapter discussion would probably be the optimal format)

This would be very doable with the older works that tend to be available online. There's a few that i would consider canonically in the genre (Vonnegut? Pratchett? Egan?)
