I've been here for years, in one form or another, and there used to be more discussion of non-web-fiction stuff; but that's changed for a few reasons.

1. There's a good amount of fiction specific to this subreddit posted here, which is enough to tide people over.

2. The community has matured from the early days---it was formed as a reaction to non-rational fiction, so people could be openly critical of fiction without getting the canned "Just turn off your brain and enjoy it" response, but that's not needed anymore. We all implicitly understand that most fiction is kind of dumb, with rare exceptions. When the community was new there were a lot of those rare exceptions to talk about, but now we all know about them, so all that's left to talk about is new rational fiction.

3. The weekly discussion threads provide a lot of this discussion.
