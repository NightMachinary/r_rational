First off, a book releases once. It might have 50 chapters and be 120k words long, and it still releases only once. On the other hand, we can discuss updates of things that publish chapter-by-chapter online /every time it updates/. This fosters discussion here and in-depth readings and arguments and so forth - a natural 'book club' effect as we all read and react to the same piece fosters discussion. A book by comparison isn't as amenable to the repeated close discussion and speculation, due to the format releasing the entire story at once.

Secondly, books have a barrier to entry and also tend to have a delay. You have to buy and read the book, instead of just clicking on a hyperlink. People like me might not buy and read many books new, instead getting them from the library the vast majority of the time, or cheaply used / on sale. By the time I've read something by an author I don't know, trust, and love enough to buy blindly on the first day, it'll often be six months or more since initial release - maybe longer. At that point, I /could/ make a discussion thread so that the other people who've read the book can discuss it... but there's not a lot of impetus to do so.

Finally, there're tons of larger subreddits for discussing novels that are 'flawed' (i.e. not-rationalist - though considering things not-rationalist to be inherently flawed is sort of an asshole / pretentious wanker outlook - but I digress). [[/r/fantasy]] and [[/r/printsf]] are great and I read and post both subreddits occasionally.
