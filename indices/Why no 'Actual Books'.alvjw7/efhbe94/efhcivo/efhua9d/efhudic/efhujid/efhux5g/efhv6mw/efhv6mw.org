I don't think so - the announcement thread talks about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7mbbmw/monthly_book_club_november_2017_book_discussion/][the first four stories]] (30,000 words) - regardless just about the only posts in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7qy6ih/monthly_book_club_january_2017_book_discussion/][the discussion thread]] apart from mine were from the author. it's a pity as the tidal wave passage that I quoted in full in particular has been very meaningful to me.
