We did that though: I remember selecting /Passages in the Void/, which was a series of ~3 main short stories (I think there's 9 total in the extended universe). I don't think anyone commented on that - even though the /goddam author/ posted a couple of times in the thread because he saw it in his traffic log!

It was very sad as I really loved that series and wanted to discuss it with [[/r/rational]]!

Maybe I should post it one chapter at a time over the next few months...
