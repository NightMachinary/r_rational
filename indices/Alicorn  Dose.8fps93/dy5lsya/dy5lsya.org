Alright, I'm not sure I understood this one as well as I usually understand Alicorn stories. Originally I thought the Orange teardrops were the same as her treats, and they might still yet be. More importantly though, they seem to be her attempt to medicate herself such that she would stay motivated to keep doing her job, in order to keep the Mission secret that (at least some of) their drugs are placebos and also so that she's still in the company whenever anything happens regarding that in the future.

That's what I'm assuming, but I do feel as if I may have missed some details.

I'm not quite sure why uni programs and jobs have drug prescriptions attached though and for exactly what reason.
