This is a weird question.

If you think that this sub is a really valuable community then you should engage with the community here. If you're not sure what engagement with the community looks like there are policies around self-promotion which could provide guidance.

We have a weekly recommendations thread and you could post a comment there promoting whatever and writing a pitch for it.

Most of the people who read this sub don't know much about digital advertising, but given what I know about acquisition costs, I'm skeptical that you'd hit positive ROI via ads. It would only work if ads were able to kick off an organic flywheel and if your book is good enough for that you shouldn't need ads to sell it here.

if you're already here, and engaged with reddit you're probably better off just investing time. Several authors self-promote on [[/r/Fantasy][r/Fantasy]] really effectively, so I'd take a look at what they're doing.

EDITS: The comment I was replying to was deleted as I was posting this, so I'm adding it here since I bothered to type it all out.

  Does that make my question less weird?

Asking people "What would be the best way to advertise to you?" is weird. You're basically saying, "Who should I pay to tell you about the thing I want you to head about?" and that's just a really weird way to approach someone. It's also weird because people talk about books they're writing in this subreddit, or in the comments of Scott Alexander's blog or in related spaces all the time. People who are part of one of these (somewhat overlapping) communities are mostly aware of the community norms around self-promotion. Your question on how "to advertise to you" makes it feel like you're not really engaged with this community, and aren't interested in being so. Wanting to pay some third party to promote your message in our community is whatever, but coming and asking us for advice on how to do that is bizarre. Most communities don't like foreign interference, and you've positioned yourself as an outsider that's looking to pay someone to shift to the discourse of this community, and then you've asked the community to help you brainstorm how to do this. I feel like this wasn't your intent, but your language is very commercially focused (advertise, bootstrapped) and you don't put any effort into making the people you're asking for help like you. The result feels so brazenly exploitative it crosses over into "weird."

Probably you want to ask a less-commercially worded question like, "How can I best promote my rational-adjacent novel?"If you want really good answers from focus group research though, you have to ask people about their problems rather than your problems. The people here, in general, don't know how to promote novels. Most of them aren't authors, and most of the ones that are authors don't do digital advertising. They do read a lot though, and they can share with you their experience of how they discover what to read next. "How do you find the next book to read?" is a question that might tell you a bunch about ways to promote your book.

  I'm impressed that you can make this calculation without knowing what I'm publishing, my back catalogue, or how I'm advertising. I wouldn't have any idea how to even ballpark ROI without this information. I'd greatly appreciate it if you were able to walk me through how you approached this calculation and what assumptions you made?

Eh. This is literally my job. I measure digital ad ROI for a living. Paid acquisition costs in Western markets are typically $3-$15 across a really wide range of products. Free gaming apps, personalized health products, custom t-shirts. Prices for ebooks are typically in the $0-$10 range. Maybe you can make it work, but I think my skepticism is warranted.
