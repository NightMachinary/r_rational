  I'm impressed that you can make this calculation without knowing what I'm publishing, my back catalogue, or how I'm advertising. I wouldn't have any idea how to even ballpark ROI without this information. I'd greatly appreciate it if you were able to walk me through how you approached this calculation and what assumptions you made?

My top advice is not being this obnoxious when someone is giving you free advice and you're trying to market a product to them. If you don't realize how you come across, I'd fix that first, because there's a chance it could extend to any advertising you do.
