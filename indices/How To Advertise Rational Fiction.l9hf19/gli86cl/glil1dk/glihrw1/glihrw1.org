Is it a web-release or hard-copy?

RoyalRoad seems to be a strong player in the web-release fiction game, and they have user sponsored advertisements. I'm not sure how granular their advertisement choices are, as I've never used it, but they host RatFic like [Mother of Learning] and [Worth the Candle]. If you expect any cross-readership from existing RatFic then you should probably find a way, RoyalRoad or other, to advertise to those established audiences.

Publishing stuff like LitRPG (which can kinda be RatFic sometimes) on Amazon seems to be pretty big too.

And if you're running a consistent update schedule, then it's free to post those new chapters to reddit and generate discussion. I can guarantee that the discussions here carry over into other forums. Word of mouth advertisement is a real thing.
