Despite its name, Comic Ad (comicad dot net) accepts non-comic ads, works on a pretty low cost bidding system and is a great way to dip your toes into advertising / test out various ad setups. Social media would be my next pitch, though I've not had much luck with it personally (I am bad at social media); at this point in modern history I'd honestly leave conventional paid ads (Facebook ads, etc) as a last resort, they tend to be priced more toward companies than individuals these days.
