People might be reacting negatively because that's what you're throwing out in your edit, but also some people are out off by any mention of advertising in a Reddit community. “I had hope for a higher level of discourse from this community” comes off as a bit [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] and the idea that authors are writing books based on how Reddit subs treat them seems a bit absurd. Trying to shame a sub of people that at least partially tried to give you good advice seems like a bit of a sick move.

Anyway as others have said you really have to start by engaging various communities in a positive manner. Plenty of people on here mention books or worlds they're working on while they write. Rational, worldbuilding, fantasy, and maybe progressionFantasy would all be great subs to post in. There are also lots of discords you could join that are plugging new rational fiction. You could look into working with someone else on a side project as well. Pay someone somewhat known to draw some art for your story, or engage with a voice actor like Voraces or some up and coming narrator to do an audiobook version so they can spread it around. Give out free copies of you weren't already.
