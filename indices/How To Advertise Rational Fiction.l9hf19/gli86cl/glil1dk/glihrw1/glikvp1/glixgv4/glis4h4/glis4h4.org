You probably are aware of most of the places you can find rational stories if you are a reader. If someone else is a fan of rational stories, they are most likely keeping an eye on those same places, like we all are. And since most of those websites have internal raking systems like reviews and likes, there is not much to do besides publishing on those and having a consistent update schedule. The rest just depends on how well written your story is and how much pull your concept has.

I don't think there are many ways to specifically target us. Like most niche hobby communities starved for content, mouth-to-mouth market ends up doing all the heavy lifting. We tend to find you, not the other way around.
