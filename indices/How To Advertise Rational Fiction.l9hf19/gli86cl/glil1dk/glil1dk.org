Inasmuch as there exists a community of readers of rational fiction, it's here + word of mouth. So... just post your work when you release it? There's nothing in the rules outlawing just making a post saying "Hi, there's this work I made, here's why I think it'll be of interest, hope you enjoy". The author of Hey Reincarnation Goddess did that just this week, to literally nobody's complaints.
