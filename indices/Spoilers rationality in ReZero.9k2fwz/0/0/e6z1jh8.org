Stupid how? There are no better exploits for this ability. In fact using it at all isn't smart since there are vastly better ways to gain information about the world and it's magic system available like say reading a book about it. The side-effects are unknown in the beginning and turn out to be more horrific than any potential good it could plausibly be used for aside from perventing the end of humanity as a whole (if you're invested in humanity over the continuation of all life on earth that is). The protagonist uses it to bring people he cares about back from death but this is explicitly a sentimental weakness of his and not anything ethically justifiable.
