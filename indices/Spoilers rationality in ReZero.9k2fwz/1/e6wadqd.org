  While he uses this power fairly rationally,

No he doesn't. Any rational use of a time loop would involve thousands of loops doing research and training rather than frivolously allowing time to progress into drastic situations where you no longer have the luxury of researching in peace.

The only reason you wouldn't do that is if you were worried about some kind of limitation on the number of loops you can do, but the MC has clearly thrown away such worries since he kills himself several times. Or if you were worried about what happens to the world when you loop, but again the MC seems to give no thought to that either.

A less rational explanation would be that death hurts a ton so the MC doesn't want to do it too often, but seeing as he is basically a regular untrained human in a world full of ridiculously powerful superhumans, and he insists on sticking next to an extreme danger magnet because she is "seriously an angel", he is going to die a ton of times anyway. So using several early loops to research and train would probably greatly reduce the total number of deaths in the long run.

The part that ticked me off the most was when>! he discovered he could use magic, then got his magic ability crippled by combat and carried on with the timeline rather than looping to get it back. I mean, seriously? It's magic. It's his one shot at being anywhere decent in combat (not to mention the countless other applications), and he just throws it away? At least loop more to try and keep it.!<
