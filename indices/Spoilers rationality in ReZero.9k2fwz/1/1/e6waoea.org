  Any rational use of a time loop would involve thousands of loops doing research and training

The novel (and anime, to a lesser extent) actually addresses this. Every time he loops in a short amount of meta-time the witches scent grows, which has consequences. At around 5 loops it begins influencing people's decisions regarding him. After several thousand he'd be kill on sight by both people and animals. Bad end.

Edit: An example of this is when he is killed by manor staff, which was after only three or so restarts.
