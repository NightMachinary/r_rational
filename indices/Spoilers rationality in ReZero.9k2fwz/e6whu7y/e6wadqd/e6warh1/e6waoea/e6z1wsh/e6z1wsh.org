  The only reason you wouldn't do that is if you were worried about some kind of limitation on the number of loops you can do, but the MC has clearly thrown away such worries since he kills himself several times. Or if you were worried about what happens to the world when you loop, but again the MC seems to give no thought to that either.

Both are reasons he brings up specifically in regards to why he doesn't and both reasons are throughtly justified.
