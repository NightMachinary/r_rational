At the very least, thank you for a good opening post. You've got the summary, tags, genre, and links laid out nicely. You also did a good job explaining why you think it'd be a good fit here too, which is much appreciated. As self-promotions go, this one was done fairly pretty well!

For anyone else wondering, there are currently 69 chapters out right now -- so presumably enough content to keep a person occupied for a while. (I personally don't start series with less than 30-40 chapters at this point since low chapter series are likely to be abandoned. Also it's painful to get into reading a thing and be stopped by low chapter count early on.)
