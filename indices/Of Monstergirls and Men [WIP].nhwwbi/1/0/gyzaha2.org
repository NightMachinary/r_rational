Thanks!

I am currently trying to figure out a way to make a living out of writing, the nice people over at royalroad/scribblehub/fiction.live helped me enough to be able to cover for my basic expenses.

So I'm currently keeping a relative posting rhythm of about 4-5 chapters per week over at RoyalRoad. The current total wordcount is at shyly above 200K words.

All this writing has helped me realize there's a LOT of things I need to get better at, so I find that having more perspectives (even if not positive ones) helps me find out where I can put more effort into!
