Regardless of if this work is trash I get the feeling this is not this kind of reply the community of this subreddit will appreciate. Good? Debatable and not my cuppa. Rational? Maybe, maybe not, I've not read beyond the first chapter myself so I'm not sure. But a read of the sidebar and many of the prior discussions about what content belongs here implies to me that OP's honest attempt at hitting some of the genre points(evidenced by the well done self-promotion post) has at least earned them constructive criticism rather than whatever you consider this post to be.
