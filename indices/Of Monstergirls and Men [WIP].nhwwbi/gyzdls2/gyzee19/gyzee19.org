This is a complete 2.0 of the original quest, I had originally been aiming at a repost but after a while I went "fuck it, I can do better than this" and went all in.

Though I intend to keep the story beats relatively the same, the bigger differences (in characterization/plot/interactions) with the original start to emerge shortly after reaching civilization.

The biggest first hit to the original story is the Kiara/Tomas aspect, getting a decent re-contextualization I'm much happier with (also lots of new things being dumped into the story that didn't show up in the quest, such as everything in the time skip meeting Kiara and finding Eva).

PS: Definitely suggest you read the scribblehub version since I did some cosmetic changes for RoyalRoad ToS.
