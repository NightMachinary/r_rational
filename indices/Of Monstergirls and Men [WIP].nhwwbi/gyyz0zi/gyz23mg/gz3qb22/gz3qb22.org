  I had added that first piece into the first chapter because the survival part of the story would leave enough of an impression that when things change gear due to reaching civilizations many readers appeared to not take things all that well.

I would not recommend doing that. It can work, but the times I've actually seen it work are very, very rare, compared to how often I see it attempted. Heck, I can probably count the number of /any/ sort of flash forward that I enjoyed at the start of a story on one hand (I will always <3 the /Firefly/ episode "Trash," though, which pulled the flash forward off exquisitely).

If you want to have a radical gear change in the story you're telling without losing people, I can think of two ways to make it work.

The first way is to tell one complete story in one gear, and then tell another in a different gear. For instance, the first Captain America movie is a WWII war story (with superheroes) and the second is a modern spy thriller (with superheroes). Telling them as one story wouldn't work, but by giving each story its own beginning, middle, and end, and then framing one as a sequel to the other, the two can exist as very different stories within a single continuity.

Another option would be to intercut between the two stories. A very good example of this is Game of Thrones, which is a political story intercut with action-adventure and zombie apocalypse. And, for the most part, it works, and that's because Jon and the zombie story, and Dany and the adventure story, are kept in the readers' minds while the politics plays out; the narrative keeps cutting back to them. If you establish the survival genre as an integral part of the story early, there won't be any shock when it becomes more prominent. The caveat here is that whatever genre the first part of the story is, you'll probably want to maintain it somewhat, basically reversing the intercut, so that your don't lose the readers who were interested in that part of the story.

The simplest option, of course, is that if you want to tell a survival story, but you feel that there's too much shock switching to that after the set-up, *cut out most of the set-up*. Leave enough so that we have a good taste of what the protagonist's status quo was before the events of the story disrupted it, and then have the story grab them by the collar and drag them into full survival mode. Then you don't have that radical gear-change (or rather, you do, but it's right at the beginning, so the reader is pulled right along). My omnibus copy of the epic fantasy series /The Belgariad/ is 1,375 pages long, and the protagonist is forced to start his adventure on about page 60. Because it's not a story about a farm.

What all of these have in common is that they don't set a false expectation in the mind of the reader. Trying to fix that by shoehorning a later part of the story into the beginning usually causes exactly the same problem, adding a /second/ gear change, and leaving the reader even /more/ confused about what kind of story they're reading.
