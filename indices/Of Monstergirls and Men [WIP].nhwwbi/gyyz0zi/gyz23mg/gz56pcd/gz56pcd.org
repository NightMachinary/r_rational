+1 for me absolutely hating flash-forwards of any kind; either I try forget about it, tell myself its not cannon or it ruins the whole rest of the story because I feel like I'm not progressing because I've already seen what happens after all this.

The flash-forward of Purple Days stopped me being able to get enough interest to read the rest for years, and probably is the main reason why I've dropped it atm (it being absolutely brilliant otherwise IMO).

I'd recommend either 1. Putting it in a skippable prologue (and saying its skippable) which I almost always skip the prologue from Isekai's anyway.

or 2. remove it and just mention in your description that you get to civilization fast and it stops being a survival.^can't see how a flash forward is better than this in any way.
