I think its completely a personal taste thing; I've heard from others half the people like it, half don't. Personally I can't stand it as I said, it turns me off the rest of the story, its worse than spoilers for some reason. The fact the spoiler is in character and shows an actual scene is that makes it so bad for me I think.
