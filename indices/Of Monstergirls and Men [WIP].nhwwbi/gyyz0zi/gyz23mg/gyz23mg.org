I had added that first piece into the first chapter because the survival part of the story would leave enough of an impression that when things change gear due to reaching civilizations many readers appeared to not take things all that well.

I'm definitely trying to figure out some alternate thing/way to put it down without bogging everything or doing too heavy a spoiler of what happens further down the line. It certainly looks like making it as a very short piece backfired though.

The second part (the one with the student) is one I've been wanting to keep but that I might have to remove entirely in favour of keeping it all within Rick's perspective.

Thanks a bunch for the comment!
