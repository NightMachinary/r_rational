Just binged. Is this a subgenre that I was happily unaware of? First the Erogamer, and now this? Is there going to be a recurring pattern of "Good world building + smut + unaware / isekai-d protagonist + convoluted justification for getting laid => profit"??? Like, good for you @author, exploration of unexplored narrative tracks is great, and this is good/fun quality writing, but I wonder at whether the entire /rationalizing/ train is so overwrought that, compared to the uninspired norm, diving into sexual dynamics is now legitimately a decent track to follow.

I just sort of feel like we are scraping the bottom of the /X + Rational = Novel Story Idea/ barrel when one of the better and more interesting new stories I've seen in a while on this sub is r!Furries / r!PokemonSmut.
