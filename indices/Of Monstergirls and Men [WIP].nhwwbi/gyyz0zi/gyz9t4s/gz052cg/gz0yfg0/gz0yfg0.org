I enjoy checking and testing and writing bout interesting personalities, one of my favorite genres is mind control in fact. And the aspect of human attraction/sexuality and behaviour around it is a rather fascinating thing that, to me, is rarely ever put to the test.

I feel that one of the reasons why the story/setting I'm writing on is fascinating to me is because it does that testing. The Monstergirls are, at the end of the day, Human+, and that "+" is what drives that test to its logical conclussion.

What happens when instinct meets rationality? Where is the edge between the two? What behaviors are sought out of desire? What aspects of your attraction to someone else is brought about by your genes? By the environment you grew up in? By your own decisions and rationality? How far can you be pushed outside the conceptual space you grew up in?

The setting as a whole is an incredibly fun playground for these considerations. Ferals are literally creatures that have grown up and only ever been guided by their instincts. What happens when they gain rationality? How far can they change?

To say nothing that the Monstergirls themselves, even when tamed, exist within a bubble of pressures that humans rarely go through. What happens to your sexual tastes and desires when they move from a reward to a need? What happens when you are constantly forced to engage in sex out of a basic urge no different to hunger? What happens when there is a literal psychic bond that nudges you to actually enjoy it with a specific individual you happen to be with right now above anyone else?

It's incredibly fun to chew on the perspectives and run them through the wringer tbh. I'm not sure why [[/r/rational][r/rational]] might feel stagnant to you, but I am sure why I love the shit out of writing r!Furries/r!PokemonSmut when it comes to characterization.
