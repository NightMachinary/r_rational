Might try reading this later. But that summary reminds me a bit of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fear-surprise-and-ruthless-efficiency-monster-girl-encyclopedia-si-oc-undergoing-repairs.748180/][this fic]], where you try and take on the actual ramifications of a shitty smut world.

It's a bit hard to navigate these types of worlds. On one hand, copious mind control. On the other hand, transhumanism is morally neutral. On one hand, you don't want to go pure reactionary puritan and say anything of any sexual nature is evil. But it's a bit rough to navigate sexual positivity in a rape world.

So I'll probably give this a shot later. Hopefully it goes in a good direction. That said, still might not be my thing, regardless.
