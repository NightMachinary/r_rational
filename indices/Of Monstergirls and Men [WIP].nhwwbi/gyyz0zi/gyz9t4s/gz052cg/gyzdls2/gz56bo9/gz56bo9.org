I'd like the opinion of the sub + author on this;

A long time ago, I've read some other stories set in this universe and one thing that I never really understood was what seemed to be a punishment fetish that pretty much all these stories had.What I mean by that, is where a character does something bad, and is punished, but crucially; said character is extremely remorseful and regrets their action (not just the consequences but the actual original action) and apologies profusely. (Note, in this story it would be what occurs with Diane? I think that was her name).

What kind of rubs me the wrong way here; is to me, punishment is completely inappropriate in this sort of situation. In a situation where an individual does a bad action, and after being informed of all the facts (including how they made others feel etc) regrets that action, punishing said person does *nothing*. Not only is it not fair (they didn't know better) but I would say it achieves nothing (other than maybe nock-on effects such as it being an example to others, but on all these cases this isn't really so). The individual would not do the action again anyway, and all it does it hurt them emotionally.

I don't know, it may be that I am just really adverse to punishment in general, but I never understood how someone could live with that I guess.
