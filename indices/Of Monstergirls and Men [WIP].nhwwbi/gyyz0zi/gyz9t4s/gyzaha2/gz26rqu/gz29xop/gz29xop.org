I hunted down writers who were building up support through Patreon and taking a good long look at what they were doing (even subbing to several to have a closer check). I also contacted those I could to ask about the whole thing.

[[https://www.patreon.com/ravStories][This is mine currently]], I'm barely scraping by right now, but I have hopes it'll keep rising towards a level where I can actually survive on it and keep going forward. It took me around 7 months to reach the current level.

How much work? A lot (I'm currently outputting something like 3-5K words a day on average and working about 5-6 hours a day).

At the end of the day the more work per day you dedicate to it the faster it will grow. You're going to want to start hard, generate as much content as you can as quickly as you can nearing the start of things. You're going to want to have an explosive beginning because many algorithms will favour your high output and bump you.

If you don't, you're better off keeping the content at a slow steady stream for a long while before you jump in to go explosive.

Either way, you should always make sure to adapt the format/presentation of your content to the websites you're aiming at. A bit of a chore, but it helps to know what gets bumped around where (also try to aim to have your content in as many places as possible at least at first, until you've properly trimmed down which sites react best to your work and which don't).

Regardless of what strategy you use, you need to keep the focus on A) What you're providing for free, and B) What you're providing at a cost.

Free content is always going to be your primary source of advertisement to draw in people. Some people like to put premium content and then trickle it out to the freemium public after a while, others lock certain content and never let it go, others just write everything for free and use Patreon more as an alternate income to whatever projects they're developing that earns them the main cash.

Past all this, patience. Loooots of patience, loooots of "I did everything I could and nothing seems to have happened" day in and day out over and over and over until you eventually start building inertia (and that inertia being slow to boot). So patience, resilience, and if possible a positive attitude and honesty with the people who're opting to support you.

The alternative to this is selling books and boy that's a completely different beast on its own.

PS, watch [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3g-w83Cb5pEAu5UmRrge-A][Brandon Sanderson]]'s lectures over at youtube, they're a god-send. Oh, and if you can, always try to give a professional look to what you do. It can help a lot.
