Finished chapter one on my third try.

This is kind of a mess. I see what you're trying to do, but it's a mess. The perspectives are not clear. The action feels a bit choppy. I'm not sure how the two girls at the... trial?... are supposed to be characterized, because it's not clear which one is doing what.

It's not /bad/, exactly, it just needs kind of a lot of polish.
