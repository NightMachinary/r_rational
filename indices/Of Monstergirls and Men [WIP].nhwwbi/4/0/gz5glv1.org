Author's opinion on the matter (spoilers ahead).

​

/First, an explanation of the event/circumstances/consequences in question/.

Diane has the power to fleshcraft, she can, effectively, alter how someone's body behaves. The power only allows her to do this in small ways, but ways that can build over time. This power does not come with a safety net, if she doesn't know what she's doing she can seriously fuck someone up (example, causing a hormonal imbalance and suddenly their brain starts pumping serotonin at max capacity).

What she had done had been to use her powers on Rick (protagonist) without his knowledge or consent on the matter (in an attempt to slowly improve him over time).

Rick found out about it and got very pissed. His punishment to her had been, effectively, for her to write down "I will ask first" a bunch of times (a punishment that might as well be a token one in the setting where slavery is a thing).

​

/The complication/: Rick trusted Diane and thought of her in a slowly but surely growing romantic way. Her actions caused a loss of trust that was highly impactful to Rick. It made him mentally recontextualize his interactions with the harem as a whole but Diane specifically, and it opened the doors to the problems that he had been keeping buried (some minor trauma from the events at the start of the story for the most part).

This was, basically, a consequence of Diane's actions and Rick finding out.

That is the core of the problem here, because to Diane, Rick's loss of affection/romance towards her was part of the punishment, but to Rick it was a natural consequence due to the loss of trust.

​

/The change/: Rick (in the following chapters) has to adapt himself because it becomes clear that Diane did not take things the way he had intended, and in his distancing from her he began neglecting his implied duties as the master in the relationship.

And at the same time, Diane has to come to the realization that his distance had not been punishment for her actions but rather a normal response.

​

/The resolution/: A re-development of the previously lost trust and an adaptation of their relationship to having found out more about one another.

Now, addressing the "punishment" situation. I personally see punishment as something that in a certain regard has a necessity to it. Just because the thief repents for what they did does not mean there should not be a consequence of the action. Should the consequence be lessened due to repentence? I certainly believe so, enough that if it's "light" enough it could even remove the punishment entirely.

And past that, the second issue is that the "punishment" is also an action to put down a weight to the non-desired behaviour that took place. This "Action -> Consequence" is, at the end of the day, the core of how everyone learns. Though there's arguments over how exactly these imposed consequences should pan out, I do think that the fact that there ARE consequences is in of itself an attempt to correct the negative behaviour.

Past that, my personal belief tends to be that Rick's behaviour was not that of a paragon of how this should be carried out but as someone who doesn't know better and is learning the ropes.
