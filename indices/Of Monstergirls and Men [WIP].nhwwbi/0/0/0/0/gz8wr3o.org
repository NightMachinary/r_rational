What you said at the end reminds me of Scrapped Princess. It was a cool concept, and I've even considered doing the same thing if I were to write something, but fact is I felt annoyed that I thought I was watching a fantasy adventure series when it turned out to be sci-fi. If I knew beforehand I would've been ok with it. One of the few occasions I'd be kinda ok with a spoiler. I remember reading similar complaints about that alien invasion series that ends the first book with vampires coming out to save humanity out of nowhere. Cool concept, cool twist, but you don't expect vampires in your realistic alien invasion story so it feels kind of unfair.
