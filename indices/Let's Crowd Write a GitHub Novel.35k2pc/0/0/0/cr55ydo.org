I think the problem is that collaborative writing means more work, not less. You have to coordinate. You don't simplify, you exponentiate. And you have to compromise your own artistic vision or whatever.

It could work with a small number of people, say, 2, and if they knew each other well, respected each other, could meet or communicate somehow in depth regularly, were similar enough to understand each other, worked well together, and write passages that sounded pretty similar. Like Gaiman and Pratchett in /Good Omens/.
