I think what you'd want to do is make a novel that could work within those constraints. People write differently? Make the differences in voice a /part/ of the novel, and embrace what would otherwise be a flaw. There are books like /If on a winter's night a traveler/ that intentionally do changes like that.

But I agree with the general point of collaborative writing being difficult.
