The format of the novel is important. If you are careful in how you structure it, you can manage it.

[[http://penandcapesociety.com/drew-hayes/super-choice-adventure-chapter-1/][Super Choice Adventure]] by the Pen and Cape society is an example where many collaborating writers worked together, each writing a short scene and completing a decent story overall.

Now, if you want to write the next great novel this way, err, good luck.
