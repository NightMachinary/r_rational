  and some ad asking me to subscribe

I think an ad asking you to subscribe to a website you already wanted to read (enough to get a tl;dr) is not a significant moral burden being placed on you.

No one is advertising obtrusive fast food or bullshit at you; just asking if you want to stay.

It's not the end of the world.
