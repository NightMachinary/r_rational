  No, more like "anyone on the Death Star is currently part of a machine looking to crush the only viable resistance to Sith despotism and mass-murder. we cannot allow it to continue to exist. The deaths of these people isn't enough to weigh against that. Agree? Disagree? You know the point either way.

I otherwise don't agree with W. D. Ross, but one thing that I do appreciate is his stance that, even if something is the right thing to do, that doesn't excuse you from feeling bad about it in some way.

If going to war is the right thing to do, then by all means, we have to do it. I don't think we'd disagree that you have to do whatever is the right thing to do. But "feeling bad about having killed people, even if it was necessary--indeed, feeling bad that it was necessary in the first place" seems to me to be something that is important to endorse, if for no other reason than doing so will reduce the likelihood that you'll end up killing people because it's the /easier/ path rather than the necessary one.

  After all, this is a universe with an actual metaphysical spirit.

This is true. I am totally fine with the Force being cool with him, since the Force is (IMO) better having a blue-and-orange morality anyway. I dislike the subtext (which perhaps isn't there) that George Lucas thinks, and would like for us to think, that Vader saving his son made up for everything that he'd done before.

  The real problem is Luke; whose behavior is totally parochial and irresponsible. The Emperor was right; he seemingly had no idea what he was walking into yet did it anyway, putting people at risk for his shitty dad.

No disagreement here.
