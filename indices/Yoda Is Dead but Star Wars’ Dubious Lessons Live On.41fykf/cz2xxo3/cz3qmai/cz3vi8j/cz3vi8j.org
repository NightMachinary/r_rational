  He's generally taken to have moral wisdom as well. A guru, in other words.

Is he, though? His "moral" wisdom is all of the form "don't give in to the Dark Side because it'll turn you evil. The Dark side looks like X, Y and Z; here are some Jedi techniques for avoiding it."

It /involves/ morals, yes, but it's still firmly in his domain of expertise.

(Except possibly for "do or do not; there is no try". In this case, though, Luke was pretty clearly not putting in enough effort, so I think his advice was pretty good.)

  The issue is that the movies seem to say that Vader's moral balance sheet, so to speak, has now been balanced.

I think the movie fairly clearly doesn't treat "moral balance sheets" as real.

Brin disapproves of this. I, however, approve wholeheartedly, and furthermore feel a strong urge to start calling Brin names.

(Incidentally, I don't think it's a tribal thing - lesser mortals are also allowed to change, like Han Solo, Lando, and Finn from the new film. It's impractical to try and exchange an olive branch to people who are actively shooting at you.)
