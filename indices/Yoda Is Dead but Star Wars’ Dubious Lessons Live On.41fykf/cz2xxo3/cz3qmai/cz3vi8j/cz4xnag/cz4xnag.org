  Is he, though? His "moral" wisdom is all of the form "don't give in to the Dark Side because it'll turn you evil. The Dark side looks like X, Y and Z; here are some Jedi techniques for avoiding it."

  It involves morals, yes, but it's still firmly in his domain of expertise.

He /isn't/, but he is treated in the film as though he is.

#+begin_quote
  I think the movie fairly clearly doesn't treat "moral balance sheets" as real.

I apologize. I wasn't meaning to imply that it did (hence "so to speak", which was apparently a clumsy way of going about things)

  (Incidentally, I don't think it's a tribal thing - lesser mortals are also allowed to change, like Han Solo, Lando, and Finn from the new film. It's impractical to try and exchange an olive branch to people who are actively shooting at you.)

Finn's a weird case that was even more blatant than the others, which actually helped to kill his character for me. He can't kill the villagers, okay, fine, I get that, although it does raise some side questions for me. But then he's apparently totally fine with shooting the people that he'd been serving alongside for years and (if I'm understanding correctly) grew up with? He's even laughing as he does so.

The Finn who couldn't shoot the villagers seems like somebody getting an attack of the moral feels. The Finn who was shooting his fellow stormtroopers seems like a sociopath. Obviously, it's kind of weird when both those Finns are supposed to be the same Finn.

I hope that what we're going to find out is that Finn had been a sleeper agent this whole time and that the destruction of Starkiller Base was intentional as part of some greater scheme (which would also explain why Phasma was so quick to give up the codes and Starkiller Base had the same sort of flaw that the first Death Star had).

But, barring something like that, it instead feels more like "Finn is an inherently good person who somehow has the moral sixth sense to divide the world into good people who you shouldn't kill, and bad people who you shouldn't care about killing."
