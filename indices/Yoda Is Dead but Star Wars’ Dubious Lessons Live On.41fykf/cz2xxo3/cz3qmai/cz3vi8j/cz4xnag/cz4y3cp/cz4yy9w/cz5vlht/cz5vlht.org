I see what you're saying.And realistically, there IS nothing else to a character. But I think, depending on how well developed said characters are, you can identify things that are "Finn like" and things that aren't. Not sure if there's a set way to go about, but we've all had times where we were watching shows/movies and found an action terribly inconsistent, based on what we've come to understand about the character. Sometimes, the inconsistency is justified (For example, Ron's various lapses in friendship, which seem like an inconsistency on the surface, with Harry are explainable due to his overly emotional state of being, combined with an inferiority complex derived from being the youngest of a poor family, along with a few dashes of jealousy) Othertimes, it just makes you roll your eyes and scoff at the writer/director/plot.

Figuring out where to draw said line? I feel that's a personal choice, for you to make based on your feelings towards the character in question. And not being able to make that choice is a decision in and of itself, as well.
