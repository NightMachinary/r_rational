His books are reasonably good.

(Well, /Sundiver/ is ehn, and his Foundation sequel is not worth reading the other two books in the trilogy and fairly heavy in Brin-ist morality preaching, and /Heaven's Reach/ struck me as a bit phoned-in. But despite my general desire to grab Brin-the-pundit by the lapels and try to shake sense into him, I *do* have all his novels and a collection of his short fiction.)
