The first three books of the Uplift series are OK, the second three were unreadable to me. I haven't read much else by him so take this with a grain of salt. That said, /Existence/, published in 2012, is in my top 10 of SF books once you take out those titles with ratings overinflated by virtue of being part of a series.

The quality of the work of SF authors in particular declines with age; they struggle to remain relevant and adapt to new trends. I give Brin big props for what he did in Existence; it's on a whole new level compared to the Uplift novels.
