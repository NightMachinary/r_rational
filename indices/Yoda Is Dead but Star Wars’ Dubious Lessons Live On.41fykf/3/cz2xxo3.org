  I do hope folks will notice, for example, that Yoda, in Attack of the Clones, orders the Jedi into a suicide charge that kills most of them, then conveniently shows up with the new clone army that he ordered. An act of treachery and betrayal so stunning that I had to watch the movie twice. Perhaps that was Lucas' evil plan.

  Yoda is pretty much, inarguably, the most evil figure ever in the history of any human mythology. I have defied folks to name one time when he says or does anything that is indisputably wise.

Dude's a Force expert. He tells you things about the Force. Also, he's a precog. If you ignore all that, I'm not sure what kind of "wisdom" he's supposed to give beyond it.

  Abrams and Disney appear to have backed off from George Lucas' heavy-handed propaganda.

Yeah, we've got Nazis who brainwash people instead. /eyeroll/

  Absolutely. The apotheosis of Darth Vader was truly disgusting. Saving one demigod---a good demigod, his son---wiped away all his guilt from slaughtering billions of normal people.

Truly, the idea that people could be redeemed is an affront to good-hearted folk everywhere.
