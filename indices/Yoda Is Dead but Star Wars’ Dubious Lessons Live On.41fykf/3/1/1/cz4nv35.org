  Luke is responsible for the deaths of a third of a billion people (the first Death Star had a lot of folks on board) and we have to get to the Expanded Universe before he has any angst over this. Because anyone who was on the Death Star is automatically a bad guy and deserved to die, and no tears should be shed for them or the loved ones who survived them.

No, more like "anyone on the Death Star is currently part of a machine looking to crush the only viable resistance to Sith despotism and mass-murder. we cannot allow it to continue to exist. The deaths of these people isn't enough to weigh against that. Agree? Disagree? You know the point either way.

This always struck me as a complaint made more for the joy of analyzing than anything. The reasoning is clear; the arguments for collateral damage are clear; you know them. But it's cool to pull a Kevin Smith and bring up the argument and sort of poke at Star Wars' simplicity and earnestness.

As for Vader; you could put it down to some sort of personal redemption. After all, this is a universe with an actual metaphysical spirit. He has basically lived a hobbled existence denying himself that light, now he has it back. It's about as odious as the Christian and Muslim conceptions of redemption. Except the Force need not choose; at the time of his death Anakin simply had the right metaphysical make-up, so he was saved.

The real problem is Luke; whose behavior is totally parochial and irresponsible. The Emperor was right; he seemingly had no idea what he was walking into yet did it anyway, putting people at risk for his shitty dad.
