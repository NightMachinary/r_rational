Don't agree with all of Brin's points, but as for these bits:

  Dude's a Force expert. He tells you things about the Force. Also, he's a precog. If you ignore all that, I'm not sure what kind of "wisdom" he's supposed to give beyond it.

He's generally taken to have moral wisdom as well. A guru, in other words.

  Truly, the idea that people could be redeemed is an affront to good-hearted folk everywhere.

The issue is that the movies seem to say that Vader's moral balance sheet, so to speak, has now been balanced. This is similar to how Luke is responsible for the deaths of a third of a billion people (the first Death Star had a /lot/ of folks on board) and we have to get to the Expanded Universe before he has any angst over this. Because anyone who was on the Death Star is automatically a bad guy and deserved to die, and no tears should be shed for them or the loved ones who survived them.

I might be reading a little too much into things in this particular story, but across the board stories with this kind of conflict mirror, too closely for my comfort, our tendency toward tribalism, and I worry that as a cultural phenomenon they reinforce rather than fight against attitudes and biases that we need to be rid of.
