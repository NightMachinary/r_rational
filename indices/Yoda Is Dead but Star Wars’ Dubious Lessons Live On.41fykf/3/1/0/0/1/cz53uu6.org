  He isn't, but he is treated in the film as though he is.

Is he? I never really got that impression. He's an old Jedi Master who enjoys pranking people, not a moral philosopher.

  Finn's a weird case that was even more blatant than the others, which actually helped to kill his character for me. He can't kill the villagers, okay, fine, I get that, although it does raise some side questions for me. But then he's apparently totally fine with shooting the people that he'd been serving alongside for years and (if I'm understanding correctly) grew up with? He's even laughing as he does so.

... yeah, that was extremely strange.

Optimistically, I could probably make an argument that stormtrooper training is just /that bad/ at producing a sense of shared identity and camaraderie - there are a few episodes of /Rebels/ showing it, and it's just awful. He probably hated all of those people.

Buuut, now that I think about it, he's also pretty explicit that he's only rescuing +Princess Leia+ Po Dameron because he needs a pilot, right? And he also repeatedly makes it clear that he only stays with the Resistance because he wants to get in Rey's pants. Maybe he's just too lazy to shoot people.
