He does have some good points. But his main criticism goes like this:

1. Democracy is good.
2. The movies are skeptical about democracy [I would say they are skeptical about the ability of large democracies to scale up as well as confront unexpected challenges.]
3. Therefore George Lucas is evil.

The same sort of argument leads him to blast someone in the comment section for citing Plato, which is apparently a no-no since Plato is "...the most malignant and relentlessly wrongheaded philosopher, ever, who despised democracy and provided intellectual ammo to be used against it for 2500 years."

Geeeeeez. I think the opposite is true: frank discussion of the strengths and weakness of democracies (and how these may be ameliorated or worsened by various constitutional systems) is a good thing -- as well as a necessary condition of democracies continuing to evolve and thrive in the future.
