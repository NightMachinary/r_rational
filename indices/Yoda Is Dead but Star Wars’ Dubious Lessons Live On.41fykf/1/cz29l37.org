Oh, Brin again. And again with the claim that Obi-Wan offers to teach the Force to Han.

(Go, re-watch the old VHS, or pirated laserdisc rips/the Laserdic rip to DVD that was in the Ultimate Collection . . . even, if you like, check against the Special Edition New Hope DVD, the published "script", and the novelization. *None of them* have this supposed offer to teach Han. As I learned when I was younger and more impressed with Dr. Brin, and repeated his claim, and was challenged, and actually went to check for myself.)

Occasionally I hope the various bits of nonsense I catch Brin saying (like when he claimed the solution in HPMOR was un-foreshadowed, and never mind the very first lines of the story) are deliberately there to encourage people to distrust claims of authority. But whatever his private intent, his public claims are regularly /full of shit/.
