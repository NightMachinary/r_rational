THE BAD, it's mostly bad:

You look horrifying, the bowl in your head and the (in)consistency of your face are going to make social life very hard for you. You're going to be causing uncanny valley reactions all the time, dead bodies skin is commonly described as "waxy", and a all bone face when eating will look especially ghoulish.

You smell absolutely awful, like burning fat and greasy smoke unless you snuff your wick most of the time and even then you will smell like warm fat. The constant smoke and grease will play havoc on normal biology, staining, clogging pores, and contact dermatitis if aren't protected somehow.

You have to avoid "high" temperatures, 40 C(104 F) and above your entire head will start to melt(assuming beef tallow). This is a much bigger issue than you would think: your neck/tallow line will be around 37 C constantly due to body heat, there's an open flame up top, and your head cannot sweat or will do so ineffectively. Hot sunny day = melt, hot car = melt, most protective headgear = melt, too close to a heat source = melt. You get the idea, 40 C surface temp isn't hard to reach, you need to live in cold places and avoid a lot of situations.

A 40C fever (high grade fever) will melt at the neck/tallow boundary and make your entire head fall off. So don't get sick or get heatstroke.

THE GOOD?

You can reshape your face and head. Hire a sculptor or learn yourself, this will be important socially. Making your face less human will reduce the revulsion people will feel when watching it, CGI movies would be a good reference. Makeup and wigs should stay great but will apply weird with your tallow. You can and should disguise your wick as a quirky candle hat. The most human appearance would probably be just wrapping your entire face "for medical reasons" and keeping the wick snuffed and covered.

Your brain and head don't age? Whatever your personality is now running on probably won't lose function over time. You're immune to diseases from the neck up.

Your head might not feel pain?

You might be able to head transplant yourself to new bodies? Depends how finicky the tallow/nerve interface is.

The sunset limit isn't too bad, definitely don't go to sleep before sunset. Make sure your fire is lit and protected during that window, depending on the wick material you might be able to stick a fish bowl over the entire thing to protect it for example.

In summary: this seems like a curse. I wouldn't accept it for less than several million dollars and that's probably still not worth the mental harm unless you're immortal.
