In my original idea, the main "problem" of the curse was the need to keep the wick lit at all times (if only to avoid it being left off come sunset, by accident). Then I added in the idea of the cursee's head being a giant candle, and was wondering what problems that might cause (a lot of /really bad ones/, it seems).

Furthermore, this was meant to be a curse that the cursee could reasonably live with for many, many years, instead of being so fragile and precarious that one bad day could kill them. There was also meant to be a small element of empowerment to it. Yes, you have to babysit this flame on top of your head for the rest of your life, but it's also a light-source that you will never be without, and can control its intensity.

So while I appreciate all the wonderful ways you can think of to make the curse worse, I'm probably going to dial back on it a lot. I guess I actually want it to be less of a curse, and more like a minor superpower with a nasty downside. Thanks for the feedback, though.
