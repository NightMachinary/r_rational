I've been playing around with an idea for a superpower for a while now, and I've done most of the basic munchkinry, but I think there's still some wiggle room.

The power is energy conversion. Can destroy energy anywhere inside of the volume of her body and create energy in the equivalent volume outside of her body. High precision & control.

Specifically, she can convert internal calorific energy contained within the volume of her contiguous body (excludes interior of lungs and digestive tracts) into any form of energy anywhere within a contiguous equivalent volume in contact with the surface of her body, instantaneously (FTL so some wiggle room for retrocausality).

By default, the volume is a few centimetres above her skin and other bodily surfaces, but can be reduced in certain areas and increased in others.

The form and location are entirely thought-controlled and limited by imagination, however once the energy is created the power provides no further control over the energy.

Conversation rate reflects actual human energy usage rates during exercise and has similar impacts on her body, e.g. exhaustion, hunger

Direct Equivalences:

- Energy of forming bonds insignificant compared to mass generation.\\
- With a cross-section of 10^{-19} m^{2} & 100GPa could lift 10^{-10} N\\

It would take 12 hours to produce the smallest dose of the strongest opioid (0.5 micrograms) @1000W, also hours for LSD & DMT.

- A tenth the transmitter power output of an FM radio station

*Electrical*:

Not sure about the physics for this one. Electrical sparks and arcs take surprisingly little power. But that might be due to potentials or ions that would be precursors to unleashing sparks. So might not work here.

- Taser equivalent @10W
- CNT are excellent conductors for ranged tasing.

*Propulsion in water*:

- Using drag equations, drag co-efficient 0.45 & cross-section of 0.25m^{2;}\\

  - @2500W speed = 3.5m/s\\
  - @1000W speed = 2.6m/s\\
  - @100W = 1.2m/s\\

*Kinectic Energy on thrown objects*:

Putting KE into an object means it flies away and she can't put anymore KE into it as it's no longer in her volume of power output.\\
Using a rope means she can apply KE for longer but that only work if she has a strong enough rope and a way to deal with friction burn.\\
Luckily we've shown how she can make CNT which is strong and low friction.

Calculation PT= 0.5mv^{2} Integrate for distance. Differentiate for acceleration. I could be wrong about these numbers.

Hair counts as body volume as long as it is contiguous with the body. It doesn't add much to the volume but allows much more surface area to work with and some reach/range. While she can't create kinetic energy directly in her hair, she can create it in something in the volume around her hair. So wrap it up in some CNT and she's got TK hair. I estimate she could grow it out to about 3-4 meters with enough protection and care. This would make for an excellent means of remaining in contact with any object that needs a long distance to accelerate to effective speeds.

Power conversion is instantaneous. However since the greatest distance, she could produce energy at measures in metres, so energy would be produced ~10 nanoseconds before she imagines it in relativistic terms. However human reaction time measures in 100'000'000 of nanoseconds, so I don't see an easy exploit for time nonsense. I doubt she'd even detect the instantaneity of the power even under rigorous scientific testing, but it's secretly there if you can munchkin it.
