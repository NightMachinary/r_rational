Can you use this to create arbitrary small objects?

I'm thinking about biotech applications. A regular zygote only weighs like a microgram, so it takes about a month's work at 100W to assemble one. Imagine using this to make e.g. gene drive mosquitoes or designer babies. And at the same power draw, you can synthesize an arbitrary normal-sized prokaryote in ~900 milliseconds, which seems even more broken.

Of course, regulatory barriers preclude doing things like making vitamin-a-rich versions of every crop in existence with this power plus micropropogation, but still, any organism that can be described to you can be created.

While existing DNA sequences can be copied easily with PCR, the synthesis of arbitrary novel sequences currently costs cents per base pair. There's money to be made in this department.
