Firstly, munchkining the power supply. "Internal calorific energy" isn't a thing as far as I can find, but "calorific value" is defined as "the total energy released as heat when a substance undergoes complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions". In a human, that would normally just be the energy obtained from eating, but what if you implanted a combustion generator under your skin? Would that increase your maximum power?

If you're measuring in volume but also doing things on the atomic scale, things would get a bit tricky. Does the space between atoms count towards "volume"? If so, then CNT would be seen as a solid tube of volume. If not, then you have to measure things by basing it on the atomic radii of all the atoms in your body.

There's also the problem of the definition of "contiguous". On the atomic scale, everything is just atoms, so where does the border lie between contiguousness and non-contiguousness? You're touching the air, which is touching the object - does that count? Or, you're touching the ground, which is touching the object. If rope works, then things like this should too.

On creation of matter: I'd imagine that, with the tiny amount produced at a time, the substance would be blown away the moment it's created in an environment that's not a vacuum. You'd have to make it in a sealed container or something.

In terms of what to make, there's the obvious production of rare substances to sell, like californium or diamond. However, with such precise control, you'd have a massive comparative advantage for the production of nanomachines and things for biotechnology. Meet with someone knowledgeable in the field and produce swarms of nanobots to do whatever, or leapfrog through CRISPR and technologies until you've got a cure for ageing. There's probably a variety of fields out there that can greatly benefit from atomic control.

In general: at this point, you're basically controlling forces as well as energy. Energy isn't a thing that can exist on its own - it has to be tied to other things. In this case, you'd be putting a pushing force on everything you kinetic-energy-ify. You'd be changing the abstract concept of "height" when you gravitational-potential-ify. You'd be creating magnetic fields when you magnetic-potential-ify. You'd be manipulating the strong force when you nuclear-potential-energy-ify.

If you can manipulate things on the scale of atoms, then there has to be a secondary power of total awareness of the volume you're manipulating. So, whatever you put in your energy-transferrance area, you can know absolutely everything about. Could allow you to (slightly) see through walls and such.

There could be shenanigans galore if you look at the quantum scale. Since you already have matter and photon creation and what basically amounts to telekinesis, when you add in chromodynamic energy and all the other types of binding energies, all sorts of things can be done, probably.

A mundane application would be cleaning. Just kinetic-energy away all the grime from your skin, hair and teeth - or even any dishes or surface you wipe your hand on - and, tada! 100% bacteria disposal.

Also, no need to wrap hair in CFT - you can just use the air around it.

And, finally, the FTL. Firstly, why are you including it? It seems like you're just breaking causality for no real reason, other than to have it broken. Why not have it just travel at the speed of light? Also, FTL-based experiments don't have to be based on your human reaction speed. Example: A detector and a guillotine is placed a metre away. Have a strand of hair go from your position to under the guillotine, then loop back to you, then to the detector. Have a continuous transferral of energy to the detector. After a time, the guillotine cuts your hair, which shuts off the transferral. But from your perspective (the relative perspective of your position, not necessarily your human perception), your transferral has stopped, but the guillotine hasn't finished cutting your hair off. Back at the detector, it detects the ceasing of transferral and stops the guillotine. However, that now leads to the guillotine having not completely cut through the hair so that it /should/ still be transferring energy, yet it /isn't/. Thus, causalityis violared.
