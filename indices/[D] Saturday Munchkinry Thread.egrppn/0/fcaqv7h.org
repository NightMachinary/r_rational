You are a human candle.

Your head from halfway up your neck is composed of tallow. You have a wick extending out of the top of your skull. The end of the wick is always burning, but never shrinks in length, or loses combustibility. The heat from your head-flame melts a small bowl in the top of your skull. If you tip your head over, the melted tallow will dribble down your head and harden.

This is natural to you: you suffer no injury from this process. The melted tallow will reform gradually over time. Your head feels no pain from your own flame's heat, or the heat of your melted tallow. If you cut down the length of your wick, it will also gradually grow back to its original length.

Your tallow is inconsistent in strength. Your head is composed of various tallows of differing hardness, corresponding to your bones, muscles and skin. This allows your neck to bend, and your face to emote. However, all can be deformed fairly easily, with sufficient pressure. You could poke a hole through your cheek with just a finger and a bit of effort.

Similarly, this deforming is inconsistent. Your tallow is most easily deformed when your head and face are at rest. When they are being actively used for something, they become much harder to alter. For instance, your teeth and jaws become solid as bone when chewing food, but could be bent all out of shape otherwise.

You're not sure what exactly counts as “at rest” and “in use” - it appears to be more intuitive than logical. However, your tallow will always melt if exposed to high temperatures.

Additionally, you have the ability to make your head-flame burn blindlingly bright, for up to 10 seconds. This is very tiring, and leaves you unable to use it again for several hours. It also drastically increases the heat output of your flame, melting your head much faster and to a greater extent than usual.

If your flame goes out at night, or during the day and is not re-lit before sundown, you will die. Shadowy wolves will emerge from your surroundings, and tear you limb from limb. These wolves are invisible and intangible to everyone except you, and will find and kill you no matter where you are or what you're doing. An outside observer will only see you suffer inexplicable bite and claw injuries, before you are torn to pieces by an unknown force.

What do?
