It was intended as a curse, yes. I was mostly wondering if there were any unforeseen side-effects one could exploit. I did not realise that the curse was way worse than I imagined.

The tallow melting is the biggest issue, in my mind. I only went with tallow because it's made of animal fat, and in my mind it had a thematic link to living bodies. What would be a good candlewax alternative, that would give the cursee a larger margin of error regarding temperatures?
