Seems like an effective curse, if the goal is misery struggling to keep your head on is extra effective. Forcing them to live in the cold for melting and smell also has the benefit of making face skulpting stay better. Tallow does add to the smell and smoke grossness. Since it's a curse you can cut out my comments about being immune to tallow yourself, having that dripping and in contact with your skin all the time is extra awful. I think your neck line would rot from skin suffocation and moisture.

You might just use mutton tallow's mp(melting point), 45-50 C, or claim it's human tallow and make up a number. Tallow isn't a super consistent material, the dirtier it is the higher the mp, and you have magic, you can set the temperature to whatever as long as you explain some way.

Other waxes: Soy wax's mp range is 49-82 C. Petroleum jelly is a messier option and has a large mp range.

Another positive: the tallow might act like a non-Newtonian fluid, turning as hard as teeth when exposed to pressure. If it doesn't work like that, clenching your teeth hard before impact should work. If you leave the candle burning all the time you should be able to cover yourself in the tallow as armor, assuming you're magically immune to the tallow's effects on skin.
