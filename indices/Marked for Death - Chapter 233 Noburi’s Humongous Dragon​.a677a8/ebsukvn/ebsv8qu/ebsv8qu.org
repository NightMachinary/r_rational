I don't know whether I can sell it that well. Worldbuilding-wise, it's naruto fanfiction, but one where the authors take liberties to make the world make some sense. The world benefits from adversary optimisation - all the quest players are looking for 'obvious' exploits or inconsistencies in the world, and those are either fixed, incorporated into the world as something people were already doing, or exploited by the main character.

The story itself is about a team of ninja who are forced to defect from their village as they are sent on a suicide mission. The main character's (who is largely controlled by the quest players) goals evolve pretty quickly from "let's survive" to "this world is fucked up, let's fix it". Queue adventure!

That's the rationalist-fiction-appealing part. Add a sprinkle of humour, heartbreaking characters, great ambition, and a sprinkling of RNG ensuring fights are not completely predictable.
