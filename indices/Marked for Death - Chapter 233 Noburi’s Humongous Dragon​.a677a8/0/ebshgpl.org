I noticed it's been a while since this was posted here ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6bhvej/marked_for_death_chapter_127_applying_a_pin/]], 1 year ago).

Granted, I think it never got much discussion because, well, it's posted on a forum, a lot of the chatter happens there. Still, for any new redditors, look here, it's alive and going strong.
