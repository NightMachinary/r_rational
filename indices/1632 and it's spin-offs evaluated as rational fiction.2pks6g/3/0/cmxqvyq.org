Which characters, if you don't mind me asking?

There is a substantial chunk of the series devoted to how the religious establishment of the 1632 era would deal with the modern equivalents. That certainly throws a lot of irrationality into the books, but it seems to me that the main characters deal with the religious issues rationally. With the sheer number of individuals in play, there are a few idiots running around, causing mayhem, but most of the main characters seem rational, even to the point of knowing how the irrational people are likely to react. They aren't always brilliant, and on a couple occasions they fall prey to being irrational in emotional moments, but I can't think of any high profile main character that was irrational.

The most irrational of the secondary characters that I can remember off the top of my head is the antagonist who tries to organize the killing of the Pope. Some of his decisions were plain crazy, and he didn't seem to be insane, but he was countered by some very rational people, and even his own political backers considered what he did to be insane.
