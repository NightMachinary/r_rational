You might want to avoid spoilers here. I don't think I've gotten to the book you referenced.

What I meant was, I don't think the characters are any more rational than characters generally are in this kind of fiction. My dislike for most of the characters doesn't stem from a rational/irrational divide. Just the way they are written, their archetypes and the Pathos that shines through. Might be just my pet peeves.
