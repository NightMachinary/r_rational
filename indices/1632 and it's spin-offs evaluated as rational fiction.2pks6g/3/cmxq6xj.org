I read the first couple of books some years ago.

Overall it's obvious that there was a lot of care and effort involved to get the world as historically accurate as possible and to get technology right. What would be possible to build in that time period, if the relevant knowledge was there, and what still wouldn't be possible.

So in that sense, the world-building was done in a rational way.

On the other hand, I don't think you could really describe any of the characters as rational. I don't remember how much it deals with good/evil (I think the first one more than the later ones?) or how often people hold the idiot ball. I do remember though that I didn't really like any of the characters by Eric Flint. That caused me to give up on the series, even though I liked the world-building. I just kept rolling my eyes at the characters.
