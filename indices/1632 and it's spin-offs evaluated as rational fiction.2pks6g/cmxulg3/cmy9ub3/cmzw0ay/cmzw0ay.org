I notice that I am confused about the idea of Level 2 intelligence. It gets used in ways that make it seem superhuman, but I don't think that's what it is supposed to be.

Would this be a fair definition of Level (0|1|2) intelligence?:

- Level 0 people mostly follow social conventions / programming as opposed to thinking for themselves.\\
- Level 1 people think about what they should do, but they also think about /why/. They derive their own rulesets on what is appropriate behavior. They find smart, creative, outside-the-box solutions to problems, and frequently munchkin rules.
- Level 2 people can do all the things that Level 1 people can do. They can also model Level 1 people in their heads sufficiently well to predict what those people will do and get out ahead of them.

This is the best definition that I've been able to come up with, but it feels artificial -- why exactly is it that Level 1 people cannot model others well enough to get ahead of them?

My HPMOR examples would be McGonagall, Harry, and Quriddlemort respectively. I don't understand why Harry is /less intelligent/ than Quriddlemort though -- less experienced and therefore unable to get ahead of him, sure. But less intelligent? Or is experience considered part of intelligence?
