Harry is definitely portrayed as a Level 2 intelligent character, and McGonagall is Level 1. I think the only characters in HPMoR who are Level 0 are the politicians, specifically Umbridge, who is portrayed as a straightforward idiot.

Level 0 is someone who regularly carries the Idiot Ball. Level 1 is feeling like real people who don't make you yell at the TV screen in frustration. Level 2 is actually making someone come off as believably very intelligent.

In most contexts, being the only actually exceptionally intelligent person around /would/ make you look superhuman, so I can somewhat understand the mistake.
