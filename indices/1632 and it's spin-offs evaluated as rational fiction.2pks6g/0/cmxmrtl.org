I mostly agree with that. I've read the first couple of them, and they have that same sort of heavy focus on logistics and extrapolating upon a set of initial circumstances that I'd expect the people of [[/r/rational]] to like. At the same time, I think that it sometimes gets bogged down in the details a bit, in the way that I'd expect from an author that enjoys finding and describing those details. And the tech level never goes beyond the 1990s.

Actually, in a lot of ways it reminds me of some of the stuff that Harry Turtledove writes - alternate history is by its nature rules-based, unless you're going off the rails.
