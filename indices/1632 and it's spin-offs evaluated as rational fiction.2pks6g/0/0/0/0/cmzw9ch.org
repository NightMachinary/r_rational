Backwards? From what I recall, it felt to me like the tech level was increasing quite quickly. They had a big step down when they arrived, of course, but after that they quickly started inventing sewing machines, railroads, telegraphs, etc. The last book or two that I read, they were even building real ham radio towers.

Or do you simply mean "moving backwards as compared to where we are today"? Because if so, I can absolutely understand that.
