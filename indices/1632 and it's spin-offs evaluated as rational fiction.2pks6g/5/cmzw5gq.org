I think these books are definitely worth a read. The premise is interesting and fairly original -- time travel of an entire town isn't something I've seen before -- and the execution is good.

One of the most interesting things is that Flint laid down a solid foundation and then opened it up to be a shared world. From what I have gathered, he did this for two reasons: (1) he wanted it to feel like real history, which meant there had to be more than one authorial voice / ideaset; (2) to help new writers get established.

The flipside of that, of course, is that the writing quality and style differ. The ones by Flint and / or Weber are excellent, and most of the rest are quite good, but after a while the focus drifted outside what I was interested in and I stopped reading.
