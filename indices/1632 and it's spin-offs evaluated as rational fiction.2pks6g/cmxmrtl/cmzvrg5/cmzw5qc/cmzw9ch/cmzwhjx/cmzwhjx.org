Yeah, I meant moving backwards from where we are today. A lot of the books seemed to deal with increasing the tech level, but that tech level is constrained by the 1990s that Grantville came from. It's still entertaining, but it always made me a bit sad that no one was going to be making a semiconductor plant anytime soon. (Though for all I know, maybe the books actually moved past that already.)
