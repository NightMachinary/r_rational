What I love is how the focus gradually shifts away from the time travelers. It isn't just the travelers changing things. The whole world is innovative and learns from what it is given, and in the end it starts being the down-time individuals who are causing changes and creating new things. So many time travel books just focus on the messianic time traveler here to do everything and set everything right, but here the down timers have just as much agency and brilliance, and often more.
