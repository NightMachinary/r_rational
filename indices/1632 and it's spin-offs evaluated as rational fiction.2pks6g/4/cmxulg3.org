There is a lot of sensibility and bias for action in the Grantville community, and there are enough people that, so long as the idea isn't too extraordinary, someone will think of it eventually. On the other hand, people tend to get in over their heads very quickly -- the initial forays into international politics are a combination of impulsiveness and serendipity. People are stupid sometimes, but it's realistic stupidity.

On the whole, I'd say it's a good job of making realistic characters, but I hesitate to call it rational. Maybe it's because people are optimizing their outcomes in relatively banal ways. Maybe it's because the insights and good decisions tend to be spread across more people than in a typical novel. Maybe it's the amount of luck. But something seems off to me.
