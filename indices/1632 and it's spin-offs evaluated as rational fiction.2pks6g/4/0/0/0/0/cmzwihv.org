Hm. The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][Idiot Ball]] (warning: TVTropes) refers to someone who is"...acting out of character, misunderstanding something that could be cleared up by asking a single reasonable question or not performing a simple action that would solve everything."

I guess the politicians are not performing the action "be diplomatic" with the Muggles but, honestly, I don't see it as out of character for the purebloods, and the Minister has always been such a self-important idiot that I don't see it as out of character for him either.

Anyway, thanks for the definitions.
