  The initial premise of a super-advanced race playing games with space and time for art is rather irrational - but that's backstory, and the characters in the book know nothing of it.

This is a meta-referential [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_space_bats][in-joke]] which plays off of the contradiction between [[http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6005][deeply-held norms of knowable, causal behavior in SF]] and the inherent conceit of the hypothesis.
