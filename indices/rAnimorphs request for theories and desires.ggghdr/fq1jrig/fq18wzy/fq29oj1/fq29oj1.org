I have a few things from earlier in the story that I'm not sure about. I think some of this is just me misunderstanding the text but here we go.

From Chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  /You don't ever get in the car with the kidnapper, man. No matter how bad it is, it's only going to get worse once you give them home field advantage./

  <I am no kidnapper, Jake Berenson.>
#+end_quote

Did Elfangor just cold read him there, or somehow actually read his thoughts, or is this not the first time he's done this. Just kind of weird that he pulled the exact word kidnapper out.

--------------

What is the deal with Jake's black box? Like Jake and the other characters explicilty refer to it as magic because it's so inexplicably right all the time. I get why it's not all that high on their priority list of trying to figure out but look at this bit:

#+begin_quote
  One day, I even wrote down scissors scissors rock paper rock rock rock paper in advance, put it in my back pocket, and proceeded to win all eight tosses. Tom locked me in a closet, Dad made him do all the yardwork, and we switched to flipping coins after that.

  It's not that my brother is stupid, or unimaginative, or especially predictable. It's just that growing up with him forced me to pay attention---to perfect a kind of awareness that Tom never had any incentive to develop. It wasn't a conscious thing. It's not like I was thinking hmmm, he threw rock last time and lost, so he'd stick with rock to surprise me, except he knows I'd predict that, so he's actually going to switch to paper! No, I just looked at him, and some part of my brain spat out paper or scissors or rock, and if I listened to it, I won, nine times out of ten.
#+end_quote

This is bullshit right? It's bullshit that Jake has lived with his entire life so he may not even realize it but something is up with this. The text even goes out of it's way to say "nah this isn't cold reading or prediction, it's straight up magic".

--------------

How is it determined what injuries carry over and which don't? (Honestly this is only here because in Chapter 5 Tobias says to put that one on the list, and it seemed like a good idea).

--------------

Probably not important, but why is Esplin signing to the central command hub instead of just using telepathy at the end of Chapter. Opsec from the hosts?

--------------

What actually happened to the Chapmans? The Animorphs think that the Yeerks did it, Esplin thinks it's suicide, and Garrett agrees with that in his recap interlude. That one just seems a bit off to me, I could possibly see the Chapmans fighting for control at a key moment and dying but with their daughter in the car?

--------------

Who is the One Who is Remembered? Rachel makes a mental note to ask about it later but hey priorities.

(Actually looking at the other replies that's probably the Chee that tripped the censor so the others could escape the Howlers).

And speaking of the Chee and the female, what's the deal with that? Maybe if they dehumanize her then they can give her weapons... but why would that only work on her? The brief hypersight in Chapter 10?
