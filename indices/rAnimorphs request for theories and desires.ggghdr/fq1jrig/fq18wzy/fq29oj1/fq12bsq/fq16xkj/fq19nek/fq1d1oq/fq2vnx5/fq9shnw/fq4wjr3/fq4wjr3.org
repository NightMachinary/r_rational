Hoping for:

- More background on the Leerans. Why have we never seen the Leeran's thoughts or memories during hypersight sequences? I'm guessing it's because the bodies are frozen, and their brains only do their /processing/ in Z-space, memory storage is still frozen with their physical bodies? What was Leeran life/culture like before the Yeerks? How does society work when concepts like "secret" and "trust" and even "communication" just don't exist? (Hey wait, was their whole planet made to exist so V3 should eventually have a way to precommit to keeping promises?)

- More alien minds. They're one of my favorite things about this story.
