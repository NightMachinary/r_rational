I'm hoping - since Cassie is out - that Rachel will be spared this time round. The world's gone to shit anyway of course (too real) but still, she was always my fave of the team back in the day in all her complexity and incongruity.

On that note I guess a small part of me is hoping we see a bit more Cassie at some point too, if only in a short form. And (although it may have been addressed, I haven't read back far for a while) I'm curious if we'll ever see anything of Loren who was imo one of the few characters who was poorly served in the original series.

Otherwise, I'm mainly just enjoying being on the ride! I'd rather not go wild on the predictions as that might spoil it for myself!
