I haven't caught up in a few months, and maybe I'm missing something, but ...

... I was bothered by the fact that there may be all of these people hanging out in Z-space because their morphed bodies have died. Some scenes have shown characters in Z-space experiencing time and thoughts in a more rapid or complicated way. So, what's happened to these people who've been in Zspace for years? Are they still cognizant? Insane? Enlightened? Will they come back at some point?
