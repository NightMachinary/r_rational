Cassie's dead, but she died in morph, and we now know that being in morph puts you in the 'realm of the gods'. Is she /really/ dead? IIRC in one of the Megamorphs books Cassie was more in tune with 'E/C fuckery' than the rest of the Animorphs. Also, in r!Animorphs death has been shown to be a 'temporary setback if you're willing to deal with some downsides' ex Rachel, V3, losing all your morphs etc, so I'm not 100% convinced that Cassie's out of the picture...
