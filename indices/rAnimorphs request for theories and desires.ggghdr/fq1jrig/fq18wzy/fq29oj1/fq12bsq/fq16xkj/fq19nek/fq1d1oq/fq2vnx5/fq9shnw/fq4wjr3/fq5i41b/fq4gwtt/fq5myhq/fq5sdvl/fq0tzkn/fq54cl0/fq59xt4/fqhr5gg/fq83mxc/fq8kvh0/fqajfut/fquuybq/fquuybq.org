Thought speech targeting. How did V3 privately find Tobias without knowing who he was specifically? Can you use this to do computations somehow? Say you gather 26 people each with a name starting with a unique letter (or something similar) somewhere + a thoughtspeaker who puts various constraints on the target.

Does anything stop you from acquiring yourself from yourself?

I still do not really understand what interlude 1 was about or rather how it happened. Does this universally happen as time is running out? Is something kind of keeping track of time for you, then?
