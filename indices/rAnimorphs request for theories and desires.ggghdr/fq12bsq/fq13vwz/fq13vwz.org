There was a theory in a comment a couple chapters ago that TK accepted as (head?)canon. With most species the Yeerk can silence the host's mental voice by plugging the right neurons, but since Andalites are telepathic, and since thought-speak sounds like the recipient's own inner voice, the Yeerk half of an Andalite/Yeerk hybird can't perfectly silo its own thoughts from the host's, and over time they blend together.
