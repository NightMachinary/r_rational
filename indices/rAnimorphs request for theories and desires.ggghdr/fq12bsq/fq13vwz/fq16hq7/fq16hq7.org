That makes sense. I'm still registering that this came across to me as an important question. IIRC, they bring up with Ellimist/Crayak prior to the Arne mission and he gets mysterious about it. My takeaway was that Crayak created the chaotic Yeerks, the Ellimist the unifying, single-voicing Andalites, both to be the best possible mortal representatives of themselves - and their synergy gives us a clue into what the Ellimist and Crayak could gain by merging.
