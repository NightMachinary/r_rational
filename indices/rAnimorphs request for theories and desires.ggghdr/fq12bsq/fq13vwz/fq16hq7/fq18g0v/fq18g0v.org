  “If you were seeking to destroy all life on Earth, you might first create an industrial society of intelligent beings capable of doing the job thoroughly, rather than risking a quicker, more haphazard solution,” the creature said. “Such a plan might look eerily similar to, say, a plan for human ascension---right up until the critical moment. You wouldn't ordinarily expect two plans with opposite outcomes to strongly resemble one another, but here there are strong forces incentivizing cooperation and convergence.”

I think the Yeerks and Andalites were created by the players together, and the actual pieces that "belong" to each player are the two Yeerk/Andalite hybrids in the universe: Crayak has the Visser, the Ellimist has Helium.
