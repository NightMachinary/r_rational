  What you expect to be addressed/resolved; what your sense of the major open threads and unsolved mysteries are. Things you'd be disappointed about if the fic wrapped up without ever touching on again.
#+end_quote

- What exactly, did having Rachel along change? What would the story have been like without her?
- Why did Cassie have to die? What would the story have been like if she had survived?
- What are the win conditions for the Ellimist and Crayak? What are their respective plans for Earth and the rest of the galaxy if they win?

As for how I'd like the story to end:

- I'd like to see them figure out the win conditions and exploit them to kick /both/ god-like entities out.
- I'd like them to solve the parasite/symbiote problem by having the link between Yeerk and host to be fully bidirectional, rather than controlled by the Yeerk.
- The Hork-Bajir get to return home, and demand better treatment from their creators.
- Theory: the problems Rachel is having are due to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration][clone degeneration]], that is, from imperfections accumulated in the copying process. You can't just keep jumping between dying bodies forever as a path to immortality.

...That's all I've got for the moment.
