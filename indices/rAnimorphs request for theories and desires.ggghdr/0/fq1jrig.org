- What's the deal with Rachel?

  - Why don't the Chee recognize her after the teleport, and why can they give her the weapons later?
  - Theory: Erek managed to erase/corrupt the memory of her doing violence in the few milliseconds between passes of the Censor cycle
  - Theory: The Chee are capable of breaking their prime directive, just not capable of /planning/ to break it. They can do things like ram a Howler ship or drop a memory of violence, as long as the refresh cycle doesn't pass between having the idea and acting on it.
  - She's /not supposed to be there/, which means at least some long term game moves were made without taking her into account. When did the players finally notice her and start adapting?

    - Wild theory: The majority of the game was meant to play out in the kids' hometown just like in canon, but Rachel blew their cover, and neither Player was willing to spend the in-game resources it would take to undo their long-term plans enough to change that.

  - What caused the morph seizure disorder? Is it related to her weirdness, or coincidence?

    - Theory: A pointer in the hypercomputer got nudged, and every time she demorphs it tried to copy over both the version of her mind that's currently running, and the nth saved copy from her previous demorphs, where n the number of times she's demorphed since rezzing. She doesn't get memories from every demorph because not every morph-mind copy is backed up, just the ones from events that are significant to the game.

- What's the deal with Jake?

  - How did he know what Tom was thinking well enough to write out /scissors scissors rock paper rock rock rock paper/ in advance, and win? I looked up competitive rock-paper-scissors records and they're impressive, but not that impressive. Is his little black box more than it seems?
  - How did Elfangor know that Jake was thinking the word “kidnapper”?

- Time travel?

- Theory: The Visser /should/ destroy the earth if the probability of success drops below some higher threshold than 1/7, but the Ellimist made sure Andalites evolved with seven fingers specifically to get Visser to anchor on subtly wrong probabilities. The way he arrogantly dismissed the prophecy (“/IT DID NOT DO MUCH FOR CASSIE WITHERS, I SEE./“) was also the Ellimist's hand at work.
