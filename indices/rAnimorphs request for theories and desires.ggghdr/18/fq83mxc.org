Rachel accidentally creates a Z space virus that removes /something/ in yeerk biology which inhibits two way linking between the host and yeerk. This in turn destroys the ability to safely morph and a critical piece of the gods' computer so E/C aren't able to interfere through Z Space. Of course this means you have eldrich abominations immediately wanting to destroy Rachel/Animorphs/Earth/Everything for ruining their game. That's ok because humanity has a little bit of time to become a race of Collaborators and/or team up with some other races to ascend and Kill The Gods. Ram the blade ship!

Omake: Rachel fucks up, attempts to target something within Helium, the computer misunderstands and targets something within helium ie: all electrons in the universe and everything stops
