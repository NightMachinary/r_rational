A few questions re: the Time Matrix:

- Why is it here? What purpose does it add to the gods' game? Have a time machine in the middle of your "competitive spore" game feels like trying to make Monopoly better by adding Godzilla to it. Like, I can kind of see why someone would do that, but it seems pretty extraneous.

- How does it work? It sounds like it's neither straightforward time travel, nor reality warping like in canon. Why did it jump the Yeerks and the Andalites back in time, but not Earth?

- How many times has it been used? How many parallel universes are there?
