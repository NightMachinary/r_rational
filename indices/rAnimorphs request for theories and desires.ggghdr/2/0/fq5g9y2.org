More stuff:

I'm really interested in seeing what the player in Interlude 13's plan is. They seem incredibly confident +Literally incredible etc.+ In an eternal game of N+1 gambits patting yourself on the back for tricking the other guy seems like a death flag. Like, the expected ending of this game is an unironic version of that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCg_ES4ApY&t=22s][one "no I tricked you" bit from Rick and Morty]] and suddenly a quick win falls into your lap and your response is "It sure is convenient he fell for my trap, gottem!"

You know, maybe playing a game like this for a long time actually makes you /less/ paranoid? One of them already talked about how you can't keep checking something forever or else you're wasting resources. At some point you do just have to let it ride and if the other guy is playing you he's playing you.

God okay the time travel stuff. Argh.

We're told in the recap interlude that Elfangor spent several years as a human. Did they pull that from Elfangor's memories? I've been trying to find where they originally found that out and can't (I think they are told that when they find out about the previous timeline but the recap happens before that). Actually maybe the Animorphs actually didn't know that since it's a recap including things Garrett wasn't there for, but I don't think the reader knew that either at that point? Elfangor has at least one hidden memory, but from the description it sounded like a dayish thing and not a several-yearsish thing.

Why was the Time Lattice still there when Visser One got there? In canon when you used it, it was taken with you. Does it just stay there while it sends you to a new universe? Is it simulating a new universe inside of it (complete with another Time Lattice that simulates another universe)? Did Elfangor even use it at all? Visser One and Elfangor never compared notes, his extreme competence might not have been because of future knowledge.

I kind of want to meet Cirran, if only for some kind of "Yeah, sorry, this whole thing was my bad" moment. Even if it technically wasn't I guess, since the part of Cirran that started all of this in the first place is Esplin now? Anyway I'm kind of curious about how Cirran feels about all of this.
