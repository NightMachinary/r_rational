I'm just here to thank you for such an amazing story. Made me so happy and excited for several days as I've been catching up and reading everything you wrote up to this point. Absolutely brilliant, can't say enough good things.

Not sure if I have any constructive feedback. I'd love to know more about the gods and the lava creatures and the spooky eye and how the hypercomputer works, but I'm assuming that's coming. I guess it would be great to learn more about the other worlds that were only mentioned in passing so far(where past and current battles took place). Also need more Garrett, he is the best =) And the ship, he's so adorable, such a good boy)
