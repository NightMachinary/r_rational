My guess is that the existence of the Time Matrix is a case of instrumental convergence. Both Ellimist and Crayak saw use for a time machine in carrying out their plans, and so they allowed its creation. For beings like them, the existence of a thing does not mean it will be used. Unless they agree to let it be used, they can always just Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies any group which is about to use it, meaning the only groups capable of using it are ones which serve both of their goals. But neither of them ever get to involve a time machine in their plans if none exist, and so they agreed to create one and argue about who used it later.
