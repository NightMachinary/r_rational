  What you /expect/ to be addressed/resolved
#+end_quote

What I expect (but if you want to take it in another direction, that's cool too):

Why is Rachel broken?

The backups of minds of people who stayed past the time limit or died in morph should be either deleted or merged with their current instances.

The gods should either turn completely friendly, or ascend beyond the human universe, deascend into limited (but possibly powerful) bodies, or die.

The construct data should be either destroyed, or used to bring the "dead" back (Elfangor) (this could be just hinted at - like saying in the last chapter that they should start research to bring them back).

  What you /want/ to see happen
#+end_quote

The Ellimist wins and becomes a benevolent god.

The main characters realizing (I'm more or less certain this is true, not completely, but still) that being restored from a morph-backup isn't a destruction of your consciousness. (Probably won't explicitly happen, but possibly a gradual acceptance (which might already be happening), etc.)

Alloran should be split away from Esplin (it's disturbing that this occurs to me /after/ the metaphysics part).

The Yeerks should converge to the same morality humans have and finding Controlling as abhorrent as other races.

David to come back along with the (hopefully) resurrectees, but getting a moral core, and having an epic "What have I done?" moment.

#+begin_quote
  How you /currently think/ things are going to play out
#+end_quote

Esplin dies with Alloran. Either the E/C die, or Crayak dies. The hypercomputer will be used to smoothen the negative consequences of the war. The morphing power either ceases to be available, or is radically transformed.
