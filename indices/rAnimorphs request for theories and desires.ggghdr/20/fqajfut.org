I wonder how V3 will reach the end of the story. There's a lot of possibilities right now - I wouldn't push the option of him winning entirely off the table, although I'd be pretty darn disappointed if he gets his way as it stands. If he loses, I'd like him to have the chance to understand how/why he loses, even if happens to be mere seconds before he dies.

What I'd like to see but doubt would see happen? V3 dies by being reabsorbed back into Cirran.
