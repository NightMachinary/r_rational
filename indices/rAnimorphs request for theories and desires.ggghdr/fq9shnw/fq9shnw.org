(Sorry about my English, not a native speaker)

At first, the Animorphs had to learn how to /not lose/ the war. Dealing with stuff like leadership, responsibility, decision making, trust, doing the right thing even when it's hard, avoiding mistakes due to bias, trauma, powerful emotions, enemy deception, etc.

And it made me want to learn to do the same.

Now, they are learning how to /win/ the war, and how to effectively wield stuff like ruthlessness, betrayal, trust (again), larger picture, PR, MAD, etc.

And it kiiinda makes me want to learn to do the same, but also it seemed like they pay a really heavy price for it. They all look pretty exhausted and mentally damaged, and while it is not /because/ of the rationality techniques they learned per se... I don't know.

Anyway, what I hope for is that they learn how to win the peace. How to /solve/ the war, not just win it. And also how to be at peace with themselves? I realize that I'm being really vague here, but it echoes a bunch of real world questions I'm dealing with, so I would definitely like to learn stuff about it.
