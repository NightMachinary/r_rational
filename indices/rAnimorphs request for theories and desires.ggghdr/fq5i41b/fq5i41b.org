I'm hoping the following from canon be addressed / nodded to / etc:

- atlantis. like they need to appear somehow or just be mentioned as being killed

- at the end it got really dark with them turning disabled kids, i'd love a nod to that even though they do kinda have the army on their side and are doing kinda the same thing with the self-clones so maybe i answered my own question

- cassie was "grounded in reality" or something and didn't accept weird realities. i know she's dead (OR IS SHE) but i found that really interesting in the books

- the buffalo/ant morphing humans. like seriously wtf.

other stuff:

- look i'm going to be honest i'm kinda lost sometimes when i read the story because i forget what happened before or i just don't quite follow what happened and miss implications. i'd love a couple of authors errata stuff that include a really dumbed-down summary of the entire story (like, a couple of sentences per chapter, with all spoilers/background) so that i can appreciate it better (maybe you can find a Loyal Fan to do it for you)

- i'd love a kind of 'bestiary' where you explain all your detailed headcanon about the different species and stuff like that, any background info for them, inspirations, etc

- him going back to the ocean to marry that dolphin OTP

- that whole supercomputer that detects morphs, i feel like it's been dropped, so it should be undropped maybe?

- what i really like is far-flung epilogues, Luminosity was great for that. I'd love a whole bunch of light-hearted romps about Jake and revived!Cassie's children learning to morph and how criminals are using the morphing powers or andalite thoughtspeak etc to do things. Like, whatever the hell random topics of how life will "go back to normal" when the war is over. Ideally wholesome but if it's a sad ending then cripplingly sad stuff about Tobias mining salt while the visser whips him or something

- the Rachel thing is super intruging to me

- i agree with whoever said that the animorphs should double cross C/E, but we should also learn their motivations, so they s hould learn their motivations in order to doubel cross C/E

- also i want them to team up with V3 to do it and they find out they're Not So Different or some shit

- also i want alloran to have the last laugh

- no COVID, please, unless you have something amazing
