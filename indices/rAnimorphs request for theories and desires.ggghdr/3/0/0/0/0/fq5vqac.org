Ah right, instrumental convergence. Instrumental goals which help you achieve many different terminal goals will be shared by agents with every terminal goal which can be achieved through them. What this means here is that Ellimist and Crayak's goals are at least comprehensible to the other. If that were not the case, not only would they have few to no cases of instrumental overlap, but they wouldn't allow each other to implement the cases of instrumental overlap, in case they understood the others' terminal goals poorly and wound up helping the other agent far more than they helped themselves. Basically, we know that Ellimist and Crayak know what the other wants because they're both willing to implement things which advance both of their goals.
