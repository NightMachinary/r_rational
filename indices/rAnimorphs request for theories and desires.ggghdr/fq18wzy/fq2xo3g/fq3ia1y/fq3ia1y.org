In a more traditional story, I'd agree, but the addition of Rachel is a core deviation from... something (and is implied to be /the/ central deviation by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/15/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 2]]). There was a prophecy about that /four/ humans would be the ones to meet Elfangor, not /five/, and I think it's a question that needs to be answered: What did the prophecy state, and how is it different from the reality with Rachel included? Note that [[/u/daytodave][u/daytodave]] also included something similar as one of their questions.

Similarly, the death of Cassie was a decision apparently reached in collaboration between the Ellimist and Crayak, despite being one of the four main "chosen" agents of humanity. One of them was shown simulating the results of that meeting, over, and over and over. in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/22/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 4]], before, apparently, /both/ players made the decision that Cassie was expendable. The reason they reached that decision is pertinent to the story.

If these were the results of the protagonists' actions, then sure, exploring them would be omake, rather than part of the story; instead, they're concrete manifestations of the decisions being made by the forces influencing the outcome of the story; insight into /why/ they made those choices should be part of the resolution of the story.
