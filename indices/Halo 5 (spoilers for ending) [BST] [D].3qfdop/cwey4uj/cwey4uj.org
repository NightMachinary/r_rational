I don't really have a lot to add except to agree with everything in the OP. This really is an incredibly unsophisticated narrative as far as AI-as-a-setting-conceit goes. It's astonishing how many classic AI storytelling cliches they fall into.

What really bothers me is how LITTLE actually happens. The campaign is essentially five hours of everybody asking "What is Cortana doing? Did she turn evil or insane?", with Cortana essentially being like 'teehee i'm not telling~' until the very last chapter, at which point she's pretty much like "yeah i'm totally evil slash insane now, there's your answer!"

In any actual, sane, worth-paying-attention-to-plot, these events would at most have taken up a single goddamn chapter, maybe even just a prologue. In fact, yes- that's the problem! This entire game is pretty much a prologue! The entirety of the story is a setup for... Whatever Halo 6 is going to be, I guess.

I normally don't care about triple-A first person shooters, but damn it I really liked the Promethian designs in this game, especially the Warden Eternal. And the Sanghelios and Genesis landscapes were absolutely incredible. It's a shame that there's no coherent plot to support them.
