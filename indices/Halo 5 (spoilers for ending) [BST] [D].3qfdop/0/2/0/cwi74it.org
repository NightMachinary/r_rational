I agree! It's amazing!

It's actually pretty dark from a control of your fate standpoint.

Basically throughout the course of the game, everything you do matters very little in the grand scheme of events. Most of the important stuff happens off-screen and out of your control. Everything kind of falls apart around you, despite your best efforts. At the end of the day you only barely manage to avert total disaster and are the lone survivor, but you have no way home and on a bigger scale, the Covenant is still out there and still outmatches humanity. You've moved the problem somewhat in time, but you haven't moved beyond your situation.
