Me and my friends came up with a general name for this kind of problem. We call it a "corrosive red herring".

The definition is essentially when what could potentially be an interesting moral dilemma or concept is rendered moot by some separate fact.

For example, if there's some supposed utopia that's based on some very different moral and societal principals that ends up going off the rails because the society isn't competent at doing what it intended. For a specific example, the anime Psycho Pass. The main conceit is that technology can read people's mental states and determine whether people have criminal intent, thus crimes can be prevented before they happen, and the bad elements are reliably removed from society and sent to therapy. It turns out the therapy is fucked however, and basically consists of enternal One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest imprisonment. What if it worked though? Wouldn't THAT be the much more interesting story?

See, a corrosive red herring is at its core a cop-out, a way for the storyteller to avoid having to think through the implications of their idea in detail, and avoid having to confront the essence of the moral dilemma that they're trying to set up .
