  Bear in mind that the AI show several times that they care about people and even though they are willing to sacrifice in the name of peace they make a concentrated effort to limit casualties as much as they can.

This is especially true for Cortana herself. This is completely and utterly out of character for her.

Two possibilities:

1. It's not Cortana, just something wearing her face. Cue Boss Battle/ Roaring Rampage of Revenge
2. Master Chief gives world's most laconic cooldown speech ever. Great job, the infinite AI overmind sure never could have thought of that. Then either plot-induced-stupidity forced bossfight anyway as EvilAI takes over newly turned Cortana or she asks to be destroyed for what she's done, or something else equally stupid and contrived.
