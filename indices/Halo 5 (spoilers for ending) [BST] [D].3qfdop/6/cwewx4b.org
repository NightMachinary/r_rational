Was any reason given why she now hates tech and decides to emp Earth? She's been corrupted by an (outsourced) Amish virus? She saw Battlestar Galactica (new series) once and went insane from the horror of thinking that humans might think of her in the same breath as the dumbest AIs ever imagined? She's been reading too many "after the end" stories? She wants to starve 99 percent of Earth's population and will enjoy using spybots to watch the poor bastards that remain eating each other (would make sense if she had just watched the complete Battlestar Galactica and was now unable to delete it from her memory).

Ruling with an iron fist might make sense if you tilt your head and squint, but starving almost everyone on Earth to death doesn't.
