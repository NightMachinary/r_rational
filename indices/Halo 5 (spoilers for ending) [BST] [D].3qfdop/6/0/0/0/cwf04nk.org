Ah, well the Halo's (as far as I'm aware) are all gone and there is absolutely no evidence supporting the fact that humans are even close to doing anything like that. In fact, during the game the covenant rebellion falls and the arbiter becomes the main leader and has a good relationship with humanity so there's not even any "major" wars going on.
