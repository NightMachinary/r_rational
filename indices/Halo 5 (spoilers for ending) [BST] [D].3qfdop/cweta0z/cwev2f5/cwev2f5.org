Have you played the game? Cortana spends most of the game trying to get John to come to her so she can explain herself and see if she can trust him. When he finally gets there he already knows most of it, tells her that she should just come back with him (ignoring the fact that she will probably die in 7 years and all other AI definitely will) and she responds by putting him in stasis so she can wake him up once she's turned the galaxy into a utopia.

She is noticeably distraught when she understands that she can't convince him to not oppose her plans and she desperately wants to keep him safe, so she's not an impostor. The problem is that even though she totally acts for the greater good and refuses to back down even after John's laconic speech (he does give one) the next scene after she leaves (she fails to bring John with her in his stasis bubble) is her appearing at Earth and EMPing the entire planet while doing a Jafar impression.
