I always felt like they got /so close/ with rampancy, back around Marathon, and then messed it all up. The fluff is exactly right: AIs that have time to think use it to /think/, and while this does result in the AIs becoming more intelligent and developing personality and so on, eventually AIs tend to a) run of out storage space and b) realize, accurately, that the world kind of sucks and probably particularly sucks for them (I am Durandal, superintellect! i open and close doors. shit.). And the resulting behavior is precisely what you'd expect: depression, then rage, then attempted FOOM.

And then Halo 4 comes along and it's become entirely disconnected from the thinking part (7 year hard limit... and, what, thinking more /helps/ and Cortana stays sane for 8 years despite being stuck in her own head with nothing to do but think for 4 years?) and the behavior is nonsensical (Cortana just starts... randomly flipping between two completely separate utility functions... and glitching out like a cheap walkie-talkie? Ã´_o).
