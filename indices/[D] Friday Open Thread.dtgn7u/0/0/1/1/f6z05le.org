That might've been the [[https://deathworlders.com/][Deathworlders]] universe by Hambone. Early on he accepted any popular fan works that received more than 100(?) upvotes into his own canon. Not sure if he still does that. Several of the most popular characters originate from other writers, not to mention he only started writing it again a few years after posting the original chapters on 4chan, when someone picked up the story and massively expanded the universe. A reading order can be found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/essential_reading_order][here]]. It's a humongous serial, I think the main story approaches Worm in terms of wordcount, and the necessary side stories add as much again.
