I mean, you just described about half the stories on HFY. They have a whole bunch of stories based on the concept that earth is a "deathworld", and humans are correspondingly physically capable. At this point, it's kind of played out and boring in my opinion, just because it's been done so often.

But, if you are interested in those kind of stories, you should probably check out the sub.

-edit- just realized you are the one who posted the top level comment, so are probably familiar with the hfy sub. Carry on.
