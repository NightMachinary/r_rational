I like HFY content in general, but I think HFY the subreddit has a disappointingly repepetive take on it. Their near-exclusive focus on sci-fi leaves them writing "human" factions that are basically just aliens themselves, what with the implausible technology. Meanwhile, their aliens are nowhere near properly alien enough.

In my opinion, an HFY story is at its best when:

- Its human(s) are from the modern age or before, and have corresponding capabilities. No sci-fi.\\
- In a story set in an original sci-fi universe, to the extent that humans are special, it should be because humans are weird even compared to most of earths' species (bipedal? endurance hunting? domesticators? what?) or because /all/ of earth's life is weird for well justified reason (and not just the cliche "most sapients are herbivores") like "planets in the outer rim of the galaxy receive less cosmic radiation, so life forms evolved there tend to have weird characteristics."\\
- In a story set in a derivative universe, the specific aim of the story should be to lampoon the misanthropic nature of the author(s) the universe is derived from, or at least the misanthropic way people interpret the original work. For example, there are a few truly excellent HFY stories in the My Little Pony fanfiction community because they're recursively derivative works of the incredibly misanthropic "conversion bureau" sub-universe.

You'll notice I've avoided mentioning original fantasy universes. This is due to their incredible rarity-- for whatever reason, HFY writers much prefer to create original nonhumans for space opera settings, rather than fantasy settings. The one exception I know of, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/bfrj07/retreat_hell/][Retreat, hell!]] is notably better than most of the stuff on [[/r/HFY]].
