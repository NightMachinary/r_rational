Hey, thanks for replying!

Well, I'm glad to hear I haven't hallucinated anything and that I'm searching in the right place. And yeah, I found that thread as well, but it wasn't it. Thanks for the effort, though.

For context, and now fully assuming no one has taken up that project, I thought I would either write an Avatar storyline surrounding it or invent something wholly independent using 6 elements instead, as a form of the history and different topics in rationality. It had a lot of great information and context to it.
