Hey everyone - sent this to the mods last week, got permission to post it in general - tl;dr looking for a post/comment chain concerning rational Avatar:TLA fiction where each nation represents a different focus/area of rationality.

I believe it was held in this subreddit several years back, sometime most likely between the years of 2013-2017. It involved a group of people discussing a rationalist take on avatar: The Last Airbender, and specifically that each of the four nations in the series would focus on either a method or process in rational thinking (ex Fire Nation on instrumental rationality, air Nomads on value-based rationality) or perhaps on philosophical/economic beliefs (Water Nation are utilitarians, etc), and the main character Aang would travel to each nation learning these techniques to become fully developed.

I've tried extensively searching through Google, the reddit search bar, etc, but cannot find the discussion, and don't seem to have had it saved anywhere.

Was wondering if anybody recalls this conversation, knows where to find it, or the people who might have been involved? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
