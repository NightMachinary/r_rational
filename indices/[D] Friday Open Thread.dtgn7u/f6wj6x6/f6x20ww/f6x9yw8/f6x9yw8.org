My problem with HFY is that almost no one is able to think of a take on the concept that isn't "Aliens are all mind bogglingly incompetent". I much MUCH prefer stories where humanity is less overwhelmingly badass but the aliens are believably capable themselves. It's actually kind of insulting when the authors are basically saying "Humans only kick ass if the rest of universe has trouble stringing two sentences together".
