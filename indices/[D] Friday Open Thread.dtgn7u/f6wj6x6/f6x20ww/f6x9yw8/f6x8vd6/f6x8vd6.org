This comment reminds me of some web fiction, democratically written if I recall (popular original story line and lots of people contributed their own stories, so fan fiction I guess).

It was where humans were exceptionally strong and violent compared to the rest of the galaxy and a normal human could just kick alien special forces ass. Turns out Earth is a particularly harsh environment compared to all the other planets intelligent life developed on.

Now, of course, I can't remember the title or find it anywhere. I'd love to find it again.
