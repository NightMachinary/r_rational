Uh, Egan's sci-fi is WAY harder than Arthur C. Clarke. I don't even know why Clark gets labeled "hard sci-fi". Have you /read/ Childhood's End? Clarke includes unexplained mystical psychic powers in practically all of his novels.

Not to mention faster-than-light travel!

How can it be hard scifi with FTL travel?
