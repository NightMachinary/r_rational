Try reading the Pandora's Legions series. It's, well, half of what you want - each story switches between a human helping an alien, more-or-less benevolent (though not terribly smart) empire integrate more alien species into itself, and an alien officer trying to cope with the frankly disastrous effects of humans' own integration because of the dangerous but seemingly beneficial ideas they have (such as capitalism with legally mandated consumption).
