Greg Egan does this. I don't believe that any character in his novel Incandescence would count as a human but it's been a while since I read that one. I haven't read his Orthogonal trilogy yet but I don't think there are any humans in it either. Depending on whether or not conscious beings who are software and have always been software count, many other stories would qualify.
