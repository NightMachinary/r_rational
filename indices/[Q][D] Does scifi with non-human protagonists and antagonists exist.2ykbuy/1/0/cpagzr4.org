Orthogonal definitely qualifies. There's nothing resembling humans. It's not even in a universe remotely like ours.

Incandescence sort of qualifies. The Amalgam civilization (expanded on in a couple of short stories) is at least partially descended from humans, and I recall one of the main characters having some human ancestry. But the chapters from the "aliens'" point of view definitely qualifies.
