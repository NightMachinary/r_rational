The novel version of Nightfall, by Isaac Asimov and I think Robert Silverberg, opens with a note that "actually everyone involved looks like a tentacle monster, but we'll narrate as if they're humans for the same reason we translated their speech into English."

And then their body type goes on to be completely irrelevant as promised, but their /mind/ types are /suspiciously/ humanlike.
