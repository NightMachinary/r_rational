A few ideas (none of which are really rational/rationalist, but all of which are entertaining nonetheless):

Steven Brust's Khaavren romances, which follow essentially (sadly humanoid) sort-of-elves throughout and has only very minor human parts. These elves have a fairly interesting nonhuman polity and outlook and society. The novels themselves are based loosely on the D'Artagnan Romances (The Three Musketeers and sequels). They are written in a unique comic ornate Dumas Imitation style, so I'd heavily recommend trying the first (The Phoenix Guards) before buying them - some people hate the style and basically can't read the books, while others, myself included, love the books specifically because of the style.

Asimov's The Gods Themselves has a large middle section in an extremely nonhuman, very sparsely described section with no human characters whatsoever. It's pretty neat.

Ted Chiang's short story Exhalation is about an extremely nonhuman society and scientist.

Depending on how you count humans... Sean McMullen's fantasy series Moonworlds has /technically/ got two humans/former humans in the first book as a central characters, one who then recurrs in minor roles, but all characters are at least mostly humanoid-ish barring extra arms and have extremely recognizably human societies and outlooks, and 3 of 4 of these books have these humanish-characters with no main character a human or descent of humans.
