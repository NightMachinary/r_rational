I agree that "chemical engineer" is probably the best background to have. In individual settings, depending on magic system, physicists, computer scientists, and mathematicians might have an advantage, but for pure utility, you can't beat chemical engineering.

Mech or electrical engineering is strictly dominated because in any situation, either you need to build your tech base from scratch (so you need a working knowledge of chemical processes) or you already have a working tech/magic base, in which case a purer field is likely more helpful for learning an advanced, but divergent technology base.
