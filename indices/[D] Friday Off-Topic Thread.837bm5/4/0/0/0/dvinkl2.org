For rational fics set somewhere less advanced than earth, You need to build the tools to build the tools to build the tools to uplift society. And in order to do that, you need to have a decent knowledge of a number of chemical processes, e.g., the bessemer process, smelting pig iron, how to alloy to make stainless steel chemicals to make electric reactions, etcetera. Mech or electrical engineers will know some of that stuff, but not as much of it as a chemical engineer.

Alternatively, in a rationalfic setting that has roughly equal technology level to ours, but different setting rules (i.e., magic or divergent physics), what matters is the mindset a career path puts you in. "Purer" fields (mathematics, physics, computer science) tend to provide the best backing for working under constrained rulesets. The engineering disciplines are on the same general tier, which means chemical engineering is still better.

And for a mostly real-world setting, chemical engineers have a median wage of about $98,000, which is all you really need to know.
