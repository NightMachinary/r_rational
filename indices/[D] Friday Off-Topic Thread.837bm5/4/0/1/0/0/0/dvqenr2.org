Wow, that's a really dumb argument. Consider this:

#+begin_quote
  You have a mental model of the universe (what fire is, and how it works).

  You predict the outcome of an action based on that model (if I strike this match, it will produce fire).

  The action's outcome is not what you expected (the match fails to light).

  Instead of amending your mental model, you insist that no, it's the universe that's wrong.
#+end_quote

Do you see how irrational that is? You're not actually thinking scientifically. You're fetishizing your existing knowledge of chemistry and physics, and demanding that the universe fit what you know, instead of considering the evidence in front of you.

Yes, if your understanding is correct, then you couldn't exist in a universe that doesn't abide by the same physical laws as our own. But you're clearly in another world, that clearly follows different rules, and you're not currently dead. So clearly it's your understanding of reality that's wrong.

Maybe you underwent some kind of conversion when you were brought to this new world. Or maybe it's a lot easier for different realities to mingle than you think. These are rational conclusions. Denying the evidence right in front of you is not.
