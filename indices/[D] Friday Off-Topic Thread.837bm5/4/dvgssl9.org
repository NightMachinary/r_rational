Just wondering how would you "optimize" a rational fiction character? What type of personality traits, general skill set, career path etc. should one have to survive and thrive despite being transplanted across a variety of different rational fiction settings?

I suppose what I'm asking for are commonalities across successful viewpoint-characters in rational fiction, before they grow into the setting.

The best I could come up with is an optimistic chemical engineer-turned-used car salesman in his 30s, with excellent memory for details. The sort of natural down-on-his-luck appeal to the writer/audience into treating him favourably, optimistic enough to take some hopeful risks, old enough to avoid unnecessary ones, an engineering background for creative problem-solving, and sufficient people skills to make friends or pull off some funny business.

A "when life hands you lemons, you sell them" type of character.
