for the anime I liked Battle tendency the most as Joseph is my favourite jojo. stardust crusaders for me was the weakest in the seies. I much more enjoyed phantom blood and deffinitly enjoyed DiU A lot MORE. for me it would be like 2>4>1>3 and we will see about vento aurero in upcoming years (the name is already licensed by david productions so i think we will get the anime shortly)

jojo is just a classic. Its everything anime was about for me and will hold a special place in my heart.
