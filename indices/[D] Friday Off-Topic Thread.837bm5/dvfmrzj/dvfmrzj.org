Anyone [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vz27p/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dm432zg][remember]] my long-winded [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7c1mov/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dpmmoj7][updates]] about working my way through the anime JoJo's Bizarre Adventure? Well I finally finished Stardust Crusaders after 3 sporadic months and feel like talking about it. It's definitely the most hit or miss arc so far, which made the 48 episode run harder to get through than the first two arcs (26 episodes combined). I like episodic monster of the week series, but this one lacks the engaging myth arc and developing character drama that I enjoy about those shows.

At the same time though, the story of JoJo has really only been an excuse for goofy set pieces and this arc has more of that than ever. The Stand battles may be formulaic and vary in quality, but I can't say they're boring to watch. The series is clinging to the plot structure established by the first two arcs where the mentor/rival figure(s) get removed from the fight, the hero pulls something out of their ass, and the useless character(s) yell in shock. Even if the characters alternate who takes which role and some episodes break the mold, my favorite being the hysterical Oingo Boingo brothers, the length and repetitiveness of the story make it harder to stay invested.

The characters could compensate for that, but I never cared much about the tour group. The plot's fixation with one-on-one fights prevents a team dynamic from forming, not that Stand powers are consistent enough for that anyway, and I had a hard time pinning down their personalities. I don't even know why Joseph was here since he rarely acts like he did last arc. Jotaro is easily my least favorite JoJo so far, no matter how much I like his cathartic “ora ora” beatdowns. I'm also sad to admit that fan favorite Polnareff never got a laugh out of me.

The comedy was a reoccurring problem in this arc for me. Listening to voice actors chew the scenery with cheesy lines isn't as funny in Japanese and the hilariously awful pronunciation of English words didn't make up for it. This was the first time I could tell characters were telling jokes instead of just acting weird, so it was disappointing that I only laughed at the slapstick gags (particularly the fight with Mariah) when the comedy was dominated by toilet humor. Case in point, I hated Iggy farting in people's faces but loved the contrived coincidences where he saved people.

With all that baggage going into the fight with Dio, who I had loved in Phantom Blood but had done nothing this whole arc, I didn't think it'd be possible for the climax to satisfy me. However, despite having the power of The World spoiled for me and not finding Dio's new appearance menacing, I still managed to get invested in the final battle and have a good time. It probably helped that I marathoned everything after entering the mansion in one sitting, so the plot's momentum and the scale of the fight distracted me from how badly I wanted the arc to end already.

I can't say Stardust Crusaders is bad or even all that disappointing by the standards set by JoJo, it just isn't as consistently good as I want it to be and that keeps me from enjoying it as much as before. It's hard to figure out what I want from JoJo since I fell in love with it for the same reasons as So Bad It's Good media, which makes its appeal hard to analyze when it isn't actually ironic. Still, even if I can't claim they were better executed I felt a lot more from the Zeppeli deaths than I did with Avdol and Kakyoin. I've spent way more time with them but feel like I know even less about them.

I'm torn over whether to recommend Stardust Crusaders as a starting point for newcomers. In many ways it does represent what JoJo is all about, has the “first season” feel of experimenting with concepts and characters, and even the lack of context for things that have been explained would prime people for how many things are never explained. On the other hand, I don't think I would've made it through the low points of this arc or accepted when the plot ran on the logic of magical martial arts if the prequels hadn't won me over first.

I don't know if it would be better to judge each arc as individual stories that just happen to take place in the same nonsensical universe because so far none of the conclusions have been as satisfying as I would've liked and that craving for more is what keeps me wanting to continue. I'll definitely be watching Diamond is Unbreakable when I get the chance, it sounds like the arc will experiment with the novel concept of character development and focus more on teamwork.
