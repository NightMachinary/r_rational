  A hunter who brings in a single deer or bear provides more food than a woman harvesting berries.

Yeah, but a woman teaching a child to walk, talk, hunt, cooking, making clothing, etc does more than a hunter who brings in a single deer; something can be vital and yet undervalued (just look at our society).

Besides, a hunter-gatherer "hunter" is probably not one guy with a bow bringing down several deer in a day; it's probably several men working together like a wolf pack. Realistically you're looking at several men going on a hunting expedition for several days and bringing back one or two deer. Which might be providing a good percentage of the calories, but in the meantime they're neglecting the camp.

Easy to justify it as being undervalued - I mean, we're all familiar with the stereotype of fathers who work all day and never see their children, and then try to "buy their love" with expensive gifts when really all the kid wants is quality time.
