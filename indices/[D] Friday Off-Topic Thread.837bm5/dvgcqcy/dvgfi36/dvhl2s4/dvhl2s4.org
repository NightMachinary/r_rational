I had always thought hunters had higher prestige because they're the most politically relevant faction(s) in a tribal society. Since control of the majority of the men of fighting age is necessary and sufficient for control of the tribe, the majority of the spoils (including status) will go to them. In any society in which the majority of the spoils do not go to them, the opposition faction (the chief's second son, the second-largest voting bloc, whatever) could seize power by bribing the hunters with more spoils, so MOLOCH dictates that all societies must allocate all available resources to the hunters unless some active pressure prevents this from being so.

Consider a society in which the gatherers are all high status and the hunters are all low status. Wouldn't it only take one hunter uprising to flip that upside-down? And since the hunters have the weapons and the will to use them, the gatherers can do nothing to unseat them, so it would remain like that indefinitely.
