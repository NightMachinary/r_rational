How would you go about creating a (believable) primitive society with equality between genders? At the very least, a society that lets women have some independence, agency.

I read a long time ago that early humans transitioned from matriarchies to patriarchies when they realized the connection between intercourse and conception. Before this idea, pregnancies were maybe seen as a sort of natural phenomena. That realization of cause and effect then led inexorably to the concept of paternity.

If that's true, then seen through that lens a lot of how men came to treat women was to ensure paternity of their children. Woman are property of their father, kept 'unspoiled' until they're fertile, then 'sold' to a husband, where they're kept mostly segregated from every other male to ensure that any child is the husband's. The reason they can't own property, can't get an educations, and can't have proper careers is just a logistical problem; women would have to mingle with non-husband, non-relative men and possibly become 'contaminated'.

So. My idea of the simplest way to have a primitive society with organic gender equality would would be to have a 'magical', sure-proof paternity test, and a simple and effective contraceptive for women. Both would have to be extremely common and cheap.

If a society had both, then perhaps it wouldn't feel the need to enforce gender segregation of children starting at puberty. Adolescents having sex would no longer be a big deal. If a paternity test were customary at birth (maybe even mandatory, if a man wanted to claim parental rights?) then its possible that marriage as a social construct would no longer even be necessary.

Thoughts?
