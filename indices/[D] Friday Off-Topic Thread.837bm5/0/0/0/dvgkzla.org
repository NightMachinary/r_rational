Oh man, does that sound familiar.

Personally speaking, I've given up on regular updates. I think the added stress and complications on my schedule aren't worth it. I just try to be as productive as I can all the time, and budget my time on a week-by-week basis.

On the one hand, it means I haven't worked on my game project for a while. On the other hand, I'm getting things done faster on average and being less worried about them.
