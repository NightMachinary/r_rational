I'm uh, in a bit of a slump. I seem to go through phases, alternating between months of huge daily progress balanced out by weeks of not being able to convince myself to so much as open the code.

Doesn't help that I'm usually loathe to admit it when it happens, since that feels a lot like admitting defeat.

I've gone back and forth on whether or not the weekly threads actually help; when I'm firing on all cylinders I feel like they're a huge boost to my momentum, but when I'm on the down slide they're a rather stressful regular reminder that I've gotten nothing constructive done. And that's not hyperbole; outside of this project I tend to be in a state of work-play-sleep that is great at maintaining the status quo and not much else.

I am however always on the [[/r/rational]] discord server and will always respond to queries on the #pokengineering channel there. If I had to guess, I'd say that the current slump will last no more than about three more weeks, possibly less, but I guess we'll see.
