I think you're on the right track, but you got lost with "prestige". It doesn't matter how people view an activity. It's about "impact". A hunter who brings in a single deer or bear provides more food than a woman harvesting berries. Yes, a diverse diet is necessary to keep people healthy, but even more important is having enough to eat in the first place.

I think in order to reach egalitarianism, the society needs to have decoupled strength and utility. If a strong child is more important to society than an intelligent child, irrespective of sex, then the sexes aren't equal.

Maybe there is an equilibrium where social pressures provide feedback to counteract the disparate impact of gender-specific differences, but I can't see what it is. Part of the problem is that such social pressures can be abused, leading to non-egalitarian outcomes. I think it would be a lot easier to come up with a matriarchal society, but even then... maybe if the rules made men a liability to the society as a whole? I can imagine a few ways, but I'd have to put more brain time on this.
