  Yeah, but a woman teaching a child to walk, talk, hunt, cooking, making clothing, etc does more than a hunter who brings in a single deer; something can be vital and yet undervalued (just look at our society).

Irrelevant. I'm not here to argue that one gender's traditional roles are more valuable than the other's. Unequal, sure, but in an apple-and-oranges sort of way.

  Besides, a hunter-gatherer "hunter" is probably not one guy with a bow bringing down several deer in a day; it's probably several men working together like a wolf pack.

That just amplifies the impact. As the food reserves dwindle, they do so everywhere. You can't go to your neighbor and borrow anything, because everyone's bellies are tightening. Either the hunters return with food, or everyone continues to starve. In such a situation, the effective hunters will easily be able to convert their skill into social status.

Compare with someone who is really good at domestic chores. It's like... in today's world, having a good manager. Everything just runs smoothly and you don't even notice how much their work affects you. These people, while valuable, have a much harder time getting recognized for their work.
