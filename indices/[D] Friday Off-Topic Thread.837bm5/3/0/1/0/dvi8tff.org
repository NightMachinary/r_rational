I mean... this is for a hypothetical society someone wants to build, so it doesn't have to be a "natural" divide.

I think history shows that there are PLENTY of societies where the low class could/should uprise over the high class but didn't, or didn't for a long, long time.

And the hypothetical wasn't for a matriarchal society where women are queens and men are scum; it's for one where everyone's equal. So if there's plenty of food and everyone has equal access, why have an uprising? Or, at the very least, why not wait to have the uprising until after the events of OP's story are written? ;)
