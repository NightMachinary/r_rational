Yeah: I'd probably also do something based on some of the more "obscure" societies we have, doing away with pair-bonding altogether.

I also remember reading about a town in Nepal or something where everyone lives in family houses that consist of sisters and brothers. The sisters go off and sleep with whoever they want to from outside the household, and then when they get pregnant, all the brothers and sisters raise the children together and the biological father has no idea.

Another society where it is believed that a baby is made from the combination of menstrual fluid and semen, kind of like a big clay sculpture: so the mother puts in some raw material and /all the men she sleeps with/ also put in raw material - so in their culture they believe the child has one mother and, say, 3 or 4 fathers depending on how many people the mother sleeps with while she's pregnant. I always thought that was interesting.
