I read about a tribe somewhere that eats a natural abortifacient as part of their regular diet, so they never worked out the sex-pregnancy connection and had a really liberated sexual society. I don't know if this translated to more general equality or just promiscuity.

I also remember reading about "plow societies" versus "something else" societies - it was saying that once farming was invented, the work that was needed was mostly plowing which was men's work and there was enough food that the woman didn't need to work, and a man could have several wives, whereas before, hunting and gathering required more equal investments from both men and women. But I could be entirely misremembering it.

I think paternity is kind of a red herring: while pregnancy is a thing, the most relevant difference is going to be upper body strength.

I remember reading an article or essay saying that it was a pity that all the "matriarchal societies" shown in fiction simply showed women doing the "men's chores" - so they'd go fight in wars, hunt, etc while the men looked after the children. Instead, the author argued, why not invent a society where the men still hunt and fight in wars but this is considered to be dirty or disgusting or shameful, it is given less prestige (maybe hunting is dirty because of the blood, or because of the act of killing). And the act of looking after children or gathering berries is high prestige (after all, raising the next generation is pretty important; gathering berries requires a lot of observational skills/etc).

So I think if I were to do it, I'd uncouple sex from procreation, and I'd change the /prestige/ of the actions - I'd probably mix up the men's work / women's work a little, but I'd give men some low-prestige jobs (e.g. hunting) and some high prestige jobs (e.g. building), and do the same for women (low prestige: washing? high prestige: gathering).
