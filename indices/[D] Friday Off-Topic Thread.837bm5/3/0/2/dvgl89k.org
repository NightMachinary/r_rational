You could have it where the men do the normal thing with hunting and building, but have the women be the ones who get good at making tools, cooking/selecting good food, and strategizing to advance over their neighbors. An organization that hoards knowledge on how to make effective tools, how to make nutritious food from surrounding material, and can undetectably poison anyone they think challenges them would be quite powerful. For example, any tribe that discovers pickling first would have an enormous advantage over any other that has to subsist on the food that can be found fresh in the winter. Or that boiling water means that you don't get sick from it, something women would be better placed to notice, and which would be difficult to reverse engineering the effect simply from the finished product.
