Backwards with Purpose - Always and Always is a good Harry Potter fanfic where the first time around everyone except Harry, Ron and Ginny died. They figure out a way to go back in time and try again in order to save everyone. I enjoyed it. I also REALLY like Nightmares of Futures Past, a different Harry Potter fanfic where he goes back alone, but it's not complete and on haitus.
