Time Travel:

- I liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] quite a bit. The characters quickly become unbalanced, but it's slightly mitigated because their opponents tend to attack them in ways that bypass their defenses. The fic does contain some sex scenes, though not in a way that bothered me.
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]] is a short (16 chapters + epilogue) terminator fic.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10017610/1/The-Dangers-of-Foresight][Dangers of Foresight]] is a Star Wars fic. There's a prequel, but it's not a must-read before starting with Foresight.

Fantasy:

- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]] is not a time travel fic, but it contains many of the same elements of incremental growth that you find in time travel fics. I've never read a fic that was this detailed in describing how its technology works.
