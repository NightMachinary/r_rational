To say nothing of the dog is probably my favourite novel. If general time travel is the theme I'd recommend a bunch of Connie Willis. The Doomsday book, Fire Watch, All Clear and Blackout are all fantastic.

And thanks for the rise and fall of d.o.d.o. Hadn't heard of that and now need to go pick it up!
