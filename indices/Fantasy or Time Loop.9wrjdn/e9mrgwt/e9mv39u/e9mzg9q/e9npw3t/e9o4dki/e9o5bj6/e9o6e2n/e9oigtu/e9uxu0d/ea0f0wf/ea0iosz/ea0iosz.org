This is pretty comprehensive of all the pony time loop stories if you want to dig through it yourself, sorting by rating helps a lot. [[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/198605/timeloop-stories]]

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset]] This is the one you were looking for, another person who replied to me actually brought it up. This one is probably the only one besides the first I recommended that extremely well known in the MLP fiction community. It has several sequels and side stories, you can look through the author's stories page for them, they should also be linked in the authors notes somewhere. I also recommend the author a lot if you want to venture into more pony fics besides time loops, he's one of the best.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder]] This is a fanfic of the first Hard Reset fanfic. It's really good but very unlikely to ever be finished.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/160710/moments]] I enjoyed this one a lot. It's dark.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/269107/the-only-day]] This one is real good too. It's dark.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/294745/tick]] I liked this one too. It's dark.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/98568/mlp-time-loops]] This one is massive, 2.2 million words, longer than Worm. Not /that/ good in my opinion but if you really like long stuff worth looking at.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/180134/ponies-on-a-monorail]] This one is decent. I read it ages ago and I just vaguely remember liking it, so it's probably not trash.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/178013/half-minute-horses]] This one is decent. I also read it ages ago and I just vaguely remember liking it, so it's probably not trash.
