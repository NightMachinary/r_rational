Generally I would recommend royalroadl.com as a place to look. There are some fics you could enjoy.

Metaworld chronicles is one of my favorites atm. It is basically modern fantasy with our world but with magic. Main character is transported there in her younger body. She becomes steadily stronger but is nowhere near the top. There are uncounted stronger oppositions. It plays mostly in magic Sydney.

If you don't mind litrpg you could read threadbare main character is a sentient golem made out of a teddy bear. It is better than it sounds. And don't let you turn of because of "supposedly" stereotypical evil characters.

A goblins teeth is very popular. Great read and very funny. Told from the view of a goblin that gets captured by bandits.
