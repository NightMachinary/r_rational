Replay, by Ken Grimwood, has a kind-of-sort-of time loop going on. The main character has a heart attack at 43 and wakes up in his 18 year old body. He uses his knowledge of the future to get rich, live an awesome life, and then has a heart attack at 43 and dies again. He wakes up in his 18 year old body once more, but a few days later this time. I won't go into more detail because I'd have to basically spoil the whole book, but it's pretty cool.
