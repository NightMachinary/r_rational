Even curated, I often find movies tedious relatives to books and video games. I think you can kind of model these 3 media on a spectrum of activity. Books allow for a lot of introspection and narration of the sort that's difficult to fit in other genres. Video games allow for a degree of agency and audience participation that's totally unmatched. But movies sit in between the two, and so they're not as good at delivering a spectacular in some respect experience. They do have an advantage in revealing visually spectacular predefined stories of the sort that video games can't always deal with, and there are definitely movies I love, but overall I devote a lot more of my time to the other 2.
