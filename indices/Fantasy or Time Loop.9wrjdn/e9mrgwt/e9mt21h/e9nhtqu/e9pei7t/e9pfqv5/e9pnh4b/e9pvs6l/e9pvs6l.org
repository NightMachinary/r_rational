Right, so be choosy about the movies you watch. No way have I watched even 1% of the movies out there. But the first time I saw Vertigo is an experience I hold dear.

I totally agree that most movies are bunk. So are most books, songs, clothes, and people. That's why I'm careful how I spend my time and money.
