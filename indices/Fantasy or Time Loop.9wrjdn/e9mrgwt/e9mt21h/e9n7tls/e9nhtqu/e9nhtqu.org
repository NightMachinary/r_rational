I gotta say I think that's a crazy attitude about movies! There are so many amazing films out there that limiting yourself to what's in cinemas or what your friends want to watch is a huge waste.

You're entitled to your opinions and I don't think downvoting you was necessary, but that's an awfully restrictive mindset.
