Have you watched Primer? In my opinion it's the best time travel movie ever made, possibly the best time travel media of any kind. Go in without reading anything about it, then read as much as you can after.

As far as fantasy, have you read Brandon Sanderson? His characters are extraordinary, and many of them act rationally in the exploration/exploitation of their powers. Definitely not rationalist, but generally well-regarded on this sub. His worldbuilding & magic systems are also consistently brilliant. Start with Mistborn.
