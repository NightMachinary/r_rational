Primer is a movie only, but it is an indie movie that was made on a super tight budget (the director is also one of the main characters, and they shot on film offcuts from other projects, etc). Added to that, they use the medium of a movie really well and I don't think it would be close to the same with a novelisation.

Invite some friends over and watch it! Puzzling out the plot together is a great activity.
