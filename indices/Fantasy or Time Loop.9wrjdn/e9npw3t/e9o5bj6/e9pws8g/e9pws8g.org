[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][/Hard Reset 2/]] is even better than the Eakin novels. The original /Hard Reset/ only has one trick; iterate until you solve the problem, then move on to the next problem. /Hard Reset 2/ is more complex because there are additional time travelers, so the fic also deals with cooperation and combat between loopers. Shame it is dead.
