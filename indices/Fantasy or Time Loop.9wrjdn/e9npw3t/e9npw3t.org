I know you've said you don't read My Little Pony fanfiction, but I'd heartily recommend [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/the-best-night-ever][The Best Night Ever]] anyway. It's my favourite MLP fic, exactly what you're looking for, and doesn't require knowledge of the series. If you do like it I have more MLP time loop stories to recommend, but The Best Night Ever is the best one in my opinion.

Not a book, but if you haven't seen Groundhog Day you should see it too. I know you said you don't watch movies, but Groundhog Day is /the/ definitive time loop story and all around great.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/]] is ASOIAF time loop story, I haven't read it yet myself but I've heard it's good.
