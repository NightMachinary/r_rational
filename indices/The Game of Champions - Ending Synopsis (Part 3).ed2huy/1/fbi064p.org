Perhaps its the distance from the original story, but this synopsis seemed a bit less /magical/ than the previous one. Red perhaps develops a bit as a character, but I guess the evocative writing just wasn't as strong, and the concept of Pokemon gods as a test for humanity seems a little cliche. I believe I preferred the story without that, but a postmortem critique would be in bad taste.

Eager to see the conclusion soon, get the closure that I gave up on.
