As requested. Lamora (the author) said the 4th part should be out before the new year, with a possible new year surprise.

You used to need an account on DLP with a certain number of non-spam posts to view the WbA subforum; someone said any new account will do. Pastebin [[https://pastebin.com/YQAf813s][here]] for the lazy and/or desperate, expires in 1 week.

Q: What is this story?

#+begin_quote
  It's a Pok√©mon fanfiction by a user named L. Lamora. It borrows elements from the manga, the games and even the anime, and it has really engaging writing and world building. It was possibly the best Pokemon fanfiction out there, before the writer abandoned it. They still give small synopses of future plot, to give some sense of closure, as an alternative to writing it all in proper story format. - quote from [[/u/Jose1561]] on [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dyffyv/the_game_of_champions_just_updated_sadly_its_just/f80ua0y/][the last thread]]
