  In the modern era this magic is gonna be mostly used for cosmetic and athletic purposes
#+end_quote

Athletic yes as a cheat to get there, but it would be expensive to pay for the maintenance on that for all but the uber wealthy. Mages are relatively rare, so think cosmetic surgery, you can't go in every few weeks for an expensive procedure, but going in once and then maintaining that is reasonable.

I don't think beauty is a biological process per-se, neither is permanently increasing in beauty. Though perhaps if one stole it from a young human growing up (but that would be very criminal - it would probably kill them), stealing maturing characteristics of physical beauty from an animal would probably go poorly. A temporary enchantment perhaps one could use an animal for that.

  Also what interactions do prion diseases have with this magic? I can't imagine anything good happens.

If you have prion riddled flesh one could use it to rot someone's brain at a distance, yes. An effective weapon, if a bit of a bio-hazard for yourself.
