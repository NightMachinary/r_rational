This may sound like fiat, but plants are too far from animals to work in the same way. The flesh of plants can only be used if they were part of a biological process through interaction with humans (like coffee beans - or the whole plant - can be consumed as a stimulant for alertness all at once). One could use the long life of a tree to make a plant that grew for a thousand years though.
