As with most things that allow magical healing, this would seem to allow soft immortality - you can still be killed, but slower stuff like diseases would be able to be mitigated by healing with flesh magic. On a societal scale, this (depending on how widespread the magic is) could lead to anything from immortal god-kings to hundreds of years old masters in various fields. This could easily lead to a stronger status quo, societally, as the classical process of new scientific ideas gaining widespread adoption by the old guard dying out might no longer happen.

Also, your magic system looks interesting, and I am looking forward to reading more about it.
