  So does bullet point one apply to sacrifice flying animals for flight? Like does consuming a bird allow you to generate a lifting force equivalent to that bird's capabilities?
#+end_quote

Yes, though you have to follow a conceptual version of the birds kinematic model to an extent. For an example you can't fly higher than the bird can, or accelerate faster.

  Also, if this is the case it implies stacking, does that hold true for other consumables (multiple eyes for better and better vision, or more and more viewpoints)?
#+end_quote

Yes it does stack but there are universal limits to how many enchantments a mage can hold, but they are kinda minor in the short term (e.g. a mage can apply a significant amount of lifting force, like on the order of magnitude of a plane, before getting close to those limits). And each individual one stacks as it's own enchantment. This has some other minor consequences (re: counter spelling).

Also, stacking generally applies only in one dimension. If you want to lift twice as much twice as fast you need 4 birds (or technically their wings, feathers, and tail) if you also want to double max speed you need 8.

  This could circumvent the brain regeneration thing since the animal would have to be regrowing the exact part of its brain that the human needed to heal, limb regrowth would end up being super tedious, though.
#+end_quote

Theoretically, if the arm can regrow then mass for mass you can use it's arm to regrow your arm. If it's whole body can regrow, you can use it's whole body as mass to regrow anything it could.

But for example, the axolotl will only regenerate brain stems. Even then neurodegenerative diseases aren't about regeneration, the brain is there, it's just failing to work properly. For this to be healed one would need something that has a biological process specifically for reversing neurodegenerative diseases. One could use human brains and consume them to make your own work correctly, for example, this would work with many neurdegenerative diseases as a mitigation, but not a cure for them. It's a conceptual magic system, but the concepts have to be true at some point (where the numbers come from; at least for this magic system - others have slightly different rules).

  Let's say you consume a live bird, do you get its ability to generate lift, its eyesight, its cognitive predilections, and whatever else it has to offer?
#+end_quote

Yes, however again, universal limits on enchantments means that's not generally useful to keep all of that around (and while taking it all at once contributes less to the limit, the extra stuff does still contribute). And some things may be needed for more than one enchantment, for example the muscles in it's wings are used for the lift enchantment, and hence can't be used for a telekinetic one. Additionally the mage has to conceptualize all of these enchantments at the same time (which is a master level kind of thing).

But if one was going to make an airplane using flesh magic (which is a bad idea because there are better magics for that, with lower economic cost, even without getting into the animal cruelty stuff - fly cruelty free air - but for an ability a flesh mage can pull out of their pocket...) the bird brains might be useful for maneuvering during flight, the eyes to see where one is going (one can never have enough eyes), the hearts to pump hydraulics, the bones to reinforce structure, the flesh for air tight seals (that all depends on what one is trying to make fly, like maybe just a couple of wooden chairs strapped together), and wings, feather, and tails for flight... one would need a lot of birds though, and the mage wouldn't be able to do much else for that whole trip (even if they could use the bird brains as a form of auto pilot).
