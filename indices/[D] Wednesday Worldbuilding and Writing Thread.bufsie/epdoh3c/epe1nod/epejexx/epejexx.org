By consumed I mean by a magical process, though theatrical flesh mages might take it literally.

  Could you consume a (or multiple) seahorse/s in the process of changing sex to cause a similar effect in yourself? Or for that matter, produce asexual from eating enough animals in the process of doing the same.

I like this one a lot, thank you. I hadn't thought of it seriously enough to connect the dots.

#+begin_quote
  electric eels, venomous animals/plants, flying animals, gilled animals?
#+end_quote

Electricity (though a rare creature), poisoning people by piercing their flesh, flight, underwater breathing.

  I wonder if, in regard to the first bullet point, people might have an incentive to breed animals (or, more likely, a specific animal) towards having better muscle density to get more out of less muscle consumed.
#+end_quote

In general yes, there are many magic systems, but breeding animals for their magical reagents is an industry.

  I'm curious what exactly counts as alive? There's a pretty obvious incentive for people to maintain an organ's freshness. Perhaps with cooling, artificial stimulation, nutrient solutions, etc.
#+end_quote

It's based off of biological "aliveness" so the warm and dead rule applies. And in the modern era of refrigeration...

  the axolotl can regenerate basically anything including parts of the brain
#+end_quote

Not that I am stuck with earth creatures, but thank goodness for:

#+begin_quote
  Some have indeed been found restoring the less vital parts of their brains
#+end_quote

Neurodegenerative diseases and vital brain damage shouldn't be protected by flesh magic was my plan.

#+begin_quote
  What happens when you consume brain?
#+end_quote

Sort of like muscle you get an enchantment of some temporary brain power, filtered through their brain patterns, activate-able on demand till it runs out (against universal limits of how many enchantments one can have). For animals this may give you animalisitic instincts, for people this might give you temporary thought patterns similar to theirs, maybe even with memories.
