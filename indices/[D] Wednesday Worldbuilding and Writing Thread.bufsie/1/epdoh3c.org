I'm writing a world with a bunch of magic systems. So I'll probably be doing a bunch of these (once a week). These are mostly to confirm what I already thought of but to make sure I'm not missing any consequences or ideas /about the magic/ not necessarily the spells I present as examples. I'm mostly interested in munchkin opportunities and professions in a modern world.

Flesh Magic. Flesh magic is about using the conceptual framework of the transformation of flesh over time (AKA biological processes) to create magical effects. The cost for this is the consumption of the flesh in the concept. Here flesh can mean living, fresh, or decaying flesh of plants or animals (anything alive; or technically anything with complex self sustaining chemical processes). The fresh (in minutes) or living flesh of a person (including the mage themself), animal, or plant can be used for most effects, but decaying or cooked flesh has a lot fewer uses. For example:

- Consume muscle mass to pull something (it can be any direction though), not more than the muscle mass consumed could have, and the amount of mass sacrificed determines how long the enchantment can pull for (though it can be kept and controlled for quite awhile; based on some universal limits).
- A plant that causes drowsiness can be consumed to put someone to sleep (plant flesh tends to last longer).
- Consuming edible flesh (e.g. one would have to be able to eat it in the first place) - the less processed and cooked the better - to gain energy and nutrition, which can be further focused into accelerated healing or muscle growth (or fat growth) by conceptualizing the bodies own processes (though this can be tricky to do all at once).
- Consuming fresh (or living) eyeballs to see like those eyes could, either on yourself directly (lasting longer), or far away (there are universal limits on how remote viewing works).
- Consuming the regenerating limb of an animal to regenerate that limb (at mass for mass conversion). Natural healing is easy, regenerating limbs is hard (it's about conceptual transformation; an arm cannot grow itself, and a tail that can regenerate cannot regenerate an arm).
- Blood is a popular choice of flesh that has it's own specialty magic (and hence gained additional related powers over time).
