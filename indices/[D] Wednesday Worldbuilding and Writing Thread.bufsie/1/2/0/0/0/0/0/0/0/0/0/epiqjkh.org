And it's nearly threatened just for it's oil.

A lot of sea creatures with long life times though, that's a good point.

I'll have to be careful with underwater societies.

Or I might have to add a constraint I was considering about closeness of species involved (e.g. one can consume a lizard for it's external effects like muscles, but not it's internal biological process like regeneration, unless applied to another lizard... lizard sophont species might benefit from that).

Or maybe accept soft-immortality for the richer segments of society (and that farming sharks is hard).

Thanks for keeping on that issue.
