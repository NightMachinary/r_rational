  As with most things that allow magical healing, this would seem to allow soft immortality - you can still be killed, but slower stuff like diseases would be able to be mitigated by healing with flesh magic.

A person would still be susceptible to age related diseases like cancer and Alzheimers unless one found a biological process that reverses ageing (or stops it). There aren't many (any?) natural healing processes for degenerative diseases. I agree with the rest of your assessment.
