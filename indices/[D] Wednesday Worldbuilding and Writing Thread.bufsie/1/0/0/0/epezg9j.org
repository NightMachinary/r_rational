Interesting, the magic would have been a lot less powerful if you had to force feed yourself.

​

So does bullet point one apply to sacrifice flying animals for flight? Like does consuming a bird allow you to generate a lifting force equivalent to that bird's capabilities? If so, you'd have to sacrifice [quite a few]([[https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2bn90q/how_many_birds_would_it_take_to_lift_and_fly_a/]]) to lift a human unless you've got pony-sized non-earth birds? Now that I think about it, the number might be greatly reduced since the magically generated lift doesn't have to factor in the weight of the bird, it would still take quite a few birds I imagine. Also, if this is the case it implies stacking, does that hold true for other consumables (multiple eyes for better and better vision, or more and more viewpoints)?

>Neurodegenerative diseases and vital brain damage shouldn't be protected by flesh magic was my plan.

​

This is something I've been struggling with in my own magic system, it ain't easy to prevent these types of biological/fleshy magics from effecting brains. So for the whole regeneration thing, say you've got a regenerating animal whose currently in the process of regrowing an arm. Do you have to consume it while it's regenerating its shoulder in order to get regrowth on a human's shoulder, and consume one when it regenerating its forearm to get regrowth on a human's forearm, etc? This could circumvent the brain regeneration thing since the animal would have to be regrowing the exact part of its brain that the human needed to heal, limb regrowth would end up being super tedious, though.

Let's say you consume a live bird, do you get its ability to generate lift, its eyesight, its cognitive predilections, and whatever else it has to offer?
