I think that, unless this is a /very/ recent change to the world, viable magics would very quickly change as they would quickly become positive feedback loops and push out other forms of magic in public thought. Once some kind of magic with a low cost to entry (like magic circles, chants, etc) and a visible, benign effect becomes known, people are going to show it off, make it well known, get more people doing it, so on and so forth.
