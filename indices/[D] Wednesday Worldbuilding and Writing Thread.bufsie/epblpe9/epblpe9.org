I am writing a story in which the frequency of which an idea is thought of(as well as it's internal coherency) determines how strong it is. I am wondering what 'magics' that people in our world think about enough for it to be strong.

Wand magic seems to be a stable for as long as Harry Potter have been out.

New age crystal magic seem to be gaining traction as crystals are believed to have healing properties(and are also physical objects that you think about when you see them)

Necromancy seem to be a stable in a lot of fantasy things.

Shapechanging is an old stable and there's a few new werewolf movies/shows happening.

Vampire and zombies are hit.

Staff based magic are present in people's mind due to LoTR.

Some kind of divine blessing.

Technomancy?

A lot of shows/stories features pact magic.

There's a bunch of discliplines under mentalism(clairvoyance/divination/mediumship/mindreading/telekinesis) but I don't know if they are prominent enough in public consciousness to really have mojo.

Alchemy had it's thing but is dead now.

I don't really think that enough people really think about mana based casting for it to be a thing and there's a lot of different ideas about what it should be able to do which damages the internal coherency.

There is a bunch of different superhero movies that features heavily in public consciousness but their abilities are so different that I don't know if they individually would gain enough traction.

Various 'magicians' does a lot of tricks but again I don't know if there's enough coherency between tricks. Spacial magic for sawing people in half?
