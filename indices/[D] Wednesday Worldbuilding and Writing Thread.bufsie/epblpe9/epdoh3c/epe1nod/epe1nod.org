Just to be clear, when you say consume do you mean ingest or is the flesh being consumed by some magical process? If the former, how long does it take for the effects to manifest? Does the flesh have to be digested?

-Could you consume a (or multiple) seahorse/s in the process of changing sex to cause a similar effect in yourself? Or for that matter, produce asexual from eating enough animals in the process of doing the same.

-I forget which animal (might've been a jellyfish) but there's an animal that can sort of reverse aging. Could you do something significant with that?

-electric eels, venomous animals/plants, flying animals, gilled animals?

-I wonder if, in regard to the first bullet point, people might have an incentive to breed animals (or, more likely, a specific animal) towards having better muscle density to get more out of less muscle consumed.

-I'm curious what exactly counts as alive? There's a pretty obvious incentive for people to maintain an organ's freshness. Perhaps with cooling, artificial stimulation, nutrient solutions, etc.

- Breeding Salamanders to get them as large as possible to improve the regeneration process. Also, the axolotl can regenerate basically anything including parts of the brain, which could potentially help with neurodegenerative diseases or in a healthy person it might have enhancive properties.

-What happens when you consume brain?
