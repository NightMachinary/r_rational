Beauty is mostly just health. Which any competent flesh mage should certainly be able to grant.

The parts of it which are not just "Being young and in prime condition" are harder to cheat - because that boils down to attitude, posture, style and happening to match someones preferences. That is, it is a skill set. and if magic can give you those, that is very powerful magic indeed.
