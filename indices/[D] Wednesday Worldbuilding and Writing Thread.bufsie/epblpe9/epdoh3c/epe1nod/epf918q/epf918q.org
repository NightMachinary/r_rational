In the modern era this magic is gonna be mostly used for cosmetic and athletic purposes - rich people are going to have physically ideal bodies as a matter of course, and athletes are going to have bodies hyper-optimized for their sport (and they're also not going to work out - every hour spent doing cardio or pumping iron is an hour you could have spent training or in downtime instead)

Also what interactions do prion diseases have with this magic? I can't imagine anything good happens.
