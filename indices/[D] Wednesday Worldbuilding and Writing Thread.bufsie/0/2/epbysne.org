Would the very fact that an idea such as alchemy spread at some point prevent its death for the most part? If there was certifiable evidence that, say, lead could be turned into gold by a certain reaction, wouldn't that prevent alchemy from dying out since people would place more faith in its methods, and it would gradually grow to be a science just like any other? Unless someone specifically purged it from the minds of the populace, or spread huge amounts of propaganda and false information of course.
