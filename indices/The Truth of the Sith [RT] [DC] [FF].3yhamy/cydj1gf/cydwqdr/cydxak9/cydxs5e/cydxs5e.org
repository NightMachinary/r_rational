I think the best way to make sense of the Jedi's canonical beliefs about the prophecy is that they saw the Force as being like a spinning top or a see-saw. To their way of thinking, the Light Side /was/ balance and the Dark Side was unbalanced. If we're using the see-saw metaphor, then love pushes down one end and hate pushes down the other, and they feed each other, causing more unbalance as the see-saw goes back and forth. Or if we're using the spinning top metaphor, love/anger/fear cause the Force to start wobbling on its axis, which gets exacerbated really easily and is difficult to recover from.

So to the Jedi Masters, ten thousand Jedi and two Sith basically means that the Force is almost entirely balanced with just a small unbalancing to it, and the prophecy about the chosen one meant elimination of the Sith, bringing the Force back to perfect balance (and thus, the Light Side). Or to use another metaphor, the chosen one is going to remove the last of the impurities in the water. (This is canonical to Legends but non-canon to the current universe, though it's not been contradicted.)

So if the Jedi at the top really believe that everything has been flipped on its head - the natural state of the Force is imbalance, which I guess still works with the spinning top metaphor - then their interpretation doesn't have to change. The Force is naturally imbalanced, the chosen one is going to be bring balance to the Force, that can't be anything but a good thing, right?
