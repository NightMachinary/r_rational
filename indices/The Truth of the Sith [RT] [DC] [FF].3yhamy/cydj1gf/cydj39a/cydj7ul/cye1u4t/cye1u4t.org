It's not so easy to locate all "force-sensitive users". You'd push them underground if you forcefully tried to eradicate them. So instead you want to provide an incentive for force-sensitive users to come forth themselves. Thus a prestigious Jedi Order, honored and respected by all, which will also deliberately breed itself out of existence the moment no new Force users can be found (and their task will then have been done).
