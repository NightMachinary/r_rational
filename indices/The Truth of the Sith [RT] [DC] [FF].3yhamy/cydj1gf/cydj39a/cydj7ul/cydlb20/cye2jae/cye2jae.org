Nice explanation!

Thinking about it some more, a potential issue with a plan of genetically eradicating force sensitivity is that it isn't very robust. Suppose you succeed but miss just one person, some random guy hiding on some asteroid. If that one guy has descendants that are force-sensitive they will likely become Sith lords (as there is only the dark side of the force) and there will be no Jedi to oppose them.

In other words, if this goal is only accomplished to 99.999% the plan may end up doing more harm than good.

Edit: actually, in some ways such a scenario is inevitable. Imagine what happens if force-sensitivity is genetic and based on a complicated combination of genes and finally rare enough so that there have been no Jedi for generations. Eventually, though, someone gets the force-sensitive combination of genes, and what will that person do?

Of course, Palpatine is justified in thinking it very unlikely that Anakin will be making such objections.
