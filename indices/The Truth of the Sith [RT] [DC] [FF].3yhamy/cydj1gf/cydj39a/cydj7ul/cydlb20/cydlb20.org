Genetics is complicated. A cleft palette is genetic, but you could still have one if your parents didn't. You may only get the Force due to a combination of genes. Maybe you have a gene that prevents the Force, but you don't pass it on to your children. Leia never seemed to be very powerful in the force, but her son was powerful.
