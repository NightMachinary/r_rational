Very nice. Fits in almost seamlessly with existing Star Wars lore and the twist it offers is perfectly compelling.

I couldn't follow one point:

  The Jedi could sustain their numbers using uterine replicators... if any of the important people thought that having more Jedi was a good thing. Already the number of Jedi is a hundredth part of what it was a millennium earlier. In time, it is hoped by all those who are in the know, the Galaxy will have solved the... problem, of the Force.

I don't see (or it isn't explained) why there are fewer Jedi now and how the problem of the Force will be solved. Generally speaking, if the rules of the universe make x% of sentients force users, and if y% of those users "go bad" if trained in Jedi techniques, while z% go bad if left untrained, then x*min(y,z) percent of the sentients will always be bad force users.
