Both views have been found in the EU, across the entire ideological spectrum from that there is only one Force - the light - to there is only a dark side a la the Warp. One Sith Lord went as far to say as that the Force was some sort of insidious god, and attempted to destroy it. The fact that the player character was heroically obliged to stop her was one of the most difficult times I had convincing myself I wasn't actually being forced by the game to play the villain! The Force being an artificial creation of the EU's most powerful Precursor race has been an idea as well.

Essentially, with a world as big as the Expanded Universe, pretty much every idea about the Force - including its lack of existence - has been thrown around at some point. ;)
