But what's interesting is that, in the EU at least, being a Force ghost is not permanent, nor is the technique to do so a Jedi one, but rather borrowed from ancient mystics (as in canon as well) who certainly don't claim allegiance to the light side. Obi-Wan must be "moving on" to become one with the Force a scant few years after the movies. Now, if we realise "becoming one with the Force" is merely a nice way of dressing up the permanent dissolution of identity, the Jedi remain deathists, and the few who borrowed other Forceful traditions' techniques to temporarily guide the living did so with a sense of sacrifice, citing becoming one with the Force - their ultimate demise - was the will of the Force and so on!

Yet in the Sith, we see attempts at true immortality, mostly selfish, although in the beginning, an attempt to create immortality for all, create life, restore dead worlds and create galactic utopia. The Sith seem to be the transhumanists in Star Wars.
