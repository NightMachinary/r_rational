If you're into the EU, I'd recommend [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LegacyOfTheSith][Legacy of the Sith]] by YodaKenobi. The Sith Lord in that series is so similar to Yudkowsky's Palpatine here it's eerie. One of my favourite villains of all time alongside HPMORQuirrell! Very Sith-heavy is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3486307/1/KOTOR-The-Power-of-Choice][KOTOR: The Power of Choice]], which also does a good job of detailing the plot of the famous Knights of the Old Republic if you haven't played it, albeit with a dark side twist...

Movies-only, I'd highly recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2897153/1/The-Shadow-of-Vader][The Shadow of Vader]] by Darth Vastor, in which Obi-Wan becomes Vader, although the degree to which it's Sith-specific is questionable, as well as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2945228/1/Fall-of-the-Sith][Fall of the Sith]], in which Mace becomes a Sith Lord, and its non-AU 'prequel' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2987152/1/Descent-Into-The-Dark][Edge of the Darkness]] which details how come Yoda seemed to know so much about the believed-extinct Sith and their Rule of Two, both by Souderwan.
