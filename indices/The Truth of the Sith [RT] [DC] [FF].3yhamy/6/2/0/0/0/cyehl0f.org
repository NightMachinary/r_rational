Not any one series, but sourcebooks and Wookieepedia would give more details. To summarise:

There were many tens of thousands of Jedi with Jedi Lords ruling the Republic as Chancellors, multiple temples, conclaves and academies, during the close of the Draggulch Period, for instance, and before Nomi Sunrider's reforms following the Great Sith War, love wasn't forbidden, with multiple ancient Jedi families such as the Qel-Dromas. This contrasts to the Jedi Order during the prequels, where power is centralised in the Jedi Temple, no more Jedi generations (outside of the Corellian and Altisian Jedi splinter sects, that is), and 'only' approximately 10,000 Jedi at the start of Order 66.
