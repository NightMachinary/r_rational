Not in the movies (Ruusan Reformation was a later retcon), but yes the relinquishing of political power, disbandment of Jedi Grand Council (of Lords) and centralisation on Coruscant was a response to the Sith threat being deemed over.

The no-attachment policies and end of Jedi dynasties took place long before the Reformation, and as for dwindling numbers of Jedi, no reason is given. It's possible Jedi Order membership simply fluctuated over the millennia, but it certainly would be true to say that Jedi numbers by the time of ROTS were less than they were thousands of years prior.
