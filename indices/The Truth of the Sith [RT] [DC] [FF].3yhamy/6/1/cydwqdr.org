One other lore complication is that Dooku was on the losing end of his battle with Yoda and only escaped with his life because he threw a pillar at Anakin and Obi-wan as a distraction before running away. Also, Dooku was a fully trained Jedi Master (by Yoda, no less) before becoming a Sith Lord, so it sort of seems like the Dark Side didn't help him all that much.

This can all be chalked up to Palpatine being manipulative rather than any actual error though. He'd just have to be reasonably confident that Anakin wouldn't call him on it. I suppose that Anakin would be more than ready to believe that Dooku was a superior foe given that Anakin lost an arm in that duel; people like hearing that the guy they lost to had an unfair advantage, because it means that it wasn't a personal failing on their part.
