A prophecy that misread, could have been... The entire notion of "balance of the Force" is one that could mean so many things, I think it's a fairly meaningless concept not grounded by anything empirical.

In the SW canon, there's also a family of ancient, deific beings who somehow control and/or personify this abstract balance as anchorites. I suspect the only meaningful definition of balance is to be found in these beings, whose affairs don't have much to do with the movies' events at all, and even less to do with Anakin, who may very well be a Sith creation (by Darth Plagueis) in an attempt to bring into being their own prophesied savior.
