Aren't dark and light matter a naturally occurring binary(actual question, not a physicist)? I'm trying to think of more but I suppose most are actually just the presence and absence of a single thing. Actually, if you want to go full blown reductionist I suppose you'd just say dark and light matter are just different things altogether, which is the type of argument a reductionist would use for any such claim. But that seems to me more a product of assumption and method than evidence of the universe working that way. If I assume apriori that everything can be reduced to zero's, one's and infinities(which reductionism seems to do) then I shouldn't be surprised if that's what I find because any two's I "find" I'll just reduce to separate categories.
