This is great. Yudkowsky you've done it again, et cetera.

I've had some ideas for how the prequels could be improved before, and this would definitely be right up there. The world needs more tragedies where the hero isn't a total chump.

My own best idea is much simpler, but IMO massively improves them on a storytelling level: rename Naboo "Alderaan" and rename Padme Amidala "Padme Organa". Seriously, why the fuck didn't George do this? It immediately grants more weight to the most weirdly unweighty moment in the original movie, ties the generations together more, and just /makes sense/.
