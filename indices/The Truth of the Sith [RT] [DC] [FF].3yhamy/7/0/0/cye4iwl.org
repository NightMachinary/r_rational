Are both of the children specifically being hidden from Vader? It's been a while since I've seen 4-6, and longer since I've seen 1-3. I guess that makes sense. The story I'd constructed in my head was that Leia was raised with the Rebels, who presumably don't give Darth Vader visitation rights. Luke and his family (weren't they supposed to be related to Anakin through his mother?) might not even be on Vader's radar until Luke is recruited by Obi-Wan; he has no reason to believe that his wife bore twins.

Your version is very interesting and sensible. :)
