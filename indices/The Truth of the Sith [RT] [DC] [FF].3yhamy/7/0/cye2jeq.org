I agree that Alderaan would have been a good place to take the place of Naboo as a locale, but a problem would be that Leia was /hidden/ away from Darth Vader, so obviously she can't grow in the same family and with the same name of the woman that birthed her.

My own idea to make the handmaiden-switcheroos more interesting would be that "Queen Amidala" is a constructed persona, all the 'handmaidens' taking turns acting out the central role of Queen Amidala and in reality ruling by majority. Padme would be merely one of the "Queen Amidalas" that exist, not the only one.

I'm guessing that idea could actually be combined with yours: if Padme had retired from the role of "Queen Organa" already by movie 3, Vader would not think that a child born to Queen Organa had anything to do with him (and in reality it would be an old friend of Padme's adopting her old friend's child.)
