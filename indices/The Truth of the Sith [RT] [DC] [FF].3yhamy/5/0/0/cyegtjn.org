For the Legacy of the Sith fanfic, it sounds like it requires some background-

#+begin_quote
  "This is only the latest series in YodaKenobi's alternate universe (referred to as "the Yobiverse" by some). His original trilogy of Revolution, The Eighth Cortex, and The Living Force form an alternate ending to the New Jedi Order series, one wherein Anakin Solo survives to become the hero of the Yuuzhan Vong War. Then there is a "bridge fic," Empire of the Hand that leads into the present series."

Do you think it's readable without all the precursors / should someone pick it up from the beginning?
