I would attribute that to fighting on two fronts, fighting Russia during the winter, fighting Russia with the US's lend lease backing, and the fact that the US had almost as much industrial capacity as the entire rest of the world at the time. I think with only one of these things to deal with, the might have held ground and built a longer lasting regime (at least on the order of the USSR in longevity).

I think maybe the USSR might be a better example for "you simply cannot force people to do something. It costs too much. "
