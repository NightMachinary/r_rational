It's a dark comedy where the chief source of humor is people making horrifically bad decisions that hurt themselves and other people, but they don't care because they're stupid and/or insane. It isn't for everyone, I'm surprised even I like it, but I got to listen to the audiobook for free and have enjoyed it so far.
