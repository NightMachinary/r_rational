In context, it's a speech given by a former British intelligence agent to his son, who grew up to be a consultant for comic book supervillains. The book is kind of a rationalist comedy, with a Quirrelmort-like protagonist marveling at the stupidity of everyone around him and trying to manipulate them to his own ends, only to fail because he can't comprehend just how irrational people are. I haven't finished it yet, but so far I like it even if it's rather mean-spirited and cynical.
