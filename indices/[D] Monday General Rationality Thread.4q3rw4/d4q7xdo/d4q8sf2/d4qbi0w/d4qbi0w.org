Yep both traits are found in biology behavior modification is actually more common than you might think though and there is some evidence that it might be present in humans due to the higher incidence of risky behavior among people infected by Toxoplasmosis.

There is also claims that certain viruses may make their hosts more social during the incubation period.

As for stories I actually have little experience writing charecters and social interactions so I don't know how it will turn out. I will certainly need help that is for sure.

Most of my ideas are built for a fiction that is a mix of high fantasy(thus separate laws of physics) and perhaps a bit of science fiction. The issue is I can't stop with one world so I have actually a bunch of separate developing worlds that have actually fed of each other over the years with some branches dying and others splitting off.

Off the top of my head I can think of

-A dystopian society based around a viral based vampire "species" that "breeds" through infecting a suitable host

-A high fantasy world under threat from a extraterrestrial foe. I have the world structure for this as well as general events pretty well laid out but the little details beyond that are near impossible for me to figure out how to do. (I have a Prologue made and an idea for how it will end)

-A "modern" fantasy world suffering after a long environmentally cataclysmic war built of both nationalism colonialism and strong species oriented racial tensions. Complete with biological and chemical "super weapons", genocide and thermonuclear warfare. The main set point is the next generation after this war ended due to a bio-engineered virus mutating and becoming more virulent than expected, devastating all factions and forcing a truce. the surviving hominids are devastated such that elves have been forced to turn to cloning, dragons are solely able to reproduce parthenogenetically as the male line (or Z chromosome) is extinct.

I come up with so many ideas I can't keep up... to be honest...
