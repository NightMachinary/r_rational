I have a similar thing I do with fanfictions; like I'll read/watch something, have an amazing plot bunny that rampages through my brain for a while and then just sits there never to be utilized. Simply because I don't have the willpower/time/interest to do it.

It's gotten better in past years but man, when I was a bit younger T_T

In other news, I find it impressive how fleshed out your ideas are, even though you haven't done any sort of storyboarding or anything. I personally find it a bit difficult to worldbuild. I'm sure I'm capable (I've ingested more than enough fiction and knowledge) but I'm not very detail oriented and my attention span is very...selective. Hence my lack of patience with it.
