There usually isn't a "right side". Any given issue is a complex, multi-faceted thing. Anyone who tells you that it's for sure this one simple thing is someone you should probably look at with a critical eye. Anyone who divides topics into "sides" is probably someone you want to take a step back from.

(Following the Orlando shooting, my Facebook feed was filled with people who were sure that it was one hundred percent about Islam, or LGBT discrimination, or mental health, or guns, or the national security apparatus, or ... whatever. It drove me nuts that everyone thought they had the one true solitary answer that could be boiled down to a soundbite. I think it must just feel good to think you've got the silver bullet.)
