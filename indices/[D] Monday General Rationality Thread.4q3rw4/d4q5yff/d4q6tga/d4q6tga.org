Bias is likely an innate part of how humans catalogue data. (I.e. we attempt to classify all new information based on preexisting information) so in essence we all have bias. However there are ways to mitigate bias where in essence you can look into how other viewpoints would see an issue.

Effectively I try and do this from a devils advocate stance however even I find it very hard, if not impossible, to do for issues I have a very strong stance for or against.

The key to remember is things like right and wrong, good, evil, moral and amoral are all subjective terms based on our societal cultural norms and upbringing.

Without a set definition described entirely in qualitative and quantitative form based on real observable features/traits you can't really say whether one path is right or wrong.
