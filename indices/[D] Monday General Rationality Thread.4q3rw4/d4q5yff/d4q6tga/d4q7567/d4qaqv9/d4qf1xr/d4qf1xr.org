  I can not understand any philosophy that solely promotes short term gains at the cost of long term survival particularly in regards to the environment where we have resisted making change pushing the issue off to the next generation.

The same argument could be made back at you. What if making full use of the resources available to us here and now (or over the next double-handful of decades) gives us the best chance at hitting a critical threshold of knowledge and industry to begin colonizing off-world, and thereby massively reducing our chance of extinction?

Alternatively, what level of quality of "long term" do you think can be achieved for 7 billion people with no use of non-renewables, and with no undesirable side effects to the environment?
