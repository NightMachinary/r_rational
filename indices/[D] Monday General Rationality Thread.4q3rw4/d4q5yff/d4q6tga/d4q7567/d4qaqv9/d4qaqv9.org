I can not understand any philosophy that solely promotes short term gains at the cost of long term survival particularly in regards to the environment where we have resisted making change pushing the issue off to the next generation. This is the example I was taking issue with. The alternative view point is the viewpoint of those that want to dismiss climate change and keep on doing the status quo. The only reasoning I can gauge is they are miss attributing short term gains over the future of their biologic line (offspring).
