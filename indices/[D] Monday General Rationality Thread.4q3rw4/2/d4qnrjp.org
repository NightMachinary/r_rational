I find myself more and more derisive of media since I got into rationality (and I'm not even that into it, really, considering I haven't really bothered to supplement myself with any sort of learning materials/nonfiction to promote my understanding)

I'll scoff at things that are stupid. Or characters being stupid. Or just...anything being stupid in a work. But the thing is, I don't think stupid should equate to bad in the same way that [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools][tropes are not bad.]]

Of course, there's stupidity and then there's /stupidity/. For example, there's moments that don't make sense or seem "stupid" that may just be to build dramatic tension, impart emotion, etc. For example, concepts like last words where someone says something and smiles even when cut in half or run through by tons of sword. Implausible IRL? Sure. But not necessarily stupid in the same way that Voldemort branding his followers with a distinctive tattoo in a visible part of the body is (Thief's Downfall, for those people who snark about concealment and such). And even in that sense, the Dark Mark, while stupid from a rational perspective, serves its use wonderfully in story as a device for JK Rowling. It's clearly evil, it acts as a cheap pager, and it's branding for Voldie's side. In both the literal sense and the marketing sense.

So....not sure where I was going with this; I guess I'm just annoyed by my newfound tendency to feel exasperated at stupid moments in fiction that may not be completely adherent to real world intelligence but do quite well as dramatic devices. Anyone else feel like this?
