I used to run nWoD games a lot, particularly vampire and changeling, and pushing back against the darkness of the theme is very doable. Are you integrating the "god machine" chronicles or wider implications of its presence? Ignoring all that helps a lot, since it's not integral to any of the mythologies except the fallen angel one.
