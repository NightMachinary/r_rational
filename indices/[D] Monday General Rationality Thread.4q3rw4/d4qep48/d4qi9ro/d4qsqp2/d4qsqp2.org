The New line is easier to work with than the Old. The Old line had a lot of strange quirks that made it very difficult to adapt, it wasn't until the New line that they adopted a toolkit approach to the setting design. For some more information on what problems it had, check out RPPR's WoD The Heck. Only the first episode is free, but it's all you really need to understand the Old line.
