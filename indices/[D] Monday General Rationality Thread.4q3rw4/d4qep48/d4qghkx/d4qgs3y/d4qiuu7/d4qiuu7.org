I've spent a little time looking at Eclipse Phase. Makes my mouth water,and not just for the gaming experience. It does remind me a lot of the SJG product Transhuman Space, but I suspect any copying is the other way round. It does contain the usual obnoxious "monotheism is dying" trope. Short form: fundamentalist religions of the sort we love with in America, at least, are sometimes antiscience but almost always protechnology. Body upgrades are no threat to someone who believes that "we shall all be changed". Current sociomoral changes hold more danger.
