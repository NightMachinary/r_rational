While we're here....

Are people here familiar with White Wolf and the Storyteller System?

I was originally attracted to the publisher by Mage: the Ascension, which promised a tale of competing ideologies/ontologies and their paths to a transhuman state. And...well, you could do that.

But the story that White Wolf has generally promoted was "Greater powers than humans have would make for a Crapsack World, subtly or grossly worse than our own." This makes some sense when the powers belong to nonhuman entities with different interests than ours, but it was applied pretty universally.

Anyone else have this frustration? And/or run a "progressive" game that dragged the Worlds of Darkness out of...um, Darkness?
