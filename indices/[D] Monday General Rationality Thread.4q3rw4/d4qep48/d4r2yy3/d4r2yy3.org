I'm ashamed of not reading your post earlier (depression hasn't left yet) but if you want a rational World of Darkness, there's a foundation left by Anders Sandberg on fleshing up The Technocracy.

As others have posted, World of Darkness follows the horror genre so it plays on the world being crapsack and going worse by the day but The Technocracy is the group of mages that want to improve the world, have actually won the Ascension War and are actively trying to bring post humanity and ascension to all of mankind through the use of science, rational thinking and technological wonders.

I'm a huge fan of the technocrats which are usually seen as antagonists but from their side, they're trying to help mankind but struggle with lack of resources and corruption among their ranks. I think they're perfect for a rational setting.

You can read more about them on [[https://web.archive.org/web/20090614202752/http://hem.bredband.net/arenamontanus/mage_technocracy.html][Anders Mage page using the Wayback Machine]].

My favorite are the New World Order which use psychology to improve mankind from cognitive bias and lead them to a happier and more productive life or Iteration X which use technology to enhance humans using cybernetic implants to create cyborgs. Iteration X aims for the merging of human and machine.

Anders Sandberg is a fellow researcher that was my first introduction to Transhumanism and rationality.
