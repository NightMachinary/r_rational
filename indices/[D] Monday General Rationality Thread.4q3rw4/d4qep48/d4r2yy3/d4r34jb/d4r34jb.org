Also if you're struggling to find where to start, [[https://web.archive.org/web/20090614203128/http://hem.bredband.net/arenamontanus/Mage/tech_play.html][The Technocracy Manifesto]] is a great resource to understand the technocrats ideals and purpose. I think a rational mage chronicle can be run on their side and makes for a great beginning.

Another option is to run it with the mages finding these documents and having them question what they're fighting for. I loved Mage the Ascension because each side makes a good point and while it proposes playing the Traditions as the good guys, from a rational point of view the Technocrats actually make some really good points and are the good guys according to themselves.

Also I suggest you try using nWoD mage system as its far more stable than the old version. Dice rolls don't make much sense in the old World of Darkness while personally I found the new mage much more boring but with a more stable roll system.
