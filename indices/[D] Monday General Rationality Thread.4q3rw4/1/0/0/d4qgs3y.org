I'm aware of thst, of course. I just felt that it wasted the potential of the setting. Imagine writing Star Wars from the perspective of helpless Ewoks being orbitally-bombarded by the Empire. There would be a certain verisimilitude to it, but I wouldn't enjoy watching.

I have heard of it but not had a chance to investigate. Thanks for the link.

I've had very few chances to run games--there are few gamers where I live and my internet access is usually limited. I am writing a Buffy/Exalted crossover but many of the characters,I've found, are too damaged to respond rationally to the power of an Exaltation while still being recognizable as themselves. I do have some plans to write rational!Harmony as the story proceeds. Why should people who are already smart have all the bootstrapping fun?
