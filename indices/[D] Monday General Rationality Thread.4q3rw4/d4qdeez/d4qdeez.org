I have read claims that, during World War II, British intelligence used double agents to feed false reports to the nazis, so they would shift their v2 launches to less populated areas of London, but after thinking a while about it, it starts feeling just confusing enough to possibly be a urban legend. Does anyone have a verifiable source for this?
