My apologies, I am new to Reddit and accidentally attached this to your comment instead of the original.

However, in regard to the specific example you mention, my experience with these people suggests a more complex situation.

- They place a very low value on life without current technological comforts.

- Conversely, they strongly believe in technological advance (though frequently without much individual understanding of science).

- They have heard many alarmist predictions that we must go back to a thoroughly nontechnological lifestyle to save ourselves. (Hollywood environmentalism, mostly.)

- They are willing to deceive themselves and/or others to preserve their comfort.

In less fancy language: they believe that you want to condemn their children to an indefinite miserable pre-renaissance existence (or worse); they believe that extinction would be better than such a fate. They figure we may as well enjoy ourselves now and forget about the looming dangers insofar as we're able. Those who are not fooling themselves about it are willing to fool you.

(A third class exists which is honest; you can find them among right-wing survivalists, the sort who hoard resources to prolong the good times as long as possible.)

An alternate stance also exists:

- People prefer not to give up their luxuries.

- Therefore government control is required to enforce environmental laws.

- It is more likely that left-wing totalitarians want more control over our lives than that the environment is in serious danger.

These two are not completely incompatible in practice, and one finds them together.

None of this is particularly sane, but problem is with their relation to the evidence, not the arguments themselves.
