I wouldn't rely on the internet at all, to be honest. One thing I've found useful when thinking about complicated and controversial things is to basically list out as many (semi-reasonable) possibilities as I can think of ahead of time, even if they are somewhat stupid, and then consider various themes and assumptions common to the views I find most compelling. I mean "compelling" in an almost narrative sense here, which means sometimes views I do not agree with much still count as "compelling". Generally there are convergences that emerge from across many very different compelling viewpoints.

In other words, I advise that you don't look at individual arguments as you happen to come across them online, instead you should think about networks of arguments that exist within the space of all possible arguments. You do need to draw limits on what you consider somewhere, but if you don't rely exclusively on any particular point of view then weird outlier ideas cannot do as much to hurt you so you can explore further away from your preconceptions than you might think.
