Search for academic books that provide background on a subject. Ideally pick two so it's easier to distinguish niche thesis from relatively discipline-wide agreement. I'd start with books by historians, political scientists, anthropologists, and/or sociologists. Use a university's [[http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?mode=Basic&vid=OXVU1&tab=all&][Primo]] or Google Scholar to search.
