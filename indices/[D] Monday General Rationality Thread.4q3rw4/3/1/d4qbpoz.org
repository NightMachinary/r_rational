The problem is that it's easy to summarize and tell the side of the story you want with these things. Anything from "The Shooter was mentally insane, there should be a mandatory visit to a psychiatrist before you buy a gun!" to "It was discrimination against LGBT groups" are going to get big from news article.

I've found that if you really, really want to learn the details of a specific event, your best bet is to look for published court and/or police reports. While it's impossible to get a truly unbiased opinion, generally police and courts are good about getting information on the various deliberations.
