This kind of view frustrates me sometimes. Sure real life is complicated and there are many factors to consider, but there is still an optimal outcome for any particular value function if you want to call it that.

Similarly dividing issues into sides can be counterproductive, but at the same time useful at times. Sure every issue has hundreds of possible policy stances around it, but that doesn't mean we can't classify them into multiple camps. Indeed humans can't deal with a sea of anecdotes so we need to classify stuff somewhat.
