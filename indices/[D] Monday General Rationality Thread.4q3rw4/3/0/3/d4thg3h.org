I'm going to have to disagree with you here, unless I'm misunderstanding you point. The complexity of a topic and the inability to reduce it down to one answer or point doesn't mean that there isn't a right side, or true and false points, albeit multiple ones sometimes. Right and wrong don't disappear because an issue is complicated - it just makes the truth harder to find.
