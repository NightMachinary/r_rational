How do you form an unbiased opinion on the Internet, if it's possible at all?

I'm trying to read up on recent political events and determine whether I've been backing the wrong horse. But all the communities I'm already part of are ones that largely agree with me, and I don't know where to find well-researched counterarguments that come from a place of reasonable discussion. And of course, tempers are running high at the moment and it's probably too soon to have a reasonable and sensible discussion about the subject matter. (I am, of course, referring to the Orlando shooting.)

I don't want an argument for arguments' sake, I just want to know which side is right.
