Welcome! Always nice to see a new username around the forum.

Taking DNA from other living beings is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer][Horizontal Gene Transfer]]. Pretty much universal in bacteria, but also not unheard of in multicellular beings. And parasites that modify the host's behaviour are unusual, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-altering_parasites_and_parasitoids][they do exist]] and they're an excellent device for science-fiction stories.

Looking forward to seeing some of your stories!
