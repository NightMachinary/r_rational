Hello I just found this sub through a link to The Mother of Learning and am interested in stories which have a well defined and immutable set of governing principals.

This is tied to a love for science which has lead me to obtain a Bs in physics and I am currently seeking to gain entry into grad school.

In my free time I love concocting fantasy ideas based around first defining a set of laws of physics and establishing a base line and history for that world.

I particularly enjoy redefining aspects of fantasy/myth/fiction into more scientific frame work my current brain child is a variation of fairies based on the ecology of ants and Termites and other social insects. the premise is a wasp derived social arthropod with a parisitoid ancestor. They have through evolution obtained the ability to steal and integrate DNA from other creatures into a malleable genome. This has produced strange specialized forms with well defined roles in the hive, notably The gene snatcher which is a genetic clone form the queen's DNA(a method employed by termites). They are responsible for collecting new DNA and injecting changeling larvae into developing young who will eventually be "called" back to serve the hive after learning from their society. The larvae which bypasses the immune system, injects itself into the developing notochord of vertebrate hosts where it sits dormant as the host develops while subtly spurring the host to be interested in new and different things. These creatures are also the only fey that are able to innovate and learn thus are very valuable to the hive but absolutely terrifying to other denizens of the world. I think I should stop here as it is getting pretty long...

I feel the social structure employed by social insects (as well as the very unusual mammals known as Naked Mole Rats who actually employ a similar structure) while they may individually lack in intelligence on a whole an emergent social cohesion forms allowing for great tasks. Ironic that I got into this after we found a termite infestation and myself discovering how little I knew about them.
