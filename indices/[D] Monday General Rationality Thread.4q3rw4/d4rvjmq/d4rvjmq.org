TLDR: I spend way too long explaining what changed in my life over the past 6 months. My conclusion is "dramatic improvement is awesome, but is it sustainable?" I wonder if CFAR could have accomplished something similar, but I dunno.

War on Akrasia, first half of 2016:

- I started on Buproprion in November 2015. The 150mg doses didn't do much, but when I missed days those days were noticeably worse. I don't remember when, specifically, I switched to 300mg, but it did make a noticeable difference, mood-wise. It's harder to say what it did for productivity (see below).
- I tried to make myself throw together a simple game for April first. I couldn't do anything but write a bunch of unused code-fragments.
- On April sixth, someone decided to put up a 24 hour game competition. I managed to submit an entry, then kept expanding on it after the contest was over, pretty much for the next month or so.
- None of the other standard intervention attempts (which more or less include diet and going outside, since I didn't have many other options) didn't show any reliable results, as usual.
- On May 15, I arrived at the [[http://louisianacenter.org][Louisiana Center for the Blind]]. I have been trying to put together something coherent to describe the first month there but it is not coming along very quickly. Suffice it to say, it's... different. My feelings are mostly positive so far but "mostly" is not "entirely".
- LCB is a 6-9 month program. It only took a week for me to go from "too pathetic to leave the house" to "I guess I'll go to Wal-mart this afternoon." Sweet merciful cool breeze in July, does that make a difference! (Also I feel like it's weird that I like going to Wal-mart, of all places, but whatever.)
- The most obvious changes from home? Being forced to interact with people on a daily basis for most of the day, lots of walking (the apartments are half a mile from the center, which probably isn't much compared to more realistic situations but it's a considerable difference from anything I've dealt with before), and the apartments do not have free internet and I don't feel like paying $50/month and so internet is less trivial than usual. Oh, and not so monotonous as home.
- Sleep was still being uncooperative, in spite of a fixed schedule. So I tried Melatonin and it seems to have helped some. My body still seemed determined to only sleep for 5 hours, though, even though I got the timing fixed.
- Productivity is not solved. There are still bad days. But I think it's safe to say it's improved dramatically. Over the course of one weekend, I wrote about as much as I had in the past 3 years put together, as an example. I'm trying to experiment with analyzing photos so I don't have to either hire someone or spend way too much time on calculations and debugging to do simple character animation. Etc. Not exactly 2001-2005, but the past month alone makes 2016 better than 2014 or 2015 in the productivity department.

Which has the bigger impact: Buproprion, or LCB? Are they both necessary components? How do sleep and the internet fit into this?

Food quality is not irrelevant, per se, but it's only a decisive factor if I'm drowning in sugar on a daily basis. Even then, I was in a hurry and just bought a couple candy bars at the dollar store for lunch yesterday, and the mental effects that I noticed were far less severe than I expected. (I need to shop at healthier places. I'll note, though, that I was at the dollar store because apparently my already impossibly skinny waistline has been shrinking dramatically since I got here and I neglected to bring a belt. I blame the walking for 3 hours a day in Louisiana summer.)

I cannot conclude that anything sustainable is to come of this, and I worry that the improvements, though rather dramatic, are not quite so dramatic as I want them to be (*mumbles something about gift horses*). Still, mentioning LCB in front of someone who would not make it easy to chicken out of enrolling was probably the best decision I've made in a while.
