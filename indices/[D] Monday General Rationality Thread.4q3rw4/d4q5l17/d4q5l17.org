"No matter how smart you may be, no matter how much money you may have at you disposal, no matter strength of arms or argument, you simply cannot force people to do something. It costs too much. For all the bombs we have dropped, for all the lives that were lost, in the end this is why the Nazis could not prevail. There is not enough money in the world to truly command and control a populace. The best you can do, all you can hope to do, is create a situation where it is easier for people to do what you want than it is for them to do what you don't. Then no one will seek to oppose you or thwart you aim because it appears you are merely helping them to do what they really want to do. There is, in the end, no defense against cooperation." - Patrick E. McLean, How to Succeed in Evil
