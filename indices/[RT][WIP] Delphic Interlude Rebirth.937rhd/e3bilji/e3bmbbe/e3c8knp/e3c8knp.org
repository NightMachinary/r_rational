I think it's that, even though Eutopia took him in, they still don't give him total free reign. Maybe they did back in the day, but since then they seem to have become some kind of thriving Super paradise, and as none of their powered people seem to feel scared or threatened, I'm guessing that it's no longer the kind of country that would condone holding a superhero against his will to study his powers.

This could be less about Doc Stevens, and more about Eutopia being a country willing to tolerate and use his talents, but not actually give him the authority to just do what he wants.
