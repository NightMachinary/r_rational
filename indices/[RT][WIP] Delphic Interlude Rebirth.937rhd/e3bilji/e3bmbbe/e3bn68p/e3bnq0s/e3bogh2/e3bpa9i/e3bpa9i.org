Having just reread the chapter, it looks like the testing he's been doing was basically a PR disaster, and in Stevens' statement, he seems to indicate that he personally thinks that everyone involved would have consented, which implies to me that, in combination with the description that a significant number of people were conscious, that many did, in fact, consent, and that he simply kept his studies secret because super research is icky or something similar? I'm not sure when modern medical science started doing dissections to better understand human biology, so maybe that was part of the alt-history?

I could also just be grasping for potential excuses for his actions and I'm 100% off base, but not seeing any commentary from his victims in the criminal case interlude is a bit... surprising?
