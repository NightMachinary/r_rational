[[/r/https][r/https]]://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grieve#Verb

My updated impression is that when you grieve a person you make that person upset (make them experience grief, 'to make sad'), but when you grieve an inanimate occurrence it's the same as grieving regarding it..? In any case, by previous impression definitely appears erroneous!
