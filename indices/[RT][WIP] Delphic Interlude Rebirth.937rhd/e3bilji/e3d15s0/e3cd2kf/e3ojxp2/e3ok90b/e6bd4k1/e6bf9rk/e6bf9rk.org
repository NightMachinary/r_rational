Here's Oxford Living Dictionaries:

[[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/grieve]]

It looks like it would be more correct, and less ambiguous, to either say "grieve for [person]" or "grieve [person]'s death." If I want to just say the verb with the person, I'd be better off using "mourn."
