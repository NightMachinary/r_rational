Yanno, I was really worried about doc being behind whisper's kidnapping... But now, I actually think LL is the culprit.

She tried to keep delphic out of it when looking, because she knew spinner wouldn't find anything. Yeah, that could be because of his ties to Doc, but...

Whisper is one of the biggest detractors of their torture sessions. And she is the best target for someone who doesn't want a whistle blown over it. If she "escaped" then she would be discredited. Plan B, if she was killed, all the supers in New York would have lost their minds trying to catch the killer. The torture method would have got traction.

It was LL that refused to allow them to take her away from the hospital until the doctor came. And had spinner not been able to see the future, whisper would have been killed right there. Her reasoning for wanting the doctor (who apparently kidnapped her) to check her out, made no sense. They needed a 2nd opinion if anything.

She was the first to know about whisper being found and the kill order happened within minutes of them showing up. /someone/ on the NYST is in on it. And LL is the most fishy.

Furthermore, LL has been stiring up other things about this case: telling refraxx delphic was decorating an office friday and only spends a hand full of hours on work. I'm willing to bet she also gave whisper that case file of the girl she killed too.
