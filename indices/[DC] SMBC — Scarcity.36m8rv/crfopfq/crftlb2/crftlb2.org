Economics is about to transform into the study of creating scarce resources and trading them to other economists.

"Economist" will then have two meanings: One, carrying the meaning with which we are all familiar, and which now has purely historical use; and the other, which is not unlike, say, "wargamer" in that it refers to a person who is a member of a crafty hobby.
