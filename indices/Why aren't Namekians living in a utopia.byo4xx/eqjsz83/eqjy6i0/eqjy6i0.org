Well, Namekians have a very long lifespan, they reproduce asexually, and they only require water to survive and don't need to eat solids (though they are able). And like you said, they regenerate. The only health problems seem to come from extreme old age.

They have no wars and no ethnicities. There are only two types of Namekians: warriors and mystic members of the Dragon Clan. Evil Namekians only exist because of King Piccolo who in turn was born out of Kami. In other words, excluding Piccolo, evil entities literally don't exist among Namekians.

Namekians need and desire nothing that their watery planet doesn't already offer them -- a planet that in itself poses no threat to their existence. Their life seemed pretty damn utopistic until Freeza blew it up.
