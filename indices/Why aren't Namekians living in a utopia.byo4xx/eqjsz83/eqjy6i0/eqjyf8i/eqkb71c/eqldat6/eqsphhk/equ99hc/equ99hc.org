Hm, good question. Now that you mention it I'm not sure it was ever shown on screen.

EDIT: here: [[https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_(object)]] it says they don't scatter. But then mentions nothing about the source, and the main Namekian Dragon Ball article says that they're simply "never shown" to scatter in the series (but they're shown to do so in the video games, though of course that's of arguable canonicity).
