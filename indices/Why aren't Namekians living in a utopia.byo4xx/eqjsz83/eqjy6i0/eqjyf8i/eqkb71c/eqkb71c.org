To the various things already said I'll add that the Namekians possess nothing like a Dragon Radar, and they're extremely small in number. Granted, perhaps they could wish for one, but I wonder if the Dragon would grant that - if it would, it'd be pretty close to "wishing for infinite wishes" levels of munchkinry.

Though at the end of the Buu saga apparently they did manage to gather the Dragon Balls all on their own, even though it should be basically impossible, so who knows.
