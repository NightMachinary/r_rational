This, probably. When the old Kaioshin is brought back from the Z-Sword, he's shocked to learn there are Dragon Balls on Earth, he says that the Dragon Balls 'only bring chaos' and that their use was only allowed to the Namekians because they were 'the wisest race in the Universe'. So the implication was that the Namekians would be contented and wise enough /not/ to use the Dragon Balls, just to be their custodians in the event of a major crisis.
