Alternatively, perhaps it is not that Namekians live in any sort of Utopia-in-the-world, but perhaps that they all have some religion similar to Buddhism, and have all† achieved the equivalent of Buddhist enlightenment. So nobody would have any real desires to change the way they are; nobody would be actively thinking or inventing stuff; nobody would see any reason to be in conflict with one-another; etc. It would give rise to a social milieu reminiscent of a Utopia... but there would still be, well, disease and predation and stuff. It's just that nobody would see this as a problem. This all seems to match the way they live quite closely.

To the degree that Dragonball is a Journey-to-the-West retelling, Namek /is/ “the West”, i.e. the parts of India where Buddhism originates.
