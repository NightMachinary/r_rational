We've got no evidence to suggest namekians don't have their own utopia , and no evidence they needed to wish for it. We see no land predators or extreme weather events (until a hole gets punched into the planet's core.) No overpopulation, disease, or anything else, they just hang out. The only namekian who shows any real signs of any sort of infirmity is the super obese one. Very tiny farms are seen but I'm guessing they only eat when they feel like it. As a species, they can merge with one another fairly easily, and can live for a really long time, reproduce asexually, and are utterly without ambition. Kami actively purges desire from himself to create piccolo. Maybe they wished themselves this way, to not need anything due to causing trouble with the infinite cosmic power of the dragonball and getting slapped down by the legitimate gods of the universe, or maybe they've never needed anything. Namekians are alien as fuck.
