  How they find them again after a wish is granted is not explained

Yeah, that was my point. I can understand how they'd find them over centuries of them being scattered if everyone knows what they look like and they're supposed to bring them to the closest village elder when they find one, but it doesn't seem like it could be done /efficiently/ without a radar. At the time of the Buu saga I'd have imagined the Balls would be scattered, since they had been used multiple times after the Namek mess, and the last wish was to teleport everyone to Neo Namek. But perhaps when they teleported they appeared all bunched up.

(I mean, who am I kidding, Toriyama simply didn't bother thinking that through XD. But yeah)
