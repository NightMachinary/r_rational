There are 6 namekian village tribes, each village elder has custody of a dragonball and guru has the 7th. Since they can sense energy it would be trivial to gather the dragonballs together from each of the clans. How they find them again after a wish is granted is not explained, it seems that the planet namek is written to be tiny as only 150 people live on it and the villages didn't seem as far apart as they would be on Earth.
