I'm intrigued that Pilgrim thinks Cats soul is worse? Did he actually see her soul or just look at the sisters? All things considered it seems like it should be much improved from eldritch monstrosity to garden variety human sinner (in his eyes).

Can we read anything said as update about Black? Last we saw him he appeared to have been escaping, body and soul firmly intertwined and going to claim a new mantle. Him simply failing and being recaptured off screen seems too neat so I'm going to presume there was some unspoken plan there on his part (or Pilgrim is lying but that doesn't seem likely).

Finally speaking of plans, Catherine is totally angling Saint into trying to kill her again, either to rerun this play or for some other story.
