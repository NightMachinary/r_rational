How are they planning to keep Saint prisoner? Only way I can think of is having Komena or Andronike keep an eye on her when it isn't nighttime. Sedation and soul extraction would work too, I suppose, but that doesn't seem like something the drow would have developed Night tricks for. Sve Noc might know how though.

Edit: Didn't realise she was trading for the body immediately. This is probably why.
