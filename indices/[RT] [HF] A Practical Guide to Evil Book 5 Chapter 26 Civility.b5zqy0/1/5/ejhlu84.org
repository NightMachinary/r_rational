about the soul, he've looked at it 3 times first time in their first negotiations, he says she's a flagellant and damage herself for her cause, her soul being scarred by wounds.

​

looked at aqua before when she posed as Cathrine, commenting on how horrible it now looked "what have you done" was his line among others, not surprising considering aqua ripped her own soul out and is the Diabolist, or were at the very least, all before Cat nailed her to cloak and entwined her soul in fay magic.
