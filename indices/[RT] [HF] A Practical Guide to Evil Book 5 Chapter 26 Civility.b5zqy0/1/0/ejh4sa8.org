  I'm intrigued that Pilgrim thinks Cats soul is worse? Did he actually see her soul or just look at the sisters? All things considered it seems like it should be much improved from eldritch monstrosity to garden variety human sinner (in his eyes).

He got bitch-slapped by Sve Noc, all he could see was Winter and two millennia of horrible murders. If you look at someone's soul and see that, well....

  Him simply failing and being recaptured off screen seems too neat so I'm going to presume there was some unspoken plan there on his part

I'm 40% sure that the Rogue Sorcerer's soul is in Black's possession after Black body-snatched the poor schmuck when everyone else was asleep. After all, he was put under a spell of silence at all times and chained up so he couldn't move or gesture. How could the RS tell anyone that Black was in his body before Saint cut his soul out?
