Nah, the choir tries to take a peak, gets blocked and then Pilgrim tries again, presumably with his own aspect, afterward. Andronike laughs at this, its unclear whether she allows it to succeed or not, there's no sensation of effort, unlike with the Ophanim, though whether that was because Pilgrim is weaker than the choir or because they didn't bother to block it, is not clear.
