  Can we read anything said as update about Black? Last we saw him he appeared to have been escaping, body and soul firmly intertwined and going to claim a new mantle. Him simply failing and being recaptured off screen seems too neat so I'm going to presume there was some unspoken plan there on his part (or Pilgrim is lying but that doesn't seem likely).

He was /planning/ to escape. Then he had a portentous conversation, and the scene ends. It sounds like he ultimately decided against escaping.
