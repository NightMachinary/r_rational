This series is so good.

- Antimemetics is a fascinating topic, allowing for quite complex and compelling plots/conflicts. How do you research something you can't remember? How do you /fight/ it? The people who routinely work on both those tasks, what mindsets do they develop?

  How would the world look like, if antimemetics were an actual part of it? Wheeler talks about it this tale: there may be antimemetic aspects to every known field of science, and ordinary people would know nothing of it. History, biology, cosmology --- what hidden aspects could there be to them?

  It's such an interesting mystery/worldbuilding tool.

- Antimemetic enemies lead to unique conflicts, in which you either need to come up with a creative plan on the spot then continuously re-discover it after it's inevitably erased from your memory, /or/ realize that you're helpless and attempt to escape via amnesia to fight another day. On the larger scale, you're not sure how many such conflicts you've forgotten even after accounting for mnestics, and you could only coordinate with other people and your past selves through asynchronous research in occasional Vegas rooms.

  I'm only sad we don't have a full novel about one of the Wars.

- Finally, SCP-3125 and the entire tone/theme of the series. The Foundation is opposing an overwhelmingly, terrifyingly powerful enemy, and continues to oppose it in spite of discovering evidence of other organizations, other /civilizations/, and its own past selves losing to it. /There Is No Antimemetics Division/'s ending, in which it inexorably destroys them anyway, was powerful, and I'm excited to see how the sequel ends.

On a related note:

  "They were human. They were probably significantly more technologically advanced than we are. They existed tens of thousands of years ago; perhaps hundreds of thousands, we can't know for sure. It's difficult to determine what really happened to them because their entire cultural memeplex was lethally irradiated. Their core cultural concepts, the things they created, and stood for, and valued highly, can never be known or propagated again."

This is one of the most creatively horrifying apocalypse scenarios I've encountered. (Not /literally/ the worst, I suppose, but still.)
