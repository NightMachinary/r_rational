  Maybe they're just better equipped

Yes, I think this is a major part of it. Wheeler says it herself, in [[/u/Alphanos][u/Alphanos]]' quote:

  The only reason we still exist at all is because we have better amnestic biochemistry than anybody else in the world.

Foundation Antimemetics has almost casual access to amnestics. Upon discovering SCP-3125, any given Foundation researcher stands a better chance of finding an amnestic and erasing the knowledge from the mind, compared to researchers of other organizations. That's why they're the last ones.

Though [[/u/Alphanos][u/Alphanos]] has a point in that Foundation Antimemetics likely wasn't /the/ most competent organization in the world. They're as competent as they could be without being so competent that their competence kills them. Like Moreno's did.
