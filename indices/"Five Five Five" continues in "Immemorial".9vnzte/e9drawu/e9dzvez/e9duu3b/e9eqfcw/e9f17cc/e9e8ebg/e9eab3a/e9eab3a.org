In the comments on [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/your-last-first-day][Your Last First Day]], the author outlines that the 'talking' beings in the story (like the one here and the (same?) one from YLFD) are /probably not/ the 'Overbeing' itself, which isn't sentient.

They're connected, and still kill you when you perceive them, but they don't do the 'hollowing out everyone around you instantly' thing. They just attack you with invisible spiders.

  There's a big aspect to this which I very nearly added to this whole story, but eventually shied away from. I was going to make it so that the huge invisible spider thing in "Unforgettable" was actually being ridden by a humanoid rider. When Wheeler shot at it, she hit the rider a couple of times. In "CASE COLOURLESS GREEN" I was going to have this rider come back and talk to Wheeler, directly antagonising her in much the same way that SCP-3125 apparently does in this chapter.

  What would then happen is that Wheeler would deduce that this rider person, which claims to be SCP-3125, isn't SCP-3125 at all, but just another manifestation. In this case, some bratty kid which randomly encountered SCP-3125 somehow, and surrendered themself to it in exchange for a boatload of power. The kid thinks they're SCP-3125, and they do wield a great deal of power like free access to this (non-sentient) spider monster, and they think they're leading the war, but the kid is actually like a cuddly mascot strapped to the front of an eighteen-wheeler.

  The lesson would be that no, SCP-3125 is not sentient or intelligent and does not communicate. It is just a massive primal force/prionic infection which has apparently sentient side-effects, and, in some cases, worshippers/servants. To some extent, it may even be that the SCP-3125's "If you see me, I will kill you" behaviour is just how this kid (and others) have chosen to defend SCP-3125 from attack.

  So you've got three options there:

  - Marion was really talking to SCP-3125, and it was giving her traditional villain backtalk (sorry about that, guess I need to work harder).
  - Marion was talking to a "representative" which believes itself to be SCP-3125 but is actually just another hapless victim of this whole mess; a bratty kid with terrible dialogue and too much power.
  - Marion was, as she suspects, genuinely just hallucinating.

  Obviously there's no way you could work out the second possibility there, but that's on me, not you, so it remains a fair criticism.

  This whole angle made its way into about half of the 30 or so drafts of "CASE COLOURLESS GREEN" but in the end I went in a different direction because it was making the entire story too complex. Although it's easy for me to explain all of this here in a forum post, it's relatively difficult to reveal such complex details in a fun, organic way through the medium of the story without resorting to infodump (and stretching it out past the end of 2015).
