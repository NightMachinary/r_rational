This chapter I got a strong vibe from "Assassination Classrom". I only read a few of the first chapter, but the premise is that an octupus powerful alien will destroy the planet (or was it the moon?) in at the end of a given timespan. The catch is that he decide to pass this time teaching to a class of children, while they are trying to kill him. He try really hard to teach and improve everyone of its students, focusing on each one point of strenght.

So could it be that Mama wants to get a vengeance on the aliens and is trying to raise an army? Every strange behaviour could be explained this way. She left the doll at the house to cause the discovery, is protecting the children and progressively making them grow and prepare for the future challenges. In this way, while Sister is thinking to be outplaying Mama, she is just a tool for their training.

If the outside world was thoroughly conquered a rebellion could only start from these farms.
