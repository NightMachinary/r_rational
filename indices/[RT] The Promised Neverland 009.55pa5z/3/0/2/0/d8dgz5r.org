Yeah. Thick lips, wide noses. It's a frustratingly common pattern in manga.\\
It's worth noting that caucasian westerners are also often caricatured (blocky cheeks and chin, [[http://i.imgur.com/4xAsggs.jpg][this]] works as an example I guess), so it's not, like... it's not special treatment reserved for black people. But it's also undeniable that the treatment black people get is generally much less flattering.

And then there are examples like Eyeshield 21, which presents its [[http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/eyeshield21/images/9/9b/Patrick_spencer.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091227021851][black character]] in a very positive light. He even has to struggle against racism, courtesy of his american coach. He's not a throwaway character, he's not an idiot, he has plenty of good qualities.\\
And then the manga starts going on about all the natural advantages black people have in sports, and how their natural talents are like those of wild animals, etc...

It's sad. Japan is just a racist country I guess. In a patronizing way.\\
(qualifiers apply of course. Not everyone is racist blah blah)
