I think murdering her isn't the best idea because it will probably affect them psychologically and that could be a problem later and also it could make convincing the other children more difficult or and it's going to make Mama and the demons see them as bigger treats .So if possible incapacitating her(breaking her legs or giving her a serious injury ) would be better .It's good to see that they are serious an capable of at least planing things like that if necessary(we'll see if they are capable of doing them) . It's strange next cap the escape ,they don't have munch information so maybe something (the demons coming to collect them?)will leave them without time to keep preparing.
