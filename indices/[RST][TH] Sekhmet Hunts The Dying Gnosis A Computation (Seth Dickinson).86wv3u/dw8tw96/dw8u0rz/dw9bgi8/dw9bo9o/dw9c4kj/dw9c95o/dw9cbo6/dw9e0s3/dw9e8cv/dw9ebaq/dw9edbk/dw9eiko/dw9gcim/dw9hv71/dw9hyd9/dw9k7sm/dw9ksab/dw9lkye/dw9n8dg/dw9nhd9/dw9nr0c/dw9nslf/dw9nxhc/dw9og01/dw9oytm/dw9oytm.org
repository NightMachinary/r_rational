Ah, sorry.

I'm talking from a perspective of [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/][compatibilism]]; basically asserting that the free-will debate (which espouses a conflict between free will and determinism; claiming that free will requires the retroactive ability to "have done otherwise") is entirely confused, that determinism is not only not at odds with free will but the only thing that allows us to have will in the first place, and that ultimately the exertion of will is not some act of /changing/ the universe (the "mutable" view) but a fact of the matter as to why the universe turns out to be the way it ultimately does, deterministically, turn out. Basically positing will as computable and computed via physics, such as while all the future of the world is already inherent in its causal beginnings, this fact does not diminish but rather enable our will.

From the compatibilist view, the fact that all the events in the universe are already written does not pose any hindrance to human will, but merely shifts the question towards the challenge of understanding the mechanism or system by which it is written. This then points towards [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference][Solomonoff induction]] as the mechanism that determines the thing that is "proper" for an agent to believe; the truth of the world to the degree to which a thinking being can reasonably be expected to discern it. (You may tell relativity from the statics of a bent blade of grass, but you cannot tell relativity from a black image. Belief is a function of input.)

Note that Solomonoff induction is near perfectly equivalent to the mechanism by which you would predict the next bit of a sequence given all the previous bits and infinite time: ie., perfect compression assuming underlying regularity and no preconceptions.

As such, when Seth Dickinson feeds me a world which looks superficially like ours, in which events mostly happen for systematic reasons, and then tells me that /the events in this world are preordained; they reveal no greater structure/, he's either lying to me about the world or about his mechanism of discovering it. (It, of course, being cribbed from our own highly deterministic and compressible world.) The theory that this universe is from the inside perfectly random, has a prior probability of 1 to [the number of possible perfectly random configurations of particles and fields]; the theory that this universe is from the /outside/ perfectly random has a prior probability of 1 to [the number of possible stories of this length describing random worlds]. Both of those are very small. A perfectly intelligent character in Seth's story would deduce the existence of Seth via complete simulation of our universe /long/ before they arrived at the part of theory-space where truly random worlds live. And if there /is/ some structure that predicts, ie. compresses, this list of pre-written events, then the fact that they are pre-written is irrelevant to the question of whether we may exploit it. After all, to the extent that it is compressed by this structure, it would just be pre-written that we would exploit it, as humans do.

If the correlation is such that Hayden gets what he wants but all attempts to exploit this by others fail, then that itself is a mechanistic fact that reveals details about the implementer of this correlation. (Namely, the sort of spite that points at a sentient.)
