  I think we may just fundamentally disagree about how to interpret fiction, then. When I read a story, I accept its premises as long as they're internally consistent. The probability that a universe containing those premises could actually exist doesn't factor into my reading.

I guess I would say that I accept a universe's /existence/ but not its /metanarrative justifications/. Things are as the characters observe them at the time: that is a given. However, descriptive claims made within the text about the nature of its universe are metanarrative, and may simply be a product of the author being confused about probability.

You cannot write a story that tells me outright that the universe depicted therein is truly random, when every fiber of the universe screams of order. (The map exists in the territory; the author's brain is part of the universe...) One side of that plot contradiction has to yield, and I'll pick the metanarrative one every time.

The laws of thought and probability are true no matter what mechanical turns you force on it. If you write a story where the problem of induction is actualized, and a character in this story believes that the sun will come up tomorrow when it /doesn't/, I'll say that does more discredit to the author than the character. It is a /cheat/ to declare random a fictional universe that objectively only exists because of the order in your own. Objectively, it does /not/ exist at random no matter what you claim - you're lying to your readers in a way that exposes the separation of author and fiction as scam.
