#+begin_quote
  The story is pretty clear that a fully-formed universe was pulled out of nowhere.
#+end_quote

The story can claim that all it wants, it still won't be true. This universe only exists because an author claims it, so it's parasitic on ours. A true random universe doesn't look like this, nine point [many, many, /many/ nines] times out of ten. See GAZP vs GLUT, as linked; it's about exactly this scenario. An intelligent character would correctly derive the existence of a literary author far, /far/ before they were reduced to claiming random chance. From the inside and the outside, you can see the shape of probability, and Hayden's power clearly conforms to some regularity. After all, the opposite of that is just that it's random. And depending on the shape of that regularity, his power may or may not be able to be commanded; evidence in the story suggests that it is such that it may. Hence demonstrating as false his assertion that he has no control, any more than everybody else in the story does.

  "Shape and selection of the correspondence"

Meaning shape and selection mechanism driving the correspondence between Hayden's mind and the events that occur in the world.
