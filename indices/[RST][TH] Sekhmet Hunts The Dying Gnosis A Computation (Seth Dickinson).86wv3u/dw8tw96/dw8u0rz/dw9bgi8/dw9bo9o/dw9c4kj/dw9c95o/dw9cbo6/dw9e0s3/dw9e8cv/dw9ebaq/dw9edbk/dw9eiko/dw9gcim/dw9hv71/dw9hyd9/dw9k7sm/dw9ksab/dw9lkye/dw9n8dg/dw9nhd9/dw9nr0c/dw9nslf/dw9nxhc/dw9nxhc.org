"Mutable" doesn't mean anything because it's a fallacy in the "free will vs determinism" (non)sense; I cannot define it without contradiction because it's a contradictory concept that some people nonetheless employ. That said, "mutable" is the degree to which the universe is /not/ "a predetermined list of things that have all been written."

Compressible means that the minimum-message-length description of the universe is (vastly) shorter than its "exhaustive list of ground truths" description.
