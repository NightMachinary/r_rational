Right, but that's my point about determinism. /Any/ deterministic universe looks like that. But the notion that this is a universe in which probability /mostly/ works except for this one person seems implausible. Much more likely that the effect is applied via some sort of search process involving probabilistic order. And then the question whether it's a local or global search is still on the table.
