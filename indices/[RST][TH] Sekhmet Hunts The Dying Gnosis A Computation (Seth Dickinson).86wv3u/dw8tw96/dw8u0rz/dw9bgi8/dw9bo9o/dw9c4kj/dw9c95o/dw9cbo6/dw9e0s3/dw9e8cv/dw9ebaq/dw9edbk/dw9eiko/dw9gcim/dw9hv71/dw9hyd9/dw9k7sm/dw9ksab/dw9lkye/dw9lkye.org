  The story can claim that all it wants, it still won't be true.

I think we may just fundamentally disagree about how to interpret fiction, then. When I read a story, I accept its premises as long as they're /internally/ consistent. The probability that a universe containing those premises could actually exist doesn't factor into my reading.

The premise of this story is that all things are prewritten and that Hayden always gets what he wants. I accept this premise and from there I conclude that everyone's /wants/ are also prewritten, including Hayden's, and that what's unique about Hayden is that his prewritten experiences always correspond to his prewritten wants. I don't think there is any real-time correspondence between Hayden's mind and the events at all. I would come to a different conclusion if I rejected the premise as you have, but I don't reject it.
