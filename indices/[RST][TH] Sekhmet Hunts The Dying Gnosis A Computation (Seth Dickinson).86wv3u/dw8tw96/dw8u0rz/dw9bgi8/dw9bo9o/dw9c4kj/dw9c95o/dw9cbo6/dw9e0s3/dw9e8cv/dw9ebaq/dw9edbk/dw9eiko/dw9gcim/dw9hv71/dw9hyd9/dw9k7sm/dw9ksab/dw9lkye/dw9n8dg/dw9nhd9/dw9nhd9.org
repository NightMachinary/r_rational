Unless I'm forgetting a key line, I don't believe the story tells us that the universe is truly random, but rather the opposite. We learn in the course of the story that the universe, despite appearing random to in-universe observers, is actually deterministic. "From the beginning of time to the end of eternity all things have been written."
