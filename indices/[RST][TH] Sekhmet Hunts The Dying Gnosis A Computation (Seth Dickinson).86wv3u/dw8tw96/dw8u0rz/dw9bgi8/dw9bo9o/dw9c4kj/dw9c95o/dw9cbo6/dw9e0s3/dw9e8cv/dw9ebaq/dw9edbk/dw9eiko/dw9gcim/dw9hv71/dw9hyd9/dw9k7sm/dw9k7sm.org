I don't really understand what you're getting at. "Shape and selection of the correspondence" doesn't mean anything to me, maybe there's some other way you can phrase it? The story is pretty clear that a fully-formed universe /was/ pulled out of nowhere.

I think it's easier to understand if you think of the world of the story /as/ a story. Like if Seth Dickinson wrote a novel encompassing everything that happens everywhere for the entire lifespan of a universe, but also on every page he includes the words "Hayden wanted X" and then describes how Hayden gets X.
