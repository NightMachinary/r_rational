The notion of being an unwilling victim to an Author kinda reminds me of [[https://qntm.org/coyote][The Bird]].

I think living with a set of facts pre-written by an author may be a cosmic horror, but it is not intrinsically unknowable in the way that the story asks us to believe. It would make narrative and cosmological sense, of course, and Hayden can simply be wrong about how it works.

Of course, it would make the point that "this is the only decision I know is independent" delightfully hollow. Maybe our author's into hurt/comfort?
