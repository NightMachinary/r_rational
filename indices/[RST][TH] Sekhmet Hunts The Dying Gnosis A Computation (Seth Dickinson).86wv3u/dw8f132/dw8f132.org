This story is an old favorite of mine. As far as I can tell, it's been a few years since it was last posted; hopefully this will be a chance for new folks to discover it!

Edit: Someone asked for a blurb but the comment is gone. I'll provide it anyway. The story is an extended allegory about the eternal war between natural selection and cognition as mechanisms of change, which plays out across the backdrop of humanity's struggle to bring about the Singularity and defeat entropy.
