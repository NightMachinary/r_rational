I think it's because Sekhmet and Set aren't meant to be defined by their outcomes, but by their methods. As far as I can say the story isn't actually about Evolution, but about Change. Sekhmet is meant to represent all the change caused by natural, emergent processes, like evolution or how the stars formed, and Set is meant to represent the change caused by cognition and thought.

And in the end Sekhmet usually wins and eats Set because all the thinking beings in the universe couldn't figure out a way to stop the natural heat death of the universe. If they ever did, that would be a triumph of cognition over the other vector of change, and Set would win.

Sekhmet and Set don't represent evolution or survival of the fittest, but two different methods of change and creation; emergence vs. design.
