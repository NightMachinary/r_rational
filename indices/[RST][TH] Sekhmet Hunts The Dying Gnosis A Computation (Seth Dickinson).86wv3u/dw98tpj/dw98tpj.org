Wait, so I'm going to see if I understand this correctly.

Essentially the universe is stuck in a loop, always resetting when Sekhmet eats Set. And this is because once Sekhmet eats Set and returns to a point earlier in the beginning of the timeline, Set is reborn from her the moment 'Thought' comes into existence once more, with the evolution of the antecessor apes.

And each time, if I'm getting this right, Set gets a little stronger. He grows a bit bigger, the difference between the two of them getting smaller and smaller. And this is good, because the ultimate goal of life is the creation of the trans-humans that could arise from the reconciliation between cognition and natural selection.

And so in the end, when Sekhmet turns to run, is it because the cycle has been repeated so much that Set has finally become strong enough to hunt Sekhmet? If Sekhmet hunts and absorbs Set, the universe simply ends in enthropy; so I'm guessing if Set manages to catch and absorb Sekhmet, the way forward will be clear?
