That story is a bit silly. It seems like it derives all its power from the freakish unintuitiveness of determinism. But in all the world, there has only ever been determinism and randomness. A correlation with your will is generally called "a power that you have". Its strength depends on the degree to which it is maintained as you "change your mind", which is not a nondeterministic thing but an abstraction on the function of your behavior depending on more recent evidence.

Nobody can get to the future without passing through the present.

It was still very beautiful and very sad, of course.
