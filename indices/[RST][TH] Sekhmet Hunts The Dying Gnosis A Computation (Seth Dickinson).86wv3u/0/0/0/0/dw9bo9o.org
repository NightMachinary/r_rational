I think the central conflict in that story was less the semantics of whether Hayden "has power," and more how the knowledge that everything would always happen the way Hayden wanted it to affected Naveen's perception of himself and their relationship. So I wouldn't agree that the story derives all its power from determinism being unintuitive.
