OK, I still don't think I'm understanding.

First, I don't understand what it means for the exertion of will to be "a fact of the matter as to why the universe turns out to be the way it does." It seems like you might be saying that exercising free will just means understanding why things are happening. Is that correct?

Second, I don't understand how knowing the rules by which the universe was generated is exploitable, when the universe already /has/ been generated. (Or at best, in this scenario, decompressed--I take the story at its word that it all came into existence at once, rather than being computed linearly from an initial state.) You're in page 50 of a book on a shelf, you realize you're in a book, you comprehend the structure of the book sufficiently to predict exactly what will happen next...okay, now what? The rest of the pages are already there.

(I don't think we're even using the same definition of "exploit," because you've already said that exercising free will doesn't mean changing anything, and my idea of exploiting something definitely means using it to effect change.)

Your position that the author is "lying" about the characteristics of a fictional universe he created also doesn't make sense to me, but that again I think just shows we have incompatible perspectives on literary analysis.

  If the correlation is such that Hayden gets what he wants but all attempts to exploit this by others fail, then that itself is a mechanistic fact that reveals details about the implementer of this correlation. (Namely, the sort of spite that points at a sentient.)

I don't think there's anything in the story that would be inconsistent with an outside sentient having created the universe or even just having rearranged it to fulfill Hayden's wants (Gary Stu fanfic?), but surely "Hayden doesn't want anyone to successfully exploit this mechanism" is also a viable explanation.
