  If it is written that event X happens a certain number of times during the lifespan of the universe and Y follows each time, that's going to look from the inside like a rule that X causes Y, right? But in reality Y happened because it was written that Y would happen, not because it was written that Y would follow X.

Right but "X happens, then Y happens, except when you try to deliberately exploit X in which case Y doesn't happen" is /much/ less parsimonious than "X happens, then Y happens". And "X happens, then Y happens" is exploitable via deliberately making X happen.

  The characters didn't believe that, so they didn't try. As it was written.

Right, I'm not saying it's inconsistent from the character perspective, I'm saying Hayden is probably wrong. The problem only arises if you take his cosmology seriously.
