I mean "random" vs "deterministic" here in the sense of "compressible" rather than some confused sense of "mutable".

Again, everything I'm saying is just a restatement of GAZP vs GLUT.

A compressible universe is one in which things happen for reasons. Reasons outside can find their echoes in understanding inside. A compressible power that looks like the one Hayden possesses is one that can be used.
