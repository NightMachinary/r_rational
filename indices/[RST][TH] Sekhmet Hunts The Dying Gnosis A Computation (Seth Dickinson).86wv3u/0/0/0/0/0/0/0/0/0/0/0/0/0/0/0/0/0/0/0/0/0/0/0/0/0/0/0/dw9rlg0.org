  First, I don't understand what it means for the exertion of will to be "a fact of the matter as to why the universe turns out to be the way it does." It seems like you might be saying that exercising free will just means understanding why things are happening.

No; rather /understanding/ free will is equivalent to understanding why things are happening. Exercising free will is a question of, in the /inside view/, choosing one of a series of previously relatively evenly ranked actions to take in response to consideration. From the /outside view/, it's one taken in a way responsive to whatever lever you currently care about socially reinforcing. The point is that all these attributes are psychological, not mechanistic: a free choice and an unfree choice run on the exact same physics.

  Second, I don't understand how knowing the rules by which the universe was generated is exploitable, when the universe already has been generated.

Right, and there's the key of it - if the universe that has been generated is compressible by human will, then "the free decision of what to do next" is a legitimate abstraction over the /function that has already been computed to generate it/. You're looking at a snapshot and saying "obviously you cannot change this snapshot", but the decision isn't the sort of thing that can /change/ the snapshot, it's the sort of thing that /explains why the snapshot looks the way it does/. The psychology of the humans embedded in the snapshot predicts the subsequent frames. We can exploit the power because "humans exploit the regularity" is an abstraction that /compresses/ the mathematical regularity of the frozen immutable state of the events that were always going to happen the same way. The computation and resulting behavior that are free will from the inside, are merely a part of the regularity from the outside.

  surely "Hayden doesn't want anyone to successfully exploit this mechanism" is also a viable explanation.

That's quite true, but that's not what he's telling us. :)
