I guess we have to conclude that, for whatever reason, he doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who's okay with it. That's the only possible way for it to not have happened. I don't think the universe necessarily tends toward what makes Hayden /happiest,/ just what he wants, even if it hurts him.

Edit: Also in retrospect, if he'd wanted Naveen to be okay with it, Naveen would have been. So I guess the problem isn't that he doesn't want to be matched with the right person, it's that he doesn't want someone he's with to accept the subsumation of their will.
