Honestly, I'm not convinced that the apparent causality of this story's universe is anything more than an illusion. If it is written that event X happens a certain number of times during the lifespan of the universe and Y follows each time, that's going to look from the inside like a rule that X causes Y, right? But in reality Y happened because it was written that Y would happen, not because it was written that Y would follow X. We really don't /know/ that this universe is compressible at all.

That aside, I don't think there's any inconsistency in the story even using your interpretation. You believe the characters should have been able to exploit Hayden's situation. The characters /didn't/ believe that, so they didn't try. As it was written.
