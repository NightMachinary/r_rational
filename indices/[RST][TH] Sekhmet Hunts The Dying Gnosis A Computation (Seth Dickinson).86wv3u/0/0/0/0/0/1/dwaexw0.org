After reading, dropping in to write down my own disjointed thoughts.

'all things have been written'. Hayden is as much a puppet in the writer's play as anyone else, have things happen to and around him without his permission. 'Everything I need happens', not anything he specifically wants or does not want to happen, and also not necessarily according to his own values, but according to what the writer wants to happen to him (his perception of the writer's motivation being what the writer feels needs to happen to him)... the motivations of the writer are the area of interest, what the writer accomplishes in designing the universe-seed such that this happens. There's also the question of Enshagag's background mythology, how that meshes with all of humanity, what happened to the others 'gods'.

The Cthulhu Mythos comes to mind--the end feels important, revelatory. It's not that Hayden can't be happy with a subsumed will, because he's been in many other relationships, which didn't go as far, didn't run into the same issue. He wants to tell Naveen secrets about the universe, things which aren't revealed in the story. The more time they spend together, the more him telling Naveen those things becomes inevitable... he feels that /knowledge/ would make Naveen unhappy, he doesn't want to make Naveen unhappy, the drives to share (and to let Naveen know what Naveen wants to know) and to keep Naveen in ignorant bliss are in conflict. There's also the question of if the writer has its own motivations, not wanting certain knowledge to be widespread. Maybe the knowledge itself happens to be about the writer, its motivations, the god/human meshing, what the whole thing is about... ('Actually, you're a fictional character in a short story about me, and the story is about to end', except that's probably going too far out of the contextspace, which includes the 'Laws are terrible things' impression.)

...if imagining it as in fact locked to 'maximum happiness'... but then why wouldn't every partner be like his earlier partners, partners who were happy together with him (and then moved on/died) without there being enough of a bond to want to share things with them... also why wouldn't his first partner be perfect and also live forever with him, enjoying the same benefits. Writer-related/-relationship perks. Sadness at times of death? If what he needs (from the writer's perspective)... and possibly Naveen is just a necessary tempering, for him to flirt with revelation to others until he can finally let himself do it one day and become more truly happy than holding all the horribleness to himself, even though he doesn't want to share it and make others have to bear the burden with him...

If that universe does have an 'end of eternity', I wonder how Hayden dies, or if not-dying has something to do with the writer's intentions (/the secret knowledge about the universe that Hayden doesn't share with Naveen).
