Well, but like ... this is kind of self-aggrandizing isn't it? Cooperation isn't random. Altruism isn't random. Those things have always and ever merely been greater interpretations of Sekhmet. We don't think the Good is Good for no reason, we think the Good is Good because it's pro-social, and pro-social wins.

If there is such a thing as Set, we have not yet given birth to him, and his birth, when it comes, will not be a defeat but a fulfilment of Sekhmet.
