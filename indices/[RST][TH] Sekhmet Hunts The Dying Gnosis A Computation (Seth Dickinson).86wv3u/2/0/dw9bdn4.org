I think it's something like that! It's not /entirely/ clear to me, but I think the idea is that humanity reconciled the two algorithms by making Set-strategies the most fit. Sekhmet is now forced to reward the "strength" that will defeat her. I think the ultimate goal is not necessarily the creation of the transhumans, but the transhumans succeeding at preventing heat death. But I'm not 100% sure, I find the ending kind of hard to interpret.

My headcanon is that the allegory is playing out in a massive simulation being run by Coeus and the other transhumans, hence the iterations, but I don't think there's anything definitive on that point in the text.
