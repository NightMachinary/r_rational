I think this is mostly spot-on, but for the very end: "Behold Set..."

I took that to mean that the Sekhmet who speaks with Coeus /becomes/ Set for the next iteration. She says that Set was born from her own flesh, a corruption of her paradigm--which is exactly what a Sekhmet who starts believing in something besides raw strength would be. So Sekhmet, who is the only deity for 99% of the universe's timeline, births and becomes Set, and then chases herself until she meets Coeus and the cycle moves forward.
