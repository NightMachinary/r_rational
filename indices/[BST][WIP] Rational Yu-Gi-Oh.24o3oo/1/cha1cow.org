  Cons: I have no idea how the actual card game works except from what I've seen and I kind of like that.

How the card game works: The first thing you should know it that it doesn't. The game doesn't work.

You know how they printed it as a physical card game? The show breaks the rules at least once per episode, usually more. Cards have More Powers As the Plot Demands, and Yami/Yugi has the canon superpower that his deck is always stacked exactly how he needs it to be (That's what "the heart of the cards" is. No, seriously, that's /exactly/ what it is.), so his /deck/ also has More Powers As the Plot Demands. Later seasons (once they stopped following Yugi) mostly started following rules, but even those are essentially made up as they go along.
