Interesting. I knew about the 3 card limit. There are massively overpowered cards in the game. The most overpowered one I know of is Ishizu's Crush Virus which swaps both players' decks with their removed from play pile or something like that.

Worst-case scenario I can just rewrite the entire game from scratch. I'm sure that won't be at all too difficult and won't make me burn out.
