I guess I'll have to. There are two main problems. First, I don't want to have to throw in a filler arc just to introduce the basic strategies with weak pushover characters, and I don't want the existing characters to be weak, but I can't just start with the super advanced stuff. Second, after the first arc it mostly stops making sense to have the card game at all. If Pegasus's Duel Monsters is based on Shadow Game Duel Monsters then it might make sense, but there would have to be some sort of explanation of why the latter even exists as a game with rules and turns and "cards".

I'll also have to carefully record my own thoughts and beginner mistakes as I go so I don't make the characters too right too fast. It's hard to simulate realistic reasoning when you know the answer. It's too easy to just make them say "Oh, obviously P /= NP because [proof].".
