Oh, the card game doesn't work much better than the show. There's a three-copy limit on cards, except for Exodia pieces and some other things pretty much at random, which are limited to one each. All monster cards have a star rating (1-9, I think? They may have added higher star ratings recently), and to summon high-star monsters you have to sacrifice other monsters from play; sometimes specific ones (fusion monsters require two specific ones in play and also a spell card, though I think there are a couple choices for the spell card, ritual monsters require a ritual spell card and usually some specific cards in play), non-special high-star monsters just require generic monsters sacrificed. There is rarely any reason to play any monster with fewer than 5 stars, because monsters with more stars are usually strictly better than lower-star monsters and 5 is the highest you get before you start needing to sacrifice guys.

Spells have no balancing factor whatsoever, last I checked (most of this info is a couple years out of date, but according to a friend who doesn't play but follows the game for laughs, the basics haven't changed). Power creep is blatant and no attempts to avoid it have even been attempted (though Blue Eyes White Dragon still has the highest attack power of ordinary monsters, IIRC. That doesn't make it good, but it is the biggest.)

Oh, and how cards interact is done ad-hoc and probably depends on the whims of whoever is in charge where you're playing.

As you may have guessed from the kinds of things I took issue with, I'm a Magic player, though I did briefly play Yu-Gi-Oh years ago. It offends my sense of game aesthetics. (I'm also a game designer, so this sense is more highly developed than is normal, possibly more than is healthy.)
