If you do rewrite it, I suggest making it work roughly like [[http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/][Hearthstone]], only with more zeros added after every number and no class restrictions. Hearthstone isn't great design, but it's a solid framework. And since Hearthstone is free to play (and not particularly exploitative, either), you can play enough of it to get a sense of what that means without spending money.

Also, it's pretty similar in some important respects; you only play effects on your own turn, with some triggered Secrets which act exactly like Trap Cards, you attack specific monsters rather than an attack/block structure, and there are significant limitations on how much you can have on the field at once.
