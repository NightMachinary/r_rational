I will look into that. It might be not-too-impossible to merge them.

Fuck that. I had forgotten how much I hate blizzard. They locked my account for daring to attempt to play the map editor with my proxy on and I can't unlock it because apparently they're too good to send a confirmation email to your email address to reset the password and they won't even accept the registration key for SC2 that I have from my physical copy. This from the company that made a game that took me literally eleven hours to update the last time I successfully played.

Maybe I'll just reteach myself MTG and +combine+ polymerize with that.
