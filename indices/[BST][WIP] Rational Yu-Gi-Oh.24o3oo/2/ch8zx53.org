I intend to make it structurally both a Yugioh arc and a Bond movie. It will fulfill the tropes of both in a satisfying way. There will be a Bond James Bond, there will be a shaken not stirred, there will be a chase scene, there will be a Bond girl or two, there will be ridiculous feats and gadgets, there will be spy stuff, saying the title, a big villain speech, friendship, card games, mysterious ancient egyptian stuff, and more.

[REDACTED]

I intend to start the story with Yugi tagging along with his grandfather on an excavation, somehow getting separated, finding the puzzle, and Yami sort of trying to kill him to test whether he is worthy of claiming the Puzzle. Yami doesn't tell Yugi the puzzle gives invincibility, so it's more of a test of courage.
