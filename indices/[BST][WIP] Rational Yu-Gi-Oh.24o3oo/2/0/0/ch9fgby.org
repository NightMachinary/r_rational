They're going to working independently for the first arc without much interaction. In the second arc, Bond will be doing investigation stuff and helping with the civil war while Yugi primarily deals with fighting the shadow realm monsters. I certainly don't see Bond as a father figure. I'm thinking they'll be mostly ally-ish.

It'll be more focused on Yugi. Bond is a dead end in terms of character development. He has to stay archetypal in order to still be Bond. Honestly it would be a lot easier to just get rid of Bond and have it just be Yugioh, but, then I couldn't justify calling it "License to Duel" and I love the title as is. Maybe if I just sit down one weekend and marathon 6-7 Bond movies some more ideas of how to use him will come to me.
