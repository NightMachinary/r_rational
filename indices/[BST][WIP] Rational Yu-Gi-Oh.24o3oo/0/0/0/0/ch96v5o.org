It was originally going to be a comedy/spoof, but I decided to make it more serious and try to make it actually good, which would be even funnier than any joke I could make inside the story.

Besides, if you've seen as much "so bad it's good" as I have, you can tell when someone's trying to force it and it just isn't as good.
