Don't know of a master list.

I think Mother of Learning qualifies in spades.

To me, litrpg =/= rational, but if you like those I found delve and seaborn to be good candidates among lots of trash. I award points on the worldbuilding being rational and put the protagonists in the middle of the pack for rationality. (They're no Ender or HPEVP, but they try, and you can make a good argument for rationality as well as pointing out many many flaws) Both are incomplete and ongoing.

Can't think of any others right now, but I'd love to read what anyone else would put on a rational list.
