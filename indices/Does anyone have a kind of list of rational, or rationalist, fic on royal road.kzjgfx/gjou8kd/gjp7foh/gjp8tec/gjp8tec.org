The interactions between the dad and daughter made me physically cringe and I couldn't keep going - apparently it becomes more tragic later which I don't like anyway

Yeah I like that, not following cos im not up-to-date. Don't know why its rated so low on RR, I'm assuming just cos of idiots. I have paused after the duel arc though because I don't like tragedy and feel like it will just go down hill from the high lol.
