  Delve is not rational, though. At all.

  It just has a short early arc with lots of fun numbers,

Sorry, I am using the rational/rationalist definition on the side-bar. Rational means that the characters make decisions in-character, the world is consistent, etc not that the MC is a genius or rational or we get a lot of math, that is "rationalist". So Numbers != rational.

The first sentence makes me think you are thinking of "rationalist" instead of "rational" cos a story being rational isn't a yes/no, its a scale like quality: the more inconsistences the story has, the less rational it becomes. IMO Delve has low enough inconsistencies to be classified as "rational". It not having numbers or being slow paced or frustrating does not affect how "rational" it is.

  As far as comparison to the rest of the list, why push back on things no one knows about?

Sorry what? What do you mean by that? My bar for "rational enough to not detract from the story" is low enough to cover about 50% of the stories in my list to give you an idea of where it is. So Delve fits well above my bar hence I call it "rational".
