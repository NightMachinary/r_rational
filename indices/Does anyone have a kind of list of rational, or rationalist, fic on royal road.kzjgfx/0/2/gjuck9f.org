If you enjoyed "I Became a [Biologist] in a Fantasy World!", then I strongly recommend "The Essence of Cultivation" by the same author ([[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34710/the-essence-of-cultivation]]), about a sort of D&D wizard that finds himself in a world of cultivators.

The downside is that it's fairly short and on Hiatus, but other than that I found it really good and hopefully the author will resume it at some point.
