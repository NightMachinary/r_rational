I like it! Words of advice, I wouldn't link to the plot reddit comment if you still have it up as I'm not sure. If you follow through pretty far with this it's possible it'll get a big following like how HPMOR has and giving word-of-god info like that definitely reduces suspense/fun stuff.

Looking forward to the next chapter! How often are you planning on updating? Regular schedule?
