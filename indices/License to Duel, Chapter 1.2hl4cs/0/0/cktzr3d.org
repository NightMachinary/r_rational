That's a good point. The "real" plot doesn't even start until after all of that is revealed but I guess I could make a puzzle out of each item's powers for the people who didn't read the first post. The only problem is that Yami has no particular reason not to just tell Yugi what they all do. I guess he has no reason TO tell him either. I'll think of something.

I managed to do two in two weeks. I hope to be able to maintain that pace but life gets unpredictably busy. As I get more practice it'll take less time, too.
