I really liked this. It started out slowly and some chapters drag a bit but we finaly have a bit more of "plot" and whatever. I would have prefered it to be earlier or smth but its still nice thats its going somewhere. I think a lot of things can be done with the setting like the effect of the orbs are just sometimes hilarious.
