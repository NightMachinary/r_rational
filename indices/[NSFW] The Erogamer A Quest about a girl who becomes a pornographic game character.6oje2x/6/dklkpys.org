** 1) This is not a rational smut story.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-is-not-a-rational-smut-story.
   :END:
Why? Because:

1. the actions of far too many characters do not match their psychological profiles.

The most extreme case of this happens with the main character's mother. At the beginning of the story she's the parent of a teenager who doesn't even know how to masturbate properly and is being ashamed of doing it. In the third arc, when she's told that her daughter has turned into a smutgame character who plans to be selling sexual services for money and building herself a harem, the mother not only almost instantly becomes ok with all that but is also suddenly happy to take part in it by giving her daughter sex-related quests and requesting a sex slave for her own use as well.

This all is being explained as the Gamer! mechanics (the “Follow the rabbit” skill, the “improbability field” AKA the ERO stat, etc) influencing people and their minds, but instead of this explanation making all these out of character changes better, it only makes the Gamer! aspects of the story worse --- it just cheapens the setting, making characters more 2-dimensional and shallow, like a poorly-designed and uninteresting AI.

Additionally, the ease with which a character's psychology can be changed makes all the long paragraphs of introspective monologues and dialogues even more of a waste of space, because one day the story can show them deciding on one thing, and the other day it can show their personalities doing a complete 180 degree shift because of some new RPG effect introduced out of nowhere.

2. generally, the Gamer! mechanics is used as a broad excuse for justifying bad writing tropes.

3. the main character somehow decides that the only way for her to lose her virginity should be to someone who rapes her \ doesn't ask her for her consent.

#+begin_quote
  Saying yes would be... sad. Like you'd been demoted back to the person you were two days ago. The Cinderella Sheen who would've had to beg a man to fuck her, maybe pay a male prostitute. You don't want to be raped, you want your first time to be sex that you want, with a man that you want. You just don't want to have to ask. Okay. Okay, badbrains, that's not sensible but at least it makes sense. How about if a man clearly wants you for your body, and buys you a nice dinner, and plies you with compliments, and seduces your clothes off. And then, just before he's about to plunge into you, he asks you if it's okay to continue? Then you have to stay quiet and look away, blushing. He has to continue anyway. That is the only way you are allowed to lose your virginity. It can't be given. It must be yielded. ... Because you deserve not to have to say yes before you lose your virginity. After you had to wait to live for so long, you deserve this much, that little thing. If you do say yes, something is being taken away from you, something that you wanted, and that's just too sad. You'll be fine about asking for sex afterwards. Just... not saying yes to losing your virginity.

4. the obesity apologism --- the main character prefers to wallow in self-pity instead of trying to research what a proper diet should be about or to hire a dietitian who would help her with the diet and explain it to her. She also has serious misconceptions about dieting and causes of body weight problems.

#+begin_quote
  She's tried to lose weight. She can't. If she starves herself to the point where she can't concentrate, she can lose ten pounds, not any more, and it all comes back in two months. ... There's no candy in her house. None. ... She's always, always hungry and she doesn't dare eat enough to ever not be hungry. ... Sometimes her willpower breaks and she does eat a cheeseburger or a candy bar, feeling sick and ashamed and like that one act makes everything else her fault. But why shouldn't she? She's never going to lose weight anyway. She's never going to be happy, no matter what she does. Unless, unless, unless something from outside everything she knows, breaks all the rules, and, gives her, a miracle.

5. the main character intends to solve the obesity problem of others by forcefully changing their bodies without their consent because “people can't make informed non-consent in this case due to their suspicious nature”. Instead of trying to come up with some less obtrusive and more efficient solution --- like making them trust her more first or spreading awareness about healthy eating habits and whatnot she jumps right to something ridiculous and starts fervently arguing in its favour.

6. one of the supporting characters decides that raping the main character and making her like being raped is clearly the only way to make her realise that her solution to the obesity problem (see above) is a wrong one.

7. the whole alien roleplay thing becoming too serious out of nowhere.

** 2) This is not a good smut story in general.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-is-not-a-good-smut-story-in-general.
   :END:
Why? Because during the 170,000 words of it there were only five sex-related scenes with too much meaningless internal monologue text.

** 3) This is not a good gamer story.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-is-not-a-good-gamer-story.
   :END:

- Halfway through the story the perspective abruptly shifts from the main character of the story to one of the NPCs, and the whole time the perspective stays on him there are no gamer elements mentioned.
- the SUB and DOM character stats almost never get mentioned or have any influence on the plot.
- the Ero stat, being too OP, first gets artificially frozen by an explanation of how the main character stops her thoughts when she feels like they would bump it past the mark of 20, and then by a deus ex machina that passively reduces the value of Ero stat by half.
- the Gamer!notifications are not interspersed evenly throughout the story, instead they are collected to be given out in large exposition dumps, making reading them a chore instead of something fun.
- there /are/ many promising sex-Perks mentioned later in the story --- but before the main character becomes able to purchase them there will likely have to be some additional 200,000--300,000 words of plot development. Not to mention that many of these perks would likely completely screw the setting. So far the setting has several available reset buttons but overall just doesn't seem to be a flexible enough open sandbox environment. We'll see, I guess.

** 4) This is not a high quality story, even though it does have good potential.

   :END:
Bad writing issues:

- too much meaningless text, internal monologues, and faux-important philosophical debates.

  #+begin_quote
    sometimes you don't understand why some people become English professors if they'll just go around trying to stop people like you from coming up with awesome metaphors.
  #+end_quote

- the way the writing directions and style are being decided through forum votes doesn't seem to work well for this story, making it look like an alpha draft-version of the work. The plot and pacing are also all over the place.

- many bad-writing tropes in the story just get explained away as gamer!influenced reality-warping. Instead of fixing the bad-writing issues it just harms the gamer! aspects in addition to it. Same problem with the “software bugs” in the gamer! mechanics.

- bad BDSM --- the Charles arc gives a good example on why people where so negative about the bad BDSM stuff in Shades of Grey.

- at times, cheesy writing --- “The hunger and the darkness and the predator inside him”

- several pages on /hair/.

--------------

** 5) Despite all this, the story has its good moments, so can be worth reading.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: despite-all-this-the-story-has-its-good-moments-so-can-be-worth-reading.
   :END:
Among other good things:

- nice idea (if a poorly executed one): about temporarily becoming an NPC in someone else's game;
- nice joke: the “'Little Death' Note” perk.

Oh, and the tags so far are: BDSM (sub, dom, bondage, sadism, masochism, rape play), bad BDSM, blowjob, voyeur, masturbation, public masturbation, edging.

Overall, this story has potential (especially considering that it's not finished yet), but it feels like a draft version that still needs some significant editing and improvement.
