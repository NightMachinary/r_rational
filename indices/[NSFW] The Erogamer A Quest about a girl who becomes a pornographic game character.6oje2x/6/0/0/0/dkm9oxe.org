  How and why would saying yes --- and clearing things out with the partner about the sex being mutually consensual --- be sad? Why would saying yes mean that she'd been demoted back to the person she was two days ago? How would saying yes mean that she was asking her partner to fuck her? Why is it the only way she is allowed to lose her virginity? And so on and so forth with the rest of the parts I've quoted and some more that I've left out.

Because she has warped cached thoughts about sexuality, and it's hard to update those beliefs on an emotional level, even if you know intellectually that you're incorrect.
