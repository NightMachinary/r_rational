She's far from a rational person. But that's not a requirement for the work of fiction to be rational itself. It's not pleasant to read, all that tortured logic, I'll agree with that much.

Now, the fact that she has a reality warping power does make usual rational fiction traits a bit vacuous. It's easy to claim that the world has consistent cause and effect and nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it' when you have a ready-made in-universe excuse for any contrivances.
