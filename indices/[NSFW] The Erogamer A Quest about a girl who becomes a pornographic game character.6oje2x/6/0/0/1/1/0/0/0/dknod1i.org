  But the main character(s) should be striving to be making intelligent decisions and striving to be improving in doing that.

  So my problem with this story's main characters is that not only are they very irrational, not only do they not realise that they are being irrational, but that also they don't try to improve themselves and their decision-making (which would at least make them realise that there were problems in their reasoning) and that they arrogantly believe that their faulty opinions and decisions are the right ones.

Most people here consider that to be a feature of rationalist fiction, not necessary for being considered rational, I think. There /are/ people in real world who would be stupid enough to behave the way POV characters of the fic behave in similar circumstances (rather a large fraction of overall population too, I'd expect). I would heavily prefer it if they were smarter, since that would be more interesting to read, but the fact that they're not isn't inauthentic in itself.

  I don't think “favourably compares to expectations regarding porn stories” is good enough to call it a rational story. So far there hasn't been a problem about recommending non-rational stories in this sub --- people do that all the time, just adding something like “it's not a rational work, but ...” in front of their recommendations. There is no need to blur the lines and gradually make that word meaningless.

That is a fair point. Perhaps it really doesn't deserve the label in the end (although for me the reasons would have more to do with the way game mechanics make sure the story is technically rational pretty much no matter what happens in it, which makes the distinction meaningless). I should point out that it's not tagged with [RT] or [RST] right now, so it's not as if there is an explicit claim that it is in fact rational from the person who linked it, even though a lot of people in the comments seem to think it qualifies. Favourably comparing to expectations should be enough to be posted here, even if the story hasn't quite achieved the standard of rational or rationalist fiction, especially given how popular the post is, but I agree that it's not enough to claim it's rational.
