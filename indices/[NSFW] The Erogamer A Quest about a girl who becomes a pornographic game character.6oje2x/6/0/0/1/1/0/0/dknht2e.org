  There is nothing particularly wrong about having various types of characters inhabiting a fictional world of a rational story, even idiots or insane people

Yes, I realised my previous comment must've looked like I was arguing against this, some time after having posted it.

So for the sake of clarifying my position I'll elaborate a bit and say that I agree with this. Stories containing irrational (and even insane) characters can of course still qualify as rational ones. But the main character(s) should be striving to be making intelligent decisions and striving to be improving in doing that. Generally, I myself would be penalising stories with extremely irrational or unintelligent main characters, but admittedly that's more of a personal preference --- usually stories like that are just boring or badly written, even if you could, technically, call them “rational”.

More than that, a story with /only/ rational characters would be an unrealistic [[http://intelligenceexplosion.com/en/2011/why-spock-is-not-rational/][straw Vulcan]] fantasy (if the setting was present-day Earth or something like that, at least). And even a story with a perfectly rational main character would be a mary sue fantasy (because the human mind is still built on top of an irrational wild animal). So it follows then that, as a general rule, good rational stories would be both about making intelligent decisions /and/ overcoming one's own faults /and/ overcoming the obstacles created by other irrational agents (who, in contrast to the main characters, don't necessarily have to be striving to act intelligently, etc).

So my problem with this story's main characters is that not only are they very irrational, not only do they not realise that they are being irrational, but that also they don't try to improve themselves and their decision-making (which would at least make them realise that there were problems in their reasoning) and that they arrogantly believe that their faulty opinions and decisions are the right ones.

The main character, for instance, has a “Good Student” skill that makes it possible for her to learn and understand pretty much any subject she's actually studying and to keep her attention completely focused during the study sessions. It's even shown in one scene that she's extremely appreciative of the abilities this Skill grants her. Yet the only things she's had studied so far were some Calculus topics, and some history books. Nothing about psychology, logics, sexuality (including BDSM, about which she's been learning from /tumblr blogs/, lol), philosophy, ethics, and so on. I realise that writing about a character which has studied all this can be difficult, but that doesn't negate the fact that the lack of all this in the story is yet another thing that invalidates it as a rational story.

  but at the very least the fic favourably compares to what people have come to expect of the genre, as far as rational writing goes.

I don't think “favourably compares to expectations regarding porn stories” is good enough to call it a rational story. So far there hasn't been a problem about recommending non-rational stories in this sub --- people do that all the time, just adding something like “it's not a rational work, but ...” in front of their recommendations. There is no need to blur the lines and gradually make that word meaningless.
