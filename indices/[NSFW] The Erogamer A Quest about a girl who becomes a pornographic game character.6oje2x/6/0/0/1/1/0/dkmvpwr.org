There is nothing particularly wrong about having various types of characters inhabiting a fictional world of a rational story, even idiots or insane people, as long as their idiocy and insanity doesn't come and go at the whims of the author and causes and consequences of those character traits aren't being ignored (granted, in this concrete case the fic does arguably cheat to an extent by having the game mechanics mess with characters' minds). That said, most people who create or consume rational fiction don't like it when POV characters are consistently incompetent or obnoxiously irrational. You'll not see too much of that, I expect. I wouldn't worry about the definition getting diluted too much.

In general, I think you're treating the distinction between rational and not rational fiction as a sharp dichotomy, when it's more of a gradient in practice. This particular fic is not perfectly rational, sure, but it's much closer than what one would expect given the premise. One can argue about validity of criteria for things not happening 'because plot requires it' and what drives characters' actions when things like 'improbability field' and other game mechanics are in play, but at the very least the fic favourably compares to what people have come to expect of the genre, as far as rational writing goes.
