  [both main characters are far from being] a rational person. But that's not a requirement for the work of fiction to be rational itself.

Then I don't know what else to say, because one could shoehorn pretty much any character personality and set of made decisions into a “rational” story through an excuse like that.

Suddenly both self-aware and unintentional examples of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic][Insane Troll Logic,]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladPhilosophy][Salad Philosophy,]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot][What an Idiot]] tropes stop being disqualifiers for a work's assessment as a rational one. And the rational! genre itself becomes much more of a buzzword than a genuine tool for finding works that would match those criteria that've made people interested in the creation of this community in the first place.
