This is the best piece of (rational?)fiction I've read in some time. It's a pornfic, but if you don't mind reading something of that genre, I highly recommend it. It's got:

- intelligent characters
- altruistic protagonist who wants to optimize the world
- it's sexy
- it's got references to things rationalists often talk about
- it's deeper than you would expect and it's deeper than you would expect after taking this into account

I am about 7 chapters in and it's caused me strong emotions - I laughed very loudly and wanted to cry (idk why, no negative emotions) at the same time. It's written in a format of a forum quest where the author writes a story and after each part they prompt readers for ideas. You need to register to read it there
