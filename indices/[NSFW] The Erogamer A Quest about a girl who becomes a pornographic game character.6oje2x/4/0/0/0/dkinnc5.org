The "Gamers Mind" schtick is probably responsible for that. Once you're in a "The Gamer" mode, you're already /literally not a human any more/. You're possibly not even the same person, in an existential sense... you have your old memories but you make completely different decisions than they would, to the point where the person you used to be may effectively be dead.
