So this is a story on Questionable Questing (sorry but it requires an account to view) and it was mentioned a few days ago in a discussion about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6nce5u/meta_rational_porn_fanfic_does_it_count/][rational porn fanfiction]]. It was interesting enough for me to consider it worthy of its own post for anyone who may have not seen the link.

Basically it involves a woman who suddenly becomes a gamer character like the protagonists in LitRPG stories...except the game she is starring in is of the Not Safe For Work variety. Furthermore there are some very odd things going on with the game with unsettling implications. Also, no one acts as if they are NPCs in a game, but as if they are real life individuals in a strange situation.
