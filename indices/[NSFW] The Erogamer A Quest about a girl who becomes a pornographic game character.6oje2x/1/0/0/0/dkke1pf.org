Sure, and I'd love to say that the universe is sure that 91 is not prime (assuming that the universe cares about number theory)... But even if I grant that the universe knows for sure whether or not 91 is prime, that does not mean that I can know which of the two is true with an absolute 100% certainty. In that case, I can say that either the statement that 91 is prime is completely false, or the statement that 91 is not prime is completely false. And that statement could not be more true... provided that I am 100% certain that logic works the way I remember it. Which will start a circular argument that goes on forever. Again, there is a HUGE number of bits of evidence that 91 is not prime, but from (what I believe to be) a Bayesian point of view, I should still not allow myself to believe that with 100% certainty (even though in a normal conversation, I would say that the statement '91 is not prime' is true without further specifications. Allowing for theoretical uncertainty is one thing, but in reality, at a certain point it becomes impractical to always take this uncertainty into account).

As an aside, if we're arguing from the point of view of the universe being certain about something, we don't even know whether probabilities other than 0% and 100% are meaningful. Even quantum mechanics still allows for a globally deterministic universe (but not a local one, if we believe the results of the Bell test experiments).
