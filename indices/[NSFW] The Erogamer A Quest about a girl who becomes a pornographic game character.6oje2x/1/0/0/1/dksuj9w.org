Wouldn't a statement that falsely identifies two atoms be twice as wrong as one that falsely identifies one?

And wouldn't a statement that falsely identifies the path of those atoms over the past two seconds be twice as wrong as for one second?

(Not having studied philosophy or epistemology, I don't actually know if either of those things would be 'more wrong.' I'll assume they are until shown otherwise.)

So until we know that the universe contains finite [smallest_bits] and finite time, isn't there theoretically always a wronger statement made up of false identifications of different combinations of particles on different timescales?
