I don't know how to formally define this, but in most people there is the conception of "levels of being wrong". For example, I would say "bananas are vegetables" is less 'wrong' than saying "the Earth is flat". One is a minor classification error while the other statement is a deep and fundamental flaw. At least I think that's what Cinderella is thinking...
