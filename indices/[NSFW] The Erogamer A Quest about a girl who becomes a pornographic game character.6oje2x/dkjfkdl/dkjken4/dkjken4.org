I thought you argued against probabilities of 0% at some point? It should in principle be possible, but extremely, extremely, extremely unlikely that 91 is a prime (a huge number of people, as well as computers, would have to have miscalculated 7 times 13 many, many times, and any other calculation/theorem that would imply 91 is prime should have failed by some random fluke). Still, assuming this event has a non-zero probability, it should be less likely that 91 is a prime AND that the next coin I flip will turn up heads.

Granted, I don't even want to consider how unlikely it is that 91 is prime (probably somewhere around the probability that something is messing with our brains; the actual calculations failing by chance is probably several orders of magnitude lower). At the very least, it's a probability not worth considering for practical purposes.

Still, now I have to wonder, how do you decide (or how does one decide in general) between things that have a probability of being wrong, and things that are (hypothetically) 100% wrong?
