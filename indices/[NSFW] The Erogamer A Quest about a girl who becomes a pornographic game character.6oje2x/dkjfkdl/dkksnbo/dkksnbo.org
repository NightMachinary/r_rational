I'm not sure that is absolutely and always correct. In type theory falsehood represented by empty set:

[[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/falsehood]]

That is the set with zero cardinality. However it's concievable to think about "sets" (not ZF?)of negative (generalized)cardinality, which would represent degrees of emptiness and degree of falsehood.Could emptiness of the set can be seen as minimal length of the term defining the set?
