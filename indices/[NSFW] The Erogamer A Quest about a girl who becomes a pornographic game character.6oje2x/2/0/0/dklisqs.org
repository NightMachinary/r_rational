I mean, that's a bit like saying that Worm is irrational because Masters exist. It's an active force in the universe of the story, meaning the author is aware that it's a thing that must be /internally justified/. You're right that it makes for a somewhat less rational story though.

I did mean the label more along the lines of "[[/r/rational]]-themed" though. Lots of introspection and consideration of typical topics.
