(While not overly interested in the original fiction mentioned, when starting this more-interesting-seeming one I was seized by the urge to analyse the main character's choices from a preferably-rational pespective. Specifically:)

Episode 3: "Moving speed is slower than human running, but when you get close it sudden attacks with hight speed"[sic]

Reasoning process: "I have to attack it eleven times to kill it, it could kill me if it hits me one time, and if I kill it I'll be upgraded to a noteworthy threat in the eyes of those two scary powerful people who are currently completely overlooking me. On the other hand, it can't catch up with me if I run straight away from it while they're occupying each other!"

Option A: "Legs, do your thing!"

Edit: Also, [[http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=031004][a reference]] comes to mind.

Option B: "I have no choice but to fight!"

I find it difficult to follow the thought process that chooses Option B over Option A in that context.
