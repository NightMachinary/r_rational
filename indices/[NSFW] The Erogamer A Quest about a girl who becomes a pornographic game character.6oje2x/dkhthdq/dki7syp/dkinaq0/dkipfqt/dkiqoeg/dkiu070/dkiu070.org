I agree that the protagonist isn't perfectly rational and does quite a few rather stupid things. Justified during the time when his INT sin't that high though, but not later.

But I think it's still good. The plot/characters/worldbuilding are good and funny enough to make a very entertaining story, and it's rational enough to not make me bang my hand on the wall at characters' stupidity and keep me from enjoying the manhwa.
