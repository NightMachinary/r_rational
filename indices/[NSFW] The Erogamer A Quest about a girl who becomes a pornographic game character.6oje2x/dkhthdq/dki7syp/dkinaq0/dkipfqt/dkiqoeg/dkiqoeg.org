Hmm, good point (that he can't get out). At that point, had he already reached a 'wall' and been unable to exit? I don't remember that, but might have missed it somehow. If not, in his shoes I would have tried to get out under the assumption that I would unconsciously exit the same way I unconsciously entered.

Later: I blinked at a little at how he's repeatedly angsted about not having a teleport skill, then when he sees the skill book shop in Episode 35 buys summoning skills instead.
