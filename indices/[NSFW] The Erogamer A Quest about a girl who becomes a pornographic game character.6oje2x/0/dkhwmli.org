Huh, I'd discovered this independently and thought at one point that it fit quite nicely into the ratfic genre. Cool to see others thought the same.

The thing that really stood out to me when I first started reading it was the depth of the MC's thoughts about the true implications of a power like this. The EroGamer power, as it's manual describes, has this casual and fundamental control over literally everything. History is rewritten, personalities shift and change, all to serve Cindy's little Erogame experience, and this is not lost on Cindy. It's surprisingly hard to describe this in detail, but people not shy about erotic fiction should absolutely give this a look just for that part.

One other thing about this is depth of Cindy's self-loathing for her original overweight and unattractive self. Like, she literally considered herself barely a person, and when she first obtained the power and put points into her physical attractiveness stat, she is viscerally desperate to get more XP so she can level up and get more. The centrality of sex in her personal self-esteem is, for me, the primary emotional crux of this story, as she receives this incredible and terrifying power that knows is unfair that other people didn't get it. Like, I am plenty sex-positive and definitely agree that it is severely overly stigmatized and shamed, but Cindy takes that much further.
