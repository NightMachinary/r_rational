It wouldn't have anything to do with rationality if she'd just been honest with herself and said something like “I have a rape fetish \ fantasy and so I want my first “real” sex to be arranged accordingly”. But what she does instead is come up with this convoluted chain of reasoning that, as far as I see, doesn't make any sense, only to justify her sexual preferences to herself.

How and why would saying yes --- and clearing things out with the partner about the sex being mutually consensual --- be /sad/? Why would saying yes mean that she'd been demoted back to the person she was two days ago? How would saying yes mean that she was /asking/ her partner to fuck her? Why is it the only way she is /allowed/ to lose her virginity? And so on and so forth with the rest of the parts I've quoted and some more that I've left out.

  she just happens to have very 'warped' values after living with obesity and sexual repression.

It's not her values that are warped, it's her chains of reasoning. Fixing which to work in a logically valid order is a major part of being a rational person.
