It gets a good deal worse than that. Have you ever read a short story called "By His Bootstraps"?

In short, a man gets bought to the distant future by a guy with a time machine. After a fair amount of stuff happening, in short, it turns out that the man who operated the time machine to get him there is his own future self - that is, his future self was only there to use the time machine because his younger self had been pulled into the future.

That's not just a matter of the paradox creating something out of nothing. That's the paradox creating /itself/ out of nothing.
