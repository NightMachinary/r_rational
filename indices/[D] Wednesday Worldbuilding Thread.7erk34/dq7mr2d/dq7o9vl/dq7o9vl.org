  One of the ways that authors of time travel stories try to avoid paradoxes is with "stable time loops"
#+end_quote

This is how physics works. That is, if time travel turns out to be possible (which I doubt), it would be within a single stable timeline. Quantum physics ensures this.

  Where did the $100 in your account actually come from?
#+end_quote

So, if this were an actual hundred dollar bill that you give to yourself in the past, this wouldn't be possible. Each iteration of the loop (from the bill's perspective) would add more wear and tear until it breaks down. It's not stable.

But you're putting it in to a bank, and then withdrawing? Fine. The actual object moved into the past already existed before the timeloop and will exist after. The only complaint is that it simultaneously exists twice within the loop. Of course, the whole premise of time-travel is that a thing moves into its own past, hence simultaneously existing twice.

  If causality runs in a loop, then that chain of causality is independent of the rest of the universe.
#+end_quote

That's why it's called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve][closed time-like loop]].

If time-travel is possible (in the sense of people being able to travel into their own past), such causal loops are almost certain to arise, if only to prevent an intelligent actor from actually carrying out his plan of killing his own grandfather.
