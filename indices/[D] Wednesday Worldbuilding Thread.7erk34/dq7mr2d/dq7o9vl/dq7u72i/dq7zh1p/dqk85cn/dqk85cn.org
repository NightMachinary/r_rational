About that I have been thinking about time loops recently , and all the dangers of trying to exploit closed time lopps to get what you want( generaly its horrible dangerous and you shouldn't try) , and when its safe to start a loop ( mostly in the cases where you can prepare you plan outside the time loop otherwise everything gets acasual and my brain refuses to continue working on the problem). I have a really long document almost written about it , but haveng gotten to actually finish it and post it here ( or maybe on the off topic thread , I'm not sure where to put that kind of thing ) . In general i asume the case of a randomly selected solution from the solution space ( depending on probability, a truly randomly selected solution makes the universe work in a really crazy way), which is what would happen from an observer's perspective in a many world's universe where "worlds" that don't lead to self consistent loops just fail to exist.
