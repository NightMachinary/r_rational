  In general i asume the case of a randomly selected solution from the solution space ( depending on probability, a truly randomly selected solution makes the universe work in a really crazy way), which is what would happen from an observer's perspective in a many world's universe

The situation is actually a whole lot worse than you're imagining. All possible time-loops will actually interfere with each other, to some degree. You can see this by imagining EM waves passing through the time-like curve. Just working with the curve as a boundary condition for the wave equation, you can see this will be much more complicated than the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment][double-slit experiment]]. That said, it does appear to be intrinsically solvable. I've seen references to work that purports to solve the problem on very small scales.

  or maybe on the off topic thread , I'm not sure where to put that kind of thing

Worldbuilding, I think, is appropriate.
