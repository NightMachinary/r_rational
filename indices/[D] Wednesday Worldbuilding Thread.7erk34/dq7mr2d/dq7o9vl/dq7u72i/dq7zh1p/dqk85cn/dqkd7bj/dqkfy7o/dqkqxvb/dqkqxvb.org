In terms of fiction, self-consistent time-loop stories are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt][older than dirt]]. I am using the term loosely here, where I consider prophesy a kind of time travel where only information travels to the past.

However, they broadly classify into two distinct types: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus][self-fulfilling]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra][unavoidable]].

In modern day time travel stories, we have two plot structures:

- Person travels to the past; attempts to prevent something; ends up causing it in the first place
- Person travels to the past; tries to change something; fails to make any change to the historical record

But a great many more stories are possible. I'm hopeful that we'll see more complex stories being told in the future.
