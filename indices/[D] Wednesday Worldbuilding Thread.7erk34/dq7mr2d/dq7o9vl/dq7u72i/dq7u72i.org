  That's why it's called a closed time-like loop

Interesting; thanks for pointing that out.

Supposing you have a time machine that creates these closed time-like curves:

- Say you have a battery with a 10% charge. Your future self gives you the same battery, fully charged. You transfer energy from the future battery to the preexisting one, leaving the former with slightly less than 10% charge, and drop off the fully charged one in the past.

  Where does the extra energy come from? You can't use it for anything without breaking the loop, but would it's inexplicable existence violate conservation of energy anyway?

- Say your future self hands you a note. You copy the words on the note to another paper, and give it to your past self. What does the note say?
