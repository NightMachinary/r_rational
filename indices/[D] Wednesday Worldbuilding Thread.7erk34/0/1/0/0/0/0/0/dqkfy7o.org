In the actual thing I used the example of having multiple universes and the ones that aren't consistent being destroyed , since I knew that an actual quantum universe is different from that in ways I don't completely understand yet ,and that probably makes room for other exploits with quantum computing, which makes the whole thing a even worse mess. the choosing a random posibility is good because for the purposes of exploiting its almost identical( assuming you don't cause the loop from inside another loop or itself and that the loop cant affect you when planing it) to actually repeating some events+ some random element(most likely whole quantum randomness) until some condition is fulfilled , which is another common situation in fiction ( and in the Saturday munchkinism thread) and its easier to think about. I'll probably put it in next week's thread ,if I don't get lazy , after making it more coherent and readable. In general I found that trying to exploit time loops for anything minimally complicated(or even something relatively simple like factoring small numbers) even in ideal conditions is a bad idea at best , and suicidal at worst .
