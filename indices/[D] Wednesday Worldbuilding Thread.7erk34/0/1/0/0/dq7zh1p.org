  Where does the extra energy come from? You can't use it for anything without breaking the loop, but would it's inexplicable existence violate conservation of energy anyway?
#+end_quote

Any extra energy that seems to exist contrary to conservation laws comes from the timeline curve itself. Presumably, it will have originally come from the machine that creates the curve in the first place. There is no known physical mechanism for creating such a curve, however: it would have to already exist within spacetime.

  Say your future self hands you a note. You copy the words on the note to another paper, and give it to your past self. What does the note say?

It's probably blank. The actual message will depend on a lot of things. Are you the sort of person to follow through on a self-fullfilling prophecy? Is this a loop you're setting up for yourself with intent to generate a paradox? Alternatively, perhaps this causal loop exists in order to prevent someone else from creating a paradox.

Consider the quantum multiverse hypothesis (where each potential action both happens and doesn't happen; a separate universe for each). In the normal "model", there is a separate universe for every combination of outcomes that could occur. Once you allow time travel, only those universes that are consistent could actually exist. However, it also becomes a lot more complicated because there are universes in which all sorts of causal loops spontaneously occur, seemingly of their own volition.

A concrete example: Suppose someone goes back in time to kill his own grandfather. You get a note from yourself telling you that person is attempting murder, so you call the police, who intervene and prevent him from carrying out the deed. Now, I don't think this is the simplest way resolve the paradox (after all, the note just has to get you to interfere; the reason doesn't have to be accurate), and nature would pick the simplest one. Unless you subscribe to the quantum multiverse hypothesis, in which case all solutions happen.
