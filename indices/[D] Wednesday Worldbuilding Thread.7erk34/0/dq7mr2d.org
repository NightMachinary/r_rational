So... time travel paradoxes.

- One of the ways that authors of time travel stories try to avoid paradoxes is with "stable time loops"- time travel where anything you'll do in the past has already happened, and altering the past is impossible. While this avoids the grandfather paradox, I think it necessarily causes a different paradox- it seems to create things out of nothing.

  Suppose you have a stable time loop time machine. You withdraw $100 in cash from your bank, give it to yourself a week ago, and then past-you deposits it. Where did the $100 in your account actually come from? You might be able to do the same thing with a million or a billion dollars, even if you're flat broke before and after the time loop.

  I think this problem exists whenever some chain of causality stretches from the start of the loop, through the end, and back to the start. If causality runs in a loop, then that chain of causality is independent of the rest of the universe.

- Another way authors avoid paradoxes is with multiple timelines- when you "time travel", you're actually entering a parallel universe that for some reason is identical to the past or future. This does a much better job of avoiding paradoxes in general, but I think a variation of the same problem can still crop up.

  Say you travel the future, withdraw $100, return to your own timeline, and deposit it. In this future timeline was an identical version of you who did the same thing- traveling to a timeline where yet another you did the same thing, and so on. Since each timeline would be identical, there would seem to be an infinite number of them, each taking money from another. So, you have a kind of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel][Hilbert's Grand Bank]], with an infinite number of $100 accounts and one $200 account, but, like in the previous example, seemingly no causal origin of the money.
