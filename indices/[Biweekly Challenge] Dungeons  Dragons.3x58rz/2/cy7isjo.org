Story takes place roughly 1500 years after traditional D&D, but it operates under the 5e system if it were realistically constrained. (It is also set 15 years after my entry on "the Matrix". Even though I haven't published any of my web serial yet, the events of this short story take place during the second arc. I was just too excited to let yet another weekly challenge pass me by!)

/edit: I've been sick for the past week and I'm Christmas vacation with my family. After some of the initial feedback, I realized that my 'short story' is lacking an ending, so consider the story only about 2/3rds complete at this point. */edit 2: a few introductory components to the characters were added and I wrote a real ending
