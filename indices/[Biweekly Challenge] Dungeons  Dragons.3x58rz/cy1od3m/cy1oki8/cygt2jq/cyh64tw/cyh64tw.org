When I first wrote this, the idea was that he decided on the flow chart because the descent into evil was gradual, and he would be able to hold on to the plan through sheer will, especially since it's not really a Good/Evil thing. But last week I realized that there is a better explanation. Harbouring the Mother Cyst does not protect against being infected with a normal cyst, so he made one of his monsters infect him and now uses Suggestion on himself to maintain the obsession with the flowchart. He couldn't use it to force himself to be Good, since Suggestion is limited and using the spells is actively corroding his moral compass, but maintaining an obsession he wants to maintain is within the scope of the spell.

It felt inappropriate to change the text more than halfway through the contest, so I left it as is.
