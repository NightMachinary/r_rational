I'm on Chrome as well and it works fine. If you have RES you can view source to read it or disable the subreddit stylesheet.

If you don't have RES you can right-click on the spoiler and press "Inspect" then read the HTML. The spoiler is the title attribute of the =<a href="#s" title="..."></a>= tag.
