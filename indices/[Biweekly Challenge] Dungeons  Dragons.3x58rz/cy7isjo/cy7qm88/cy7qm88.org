This feels less like a story and more like a worldbuilding infodump. It also doesn't end in a satisfying place. The runes are also bothersome -- they are clearly important, but I can't read them. I have a feeling that this is just a special font and that if I wanted to go out on the net (or do some basic cryptography) and search I could figure out what it says. That's too much to ask for a short story though.
