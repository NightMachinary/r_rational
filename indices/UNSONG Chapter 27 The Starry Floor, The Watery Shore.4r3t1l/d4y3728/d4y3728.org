Simeon is now the least trustworthy character in Unsong. Less trustworthy than Thaumiel or Satan. Interestingly, the biblical origin of his name sometimes is "he who listens [to the words of God]" and sometimes "there is sin". So it would be a great name for a traitor, but also for a theodician.

(I was just going through Pratchett's Maskerade recently, and the practice of telling a person's character by testing the firmness of their handshake and looking deeply into their eyes is remarked upon repeatedly in that book; want to guess how trustworthy the guy described as "giving [...] a firm handshake and looking [...] squarely in the eye" is?)

Also, the Mass-energy converter pun is /bad/ and Scott should be ashamed of himself. I laughed, a lot.

Finally, colours of sail:

Red - Normal wind\\
Orange - Placebo\\
Yellow - Kabbalah\\
Green - Singing?\\
Blue - Prayer\\
Violet - Angel\\
Black - The Comet King (?)

I myself can't really reliably tell Indigo from Blue/Violet interface, so I'm totally fine with not having an Indigo sail.

The Comet King sail seems like the sort of plot hook where it will ultimately be driven by Cometspawn, maybe.
