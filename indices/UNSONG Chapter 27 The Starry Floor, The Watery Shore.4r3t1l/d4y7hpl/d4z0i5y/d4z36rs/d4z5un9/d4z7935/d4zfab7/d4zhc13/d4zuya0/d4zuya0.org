This is a metaethical problem, one I don't expect to be easily (or ever, potentially) solved. Remember the post Scott linked you too? I fall pretty squarely oblivion side of this issue, to the extent that I'd think a significant fraction of humanity would be better off having never existed. (Though like most antinatalist I don't actually think we should kill them, and I am uncertain whether they would be better off /having stopped existing/ (as opposed to having never existed) which is subtly different).
