Alright, I'll stop being facetious.

The problem with this line or reasoning is exactly the same with any argument that deals with tiny probabilities: you are so focused on the values /inside/ the argument that you neglect considerations /outside/ of it. I don't know what you'd consider to be the chance of hell's residents achieving heaven, but =1/3^^^3= would seem to be somewhere in that ballpark. Tell me, weighing every assumption and prior that when into your calculation of this number, do you honestly think the conjunction is anywhere near =1/3^^^3=, let alone less than it? I'd sooner expect problems in your metaethical theory, or model of reality, or /literally anything else/ than seriously consider any probability outputted that exceeds the probability I assign to the conjunction of all my assumptions in the first place.

*Edit*: you know what? I just remembered this is fictional world, so there is no uncertainty about the ontics of reality. Disregard my whole position.
