Two days on and I'm actually finding myself impatient for the next chapter. Any time I see Superman referenced anywhere I get a tiny jolt of excitement as my brain subconsciously makes the connection before I realise what it's excited about and that it'll be days before the next one and will continue to be a week between each one...

Congratulations I guess!
