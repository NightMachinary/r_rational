On my personal comments, I like the point of view of Lex, but I think by changing Lois's inner thoughts you bias us further against Superman which I think is, perhaps not unfair, but overdone. I think that Lois, or someone in this fiction, should have a differing view from Lex instead of it being an echo chamber. If Lois was similar to canon Lois we would get the contrast of Lex and Lois's opinion on Superman instead of both of them disliking him.

I mean it doesn't have to be Lois now that you've wrote her in like that but I think it better demonstrates Lex if he doesn't have like minded people as in the Superman comics, where all his points would still apply but he would be alone instead, even the people who meet superman disagreeing with him (because of course that doesn't change his points but it creates more of a likely scenario for people in that position), but of course I don't know your intention with the story but that's kind of my theory comments.
