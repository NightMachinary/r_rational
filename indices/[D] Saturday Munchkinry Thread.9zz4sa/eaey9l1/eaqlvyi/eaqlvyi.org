You should play Deponia Doomsday. To this day it's the piece of media* I've found with the most intertwined time-travel elements that manages to retain (as far as I've given it thought) complete self-consistency, and that's really something because it mixes four or five completely different timetravel styles, from closed causal-less loops to memory-retaining resets to timeflow-differential timeportals routing through interim time, and they interact with one another to hilarious results.

*Not counting that one RTS game whose name I can't recall right now.
