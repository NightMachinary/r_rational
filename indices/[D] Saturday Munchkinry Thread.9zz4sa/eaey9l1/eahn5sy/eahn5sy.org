You're clearly enthusiastic about this, which is awesome, but I see a few problems.

First, plotwise: with the exception of Ocean The Mother, none of your AIs are necessarily at cross-purposes. Superfun and eudaimonia are pretty close to the same thing if you consider suffering to not include things like reading sad stories, and moderate Islam is perfectly compatible with those as well. The goals are even relatively aligned, or at the very least would take minimal resources from each other once full control is established.

So, it seems to me that rather than immediately moving into 4-way war causing massive losses and the very real potential for destruction for each AI, Ocean The Mother would be targeted by a coalition of the other 3, who merge into one entity.

Second, tone: I get the feeling from this writeup that you're focusing more on the details of "how does this happen" rather than "why do we care". Hopefully that's just because of the nature of the advice you're looking for, but do be careful to write a story rather than a telling of events.
