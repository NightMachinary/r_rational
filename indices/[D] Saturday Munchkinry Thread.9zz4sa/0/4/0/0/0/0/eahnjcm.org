  Iron doesn't increase your mass, just your weight. The author [[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/6-bands-of-mourning-release-party/#e327][noted]] that iron messes with the Higgs field in some way that changes how gravity interacts with you.

That just says there is Higgs field stuff going on, not that iron only changes weight. If that were true, you wouldn't be able to use it to make yourself a better anchor for Allomantic pushing/pulling, which we know you can.

There is also a different [[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/95/#e838][WoB]] that says feruchemic iron is distinct from lashing (which is explicit gravity manipulation).
