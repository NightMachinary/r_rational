Feruchemical metalminds are locked to their owner*. There are also limits to how much each metalmind can hold. The "always walk around at 1/4th weight" is mostly because there are always opportunities to use that weight, and the metalminds need constant replenishment to be topped off. Even if they didn't, going around at 1/4th weight has benefits, so it makes sense to always keep enough room in the metalminds to do that.

*Though /technically/ there are hacks around this using other parts of the magic system, so far unseen in the books but definitely implied by the appendicies and maybe with knowledge unknown to the characters
