Is there a cap to how quickly/much someone can burn at once? It seem trivial to bootstrap up to an infinite amount of attribute if you're a compounder, with the only limit being how high of density the limit of a metal is. Since you mentioned someone living 24/7 storing 1/4th their mass, I assume that density is "very large".

The obvious problem is with astronomical weight. If the magic automatically reinforces your body to be able to sustain your mass, and you can store functionally infinite amounts of mass piecewise, the first time someone tries to pulse up to relativistic mass for a fraction of a second they would 1) crack the mantle 2) become a fusion bomb. This has obvious consequences on the setting.

Just ballparking, but if the guy is able to store 1/4th of his mass (let's say 25kg) for a year that's already 788,923,149 kg/s. Even with an upper bound for density and rate, that's /a lot/ of mass. I imagine kingdoms would simply have monks sitting around storing as much as they can, and then pull a week's worth of mass in an hour and run around with 168x normal durability and momentum.

If the metals aren't locked to their owner then the other obvious hack is to have a morbidly obese person storing as much weight as they can, and then distribute the metal to a platoon of little people. They would get much more proportional value per kg stored due to smaller mass and a smaller area.
