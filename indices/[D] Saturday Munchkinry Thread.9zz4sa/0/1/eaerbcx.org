First of all, it's worth noting that iron feruchemy is dependent on reference frame. Sanderson has noted [[https://wob.coppermind.net/adv_search/?query=iron+momentum][several times]] that using iron to change mass preserves momentum. But a magical change in mass can't actually preserve momentum in all reference frames. So the power has to select a frame. In the books, it's established that powers anchor themselves to any sufficiently-massive nearby object, and we know that trains are big enough, but horse-drawn carriages are not.

So what can we do with this power?

- *Enhanced combat grappling:* This is another one that actually happens in the books. Grab onto someone, and lean into them as you massively increase your weight. Their bones will shatter beneath you.

- *Fly under your own power:* A normally weighted human needs [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syJq10EQkog][ridiculously flimsy constraptions]] to fly under their own power. but an iron feruchemist can make themselves as light as a bird. Depending on how the strength scales with mass, it might be possible to use a Da Vinci Style Flying machine. Worst case, you can increase mass to build up speed in a glider, like a more exciting version of your ferris wheel example.

- *Brake:* Increase your mass as much as possible at the last possible moment before impact. This will decrease your speed. Note that you still need the same force to actually stop, but hopefully the increased durability and increased impact-time will keep you from splatting. The Mistborn Adventure Game notes that iron twinborns are "Notorious for smashing themselves flat", presumably from cannonball shenanigans.

- *Boost:* Get on a horse or anything else small enough not to anchor your momentum. Get up to speed, and dump 80% of your weight into your ironminds. [[https://imgur.com/rMBOrcN][You'll shoot forwards at 5 times the speed.]]

- *Boost!* Find a moving object large enough to anchor your momentum, like a train, or falling chunk of stone. Stand close to it, and decrease your weight to 20%. [[https://imgur.com/e6Kdzwp][You will be launched in the opposite direction at 4 times the speed of the anchor.]]

- *BOOOOST!* If a momentum anchor is moving past you, you can also increase your weight to be accelerate in the /same/ direction as the anchor in a process equivalent to braking. Combine this and the above effect, and it's possible to create [[https://imgur.com/ivLhuvH][reactionless propulsion ships]].

Iron compounding allows for these tricks to be enhanced, but it's difficult to think of applications where being heavy for an extended period of time is super important. Here's the only one I can think of:

- *Chaining reference frames:* If the criteria for anchoring powers is just based on mass and doesn't have any size requirement, then an iron compounder can serve as the anchor point for other powers, such as time bubbles. Imagine a bubble of accelerated time speeding around, kicking up dust in its wake. Or what about a chain of iron skimmers boosting off each other: The speed at each stage would increase exponentially, and the only limits would be the reflexes of the suicidal maniacs involved.
