  In a sense, even if allomancy conserves momentum feruchemy kinda sidesteps that. Wait you store weight or mass?

Yup, you can absolutely sidestep the conservation of momentum problem using feruchemy. In the story itself it is exclusively refered to as storing weight, I think, but it quite clearly is supposed to be mass.

  How small/far away can be the iron? can I pull on a person's blood, or at the earth core?

Don't think we have an upper limit on range, but the lower limit for size is quite small. Powdered metal can be used to confuse someone using allomancy because each grain of metal gets its own line.

Metal that is inside someones body is immune to allomancy though, so bloodbending isn't happening under normal circumstances.
