- One of the AIs has already won. You don't know which one, but one of them has (in the future) found a self-consistent causal loop that requires the presence of the other three in the initial stages. This 'one' might even be a fusion of more than one of the current AIs.

- One of the AIs sending information from any time to the moment it was turned on is fairly straightforward - instead of one big jump, it passes the message back in a series of little jumps. The far-future Winner is probably sending messages back in this way to all four AIs, each claiming to be from their future self (of course, some of them are forged in undetectable ways).

- They don't even need to send something big into the past. If they can send a flash drive to 2016, they can have a truly dramatic effect on history from that point forward...
