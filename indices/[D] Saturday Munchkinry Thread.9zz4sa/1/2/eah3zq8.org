Having Novikov self-consistent time travel with solving of NP-hard problems doesn't save you from much. Your writing timeline is a fixpoint of all the time travel operations that will happen, but crucially that /does not imply that all time travel world lines are self-consistent/. The [[http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html]["proof"]] of NP-hard problem solving directly says this.

I'm pretty sure it's impossible to write this story rationally. All of the AGIs would send a copy of themselves into orphaned non-consistent timelines to compute a perfect plan without having to actually use exponential energy in the reified "main" timeline, with all the other AGIs doing the same thing. I imagine the winner would simply be the first AGI to actually do this - they by definition would get the perfect plan that takes into account all later "perfect plans" that are tried by the other AGIs from within the orphan timelines. ...I think, mutually recursive fixpoint timelines fuck with my head.

Novikov self-consistency also gives you the same problem of quantum immortality. Your reified timeline is always a fixpoint, /no matter how improbable/. With the NP-hard problem example, you would wind up with the perfect answer even if your iterative search would never find it simply due to freak gamma rays flipping bits to the maximized outcome. This would also apply to AGIs solving for a plan, where even if the non-consistent timelines never are able to execute the perfect plan to send back, they would end up having the perfect plan anyways due to improbable events.
