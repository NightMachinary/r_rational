I'd also be up for reading this!

My first thought for munchkinning Novikov self-consistency would be that you'd have a lot more freedom to alter the past if the effects will only become visible at a later date. If you know what happens in an area, the only changes that could be made would be those that would evade your observations.

So, for example, an AI might maintain an ace in the hole by studiously ignoring a particular region so that it can send something back to that area to prepare from the start of the sensor blackout, essentially keeping the contents secret from itself so that it has the freedom to fill in that gap with something useful when the time comes.

How would that work from the perspective of another AI? If they were to observe the isolated region, they'd know ahead of time what preparation their opponent had made, and would be able to respond to that in turn with their own cache. I think it follows that the majority of warfare between the AIs would be information warfare: minimising the information available to opponents and maximising the information known to oneself.

What would this look like? I'm picturing the AIs sending back agents to archive as much information as possible and set up sensors to detect any projects of their adversaries. At the same time, they'd want to establish footholds in the areas that would be hardest to study. For example, sending an expert in underwater habitats back to secretly establish a hidden base in the Mariana trench that could reveal itself after you send them back.

You could also rewrite history in a sense by falsifying information. Say there's a warehouse you'd like to send something back to, but any changes there would have shown up on the internet at the time. If you first send an agent with a collection of zero-days back and instruct them to overwrite any articles on the internet with the ones from your archives. Then you'd be able to send something back there, having successfully reduced your state of knowledge about the warehouse.

In other words, a very literal version of "Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past."

Further thoughts:

Why do the AIs care about earth? Obviously, there are humans on it that are relevant to their terminal goals, but if you can send stuff back to arbitrary locations, why not colonise other planets? Causal loops would be made easier due to the limited surveillance. If range is a limitation, they could still take advantage of asteroids and comets that pass close by the Earth from 2007. Similarly, if they can produce technology that can survive it, why not start seeding factories below the Earth's surface? It might be that anything capable of self-replication or mass production would be too large to send.

You mentioned that 2007 is the furthest back one can feasibly go. I'd assume the AIs would try to go back further by setting up time machines at earlier points in the past if they could, so if you haven't considered how to prevent that I'd suggest that the machines require components and power that would not be possible to produce in secret in a 50-year timescale, or else the AIs already fought eachother to a standstill over the destinations that would enable that and destroyed their viability in the process.

With regards to the technology they could deploy from 2007, it might be worth considering how much of our present technology a single agent could replicate in secret for their own purposes if they were sent back to 1957. Software would probably be easier than hardware, since chip fabrication requires high-end tools, but with a few zero-days you could probably subvert bitcoin miners and have them run a narrow AI produced by a 2050s programmer, assuming they knew enough about the entire stack to code it from scratch.

A lot of the usual time travel exploits wouldn't work, since lottery winners and stock market behaviour is recorded. If you went back with Satoshi Nakamoto's private key, you wouldn't be able to do anything with it.
