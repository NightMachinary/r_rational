For a full Mistborn, there's an alloy called Duralumin which, when burned with another metal, instantly consumes all of itself and that metal for a massive power spike. You'll have to consume more of the metal if you want to use it again, and doing that is really hard when fighting against another iron or steel burner, who will just take your flakes out of your hands.
