There's a limit, but a stomach volume is quite a lot. I really don't know what kind of densities examples the book uses or what speeds, which limits munchkining a lot...

There's also the question of the limits of that. Can you burn metal only from your stomach? Large intestine? Small intestine? Mouth? Blood? What happens with a stomach shunt or feeding tube?
