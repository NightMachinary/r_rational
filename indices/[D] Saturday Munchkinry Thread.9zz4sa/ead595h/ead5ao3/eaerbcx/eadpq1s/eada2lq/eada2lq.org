Well, the first thing I'd look for is how to store "feruchemy skill" and to create a positive feedback loop, but it looks like iron is not suited for it, pity. Maybe once you have infinite energy, with a liiittle engineering you can get to nuclear fusion up to iron, and then you can use the iron to do compounding, voila' infinite iron and feruchemic power.

I assume no magician is good enough to play with relativistic masses/speeds?

Something fun to do with iron would be to cannonball yourself, you would first get very light, pull yourself toward your target and get very heavy on landing.

In a sense, even if allomancy conserves momentum feruchemy kinda sidesteps that. Wait you store weight or mass?

How small/far away can be the iron? can I pull on a person's blood, or at the earth core?
