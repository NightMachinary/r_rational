I wonder if a feruchemist could isolate himself and burn store so much zinc as to cause heartattacks.

I don't remember the time bubble chemicals (reading the wiki, never read after the first three), but I feel like ferochemist could age a person to death or rust a whole lot of people. The whole impenetrable bubble sounds prone to a lot of exploits on its own. Do it canyon exits to make a drought then flood. Split people in half. Walk on air. Make tiny time bubbles in front of people moving really fast.
