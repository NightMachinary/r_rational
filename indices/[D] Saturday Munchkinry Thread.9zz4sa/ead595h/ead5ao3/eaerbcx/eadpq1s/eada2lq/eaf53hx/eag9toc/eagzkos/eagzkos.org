The OP mentions that it strengthens your body to be able to support your new mass. If your skin and bones become strong enough to hold up N times your mass, then they will also be strong enough to resist bludgeoning and cutting.

I'm also not really sure how this argument is supposed to hold weight. Density is just mass / volume. Using Iron increases your mass without increasing your volume. By definition, that's increasing your density.
