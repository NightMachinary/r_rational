I've been thinking about this for a while and not sure this leads to a self-consistent model.

Doubling /weight/ but not the normal force that you feel in response would need something like "you gain 2x gravitational inertia, and inertia up to 2x counter gravitational inertia is halved in your local reference frame". I can't think of something else that would give the correct behavior.

This feels like it contradicts examples given in the OP, though: standing around would be modeled correctly, but being accelerated upwards in an elevator leads to your legs snapping from having to bear your /effective/ weight's acceleration, since you are only negating up to your "iron inertia" worth.

If instead you feel halved normal force even under acceleration, and so can stand in elevators, then you'd take only half force from sword upsweeps or being shot from below.
