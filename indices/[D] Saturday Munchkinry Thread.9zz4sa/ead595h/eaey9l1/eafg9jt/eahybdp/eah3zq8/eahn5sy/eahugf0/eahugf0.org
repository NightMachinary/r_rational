  So, it seems to me that rather than immediately moving into 4-way war causing massive losses and the very real potential for destruction for each AI, Ocean The Mother would be targeted by a coalition of the other 3, who merge into one entity.

They don't discover each other immediately, and by the time Sarimanok discovers OTM and OpenMind, they were duking it out already. Esrafil and Sarimanok don't discover each other until really late into the conflict, both having deduced the existence of more powerful AGIs because of the worldwide Internet blackout.

But yeah, all this is moot if I can't find a fundamental reason why they wouldn't want to cooperate other than my intuition that coexisting with gods who can potentially become many times smarter than you is /really problematic/. I think it's just unbelievable that you can cooperate successfully with sentient beings to whom you are a mere fly, just as the survival of every other species on this planet is entirely dependent on our whim. That's not to say it's /unrealistic/, which remains to be seen, but I'm betting if we work out the game theory it's not gonna happen.

  I get the feeling from this writeup that you're focusing more on the details of "how does this happen" rather than "why do we care".

You are correct. My primary audience is not [[/r/rational][r/rational]] but students in my own uni. As to why, well, that's a discussion for another time. But I do see your point and it eats me up as well. As I mentioned I don't write stories /at all/. This is my first attempt at doing that and the Eight Deadly Words breathe down on my neck every time I write.

I have tried my best to make the characters drive the story than the other way around and for the most part, I feel I've been faithful to that rule. But the uncertainty remains, though I feel that it's premature for me to judge the work before it is done.
