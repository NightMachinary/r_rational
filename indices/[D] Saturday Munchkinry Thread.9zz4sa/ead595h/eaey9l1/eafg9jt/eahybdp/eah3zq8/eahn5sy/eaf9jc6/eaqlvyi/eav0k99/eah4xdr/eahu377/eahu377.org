  Proportional to what? What is the amount of energy a function of? Distance through time, or object mass? Volume? Probability of success?

Mass-energy of the package. The precision of the space-time point to which it would be sent is inversely proportional to de Broglie wavelength, so you can't precisely direct electrons in electrid grids of the past.

There's also the EM bombardment issue so electronics (and biological entities with electrochemical nervous systems) have to be encased in Faraday cages.
