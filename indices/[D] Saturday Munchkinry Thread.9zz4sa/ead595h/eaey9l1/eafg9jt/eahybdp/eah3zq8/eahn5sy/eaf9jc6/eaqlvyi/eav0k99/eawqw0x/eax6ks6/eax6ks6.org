Try this [[https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/][webpage]]. It links to lectures where he talks about the same stuff as in the book so you can just skim for what you want. The textbook is a little more filled out, but you don't really need to buy it if you just read the lectures. I would have just posted a link to the lectures instead of to the Amazon book, but I forgot about them until now.
