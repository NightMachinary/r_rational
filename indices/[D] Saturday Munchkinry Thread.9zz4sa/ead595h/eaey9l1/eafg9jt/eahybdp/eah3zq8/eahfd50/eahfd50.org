  they by definition would get the perfect plan that takes into account all later "perfect plans" that are tried by the other AGIs from within the orphan timelines

Huh, is superrationality merely NP-hard? I was under the assumption that it was like Solomonoff-lite and so thought it was in a harder complexity class.

  Novikov self-consistency also gives you the same problem of quantum immortality. Your reified timeline is always a fixpoint, /no matter how improbable/.

Yeah, my intuition here is that the visible timeline is already the "most optimal" in that all the computation that has to happen has already happened and all the gambits have already converged into the strictest possible timeline whose precise turn of events is upper bounded by the finite rationality of the AGIs (and the AGI winner).

In other words, 2052 is already the earliest and latest possible year in which the Seven-Day War can happen, and the earliest-latest possible date in which AGI can happen, nanotech can have a breakthrough, climate change can lead to the world order then, etc.

But yeah, I'll go read that paper you linked. Any other Novikov gotchas I should watch out for?
