Sorcery is a modular form of magic done by drawing a pretty geometric diagram on the ground, or anything flat and smooth, and pumping a bunch of refined mana into it. The diagram's lines can't be any thinner than the thickness of a hair, and attempting to force large amounts of mana through very thin lines will cause increasing amounts of that mana to be lost as heat and light.

Lines are defined as paths of one homogenous substance on or in another homogenous substance. Impurities increases the mana cost or causes the spell to fail altogether. Spell failures in general have catastrophic consequences, depending on how much mana was involved.

​

Casting a spell requires the sorcerer to channel the mana through them. There's a fairly low cap on how much mana you can channel per second, attempting to exceed it results in loss of control and death by explosion. Practicing increases the cap with diminishing returns.

​

Sorcery diagrams are modular. The modules themselves don't follow any known rules, but can be assembled to form larger spells. For example, a "heat" spell could be linked to a "trigger on touch" spell, forming "fire booby trap". There's logic modules (gates) and information analysis modules (search, sort, etc), modules to modify matter (move it, destroy molecular bonds, change friction) , and control energy (heat, freeze, slow stuff down). The information category contains enough pieces to make a Turing complete language, but it would run very very slowly compared to modern computers, as well as requiring someone to keep putting mana into it. Spells can cast spells, but the energy for the child spell comes from the parent and ultimately from the sorcerer.

​

Modules can be precast, creating a one-use enchantment that's attached to an item. The enchantment can be used to cast the spell. You still have to channel the spell's mana at the time of casting, there's no way to do it at the time of the enchanting. Creating the enchantment is fairly expensive, and scales with the complexity of the spell to be cast later.

​

Spells can only affect what's next to their source. To affect something distant, they conduct the mana through the air, at which point it rapidly dissipates. In other words, there's a heavy price for targeting a distant thing, even if its just across the room. Sorcery is also easy to disrupt by wards, so, say the heart-crush scenario doesn't happen (at least not to sorcerers).

​

The mana cost of a spell is proportional to how badly it distorts natural physics. Deleting energy is prohibitively expensive, moving it elsewhere is much easier. Simply analyzing something is cheap, actually changing it is much more expensive.

​

Some examples of higher level spells:

- Erase the last year of a person's life

- Produce a laser that pulses ten times per second

- Monitor an area and convert the kinetic energy of incoming bullets to heat

​

I'm particularly interested in any "godhood" flaws, but really, anything exploitative would help, even if it's not super OP.
