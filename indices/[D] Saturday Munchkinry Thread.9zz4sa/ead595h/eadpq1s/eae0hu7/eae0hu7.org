There are limits to how much metal you can ingest, because if you ingest metal and don't burn it, you get heavy metal poisoning. Presumably, the more you ingest the quicker you have to use the extra. It's been a few years since I read it, but they might have talked about being saturated. However, they can get a metal that lets them burn all their reserves quickly.
