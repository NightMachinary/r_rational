*Mistborn Munchkinry Mini-Series*

Spoiler note: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves (there is at least one plot twist for the first book that will be spoiled by this post), so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

I'd like to do a sort of mini-series of munchkinry around the magic present in the Mistborn world. In this world there are two magic systems that center around 16 specific metals, my plan is to write out a detailed description of the powers related to one metal each week and see what this subreddit would be able to achieve with those powers.

First though, a (not very) brief overview of the magic systems in question:

*Allomancy*

The first of the magic systems is called allomancy. When an allomancer uses their power, they first consume the appropriate metal, typically in the form of metal flakes in an alcohol solution, and then "burn" it (ie. magically consume it) while it resides in your stomach to achieve the effect associated with that metal. The metal has to be of fairly high purity (by the standards of an industrial era civilization) in order to be used for allomancy, burning impure metals or alloys with incorrect proportions of metals makes you violently ill. Allomancers come in two flavours: The titular mistborn who can burn all sixteen metals and mistings who are limited to one specific metal.

*Feruchemy*

The second magic system is called feruchemy. When a feruchemist touches a metal of the appropriate type, they can store a certain attribute in that metal and save them up for later use, different metals store different attributes. For example, a feruchemist that is wearing a pewter ring can store physical strenght in it. For as long as they are doing this they will be much weaker than normal, but afterwards the ring will hold a storage of strength that the feruchemist can tap to become much stronger than normal. The amount of charge that an item can hold is related to the mass of the object (a bracer can hold more charge than a necklace and a necklace can hold more charge than a piercing) and you can only use a feruchemic charge that you yourself put in an item.

Feruchemist can control the speed at which they store an attribute as well as the speed at which they withdraw the attribute. So if a pewter feruchemist spent some time at half strength, they can spent a similar amount of time being 1.5 times as strong or spent half that time being twice as strong (the upper limits for both storing and withdrawing attributes are determined by how skilled the feruchemist is). Because of this, feruchemy can produce effects that are far more spectacular than allomancy, but it is limited by the requirement that you have to save up the attribute first. Like allomancers, feruchemists come in two flavors: Full feruchemists who can use all sixteen metals and ferrings who are limited to one specific metal.

*Compounding*

An interesting thing happens when a single person is able to use allomancy and feruchemy with the same metal. When burning a metal that has a feruchemic charge you don't get the normal allomantic effect, instead you get a very large boost to the attribute that was stored in the metal. Notably, the magnitude of this effect is /not/ limited to how much of the attribute was stored in the metal. The typical process for compounding a metal, as this process is called, is to fill a piece of metal with a tiny charge, burn it and use the resulting surge of power to fill a different piece of metal with a much larger charge.

What I'd like to munchkin are the so called twinborn compounders, people who are both a ferring and a misting for the same metal. For the setting I would like to consider two scenarios: modern day earth where you are the only person with this power and second era Scadrial (the Mistborn world) which is essentially the wild west but with allomancers and feruchemists running around.

*Part 1: Iron*

*Allomancy*

Allomantic iron allows a person to pull on pieces of metal. As soon as you start burning iron you will see thin, translucent, blue lines spring up between your chest and every source of metal in the surrounding area. You can then mentally tug on one of these lines to pull each individual piece of metal closer to you. This manifests as a force that is exerted between your centre of mass and the bit of metal.

Ironpulling conserves momentum, so pulling on something that is much lighter than you will fling it towards you, while pulling on something much heavier than you (or something that is attached to something much heavier than you) results in you being flung towards it. This can be quite dangerous if you pull on, for instance, a nail that wasn't as securely hammered into a building as you thought it was and instead of flinging yourself towards the building you send a sharp bit of metal flying towards you at high speeds. You cannot pull on any piece of metal that is at least partially inside a person (incidentally, this makes piercings and earrings a popular kind of jewelry for feruchemists) and you cannot pull on aluminium or anything covered in aluminium.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemic iron is a good complement to its allomantic counterpart as it allows you to store weight. The one iron ferring we've seen in the story so far spends most of his time at 75% of his regular weight and then makes himself much heavier if he needs to bash down a door or fall through the floor of a building or something. Yes, this power blatantly and explicitly defies conservation of energy.

It's worth noting that drawing in extra weight also automatically makes you strong and durable enough to cary your own weight and, conversely, making yourself lighter also makes you weaker and more fragile than you would otherwise be (so you can't use this power to jump higher than you would otherwise be able to). However air resistance is still a factor, so making yourself lighter does allow you to descend safely from pretty much any height (provided you have enough uncharged iron with you). Also worth noting is that you only make yourself lighter with this power, your clothing and anything you might be carrying (including the iron that you are using to store weight) still weighs as much as it did before.

*In universe uses*

A few ways in which these powers are used by the characters in the story:

- Have the safety of a gun be inside the handle, so only you or someone with the same powers as you can fire the gun.
- Wear a heavy chest plate that covers only the centre of your chest and pull incoming arrows towards that spot (note: gunfire is too fast for this).
- Make yourself incredibly light and use a weapon with a high recoil to push yourself in the opposite direction.
- Spiderman through the city by pulling on lampposts and metal bits in buildings. Though note that this is quite dangerous for people with only allomantic iron because you cannot slow your own fall if you ever find yourself without an anchor above you.
- Not actually used in-universe, but just to preemptively cut of the most obvious exploit: Yes, you can get infinite energy by standing on a ferris wheel and making yourself heavier when you are near the top and lighter when you are near the bottom.
