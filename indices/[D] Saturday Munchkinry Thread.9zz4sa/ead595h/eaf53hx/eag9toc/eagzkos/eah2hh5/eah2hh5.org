  If your skin and bones become strong enough to hold up N times your mass, then they will also be strong enough to resist bludgeoning and cutting.

You'd think so, but it's explicitly stated in the books that no amount of iron tapping will make you bullet or knife-proof.

  I'm also not really sure how this argument is supposed to hold weight. Density is just mass / volume. Using Iron increases your mass without increasing your volume. By definition, that's increasing your density.

Iron doesn't increase your mass, just your weight. The author [[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/6-bands-of-mourning-release-party/#e327][noted]] that iron messes with the Higgs field in some way that changes how gravity interacts with you.
