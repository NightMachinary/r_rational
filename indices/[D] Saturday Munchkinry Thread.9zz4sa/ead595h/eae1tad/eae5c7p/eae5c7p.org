Yeah, Cadmium and Bendalloy are going to be interesting when we get to them.

The things you mention don't really work though, because time bubbles aren't impregnable and the allomancer needs to stay inside them for them to work (they start centered on the allomancer and "pop" when something the size of a person leaves them).
