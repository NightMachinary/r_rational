Gold alloys do time manipulation. Pure gold shows you other possible personal presents, Electrum shows you possible immediate personal futures, Malatium shows you someone else's possible personal presents. Bendalloy creates a local bubble of fast-time, though it isn't made of gold. Cadmium makes local bubbles of slow-time.
