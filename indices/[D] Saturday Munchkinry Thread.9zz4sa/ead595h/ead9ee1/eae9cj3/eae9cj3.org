You'd need to completely overhaul the magic system for that patch to work. In addition to what silverswift mentions:

- The weight you can tap is a function of both /how much/ you are tapping and /how long/ you are tapping. So if your descent path takes less time than your ascent path, you can overcome whatever potential-energy based limiters are put in place.

- Gravity is not the only source of potential energy. Suppose that the feruchemist is hooked up both to some sort of counterweight, +and to a large vertical spring+. The proposed patch only prevents pumping energy out of the counterweight. +You can still pump energy out of the spring.+ (Edit: NVM. I can't get the math to create extra energy with a spring that isn't just equivalent to gravitational potential. But there are definitely ways of pulling energy out by increasing speed in motion, so the general point stands.)

So it's not as simple as simply imposing an energy cost as a function of height. The magic would have to look into the future, calculate your path, and impose a cost based on every energy gradient you will encounter.
