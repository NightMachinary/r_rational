  Simply analyzing something is cheap

I feel like this is the most important part. Eg. can it analyse the contents of a human brain? Can it analyse the nature of reality? Perhaps there is a method to make it answer arbitrary questions.

Even without magic, we have built technology that punches way above our weight class (a la nukes). Normally, I'd expect magic to hinder the growth of (our type of) technology, since we are not forced to find novel solutions, just use magic. In this case, with analysis magic, science /wouldn't even be necessary/ since absolute answers could simply be found. It's almost guaranteed that magical engineering would exist, and with what is effectively finished science, I'd expect technology at least as destructive as ours. Godhood would be short.

Either that, or someone would develop a novel implementation of magic that results in a quick domination of the world. Eg. the ability to turn someone's values into yours upon touch (and spell).

The other alternative I see is that civilization has developed to prevent these things from happening, which could lead to some really cool worldbuilding. Eg. Everyone has a device with a series of wards to defend against hostile mages such as the aforementioned mind mage.

Perhaps you could wrangle out some restrictions on divination that make an interesting setting!
