It's pretty hard to munchkin a power if you only have a few vague categories and some examples of what it does ("modify matter" and "control matter" are both pretty broad), but here goes:

#+begin_quote
  Spells can only affect what's next to their source. To affect something distant, they conduct the mana through the air, at which point it rapidly dissipates. In other words, there's a heavy price for targeting a distant thing, even if its just across the room.

Three questions:

1) How large does a spell diagram need to be? 2) Can the pretty geometric circles be folded while the spell is in effect? 3) Can modules be stacked on top of each other with one module triggering the next one up?

If diagrams can be made small enough you could just pack it in an aerodynamic casing and have another spell lob it at the intended target. Cast the spell before lobbing it and have it trigger once it hits its target.

If you can fold or stack spells, just do the same thing and fold/stack the spell until it fits in the casing.

If neither of those things are possible, you might be able to make a golem with a spell diagram in its torso and have it run at the target before activating whatever spell you want activated.

As in erase a persons memory or as in literal actual balefire? In the latter case your universe is just doomed, balefire is way to powerful a weapon in the hands of a rational munchkin.

In the former case, the first thing you'd want to do is get a continuing ward up to prevent anyone messing with your mind and if possible you'd want to have some kind of mechanism in place to prevent the ward from being removed (or at least detect it afterwards if it was ever removed).

If such wards are common, finding loopholes in how they are used is key. For instance, figure out if you can disrupt a ward and then place it back without the subject finding out the next day.

Also, if this is done with the modify matter modules, then they have an absurd amount of control and either this society has a ridiculously detailed knowledge of how the brain works or the magic has that knowledge built in. In both cases, you can probably do much more fun stuff than just blunt force erasing someones memory.

Wait, how does that work if you can't effect things at a distance?
