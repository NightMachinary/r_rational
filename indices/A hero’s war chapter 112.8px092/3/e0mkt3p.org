What does a conclusion to these kinds of stories look like? It is always interesting in the beginning but when ever I have seen these stories get to the building-guns part I loose most of my interest. I do not know if it is the almost-modern weaponry or the inevitable modern warfare that I care less about, but either way most of these stories I loved in the beginning and then I felt as if the author no longer knows where to take the story.
