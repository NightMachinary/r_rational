What other things might you do?

Jump off before they tell you to. Push the guy in the grey robe off. Steal his robe and run down to the bottom and claim you're him. Drop something. Go back down the tower while resetting all the puzzles on your way. Jump off the tower, then climb back up and do it again until you get it right. Jump from the bottom floor of the tower. Rappel down the tower. Go down the stairs, and claim that you jumped despite all evidence to the contrary. Leave the tower, and say that you got bored. Go down the stairs, and claim that you're the guy in the robe and the other guy stole your robe. Pull out a gun and threaten the guy in the cloak if he doesn't say you passed. Any others?
