I could see myself giving several different answers to this sort of test, depending on many factors down to even things affecting my mood like the time of day and when I last had a meal; I don't think I'd like to be classified by something so... arbitrary.

Consider Chris Anvil's story Test Ultimate short story (go read it if you haven't*): a jump into a pool of predatory fish, encouraged by an authority figure, seems pretty similar. I would be far more likely to jump into that pool than I would to jump from the tower, simply because I am irrationally extra afraid of heights but I am not extra afraid of piranha...

Also, I for one enjoy the company of those who approach things differently from myself at least as much as those who are similar...

An interesting and thought-provoking story, though.

* You can snag a lot of Chris Anvil's stuff from the 1635 Baen CD released with full allowance for free copying/redistribution of the CD's contents, from [[http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/]] . Test ultimate shows up in one of the two Interstellar Patrol books there.
