"- leap from this tower," said the gray-robed figure.

The dizzying drop loomed before them. After all this effort, after all these trials, after being pushed to the limits of his mind, it all came to this. What a joke.

Jad grinned, his lips parting wider and wider until his polished teeth were fully revealed, his smile reaching up to his cheeks, then his eyes, then his eyebrows. He put his hand on the gray-robed figure's shoulder. Jad was a picture of joy. The laughter that shook him soon erupted into audibility, and he screamed his ecstasy from the top of the tower that all the world might know his sublime pleasure.

He stopped laughing, and for a moment the chamber echoed with his aborted mirth. It was pleasant, to have an audience that appreciated him. He turned to look at the gray-robed figure.

"I get it! I got the joke, mentor. That's what this is, right? A sick joke?"

Silence from the gray-robed figure, except for a grunt and a slap. Unperturbed, Jad continued.

"That's the right answer, isn't it? This is all some kind of fucked-up game for you, isn't it? Answer me!"

Jad shook the grey-robed figure violently, but still no reply. Not even a grunt any more.

"Why won't you ANSWER ME?"

Finally, he let go of the gray-robed figure's neck and the man fell limply to the floor. Jad was alone at the top of the tower, now, with only echoes his companions. He laughed, and the world laughed with him.
