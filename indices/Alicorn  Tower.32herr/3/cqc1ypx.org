Hmm. My actual reaction would probably be some mixture of white and gray, with a very strong tendency to signal blue-robedness because I'm not-so-secretly paranoid about people using my open-secret idealist tendencies against me. The brown-robers are the ones I admire most and want to be like.

Is there another robe color for being a fucked-up person?
