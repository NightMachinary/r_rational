Glancing at the later chapters, I'm enjoying these (non-spoilerish) parts from chapters 1181 and 1182:

“You and I know the meaning and usage of the transliterations such as ‘romance' and ‘logic' because we share the memories of the ‘earthling Li Yao'. Both of the two words originated from the western civilizations on Earth and were passed on from Greek to English until they were loaned into the Chinese language!

“But Ding Lingdang and other people don't know anything about Earth. They don't know anything about ‘ancient Greek' and ‘English' at all. Then, why do they know the usages of the transliterations such as ‘logic' and ‘romance'?”

“If the transliterations such as ‘romance' or ‘logic' are coincidences, how do you explain the following words?” Li Yao said coldly. “I've fought with the federal army and the Cultivators more times than I can count. Every time we are grasped by desperation, people always use two idioms to boost the morale---'break the cooking pots and sink the boats' and ‘fight with the river to our back'!

“I didn't feel too strange about those two idioms before, but on second thought, do you not feel that it is horrifying?

“Where does the idiom ‘break the cooking pots and sink the boats' come from? It comes from an ancient general named Xiang Yu in the Chinese culture on Earth who smashed the cooking pots and burnt the boats, declaring to his army that there was no retreat, during the resistance against the Kingdom of Qin. Eventually, he crushed the magnificent Kingdom of Qin, thereby leaving the tale of ‘breaking the cooking pots and sinking the boats'!

“As for the idiom ‘fight with the river to our back', it is about another famous general named Han Xin, who deployed his army right in front of the river during a battle. It was also a method to encourage the soldiers to fight hard in the desperate situation because they had nowhere to retreat. In the end, he secured a victory, hence the idiom!

“It means that the two famous generals named Xiang Yu and Han Xin appeared on Earth first before the two idioms ‘break the cooking pots and sink the boats' and ‘fight with the river to our back' came into being!

“You and I boast the memories of the earthling Li Yao. So, it is not strange that we know the two idioms. But what about other people? Why are other people aware of the idioms that come from Earth?

“There are more popular idioms than ‘break the cooking pots and sink the boats' and ‘fight with the river to our back' in this era. For example, there are also ‘taste the gall on the hay' and ‘call a deer a house'... All of them are common idioms that people use on a daily basis, but they are based on the tales from Earth. Are they simply coincidences?

“Also, stocks, network, government, army... all those notions exist both on Earth and in the world of Cultivators and have the same spelling. How incredible is that?”

(Though I imagine 'call a deer a house' should be 'call a deer a horse'.)
