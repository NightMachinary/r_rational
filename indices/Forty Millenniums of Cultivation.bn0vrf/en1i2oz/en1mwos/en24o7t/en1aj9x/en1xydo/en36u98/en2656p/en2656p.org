Or fuck I here I thought I was close to the end of this book, currently on ch 789, and just found out that this series has not being finished yet...

So far is a good story, it avoids a lot of the cliches of other xianxia books, there are some moments, specially close to the end of an arc that God, they go on and on, on some lore or other background story that will somehow show up on the next arc... but overall great web novel...
