I had this same reaction to it at first, but about... ten chapters in (which isn't far, with the length of them), I noticed that something happened in my mind, and two concepts that I had previously thought were inseparable---good writing, and good /prose/---sort of “delaminated” from one-another. The writing /was/ good, despite the prose being clunky, and in my mind I stopped noticing the prose, switching away from reading the English /as English/, and switching into the same frame of mind you enter when you read annotated middle-English, or follow along with the programme of a foreign-language opera---a mindset where the words on the page aren't the words of the story, but rather are a guide to visualizing what the words of the story /would/ be, if you could understand them; a guide that a native speaker of the story's original language could use to put the original sentences back together in their own mind.

This has never happened to me before, and I've read plenty of translated fiction, so I feel like there's something special here. I think it's just that the original quality of the prose /in Chinese/ often shines through, despite the translation rather than because of it.

As an aside: as a writer, I feel like this story's bad translation has actually improved my ability to draft! I now feel much more confident in what I'm doing when drafting: getting the /story/ down on paper, without trying at all to get the /prose/ I want down on paper. The translation here serves as a great example of what a /good/ author's unedited draft should look like, if they've internalized the concept of drafting as a separate phase from editing. (“Unedited” in the sense that anything that Microsoft Word could point out along the way has been fixed, but anything that requires a human editor to notice hasn't been.)
