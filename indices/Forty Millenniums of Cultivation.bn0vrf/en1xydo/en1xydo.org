Pretty good story, smart protagonist, and a good exercise in reviewing Cultivation Novel's clichees under a scientific and technological understanding.

My favorite part is when MC is reaching a new Cultivation stage in his original country, and he reserves an special facility dedicated to it.

It's like someone minmaxed the chances of the breakthrough, and pilled all kinds of bonuses in a single place: the record of an epic music executed by the most proficient orchestra, medicines administered by gas into the room that can be inhaled or absorbed by the skin, the paintings of the breakthroughs of several other cultivators.

Kudos to the author for the well tough scene.
