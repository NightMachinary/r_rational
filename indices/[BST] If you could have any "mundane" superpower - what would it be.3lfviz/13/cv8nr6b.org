Define "mundane".

If it means "things most people can do", it's inherently unexploitable as a power, although if you have any shortcomings you can overcome one.

If it means "things some people can do", what you pick depends on how rare the thing can be. You can probably pick healthy lifespan, or wealth, or intelligence, and the lower the threshhold for how few people can do it and still have it count as "mundane", the better the healthy lifespan/wealth/intelligence you can pick.

If it means "things that non-geeks would think of", plenty of non-geeks would think of bring rich, smart, healthy, etc.

If it means "things that non-geeks would consider minimally useful", you need to pick something which has very good uses that most people wouldn't think of. Seeing a day into the past might be interesting, but almost any superpower would do it because almost any superpower can be muhcnkined in ways that non-geeks wouldn't think of. Also, almost anything in this category would win the Randi prize.
