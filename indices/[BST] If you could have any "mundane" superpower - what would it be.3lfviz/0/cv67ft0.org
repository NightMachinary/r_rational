Trying to figure out how to word this, but: The ability to instantly know any "Mundane" piece of information so long as it's something available or easily derivable from online, but no actual practical skills. Basically uber mental google search with a little generalized computation power.

Things like:

"How many air molecules are within 20 feet of me?" "How many lines of code would it take to splice in a quick save function for this damned game?"

But not:

"What is the code for creating a quick save function for this damned game."

Point of the power is being able to grab any of those little odd and end curiosities that pop in your head that would otherwise take research time disproportionate to the value of knowing their answer.
