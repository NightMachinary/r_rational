Ability to look 'inside' such as being able to look inside locked safes, inside a person's body, inside a notebook, seeing the other side of the card, and the inner workings of delicate machinery.

It would be so awesome to just be able to 'see' directly how different things work and I could fairly easily make use of the power in so many 'mundane' ways.

It sounds really minor, but anything which affects your senses (especially vision) will open up fascinating new insights into the world around us.

Other cool modifications I'd love to make to my vision would be being able to see in ultraviolet, infrared, or any other part of the light spectrum. Another one is seeing in 4-dimensions. Topology classes would be a lot easier!
