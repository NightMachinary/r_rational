The ability to cast Prestidigitation, as per the 0th level cantrip from D&D.

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/prestidigitation.htm]]

I'd use the telekinesis for fine point manipulation under a microscope (or if I became specialized enough, under an electron microscope). I'd find out which particulates are defined as "soiling" or "cleaning" and if I self-define it intuitively, then I'd be able to oxidize or reduce chemicals if that makes them look more rusty or spoiled or dirtier.

I could purify water at a rate of 1 ft^{3} every 6 seconds... which after an 8-hour shift is... 135,920.9 liters (whoa, really?). Hell, I could step up any sort of chemical purification process at a similar rate by "cleaning it" and leaving only specific enantiomers as my desired product.

The hour-long duration of 1 lb of brittle material creation, heating/chilling/coloring/flavoring don't defy entropy heat death on an exceptional scale (although I'd experiment to see if the energy is transferred to another object when the duration expires, how close is the bookkeeping?)
