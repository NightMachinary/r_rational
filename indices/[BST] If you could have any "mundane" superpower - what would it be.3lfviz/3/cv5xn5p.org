Finding pocket lint.

There's always between 1 and 5 grams of pocket lint when you put your hands in your pockets.

Doesn't seem useful, but that's matter generation. Even better, it's flammable matter. You'd need a really efficient heat engine to exploit that. I'm sure that a physicist could do more with a matter generation engine that produces 1-5 grams of matter every few seconds.
