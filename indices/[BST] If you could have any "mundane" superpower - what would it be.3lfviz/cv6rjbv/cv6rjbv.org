Retroactive preparation.

If you spend a few minutes in the morning, you will have prepared for the first few problems you run into during the day. Unexpected rain? Good thing you brought your coat along. Get into a debate with a friend? You just looked up the references you need. Running out of gas in your car? Good thing you grabbed a jerry can from your garage.
