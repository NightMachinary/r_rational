Retroversion. Activate it on a target person, and if a third party does anything to that person that they don't like, it rebounds onto the third party.

Technically restricted to whatever the third party might choose to do, and you're not directly affecting them with the power - although there's nothing stopping you provoking them in other ways.

Could be a fun way to get a lot of violent and intolerant people to beat themselves up, bad-mouth themselves, sabotage their own careers, fine themselves etc.
