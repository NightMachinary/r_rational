This is the first chapter of something that's been on my mind a while, but I've gotten around to writing.

I think this chapter alone doesn't quite meet the standards to qualify as rational fiction, but the chapter itself is meant to be an introduction, more than anything else (most dialogue so far has been more polite or emotionally charged than deep discussions, etc). The story I'm planning is heavily inspired by rational fiction; future chapters will have more intelligent conversations, and hopefully the characters will behave in believably intelligent ways.

It takes place on a near-modern Earth with only minor differences, to explore a few what-ifs:

- What if telepathy suddenly came into existence?

- What if aliens demonstrably existed but Earth was isolated?

- What if an /only slightly alien/ alien actually existed and had celebrity status?

My goal is to continue writing (I imagine this plot being roughly novel sized, but who knows how accurate a prediction that will turn out to be), but I do not expect to work as quickly as most stories posted here. Does such a story belong here, or should I take it elsewhere (it is a little YA-esque)? If you could, please let me know what you think!
