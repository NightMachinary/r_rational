It's an interesting enough concept and the writing is snappy enough to want to read more. From a rational fic perspective, I'd want the story to begin to elaborate the goals of the characters and how they will be challenged by their environment. So far it seems pretty easy going without much conflict or foreshadowing of anything momentous other than too-obvious tropes of Rose actually being an evil mind control monster or the anti-rose faction showing up. What is the major thrust of the plot? how will the action and momentum develop? What interesting questions will this situation raise?

if you can answer these I think it has promise.
