Thank you very much!

Right now, the future of the story is only partially planned, and a lot is vague in my mind. The world itself has been partially solidified, but much of it needs work. Several difficult problems still need addressing, but thankfully I believe most won't affect the near-future plot in a major way (as mentioned, the world is isolated).

A testreader would certainly be a lot of help. It took some effort to go through this single chapter and make sure information was presented in an order that made sense. I'm not sure how exactly to acquire them, so if anyone reading this is interested, just DM me.
