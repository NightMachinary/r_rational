Oh, it's completely alright. My other subscriptions live in my email, and now so does this one, that's all that I need.

There's no real benefit to uploading on fictionpress, I think.

I think [[https://archiveofourown.org/][AO3]] is a good platform, though. It actually has something resembling decent search, allows various different ways to read your work (including automatically generating an epub of it), and might actually have some people stumble on your work randomly on the site. But that's up to you.

[Edit] ... after a quick look on the AO3 original fiction page, it's a bit less wholesome than I thought. Still a decent platform, though.
