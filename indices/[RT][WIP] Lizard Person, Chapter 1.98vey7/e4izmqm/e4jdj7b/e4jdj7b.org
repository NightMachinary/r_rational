I really enjoyed reading the chapter, and am looking forward to more. To the point where I'd like to know if there's a place I can subscribe, I couldn't find anything from a quick look.

I think it fits right in in the subreddit. "Real" rational fiction is rare enough to be posted that "just" quality webfiction is quite welcome, IMO.

[Edit] Found the place to follow the blog, actually. Needs an account on the site, and the blog needs to be added to follows in the dashboard.
