Very nice, so far I really enjoyed the chapter = ) and actually have some high hopes with this, your Questions as a Setting seem to have a lot of potential and are quite intriguing. Are you going full worldbuilding on this ? If your goal is a mostly rational story maybe you can find someone with expierence as a testreader in the community to help you out catching most glaring inconsistencies and loopholes; a lot of stories seem to benefit hugely from that. But really a nice start and a good writing style.
