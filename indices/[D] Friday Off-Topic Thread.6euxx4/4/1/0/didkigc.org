I was considering just saying "sadness", since that would also include Princess Carolyn and Diane (some say they're both depressed as well, but I disagree). Mania is an interesting thought, but the only thing keeping me from it is that every single insight into his thought life is hopelessness, despondency, etc. The times where he's manically pursued improvement (like S2E1, with the self help tapes), it was still obvious to everyone but him that he was still hiding from the sadness within him(in this case, dodging phone calls from his mother).

But yeah, maybe depression doesn't fit as neatly as some other disorders might.
