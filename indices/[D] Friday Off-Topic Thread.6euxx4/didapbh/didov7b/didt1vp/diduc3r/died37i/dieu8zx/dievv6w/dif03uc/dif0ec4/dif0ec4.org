  Man, reading/watching fiction must be interesting for you :P I'm guessing you regularly identify with the villains more than the heroes?

Only in fiction produced by the international cliques and the globalists that deliberately vilifies my beliefs. Sometimes they even try to pass it off as non-fiction and pray to Moloch the gentiles won't notice, I assume.

But frankly, I don't read much fiction, I try not to frame my political views in terms of works of fiction, and if you do, I think less of you for it.
