Personally, I think tribalist behavior tends to actually center around lived experience. The beliefs aren't the point. The people gain loyalty by recognizing the lived experiences of the "tribe members", validating those experiences, and pledging to represent those members, those experiences, that tribe.

Mind, in many cases, the Trump voters who aren't fascists, anarchists, or pretending they never supported the guy are petty-bourgeois. As in, their lived experience is blah blah makers vs takers blah blah bootstraps blah blah we make this country run how dare you come after us blah blah.

The real solution, and this applies to the Dems too, is not to have a society where people can live in a bubble, comfortable but ignorant of how their lifestyle materially comes about.
