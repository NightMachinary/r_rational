So how can the petty-bourgeois be persuaded that they are on the wrong path to get what they want if they believe that everyone outside of their tribe is inherently against them? Even the moderate ones are convinced that Muslims are inherently dangerous to America, straight white men are being oppressed by political correctness as badly as minorities have been oppressed, news media that disagrees with them is propaganda attacking their icons, and intellectuals (including us) are arrogantly claiming that our opinions are factual when their's is just as valid so they have no reason to change.
