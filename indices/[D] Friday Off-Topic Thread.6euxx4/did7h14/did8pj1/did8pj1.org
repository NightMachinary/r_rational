/Patriot/ is a show that's only available on Amazon Prime, but it's probably one of my favorite shows in the last year. The main character is a deniable asset working at an industrial piping firm in order to have non-official cover for moving money to swing the Iranian election. He's also depressed and in the wake of a nervous breakdown. (The show itself is really weird, like Wes Anderson meets John LeCarre, and /some/ of the characters are stylistic rather than being attempts at simulating real people.)
