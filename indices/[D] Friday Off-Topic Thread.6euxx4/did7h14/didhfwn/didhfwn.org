I'd somewhat contest Bojack Horseman and depression: he definitely goes through bouts of it, but they're usually the result of his own self-sabotage, which in some cases comes from self-loathing, but also regularly comes from panic attacks and uncontrollable anxiety.

His symptoms also come off as more manic than anything. Most people going through depression who want to avoid doing something will just stay home all day, whereas he just as often avoids doing something by taking random trips out of the city or wild partying and drug use.

It's definitely an interesting show for examining mental dysfunction, but if I were diagnosing him Depression would not be my first thought, personally :)
