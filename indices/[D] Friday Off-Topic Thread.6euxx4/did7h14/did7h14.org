Lately I've been on the lookout for good depictions of different types of psychological dysfunction--specifically depictions that are consistent and clear, instead of just "lulz they're crazy". Examples that come to mind so far are:

/Bojack Horseman/ and depression

/Wilfred/ and anxiety

/Jessica Jones/ and post-traumatic issues

I almost want to include Crazy Ex Girlfriend in this list, but the protagonist of that show suffers from several different issues to varying degrees, so it's harder to get a sense of what is happening in her mind.

Does anyone know of other pieces of fiction like this that are worth recommending?
