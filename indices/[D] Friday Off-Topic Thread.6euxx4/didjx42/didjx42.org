So awhile back I wrote something of an anti-FAQ for "Nice Guys," here being used to refer to "Guys who bemoan the unfairness of the romantic world toward good, kind hearted guys like them." The point of the anti-FAQ is to try to explain the errors and biases in that perspective, and help them find a more useful/mature understanding of the opposite gender and the dating world.

(Is Anti-FAQ the right label for that? I'm not quite sure what it means specifically, but FAQ seemed wrong since it's the hypothetical Nice Guy asking the questions and me answering them)

I never published it because I got super busy with other projects before I could find others to proof read and give feedback on it, particularly people who consider themselves farther on the "MRA" side of the spectrum rather than the "SJW" one, if we use those acronyms to represent extremes.

Finally figured I might as well offer anyone who's interested the chance to provide some feedback so I can maybe put it up sometime this month. All perspectives welcome, though if you consider yourself or have considered yourself at any point a Nice Guy, your feedback would be particularly helpful.
