Another book I'd like to read from “the same series” would be /Operational Manual For Your Body/.

Possible chapters: knows bugs (and workarounds \ fixes), lesser-known capabilities, proper maintenance and damage prevention (short-term \ long-term), properties specific to your sub-model (this information can be partially harvested through DNA tests, I think, but still).

The point is --- it's not that this information is not exactly available somewhere out there, but that it's usually intended for professionals (GPs, specialised doctors, surgeons, therapists, etc), and not the “users” themselves. So you can't just pick up a 300 --- or, hell, even 600-page long book, and be sure that most of what you'll need to know about your organism will be in there --- relevant to everyday-life and for the entire human lifespan, and not in abstract-biology encyclopedia type of way.

Well, I, at least don't know of any such books.
