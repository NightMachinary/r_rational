My impression is that MRAs are moderates while PUAs are extremists. However, I'm well-acquainted with neither [[/r/TheRedPill][r/TheRedPill]] (PUAs) nor [[/r/MensRights][r/MensRights]] (MRAs), let alone [[/r/MGTOW][r/MGTOW]] (though I usually upvote submissions from [[/r/MensRights][r/MensRights]] whenever they appear on [[/r/all][r/all]]).
