Mostly because I don't see them as "the enemy?" When I was in high school I shared some of the same self-pitying beliefs, and I grew out of them for a number of reasons that not everyone apparently was fortunate enough to be exposed to. Maybe some of them are just using the Nice Guy persona as a cover for misogeny, but I hope they're in the tiny minority, and in any case they would just ignore the stuff I say anyway.

As for the rest, if I can help them even a little then why wouldn't I?
