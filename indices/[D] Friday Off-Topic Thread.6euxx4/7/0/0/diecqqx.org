That looks like just the tool I need...

... but I seem to have entered the yak-shaving stage.

I have pdfjam installed; I just can't seem to get my copy to /do/ anything other than announce errors. For example, looking over the pdfjam-pocketmod script at [[http://tug.ctan.org/support/pdfjam/bin/pdfjam-pocketmod]] , I can manually enter the final command (replacing the variables with what I want done), but... if I don't enter an output filename, then it obviously doesn't work, but if I do enter an output filename, I get an error that the file with that filename doesn't exist. And, of course, neither the man page nor the website or any discussion I can find offers anything as simple as a working example of the pdfjam-pocketmod command.

It's 3am locally; maybe I'll see whatever it is I'm missing after some sleep.
