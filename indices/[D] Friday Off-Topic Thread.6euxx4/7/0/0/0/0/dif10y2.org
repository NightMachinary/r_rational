... and it was the "-o" that I was missing. (I'll blame the lack of sleep last night.)

I've now got myself a pair of PocketMod-capable [[https://www.datapacrat.com/temp/Cniglic%20Test%202.pdf][PDF]] [[https://www.datapacrat.com/temp/Cniglic%20Test%203.pdf][files]] for printing - twice as much paper as I really need, but it'll get the job done; and it'll just take me a few minutes to work out which order the pages will have to go in. And that can wait while I try to figure out how to make the various tables more readable.

Long story short: Thank you kindly. :)
