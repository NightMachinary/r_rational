Your printer doesn't have a "number of document pages per sheet of paper" setting?

I can go Print-> Properties -> Multiple Pages -> 9 in 1, but it would require manually reordering the pages (and adding two filler pages).

If all else fails, you can use GIMP or something to horribly hack all the pages together and print that.
