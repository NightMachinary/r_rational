I've been watching the show Code Lyoko recently, and I realized that it's already pretty close to rational fiction. They could have shut down the super computer at the beginning, but that's more of a difference in systems of morality rather than something that was explicitly wrong. There are many times when if they had thought a bit more logically it would have worked out better (eg. Jeremie bringing the CDs he's made to the factory when there was any chance of needing them), but on the whole, the story actually does meet all the criteria.
