Okay so the gang discovers the XANA supercomputer and with Lyoko and Aelita. In the show, they do this whole 'threat of the week' thing where XANA attacks and they defeat it and rewind time to undo the damage that it did. Just like, unpacking that into "kids fighting a UFAI and trying to rescue their friend from inside a virtual world" running through all the implications of XANA and time travel and all of that instead of just glossing over it. It wouldn't be 'threat of the week' anymore, that structure would break down pretty much immediately, and there'd probably be a sort of Lensman Arms Race between XANA and the gang as time goes on. Could even have it culminate in XANA going full skynet and starting a widespread war on humanity.

Just taking all the pieces the show has, and putting them into a rationalist framework, yields some really interesting potential stuff.
