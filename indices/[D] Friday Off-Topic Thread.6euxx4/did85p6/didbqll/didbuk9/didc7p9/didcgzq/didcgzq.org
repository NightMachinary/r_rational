One thing I noticed at the beginning was that the returns to past can't bring people back to life, so the implication is that every time they return to the past, a bunch of people who would've died in the next 24 hours suddenly drop dead.

One solution is that it only can't bring back people who would remember the return to the past, but then why do they work so hard to save everyone? It could potentially be an ingrained sense of saving people that they haven't reconsidered.

Another solution is that it only can't bring back people that were only killed because of the actions of XANA/the supercomputer, but that's somewhat confusing in the "who decides that" way.
