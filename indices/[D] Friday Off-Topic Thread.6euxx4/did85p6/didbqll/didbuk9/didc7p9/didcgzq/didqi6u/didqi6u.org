Well, in the show XANA very clearly had magic powers. It repeatedly /possessed/ inanimate objects with no mechanical components like antique samurai armor and a teddy bear that grew giant-size. One time it somehow used indoor and outdoor light fixtures to control gravity, and in a later episode even took control of a doctor while the heroes were in a hospital. Even when they finally make Aelita human, XANA somehow made it so she'd die if they unplugged him.

Rationalizing the time travel rules is the least of your problems, this stuff is actually important to the plot beyond justifying episodic stories. The method that comes to my mind is to say XANA created grey goo bots too small for current science to detect that can build things from the environment, but whatever has XANA trapped in that computer is preventing it from accessing more than a small amount of the machines at a time every week or so.

If you went that route, though, it'd be easier to justify XANA's victims not coming back since the machines could be having an insidious effect on the people around the town whenever XANA gains control of some. It's just another kind of magic, but it's something and that level of technology would explain how they're able to eventually construct a human body for Aelita.
