It's basically my first exposure to the topic of Trump's Twitter posts, but the recent /covfefe/ incident has me wondering if Trump has been intentionally using typos to manipulate the perception and publicity of his tweets. I mean:

1) It is common knowledge that typos change the perception of a message, increasing the reader's sense of the spontaneity (and hence sincerity) of the message. (While, yes, decreasing their sense of the writer's formal education / intelligence.)

2) A narrative of "the media makes fun of me for /stupid/ things that don't matter", the sorts of inconsequential things that working guys like you do (like typos in tweets), is in Trump's favor.

3) Getting cocky? A particularly blatant error (see #5), in a post about how "despite the media coverage...", later replaced with "guess what this typo means" and a "Yep, it's a conspiracy" from Spicer.

4) Apparently he's been routinely misspelling Barack's name.

5) The most recent one, "covfefe", does /not/ strike me as a real typo - it (unlike the other typos of Trump's that I found reports of in a quick search) is not a correctly spelled word (IE, not an autocorrect error) and not a phonetic spelling. Also, I spend way too much time looking in detail at people's typos, when I see them, and "fefe" instead of "erage"... just... um, really? Probably not on QWERTY...

6) Scott Adams puts forth that there's some evidence that Trump has a powerful grasp of a sort of low wit that could perhaps include techniques like this.

On the "evidence against" side, of course, we have the base rate of typos in his posts and the difficulty of prosecuting a good conspiracy.

Conclusion is that we should stop giving media attention to Trump's typos.
