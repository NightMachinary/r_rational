  Your printer
#+end_quote

... As it turns out, I'm not quite finished moving house, and my printer is buried and/or transmogrified into an unrecognizable box; it looks like once I get a print-ready file or two, I get to stick them in my online temp directory and pop over to my new local public library to print them there.

  you can use GIMP or something to horribly hack all the pages together
#+end_quote

At this rate, I may have to do just that. Which will mean a dive into yet another program's canvas-size settings and taking the time to figure out how to divvy up the page and how to paste into selected areas, etc. At this point, I'm gaining a tiny amount of hedons just from how many steps it's taking to get to the point where I can look up my notes while I'm out doing some chores. Not nearly enough hedons to counter the annoyance of not having just printed the thing two days ago, but I've got enough depression that I'll grab my hedons wherever I can find 'em.
