I think something from the pdfjam package may work for you:

In particular there's a tool called pdfjam-pocketmod, which "converts 8 pages from a single PDF file into a pocket-sized booklet". That's for a fancy layout where you can just fold the page directly into a booklet I think -- if you just want to shrink pages so you can cut them out, pdfnup is a tool for grouping every N PDF pages into one (read the name as "pdf-N-up".)
