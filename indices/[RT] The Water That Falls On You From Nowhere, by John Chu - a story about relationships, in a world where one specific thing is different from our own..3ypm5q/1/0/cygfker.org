It isn't just writing; consider media. Does an actor in a show get drenched because in order to play a character he must make statements that are not true about himself? If the answer is no, can you hire someone to give a speech for you? For that matter, could you believe "the statements in the speech are literally false, but they are not designed to mislead" and make a speech without getting detected as a liar? If you cannot, what happens if your statements are literally true, but you know that 1 out of 1000 people in the audience will misinterpret them as something false? 1 out of 50? 1 out of 1.5?

Does the whole thing detect intentional recklessness and bias, but where the speaker doesn't know (because of his bias) that he's lying? If so, that could take politics in an even worse direction than it already is, since politics would then select for people who genuinely but irrationally believe crazy things.

What happens if you construct an untruth out of one or more truths, by using prerecorded media (so you don't need to say anything additional), such as taking a statement out of context?
