Good stuff! I'd be interested in seeing other thing that would change in regards to water. Most notibally, how does politics change? Especially on a global level. Does writing cause water when read? Will that make all writing no longer as trust worthy? Do courts use humidity sensors? Is the water usable as evidence in court?
