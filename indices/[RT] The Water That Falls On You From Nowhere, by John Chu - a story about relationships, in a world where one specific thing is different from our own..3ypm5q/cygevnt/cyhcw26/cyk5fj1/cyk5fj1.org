It's a story about coming out in the style of magic realism. The /point/ of it is to write a perfectly mundane story that just so happens to have magical elements. As a piece of speculative fiction it doesn't work, but that's like saying it's a pity Monet didn't just take photos; they would be /so much crisper/.
