Seriously. Look at every other post in this topic. All about the amazing possibilities of conservation of mass turning out to be a myth, perfect zero-cost lie detection, etc. The story deals with precisely *one* societal impact of The Water, and it's just a stupid cheap shot at "frat bros", aka progressive virtue-signaling.

The worst part is that the story even hints at a story that would have worked so much better - namely a gay bioengineer trying to build him and his partner a son. And it's just a single laugh line.

It's not a bad story, but those flaws combined with the Hugo win total up to being very disappointing.
