It's a magical effect with no mechanism even implied and no part of the story concerns itself with either understanding it or exploring the consequences. This is a coming-out story, and a pretty neat example of that genre, but it's just not science fiction in any meaningful sense.

Science fiction is supposed to ask a specific kind of question - you can ask it as "What if", or "Why not", or even "If this goes on..." You ask the question and then you explore possible answers. "Water" frames itself as if it asks the question, but doesn't spend any time paying attention to how answering that question would change the world. Even without the weird physics-breaking precipitation, this weird subjective-truth oracle and the paradox allergy would tell us a lot about the world and universe that would change cultures, let alone research.

In the end, this is the story of the protagonist coming out to his family. It wouldn't be that different if it were a purely mundane coming-out story, and wouldn't be any different at all if it used some other kind of truth-telling faculty. It's not science fiction.

Edit: It's very late and I misread your question as being about it's SF-ness, not it's worldbuilding. Much shorter correct answer is - the mental activity of lying produces cold water. People's moods alter humidity and ozone levels. If nothing else, the bio-engineering protagonist would need to be trained in some kind of autohypnosis like all the rest of the lab-based biologists. If you write off every other possible spin-off of psychohydrology, working out teachings that allow you to think about what you want while not fucking up lab conditions are a high-enough priority that they would be common knowledge.
