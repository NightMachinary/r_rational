Dungeon Defense is solid and has has a fairly clever protagonist. The description, copied directly from the series' wiki, is:

#+begin_quote
  After renouncing his inheritance of his late father, a young man decides to spend the remaining years of his life without working. One day, he received an email from the company that created『Dungeon Attack』, a standard dungeon-capturing RPG that was boasted as the absolute hardest strategy game. After answering a suspicious survey for the next expansion, he now finds himself in the game as the weakest Demon Lord,「Dantalian」.

  With only his eloquent tongue and memories of conquest as the hero of the game, in order to survive as Dantalian, he decides to tear this new world apart.

Dantalian is normally defeated in the tutorial mission in the game he finds himself transported into, so he needs to use his intelligence to succeed instead. It's not the greatest story ever written, but in my opinion it's written well-enough and is thoroughly enjoyable.

Last I heard, the writer was going through the process of writing the isekai elements out of the series, because in general it functions better as a fantasy story than as an isekai.
