I read this after your recommendation and stopped in Volume 3. I didn't like it. We as the readers aren't let in on what is happening or why most of the time and then the problems get solved because "Oh yeah, the main character knew this thing from the game so it all works out." I would be down with the main character abusing known game info basically be prophetic but the readers are never let in on it until the exact moment when it becomes relevant and makes the main character win out of nowhere. That makes it seem like deus ex machina and not good planning. Also the main character is a pretty insufferable Gary Stu. "I'll just start reciting the complete works of William Shakespear (Which of course I have memorized) at this random bar and now everyone is in love with me because they have never heard a good story before."

The other big reason I stopped reading was because the main character just casually threw away one of his core convictions in Volume 3. It makes no sense for his personality to take such a huge turn.
