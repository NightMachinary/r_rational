I actually really liked Shinobi The RPG. It was kind of shit until he got his team, but then it got a lot better. It is a pretty weird twist on The Gamer, which was amazing, but it disguises itself as being a shitty cliche story first. The ending of Act 1 was amazing, and I actually cried at the climax just before hand, which happens very very rarely. I definitely recommend this it.

I haven't read the others.
