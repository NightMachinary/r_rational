I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death][Fairy Dance of Death]]. It sets the death game of Sword art online in the more pvp centric world of Alfheim Online, where players are less incentivized to work together, and adds a layer of politics.

It's currently unfinished. I think the author is struggling to find time, but their recent profile update says they're still working on it.
