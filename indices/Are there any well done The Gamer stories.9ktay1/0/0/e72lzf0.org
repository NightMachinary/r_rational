I would recommend [[https://www.erfworld.com/blog/view/50734/the-last-turn-part-1][The Last Turn]], an Erfworld fanfic by the writer of The Wandering Inn. It's a game world, not a single-person power, but it might be what you're looking for. It's short (for the genre) and I enjoyed it much more than Erfworld itself. Munchkinnery at its finest.
