My take on it: Jaune does a lot of thinking, and it does help him (it at least looks like a rational fic), but he's not spending that thinking time effectively so it seems more rambly than rational. Jaune has a lot of abilities which he can choose between but he makes his decision by thinking about it instead of taking measurements and making calculations. Eg. he chooses to split his stat points between intelligence and wisdom but:

- Stat points can be increased by training them, so he is encouraged to put his points into already high-level stats to maximise their payoff (ie. focus on one stat)

- Intelligence and Wisdom stats work together very well, but in the late game, each 50-stat step gains even more benefits to the last. So while 250-250 was very powerful, 0-500 would have been absurd.

It's like the rational equivalent of a chinese xianxia: a large quantity of (relatively) cheap writing that is enough to tickle all my requirements.
