i would recommend [[https://wanderinginn.com/2016/07/27/1-00/][the wandering inn]] which has levels and classes and skills, but does switch characters over so often. premise is humans sumoned to another world. overall its good, but some of the shifts to other viewpoints feel lacking because of how many there are now.

i would not call it rational. it does have regular updates.
