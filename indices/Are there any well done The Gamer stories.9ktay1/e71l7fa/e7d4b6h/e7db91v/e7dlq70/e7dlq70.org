Yes but how do you know him, etc? Ok maybe this is too much prying. But it's really strange to have followed you on [[/r/haskell][r/haskell]], and then [[/r/wormfanfic][r/wormfanfic]], and now here, and then MIRI. (Also this is my headcanon.) Too weird, but awesome still.

(Is MIRI a good place to level up as a beginning Haskeller, intermediate FPer?)

And yes the Erogamer is fabulous, and one of the best things I've read in the past year. Glad to hear you're enjoying it too!
