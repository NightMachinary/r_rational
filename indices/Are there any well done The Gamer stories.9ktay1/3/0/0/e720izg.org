It is what it says its about. Protagonist finds herself with erogamer stats. I only started reading it because I found it linked here, but I feel like the time was well spent. It may not float your boat, but it does have at least one explicitly rationalist background character and a bunch of characters intelligently dealing with the fact that they've found themselves thrust into an eroge as support characters.

Threadbare is basically all sorts of cuddly awesome though.
