The Erogamer on QQ is probably the best story in that genre that I've read.

Something that borrows some of the elements is [[https://www.amazon.com/Threadbare-Stuff-Nonsense-Andrew-Seiple-ebook/dp/B078KGS4V4][Threadbare]], by Andrew Seiple, which was first posted as a web serial on SV. Not exactly rationalist, but still a fun read.
