I think when the munchkining comes at the cost of pacing, plot, and chracterization it's not worth much. But when an author is able to make it work with the story in a way that adds flavor (instead of taking over) then it can be quite enjoyable.

It would only be a guilty pleasure to me when the plot basically boils down to "Main character is really smart and figures out how to game the system and beat everyone showing how smart they are... The End". And admittedly some stories in the genre are like that, but I generally stop reading those fast.
