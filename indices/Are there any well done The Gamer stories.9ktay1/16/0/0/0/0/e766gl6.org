I do read "The Gamer" manga, but it annoys me a lot because it's so dumb. :D

I don't think it's about scifi at all.

It's sadly a lot about wish-fulfillment and gaining stupid amounts of unfair power by "munchkinry", which is not even munckinry in non ratfics.

Maybe I'll try to write a good one. One that wouldn't be about becoming a literal god and trouncing everything with your uberpowers, but would still use somewhat of a gamerlike system. I have been thinking about this for a while and have some specifics of the world set up already in a doc. Probably ends up being shit anyway.
