Gaming the System\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/13807/gaming-the-system]]

A really good story that is unfortunately discontinued.\\
Still, I highly recommend reading it.\\
The family dinner where he reveals his new Gamer powers to his family is hilarious and the whole story tries to be as realistic and munchkin like as possible.
