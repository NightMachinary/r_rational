It gets mentioned from time to time, and there was some discussion in either the last chapter update or the update before it. The author is (IIRC) Croatian, which I'm sure it part of it. It's just not a thing that people are going to point out every chapter, and if they like it, then it's probably either a bullet they bit, or something that doesn't bother them.
