Seconding A Bad Name, the character development in this is better than most Worm fanfics I've read so far.\\
The protagonist doesn't start out as a very smart person, but he makes decisions that make logical sense given his experiences and the situations he finds himself in. And as the story goes, he does gain a lot of agency and makes more intelligent decisions.

Have to warn though, full spoilers for Worm.
