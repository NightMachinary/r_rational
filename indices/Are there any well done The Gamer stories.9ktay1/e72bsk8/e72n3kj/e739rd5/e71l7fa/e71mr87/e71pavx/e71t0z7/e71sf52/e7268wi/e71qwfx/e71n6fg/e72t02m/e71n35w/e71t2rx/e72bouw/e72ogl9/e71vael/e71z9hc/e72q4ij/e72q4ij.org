Clearly our rational fiction fanbase is correlated with people who like this genre. I can see a couple hypotheses why:

- The intersection of between rational and science fiction/fantasy is large (larger than other rational fiction types)\\
- Rational speculative fiction is easy to write -> more quantity\\
- Rational speculative fiction is effective within speculative fiction, so they recieve more visibility

- The kinds of people who like rational fiction also like speculative fiction\\
- Similar excitement is gained from rational fiction and speculative fiction, so the combination is even better

- Our community has become self-reinforcing for speculative fiction in particular

I think downvoters should take into account that [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]] raises a good point if we consider this last hypothesis. This can be seen as a call to action, where we should do something to improve our sub's inclusivity.
