I mean MoL specifically. I think I mostly managed to ignore it when I binged the first 70 or something chapters, but ever since it's been annoying me more and more so I ended up dropping it a few chapters ago. It's hard to point out specifically what's wrong with it, I guess, but the one criticism that sticks in my mind is that nobody feels like they have a unique "voice". Take any line of dialogue and, unless it's dealing with information or something that only specific characters know or a similar situation, it sounds like virtually any character could have said it.
