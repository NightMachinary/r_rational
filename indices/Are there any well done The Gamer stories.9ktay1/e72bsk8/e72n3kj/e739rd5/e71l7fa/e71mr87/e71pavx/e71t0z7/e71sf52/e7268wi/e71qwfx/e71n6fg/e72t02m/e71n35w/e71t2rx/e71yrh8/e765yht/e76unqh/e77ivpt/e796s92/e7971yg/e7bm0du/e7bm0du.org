That's funny, because I love MoL much more than the other two. I read about half of Worm before finally giving up, and I wouldn't have read as far as that if it weren't so widely recommended, because it was too grey for my tastes. Worth the Candle is... Ok. I'm still reading it, but I don't rush to catch it as soon as it updates. But I'm always waiting for the next MoL chapter.

I'd say that half of the appeal is the level of world building (it was a fantasy world building project before it was a story), and the other half is the level of opposition. Zorian has a time loop, but he starts off so vastly overmatched that he just keeps getting killed. And when he makes progress in solving the mystery of what's happened to him, it's in tiny increments, gradually piling up clues until he can put the picture together. And whenever it seems like he's getting too powerful and there are no more plausible challenges, the world finds a new way to kick him in the gut.
