I'm a spider so what? Is one of my favorites but there aren't great translations and it turns into a different genre mostly towards the later parts and got unfun for me.

I'm currently reading Everybody Loves Large Chests and it's been really fun and funny although not terrible rational. It is also quite pornographic intermittently which might turn some people away.
