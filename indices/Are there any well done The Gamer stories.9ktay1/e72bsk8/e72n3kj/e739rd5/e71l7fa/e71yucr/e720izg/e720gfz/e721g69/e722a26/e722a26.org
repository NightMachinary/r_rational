I agree. It was fun and easy to read, but characters hardly changed except for getting more power. Conflicts were resolved mostly by one side overpowering the other, or upon discovering a misunderstanding. I can't think of one instance where any main character actually changed their minds, let alone their values.

It's appeal is its quirky setting and fun situations. For example, the first dungeon Threadbear enters is cat and death themed with the "Nekomancer" as the final boss.
