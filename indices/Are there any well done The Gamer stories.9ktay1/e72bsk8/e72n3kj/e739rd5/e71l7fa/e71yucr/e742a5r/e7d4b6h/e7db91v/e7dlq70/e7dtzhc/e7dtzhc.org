  Yes but how do you know him, etc?

As for how I met Nate, it was a cold call on his part back last September asking to grab dinner!

Your headcanon isn't /terribly/ far off. I've been sort of rationalist-adjacent for a long while. I've read a lot of rationalist fiction over the years (and stuff in the general neighborhood like Worm, Unsong, Vinge, etc.), because I tend to get sick of the standard Hollywood narrative that any sort of progress is inherently bad.

I've read a lot of the same source material, e.g. I stumbled on Less Wrong when working on some MCMC stuff and looking for material for trying to explain it to folks, collected a degree in AI during my binge through academia. I use lots of adaptive dynamic programming / Q-learning style tricks when working on compilers and the like, MCMC for graphics, etc. This means I've had to pick up a lot of the same tools but for use in rather more "pragmatic" short-term goals. I also try to be a good little Bayesian in my day to day life, though maybe not to the same degree as the typical MIRI-ite, as evidenced by the fact that my wife feels a need to apply a correction factor whenever I tell her my odds for things. ;)

If we're going to have some form of AI it'd be nice if it was something we could reason about. My main emphasis currently is on the idea that if the kind of AI we do know how to reason about is made up of functional programming and logic programming bits, it'd be really nice if that sort of approach could scale to the levels of data we can feed to deep piles of neural networks, and if it could run on the same sort of hardware, lest it be relegated to a form of irrelevance purely for a lack of computing resources. Going slow to go fast by trying to get our foundations right works to a point, but now there are 10,000x more folks working on the other side of the equation.

  (Is MIRI a good place to level up as a beginning Haskeller, intermediate FPer?)

I'm not sure I can speak to that. They do have a bunch of functional programmers on board and are actively recruiting in FP circles for both interns and regular employees. I also know Nate and at least one of their interns were doing a lot of work in Lean recently and also seem to have a lot of internship positions to fill and comparatively few applicants, so for folks looking to do an internship, at least, that seems very viable. I'm also around the office now and again and have been spending my time there relentlessly braindumping FP, math and category theory on folks.
