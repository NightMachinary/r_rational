Here are some I've been reading:

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/greg-veder-vs-the-world-worm-x-the-gamer.44380/][Greg Veder vs The World]] Good character development, classic take on The Gamer in the Worm universe.
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/shinobi-the-rpg-act-1-naruto-si.36903/][Shinobi: The RPG]] Uses the Fallout stats system which apparently you can't upgrade until late in the game. MC screws himself over by treating charisma as a dump stat, then realizes to his horror that he has to interact with actual people this way.
- [[https://wanderinginn.com/][The Wandering Inn]] There's no explicit XP numbers in this story (that we're told about), rather the levelups and associated skill gains seem to be in some way connected to character growth. Fantastic writing style.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10881/dungeon-heart][Dungeon Heart]] Almost no character growth, but there's an in-story reason: The protagonist is a very old dwarf with a well defined and stubborn personality.
