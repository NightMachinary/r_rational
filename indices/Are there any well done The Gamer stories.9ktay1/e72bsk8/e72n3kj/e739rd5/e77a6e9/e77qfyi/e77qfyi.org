Yes, it was definitely the kind of fic where I started out expecting one thing and ended up getting another (in a good way).

The same author also has a Young Justice SI in progress, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/pyroclasm-young-justice-si.49156/][Pyroclasm]], which might be considered rational. YJ SI's tend to take inspiration from [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]], but in this case the protagonist starts as an infant with no powers and makes his own with the help of some friendly AI he created.
