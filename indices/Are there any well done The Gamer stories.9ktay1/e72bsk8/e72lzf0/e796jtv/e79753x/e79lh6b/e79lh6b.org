It's still pretty good and consistent, but the pace goes waaay down.

By now it's the kind of pace where the story has an entire book (twice as long as Book 1 so far) dedicated to the "multiple characters are stranded from their base and their faction is in mortal peril as long as they are" arc.

It's enjoyable to read, mind you, (I'm still reading) but the pace has really taken a hit. The fact that half of the updates are text pages going into the details of each character's backstory and how it informs their decisions doesn't help.

("eg Did I ever tell you about that game I played 10 years ago when I was in a completely different faction? Here's how that game works. The situation I'm in has some stark similarities with that game.")
