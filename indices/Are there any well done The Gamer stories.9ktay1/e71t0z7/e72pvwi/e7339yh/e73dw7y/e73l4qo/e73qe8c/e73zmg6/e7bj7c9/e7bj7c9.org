I can't tell if this is kink shaming or just the usual modern "eww, secks" American values leaking through.

I mean, the whole premise is already absurd. A succubus (magic sex-based demon) that undergoes a weird mind break and develops a masochism fetish as a coping mechanism for dealing with the pain of being a contracted demon to a retarded and voracious omnivorous chest that spends hours summoning her only to eat her alive (because it's too stupid to understand that it can't get full from dissolving mana bodies, and it won't gain mana from eating its own conjured critters) isn't nearly the strangest thing that happens in the story.
