Cat seems to be acting more heroically than not, even if she complains that villians couldn't get away with showboating as much as heroes like Archer.

I hope we get some payoff from Ranger being around in the form of the Queen of Summer showing up, or a face to face meeting with Cat. I could also see a cryptic message from afar delivered to Cat for payoff at a later date.
