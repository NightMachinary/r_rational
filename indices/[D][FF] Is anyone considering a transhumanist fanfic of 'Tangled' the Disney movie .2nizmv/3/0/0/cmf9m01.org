It isn't clear how that magic works. If the flower just affected fetal development to magically add those enchantments to perfectly normal hair and other things, then it is less grim.

But it seems likely to be a magical genetic mutation, like red hair was at one time, given how hair growth physically works and what happened to the hair that was cut when she was an infant. There are also the other abilities, which also support this genetic claim. The strongest point here is that normal hair grows for a time, stops growing, and then naturally falls out.

Neither the uncut super-hair or the brown, natural hair seem to act like baseline human hair does. This suggested the hair follicles themselves are enchanted, and remain so even after the hair is cut.

Note that normal maximum hair length is based on how long (over what period of time) hair grows until it naturally falls out during [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle][hair growth rest, or telogen]], and that how long it takes to reach this point in the hair follicle cycle is a genetic trait.

--------------

First, we have to either assume normal hair growth with individual hairs eventually falling out doesn't happen here since there are no examples of shed super-hair, or that falling out is the same as being cut to the shed hair /itself/ but not to the hair follicles that would need to pick up growing enchanted hair again.

Otherwise, after 4-6 years of life, all her hair would be brown. Or she'd be bald.

And if it fell out and did not count as being cut, there would be piles of blond super-hair everywhere that should, given available information, function perfectly well for the magical song.

Some confirmation from canon: as Gothel doesn't carry around skeins of shed super-hair, it would follow that either she is not a very intelligent actor, or that shed super-hair doesn't exist.

As an easy check against this, but by no means strong evidence, the hairbrush we see appears to have no shed hair on it -- at least, no good shots of hair on the brush were found in a very brief [oh god don't make me study this in-depth] viewing of low-res video of various...hairbrush related scenes in the movie. There are also no long brown hairs shown, of which there would be many if such absurdly long hair was ever shed and lost its properties.

I think the simplest assumption is that her hair never falls out as super-hair, and never enters the rest state, growing in anagen forever /except/ when cut. There is still a problem here. That would mean either the brown hair is also invincible and never falls out but merely stops the follicle growth phase, or that it has been /magically/ altered to, after cutting, always grow to that length (rather, for the same amount of time to reach that length) for all hair originating from those specific hair follicles from which enchanted hair was grown and later snipped. Either case involves additional magical changes to the hair follicles.

The never-falls-out super-hair scenario also implies that either all hair she now has was from enchanted hair she had in the womb, or all hair grown /after/ the in utero enchantment from the flower cure was also enchanted bit by bit as it emerged from the hair follicles. Infants are not generally born with the same thickness of hair that they will have later in life (this would result in absurdly thick baby hair, which does happen rarely), though they /are/ born with all the hair follicles they will ever possess. This again suggests that it is the hair follicles that are enchanted.

In both cases, consider that new sections of her existing hair (new hair growth on existing strands) has the enchantment, even though those are completely new molecules, generated (one assumes) from food eaten after the enchantment went into effect. This suggests it is the hair follicles that are enchanted to produce new molecules of the enchanted proteins.

The hair cut as an infant remains the same length, and her late, post-plot shots take place with her still having short hair. It seems to be physically different from normal human hair in that way, as it is shown after the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut][Dramatic Haircut]] always at the same length, just like the infant haircut. This points towards the non-super-hair being odd in some way.

Shed hair, or rather its lack, and the continuing growth of hair that maintains the enchantment strongly supports the hair follicle enchantment hypothesis. New super hair continues to grow in all places except where the enchantment is broken, at which point all existing hair and any more that is grown there (if any is, this is not clear) has different attributes that are still abnormal in growth period (either never falling out, or only growing short).

As we see no next-generation (the movie ends at that point), this isn't really something that can be approached. But the hair is still interesting.

--------------

From a story standpoint, having even the cut hair be strange is likely the most interesting angle. If I were plotting a rational story, I'd make shed hair occur, and have it become normal hair when it is lost. Have hair follicles from cut hair remember the length it was cut to when the enchantment was broken, and have it only grow for long enough to reach that length again. This is most interesting if the change is at the genetic level, changing how hair follicles work in a complex way, rather than just a "magic did it" cop-out. After all, functionally new cells of the hair follicles were grown from a magically altered genetic template, which could be passed on.

The origin would be hair follicles magically changed in utero. I'd make her nails not grow either, as they were all cut at some point and now have the same properties as the cut hair. And, given the twist at the end, the other genetic change was something in the protein-based [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears][prolactin or adrenocorticotropic hormone]] being enchanted. Those are hormones present in tears, but much more so in tears produced from emotional distress, as opposed to normal output. Strange but true.

I'd go with the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin][first]].

  Prolactin is secreted from the pituitary gland in response to eating, mating, estrogen treatment, ovulation, and nursing.

That one is also present in breast milk, btw.

Or it changes the second, possibly in addition to the magic effects making ACTH production have more or less umph, which might mean she has either Addison's disease or Cushing's Disease. Ouch. Interestingly enough, Addison's has coma as a symptom. So maybe it is genetic, affects ACTH, and sleeping beauty is her daughter. Sleeping Beauty has long (though not absurdly long) blond hair as well.

It *all fits*.
