Remember, this is a medieval, pseudo-feudal society in the movie, so a "rational" view of it is historically accurate, not filled with rational and well-educated actors. Rather the opposite.

And remember too that her power was passed on /genetically/ and included both uncut hair and [[#s][wow]]. So maybe Gothel will be darkly rational, but she /certainly/ won't be /darkest/, and might not be the most coldly rational either. There are certainly darker and more...functionally optimal fates than being locked in a tower for someone with the genetic code to immortality stuff to suffer.

I only have one compound word to say about that world made accurate and filled with intelligent people:

/Grimdark/.
