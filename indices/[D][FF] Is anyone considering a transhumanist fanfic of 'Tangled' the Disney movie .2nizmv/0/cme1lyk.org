If I knew how to structure it as a story, I would probably do it. There was this reference to /Tangled/ in /A Bluer Shade of White/:

  “Did you know,” he said as she came in, “That the princess of Corona had the power to heal people with her hair?”

  “I did,” said Elsa with a nod. “She lost the power when her hair was cut, if I recall.”

  “And yet it raises so many interesting questions, doesn't it?” asked the Duke. “How did the magic know what a healed person was like? How did it know what to fix and what to leave as it was? If a person lost a finger, would the magic have known what to make a new finger look like? It was fabled to even have the ability to reverse aging, yet how did it know to remove the wrinkles and tighten skin? It suggests either that the magic could read the intentions of the princess, or that there is some true platonic ideal which the magic was hewing to. The princess wasn't a surgeon of course, and yet it's claimed that she could heal a broken bone or even internal injuries without knowing the specifics of what was actually wrong.”

And it would be easy enough to pontificate on healing hair, and how it works, and what to do with it, but that's not actually a story. My first instinct would be to take it in the direction of [[http://qntm.org/jesus][The Jesus Machine]] (a part of /Ra/ that's somewhat disconnected from the plot), in that the inevitable result of someone with magical hair that heals people is that you try to maximize for total healing in a day and end up having to somehow limit people, given that the need for healing is greater than the ability to heal, /especially/ when that extends to old age, and /doubly especially/ when the cure for old age isn't permanent - it takes constant treatments or the anti-aging therapy wears off. To some extent you can have Queen Rapunzel sitting on her throne with her hair spread out into healing chambers that people are run through as quickly as possible (with the power always "on"), but even then, it's not really that exploitable, unless you can find the magic flower that made it possible in the first place.

/Anyway/, I don't know what you'd make the plot if you don't want to do a retread of the movie. And it's something that I've considered, but don't feel like writing, mostly because none of my ideas really grab me all that much. Maybe you do it as a character study of a (more) rational Mother Gothel whose motives are slightly more acceptable than vanity and a fear of her own death? Maybe I'm just not in the mood for a super dark rationalist at the moment. Either way, you have to set it when Rapunzel has her magical healing hair, which means during her captivity, during her adventure, or possibly in some alternate world where the plot of the movie is resolved without her cutting off her hair.

Rapunzel's character arc is that she's a naive girl who's curious about the world and does some growing up on her adventure. It's a compelling (if easy and well-worn) story. To make your own version of /Tangled/, you'd need some story that's equally compelling, but I just don't know what that would be. If you follow the pattern of serial escalation, then the story ends with everyone's disease being cured for all time, and the eradication of death from the world, but putting enough roadblocks into the way to make a reader interested is the big challenge.
