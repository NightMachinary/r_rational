I did notice the /Tangled/ reference when I was reading /A Bluer Shade of White/. In fact I was just thinking that the "platonic ideal" that the Duke refers to is obviously the individual's genome interpreted to an undamaged adult state.

I acknowledge that the 'most-good' implementation of Rapunzel's healing would quickly lead to a bottle neck and the inevitable corruption of the healing being prioritized towards the royal/noble families.

I will have to think about how to make the plot interesting. I am leaning towards a point-of-divergence where Flynn Rider stumbles on Rapunzel's tower and a much more formidable Gothel. Thanks for the outlining the challenges.
