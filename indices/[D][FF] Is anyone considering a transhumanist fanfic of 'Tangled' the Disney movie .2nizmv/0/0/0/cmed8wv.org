  In fact I was just thinking that the "platonic ideal" that the Duke refers to is obviously the individual's genome interpreted to an undamaged adult state.

I like the intuition model better, and I'll tell you why:

Let's say that there's a polydactyl baby born with six fingers on each hand. At the age of ten, the local chirurgeon amputates the boy's extra fingers, which don't have full extension and besides that make him a social outcast. At the age of twenty, he gets a deep cut across the palm of his hand, whereupon Rapunzel comes across him and uses her hair to heal him.

If we're following the genetic model (and assuming that her power can regrow body parts) he would incidentally end up with the new finger. Hell, if he had an appendix taken out, healing him might put it back in.

If we're following the intuition model, he would be healed, and perhaps the scar on the side of his hand would fade away to nothingness. And once she realizes that she's not bound by what someone is born with - that there's no need to add a finger back on - the natural progression is talking to this polydactyl man seeing whether she can use her power to remove his extra toes that never seemed like they were worth the bother. And once she's figured out that she can remove extra toes, then she can also figure out that maybe she can /add/ extra toes, and the progression eventually leads to "healing" in a form that's as extreme and escalated as the story can handle.

If you use genetics, you have to do some interpretation when it comes to "undamaged" anyway, given the sorts of genetic abnormalities that people can have (for example, Down's syndrome).
