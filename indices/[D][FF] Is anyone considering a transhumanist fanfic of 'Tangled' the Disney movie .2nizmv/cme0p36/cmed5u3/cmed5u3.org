  As I have to mention every time someone asks about making a specific rationalist fic: You could always write it yourself.

If I had gone and written every damn story I'd ever thought of, the following would exist:

- /Dune's Butlerian Jihad: [[http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Kwisatz_Haderach][Prescient Mutant Superhumans]] vs UFAI/
- Basically /Following the Phoenix/, which someone else actually /did/ write, thankfully.
- /The Communist Manifesto with [[http://gurrenlagann.wikia.com/wiki/Spiral_Energy][Spiral Power]]/ (free energy is invented: this breaks physics and logic /almost/ as badly as you think it does, and breaks society about as thoroughly as your average uncontrolled technological singularity... though every time they try to build AI it explodes, just to keep that particular easily-abusable power /out/ of the story). I swear I'm gonna get to this someday.
- [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure?from=Anime.JoJosBizarreAdventure][/Jojo's Well-Reasoned Adventure/]]
- /Chaitin's Number Î© and How to Weaponize It/ (will only ever exist conditional on Chaitin's Constant actually being usable as a weapon)
