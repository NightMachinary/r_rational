Well, for one, you wouldn't feed the flower to a pregnant lady. You'd just use the flower to heal her, and then try your damned hardest to get more flowers / a large vine shooting off the flower.

But...

7 billion people * 4 seconds to sing the "flower gleam and glow" song = 28 billion seconds to sing to the whole population.

Singing non-stop, it will take about 900 years to sing the entire population once, so you can't outrun death. However, if you can heal 100 people simultaneously, you can outrun death if each song completely re-fills the life meter. (It doesn't in canon AFAIK though)
