I doubt that'll work. Rapunzel is being emotionally abused by Mother Gothel. If you don't somehow incorporate that in the story, you're probably doing it a disservice.

Just a bit of brainstorming:

- Mother Gothel's manipulation becomes a lot better.
- Rapunzel knows about the methods of rationality from all her books (she reads and re-reads several per day, this is canon), but doesn't have a lot of actual knowledge about the world (and a major blindspot towards Gothel)
- Flynn is all about being instrumentally rational, but bad at coming up with worthwhile goals (he somehow really thinks that "an island that I own, tan and rested and alone, surrounded by enormous pikes of money" will actually make him happy.)

I think those can be worked with.
