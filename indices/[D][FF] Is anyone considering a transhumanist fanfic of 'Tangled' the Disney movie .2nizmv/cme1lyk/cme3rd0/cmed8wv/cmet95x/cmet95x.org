Precisely. By undamaged I meant without physical or age-related damage. Genetic abnormalities manifested before, say 18 years, wouldn't be fixable in this scenario. Personally I shy away from the intuition model, because apart from being over-powered, I cannot imagine a coherent model of how that would work. Rapunzel apparently doesn't possess any genetic/medical expertise to consciously direct such reshaping. Intuitive super-healing by a layperson almost implies a super-intelligent subconscious. The information has to come from /somewhere/.
