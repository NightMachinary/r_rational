The hair cut as an infant doesn't necessarily remember the same length. She might have just been cutting that hair for aesthetic reasons since it didn't matter anyway.

However, yeah - there's lots of cases for it not being normal hair beyond the healing. The hair can pull up heavy objects and restrain people so it's apparently super strong. It might have other properties as well, depending on how ridiculously athletic we decide Rapunzel is. She's either /really/ good at throwing it to grab objects because such things are possible in cartoons, or it is vaguely prehensile. It also doesn't seem to weigh her head down at all, and she uses it to carry objects that someone of her size and frame should not be capable of carrying. (Then again, Rapunzel is ridiculously good at /everything/ for someone locked in a tower and there are horses who understand speech and make complex inferences, so this might just be a case of all heroes being hyper-competent...)

So there's a good case for "it's pretty darn strong and so rarely sheds unless cut", but the whole prehensile thing also makes a case for "it has some some mechanism to deal with normal shedding, but cutting hurt it in the same way it would harm you if I cut off your arm but not if I rubbed it with a pumice stone".
