Only 2k words, disappointed in myself, but I still aced philosophy and Anthropology, which is neat I guess.

Criticising my work will leave me in a deeply emotional state: I will cry for weeks on end, drink copious amounts of the alcohols, and eat enough chocolate to put Queen Elizabeth to shame.

(I love critique, it's helped a lot)
