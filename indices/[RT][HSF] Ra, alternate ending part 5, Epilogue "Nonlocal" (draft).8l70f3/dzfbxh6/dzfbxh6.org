This new ending might be more satisfying to him in some technical way, but it's lifeless.

One thing I liked in the old ending was the judgmental verdict 'We find magic to be absurd'. That seemed like it came from the author's own anguished ambivalence. The whole story is a doomed attempt to synthesize magic and hard sci fi -- he kept looking for explanations but ultimately had to handwave it away under "nonlocality". One of the things I like about this book is that in its story of how King & co came to create their illusion of magic, it's also examining the urges that spawned itself -- why does someone who prioritizes logical rigor want to write a story about magic? The author can be seen as self-inhibiting due to this constant enchainment of his fantasy impulses with the requirement for logical backing, but that's part of the charm, and the fact that those impulses made him write Ra means they must be strong, at least strong enough to prompt a doomed war for synthesis.
