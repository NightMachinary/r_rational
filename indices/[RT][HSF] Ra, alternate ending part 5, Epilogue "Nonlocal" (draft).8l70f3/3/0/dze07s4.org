No, they'll die when the Sun runs out. That's likely to happen first, as the sim is running at less than realtime because it has low priority. They could be running hundreds of times slower than realtime, but it would be indistinguishable for people inside the sim.

They've been trapped inside an inescapable bubble with no way to interact with the outside universe, and no way to even calculate when their doom will come. It's certainly a bad end, albeit not as bad as just dying when the Earth exploded.
