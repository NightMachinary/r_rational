Could be, but I think it's the other way around. She mentions the world has low priority. Look at the whole quote:

#+begin_quote
  Being encrypted makes it impossible for any external force to materially interfere with the running of the virtuality, short of introducing wild corruption and causing a fatal crash. A crash is not impossible, if some heavyweight and hostile pre-existing denizen of the Ra ecosystem were to come gunning for the processing resources Kasta consumes. But why would it? It's running in the deepest available background, at the lowest possible priority, there are trillions of parallel processes to choose from, and meanwhile there's an entire unclaimed frontier of free solar power out there, unfolding minute by real minute.

  The Bridge was not able to supply Natalie with detailed information about Kasta's placement or the specific level of time compression allocated to it. Apparently, this latter factor is prone to some fluctuation. *Kasta can even suspend completely for long periods of real time, as a form of camouflage. Natalie's guess is that it averages out to somewhere within six orders of magnitude of real time.* But, she hurriedly clarifies, that's simply a guess.

I read this as meaning that it's slower, as it can even sometimes suspend for 'long periods of real time' and then afterwards it mentions the compression as an average including those periods of suspension.
