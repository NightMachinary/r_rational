Deranged, determined individuals with a lot of power.

It is currently possible for one person, working independently and alone, to build or purchase a weapon (perhaps a bomb or a gun) and use it to kill a few people, if they are intelligent and determined enough.

As technology develops, the amount of raw physical damage that a person is capable of dealing increases, while humans are not generally getting physically tougher.

It is conceivable (although not necessarily feasible) that in the far future, science and technology will advance to the point that a small group of highly deranged, capable individuals would be capable of dealing catastrophic damage to the human race as a whole.
