What, precisely, would you consider the difference between self-replicating nanotech and genetically engineered bacteria to be?

Grey goo is a classic SF fear, but it doesn't seem particularly plausible; in the end, these things need to power themselves somehow, which significantly reduces the stuff they can realistically eat / self-replicate from. There needs to be an energetic chemical pathway from raw materials to more of themselves, and bacteria have already taken up all the easy examples of those niches.
