  This isn't just stock "Eurabia" rambling

There's also, you know, /Da3esh/. They appear to have averted the whole "Eurabia" deal by starting what is quite nearly a third World War in the Middle East. It's only our luck that the rest of the world is /already/ tired of dealing with our region's shit.

Of course, in a weird way, Da3esh's war in the Middle East has the /upside/ consequences that the rest of the world is /finally/ making real moves to get off oil, since they're /finally/ seeing that it's too damn volatile and entangles them in a nasty piece of work of a region.
