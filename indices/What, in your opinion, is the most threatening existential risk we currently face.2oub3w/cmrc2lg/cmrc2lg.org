What do you mean by "existential"? End of civilization, end of humanity, or end of life on Earth in general?

There is currently nothing that I consider a plausible existential threat toward life on Earth or even to humanity as a species. We're extremely resilient and extremely widespread, we'd easily survive any of the mass extinction events that Earth has experienced in the past half billion years or so. It would take an unprecedented cosmic event to make Earth uninhabitable, an out-of-nowhere gigantic impactor for example. We can't make it sufficiently bad via climate change or nuclear war for humanity to be at risk.

As for ending our civilization, a full-scale nuclear war seems like the most likely plausible way to do it in the near term. I don't consider climate change that big a threat because it happens slowly enough that our civilization will adapt, even if it degrades us somewhat.

I don't consider AI to be a near term threat either. Long term, maybe, but only insofar as it will render humanity increasingly obsolescent rather than having a computer wake up one day and decide to Destroy All Humans. It's certainly not something we /currently/ face, though.
