Depends on the costs, really. If bioprinters can be purchased for thousands of dollars, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, then that puts them within reach of private individuals, doomsday cults, or terrorist organizations. "People will have bioprinters on their desktops" is a somewhat hyperbolic way of putting it, but low level biofabrication getting cheap is a real threat if the engineering and production side of things gets widespread.
