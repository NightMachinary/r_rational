[[http://www.pdfernhout.net/beyond-a-jobless-recovery-knol.html][Beyond a Jobless Recovery]] speculates on this problem and how to deal with it as a society.

The most promising option is basic income, possibly in conjunction with reduced work weeks, eliminating or reducing minimum wage, and earlier retirement.

The most likely option, I think, is homelessness, reduced lifespans, rioting, and imprisonment, with a sprinkling of charity.
