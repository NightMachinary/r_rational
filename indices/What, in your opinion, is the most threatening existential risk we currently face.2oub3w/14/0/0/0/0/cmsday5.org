  Artificial neural networks are, in my books, always de novo AGI. They're not realistic models of the actual brain in their current form -- but they are useful.

I think this is the key to our disagreement. I expect attempts at modeling animal and human brains to lead to discoveries that can be directly applied to artificial neural networks. So our first AGI wouldn't be an upload per se, but rather an artificial neural network directly influenced by animal or human neural models.

Anyway I think I understand your view better now so we can have more productive exchanges on this subreddit in the future.
