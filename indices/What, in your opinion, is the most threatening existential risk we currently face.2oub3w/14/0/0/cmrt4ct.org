Not really to start a debate, but could you just give your reasons here? Deepmind is really impressive, but I would still expect them to have a lot of work to do to get to human level AGI. I don't think we know that just extending Deepminds's techniques to a large enough neural network will result in a complete intelligence. MIRI on the other hand... I can see how their work might be useful in the future, but don't think they've yet come up with anything that is even implementable on finite computing resources in finite time.

For mind uploading, the progress has been slow, but I expect it to pick rapidly as the goal gets closer. Right now, the Blue Brain project has simulated the cortical column of a rat. This technique has been shown to be successful, it is just a matter of extending it to more types of neurons, and more neurons. It is still decades of research for doing this with a human, but it will just be a matter of time. I've read estimates claiming 2023 for a human brain. Even allowing for significantly more time, I would still expect them to be working on a human brain by 2030-2040.

If anything, I expect efforts like Deepmind to benefit from the study of biological neurons and neural networks. Principles found in biological neural networks feed into artificial neural network research.

So just tell me why you think DeepMind or MIRI will succeed by 2030-2040. Also, it might be helpful in future discussions if we differentiate how much biological inspiration to artificial neural networks means they are no longer de novo AGI.
