My vote goes to things from space damaging the planet or its orbit. If it ends up being our own fault though, it will probably involve big explosives.

That said, there's lots of /other/ horrible things which could go wrong that don't necessarily end humanity forever but do kill /most/ of it - like, say, ecological collapse.
