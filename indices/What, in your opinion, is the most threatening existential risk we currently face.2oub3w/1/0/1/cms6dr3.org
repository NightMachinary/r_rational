Basically what [[/u/eaglejarl]] said. I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that a man-made nanobot (or engineered bacteria for that matter) would be more effective than something cobbled together by evolution. And they only really need to be good at deconstructing one specific thing - an engineered bacteria that was good at eating through trees would be nearly as deadly to humanity as one that could eat through anything, because it could cause a total ecosystem collapse.
