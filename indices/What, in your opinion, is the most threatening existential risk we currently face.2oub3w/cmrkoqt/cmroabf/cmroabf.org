It's not literal infertility though, right? People aren't losing the biological ability to have children, it's just that people in developed nations are /choosing/ not to have them.

So long as it is a choice, I suspect it will balance out. If nothing else, we'll start seeing governments paying people to have kids -- the opposite of China's only-one policy.
