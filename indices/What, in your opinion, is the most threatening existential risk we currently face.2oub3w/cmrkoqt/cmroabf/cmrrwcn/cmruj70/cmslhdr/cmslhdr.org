There are a lot of possible reasons from all of the chemicals we constantly put in our food, to just simply people having more trouble because they are waiting until their mid-thirties to reproduce, to some [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/l5/evolving_to_extinction/][genetic mutations]], to another million possible reasons why. No one has any clear idea (or hasn't told the rest of us yet) and I feel that's what most people are more concerned about.

I have to say though, the first thing I thought of when I first heard about this was, 'Thank goodness! We can actually get our population under control before a Malthusian catastrophe occurs.'
