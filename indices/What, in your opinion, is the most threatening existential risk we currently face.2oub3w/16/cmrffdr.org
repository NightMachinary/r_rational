I'm thinking that most of the conventional anthropogenic scenarios lead to about the same place: a resource-depletion foom that leads to proto-industrial technological stasis.

- It could just happen on its own; consumption is always going to overtake production if you don't get into space, and it will at the very least radically change the nature of modern economics as we know it (which will make solving the problem harder).
- Nuclear wars might very well be "survivable", in the sense that in spite of most of the world dying, a significant population could probably scrounge together micronutrients/food whatever for a few decades (it's far from unprecedented, especially with intelligent actors). By the time anthropogenic x-risk becomes a problem again, a foom is just that more likely.
- Pandemics are similar to nuclear war. Even a particularly virulent one would still leave founder populations (e.g. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sentinel_Island][North Sentinel Island]], the highlands of Papua New Guinea, possibly paranoid survivalist compounds and large ships if the incubation is short enough).
- A somewhat strange, but remotely plausible possibility is a economy-smashing demographic or political crisis. This isn't just stock "Eurabia" rambling, there are lots of potential vectors. Japan is barely holding together very deeply ingrained social structures. I have no idea what's going to happen if Putin dies (or slowly goes senile). Mexico could go up in (even more) flames. China's rapid development will slow down, and has a ceiling due to the inherent constraints of an authoritarian culture on ability to train hackers and academics. The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiverfull][Quiverfull movement]] could catch on somewhere. All of these only take one or two 9/11-scale political upheavels to trigger.
- Climate change, anthropogenic or otherwise, is always on the table, but I think the timescales and effects involved make this unlikely to occur before one of the other outcomes.

Both the transhuman program and space expansion need a lot of financial and political capital and raw materials. This might not be feasible with the resources and ideologies that would be left after one of the preceding events.

What comes after this depends on the specific circumstances, but given that it will probably settle on an eventual steady state of manual-labor-intensive agriculture, it does not take much imagination to see how it could be /terrifying/.
