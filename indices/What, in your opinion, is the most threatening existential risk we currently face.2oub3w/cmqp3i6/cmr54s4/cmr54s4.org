An exploding population means growing food requirements. On the other hand, insufficient nutrition means pregnancy is much more dangerous, which should drive down the population even if rations are just barely enough to keep people alive in normal conditions.

And if rations are below what keeps people alive in normal conditions, people start dying in droves. Problem solved, albeit in a nasty way.
