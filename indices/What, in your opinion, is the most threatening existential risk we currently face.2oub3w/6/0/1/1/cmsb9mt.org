We can deal with asteroids, yes. This is dependent on three factors.

1. When do we spot them? The later we spot them the less well slow but cheap methods work. Your method may be slow.

2. How big is it? Something really big is going to need a lot of fuel to deal with it or really big bombs.

3. What do we have available to hit them with? If a specialized craft has to be built this is less likely to happen.
