Going too much into depth about how we can deal with asteroids in this thread would probably get us loaded with lots of negative karma, so we probably want to keep it brief.

Yes, we have to know they are there to do anything about them, and the farther away they are when we see them, the better.

The larger the detection envelope is, the larger the reaction envelope will be.

The larger the reaction envelope is, the less force will be required to push the asteroid off of a collision trajectory.

The larger the asteroid is, the more fuel will be required to deal with it, but again, the reaction envelope is important. The sooner we act, the less force will be required.

With our current technology, and no space industry, the simplest solution would probably be to rapidly manufacture small, simple rockets to be carried into space by larger rockets. The large rockets then unload their small rocket cargo and the small rockets could then be launched from Earth orbit and carry nuclear warheads to the asteroid.

If humanity ever bothers to actually start a real space industry, our options for dealing with asteroids become far more attractive. In fact, with a strong near-Earth industrial capacity, humanity would probably be more than happy to discover meteors on intercept orbits with Earth, because we could capture them with minimal fuel costs as compared to trying to haul them out of the asteroid belt.
