I'm honestly not sure: are we able to build a gigaton nuke? Largest ever was only 50 megatons.

Even if we can, how would we get it there? We currently have nothing capable of launching to beyond LEO. We do still have the plans for a Saturn V -- I think; I've read that they were lost -- but could we build, test, launch, and have it arrive in time?

If the asteroid came from the inner system (e.g. an Apollo), we quite possibly wouldn't see it until it hit us, as the sun would be behind it. Even if it comes from the outer system and were spotted with fifty or a hundred years on the clock, I would be worried about people procrastinating and / or arguing about who should put in how much funding etc that we never actually deal with it in time.

Nuking the asteroid head-on would likely not help -- at most it would break it into smaller chunks with the same mass and they would still hit us. If they were small enough then /maybe/ they would all burn up, but I question the ability of mankind to build and deploy a weapon capable of vaporizing or thoroughly decomposing a 10km chunk of nickel-iron.

If we hit it at an angle then maybe we could deflect it enough that it would miss us, but that would rely on having detected it early enough, which isn't a certainty.

What safeguards would we build on a fast-takeoff AI that would ensure our safety?

What safeguards would we build on nanotech that would ensure our safety?

Assuming such safeguards exist, once nanotechnology / AI is real, it will become cheap enough to be accessible to construction by small groups and corporations. With enough labs building it, someone will be careless or crazy or stupid or evil enough not to incorporate the safeguards.
