Yep, agreed on all points. If we were to collapse /now/, I would have no fear of our ability to restart. But what if we collapse in a century or two, when the easily accessible coal has been exhausted? Hydro and wind are only useful in certain places...

Hm, actually, hydro seems to have pretty good energy supply -- a quick search says that China produced 721 Tw/hr in 2010. Maybe that /would/ be enough to restart.

Cool, thanks.
