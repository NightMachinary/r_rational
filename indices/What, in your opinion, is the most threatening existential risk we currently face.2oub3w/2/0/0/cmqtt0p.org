One additional thing that worries me about civilization collapse: we've used up a lot of the easily available fossil fuel and other resources. Going from our current state to "unlimited" energy (fusion, lots of fission, space based solar) is quite doable. If we had to start technology over from scratch, would we be able to get across the leap from steam to any of those methods, or have we / will we have used up the intermediate energy sources?
