There are two strikes against Thorium reactors in the united states:

1. It is a metal salt reactor. /The united states is a traditionalist mentality in nuclear power due to the cultural horror bias that forces American nuclear power to be */very** conservative and risk adverse beyond our strong and sensible planning, testing, and design risk aversions. The point being modern U.S. Nuclear power basically is entirely descendant from the legacy of Rickover and proven pressurized water reactors with certain negative feedback coefficients. This culture [basing on myself] shows associates metal salt reactors with contamination due to some of the problems Russians had with their metal salt reactors, and well a thorium reactor is a thorium fluoride reactor, which screams corrosion to me before I look much deeper into the chemistry.*

2. It's a breeder reactor: /Look at the treaties on nuclear proliferation. It's pretty hard to differentiate safe fuel producing reactors from producing weapons fissabels, it's basically a difference of concentrations, but the regulation questions makes it very hard and risky on the bureaucrat size, and in an industry where you have to pay government inspectors at ~300 USD a hour to check your designs you have a hard time going with a design that might risk concern against international treaties./
