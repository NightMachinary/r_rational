Nuclear war, certainly.

It seems like all cataclysms have a sweet spot of technological development where they could wipe out the human species. Well, perhaps a "bitter spot" is a better name for it.

Earthquakes or disease are too late - we've been dealing with those for our civilisation's entire history, and we've got good enough infrastructure to handle everything that's been thrown at us so far. Diseases aren't getting more advanced, but healthcare is. Arguably, a species-killing epidemic would have an easier time spreading across nations and continents, since we've got aeroplanes now... but I think it's safe to say that we're better equipped to deal with pandemics than we ever were before.

Nanotechnology and AI are too early - the technology to create them simply doesn't exist, and I find it unlikely that anyone working on any top-secret project has beaten the cutting edge by enough to change that.

Nukes work, they're here now, and the only reason we haven't already been wiped out is that the people with the keys are under a lot of pressure to not use them. If the apocalypse arrived tomorrow, I'd wager that it would be a nuclear one.
