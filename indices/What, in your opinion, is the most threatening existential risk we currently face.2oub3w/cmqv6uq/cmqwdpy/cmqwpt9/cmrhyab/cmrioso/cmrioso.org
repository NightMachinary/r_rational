  You are dismissing illness as the MAJOR THREAT because we've invented some medications? Antibiotics, pesticides and any other wiggly-killer will become outdated as high-replication rates put a selective pressure seeking novel mutations for survival.

Precisely. Reckless usage of antibiotics will cause new strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to emerge... and then we'll only be back where we were before antibiotics were invented. Slightly better off, even, since antibiotic-resistant strains are often less robust in other ways.

And if super-powered insta-kill pandemics were possible, we'd have seen them before, and our species would never have survived to this point. /And/ they'd have still happened if we didn't use antibiotics. Germs don't gain more XP for defeating our countermeasures, they become adapted to the environment they find themselves in (i.e. ones with antibiotics) and less adapted to environments that they're not in (ones without antibiotics).

Compare and contrast with weapons designed by human ingenuity to defeat human ingenuity. MAD has worked so far, but all it takes to break it is one General Ripper to go insane at the right place and the right time. And I don't care for plans that require a large number of unknown people to always act in the sane and sensible manner. People are crazy.
