Well, to be fair, isn't the less wrong guy (the one who wrote the harry potter fanfic) more of a blogger than a scientist (not that the two are mutually exclusive; plenty of established scientists have blogs)?

The Bible's many authors weren't scientists either, but it's a lot more popular, and therefore more likely a priori to be the subject of an offhand reference. Though perhaps someone like Asimov or Sagan would be even likelier.
