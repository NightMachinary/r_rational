"What's the status of the project?"

"Not very good. I don't understand why all of the civilizations keep self-destructing before they reach [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale][Type I]]."

"Are they self-destructing in the same way?"

"That's the annoying part. I anticipated certain failure points such as the environmental, technological, and biological disasters, but they keep finding a different way to destroy themselves. The latest one failed due to poor social engineering. They ended up making everyone happy and in love with each other. But without any ambition, they stagnated and their birth rates fall so fast that they went extinct within a generation. It's enough to wear on my patience."

"Maybe the problem isn't with your methods, but your efficiency."

"Sir?"

"Instead of trying to anticipate everything, let them learn how to anticipate the future and notice potential failures instead of having them 'naturally' evolve into an advanced society."

"Hmm, that could work. If I let them do the work for me, they would be able to notice and prevent the problems occurring at the micro-scale, allowing me to focus on managing the macro-time scale. That will require teaching them rather advanced skills of thought at an unusually early stage. Maybe if I nudge one of their scientists into disguising the lessons as one of their popular works of literature....."
