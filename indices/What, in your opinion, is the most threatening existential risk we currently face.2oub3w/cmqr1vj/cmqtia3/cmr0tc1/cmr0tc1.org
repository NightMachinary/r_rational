There is a way that we could fairly trivially deal with almost any size asteroid, by using remote fuel methods to deliver a rocket and fuel to them in order to simply push them a bit so they miss Earth, and then either capture them or push them into a solar intersecting orbit.

It would actually be fairly trivial, and we could do it with existing technology, with minimal engineering. One of the biggest hang-ups we have in space is this painful adherence to wanting to carry all of the fuel required for a mission as a single lump, when we've had the technology for decades that would allow us to remotely fuel vessels in space, outside of orbit, much like in-flight refueling.

The rocket equation tells us we need hugely stupid amounts of fuel to generate lots of delta-v, but the space science community doesn't seem to have picked up on the fact that carrying all the fuel at once is no longer necessary, which in turn throws everything we know about high delta-v missions on it's ear.
