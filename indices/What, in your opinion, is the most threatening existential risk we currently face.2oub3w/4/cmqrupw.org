Well, I'll be the first to say AI by a big margin. The rest either won't result in extinction, are incredibly unlikely, or both. They also have the advantage of being obviously bad. Like if we detected an asteroid on a collision course we wouldn't be worrying about whether it was harmful, we would throw everything at it. We've also had the tech to wreck the Earth for some time and haven't done so. So I don't see why nanotech, super bugs etc, would change that.
