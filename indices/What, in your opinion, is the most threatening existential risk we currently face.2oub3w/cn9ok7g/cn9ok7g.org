I see three: Pandemics, Meteor strikes, Economical collapse due to the 'bot revolution, and UFAI coming after the 'bot revolution.

For reference: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU]['Bot revolution]].

Economical collapse is not an existential risk per-se, but I could see it being managed poorly and amplifying the current trends of inequality instead of equalizing society and moving us towards a post-scarcity society.

Essentially what is depicted in [[http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm][Manna]].

With the rise of advanced approximate learning algorithms, I don't think UFAI is far off. It scares me shitless, tbh, and I hope we can notice it being evil and kill it with nukes before it gets too smart.
