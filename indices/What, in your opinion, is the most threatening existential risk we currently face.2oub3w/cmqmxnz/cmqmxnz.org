Here are my current fears, in order of already happening to far fetched:

*Economic Ecological Apocalypse*\\
Food instability driven by changing weather patterns, water shortages exacerbated by groundwater pollution and hydroelectric projects, the collapse of industries that rely on cheap consistently available oil, and climate-enabled health crises gradually worsen until all of the small factors combine and the global economy collapses in a flashpoint, marked by superpower proxy wars for control of [rivers, pipelines, shale gas] and civil unrest with an isolationist anti-intellectual theme. This may not be an extinction event (for humans anyway), but it won't be a lot of fun.

*Global Thermonuclear War / The Fallout Premise*\\
A world ending nuclear war seems far fetched right now, but it would probably only take a generation or so of a government evolving in the wrong direction before it might be willing to threaten its resource rivals (after all, that's all it took to go from the cold war to current global politics). Actually, Putin would only have to be a little bit more insane for us to be there already.

*Runaway Climate Change*\\
I haven't seen a lot of evidence that runaway climate change can be triggered by a 2C rise, but who thinks that global warming will be restricted to that in the following decades and centuries? If the most pessimistic of climate scientists are right we could end up Venusing the Earth over the next few centuries. I'm not urgently afraid of this, but we're getting into less likely territory.

*Solar Flare*\\
A big solar flare could knock out unshielded technology on earth. Humanity would probably survive, but I'm not sure civilization could. This could probably be inserted into the list more accurately by looking at how often they happen compared to asteroid impacts, but this is in fear order, not probability order.

*Asteroid Impact*\\
An oldie, but a goodie. Not particularly exciting or glamorous, but we know it happens, it's happened before, and even if we see the asteroid with humanity's name on it years in advance there's no guarentee we'd be able to generate the technology (or even, a cracked and jaded part of me thinks, the political will) to tractor it off course.

*Cronus Apocalypse*\\
I'm lumping all of the extinction events where one of humanity's technological children kills its creator, either by bug or malice. Terminator, Matrix, Grey Goo and Paperclip all own less of my fear space than even an asteroid impact - not only would we have to make a lot of mistakes to get there, but we're going into it with our eyes so wide open. There are already a lot of smart people thinking about how to avoid this.

*Exotic Physics*\\
These are fun ones. We either accidentally generate strange matter or are hit by a roaming quark star, and the whole Earth is converted to strangelets over a period of time. Maybe strangelet production in colliders is the great filter? Fun. Also - a vacuum metastability event. Not necessarily possible or likely, but the untimely end of the /entire universe/ has to get an honorable mention.
