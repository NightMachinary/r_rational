  After World War II, uranium-based nuclear reactors were built to produce electricity. These were similar to the reactor designs that produced material for nuclear weapons. During that period, the U.S. government also built an experimental [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor][molten salt reactor]] using U-233 fuel, the fissile material created by bombarding thorium with neutrons. The reactor, built at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory][Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], operated [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass][critical]] for roughly 15000 hours from 1965 to 1969. In 1968, Nobel laureate and discoverer of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium][Plutonium]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Seaborg][Glenn Seaborg]], publicly announced to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission][Atomic Energy Commission]], of which he was chairman, that the thorium-based reactor had been successfully developed and tested:
