Energy wouldn't be too bad, really. Solar power generators date to the 19^{th} century and don't really require any materials that couldn't be obtained with... traditional, let's say, methods.

It's the materials that are derived from petrochemicals that would be annoying to do without. Without even going in to all the materials surrounding you made from plastic, think of all the fertilizer and people supported by that fertilizer that is currently derived from fossil fuel resources. Feeding everyone currently on the planet while lacking the benefits of the green revolution would be taxing to say the least.
