  I'm pretty sure one of us is telepathically stealing thoughts from the other.
#+end_quote

One of the following questions can be answered from information you have available to you, and the other requires telepathic contact: What is the name of my [[http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Stand][Stand]], and who is best pony?

#+begin_quote
  So, what advice would you give to yourself 10 years ago?
#+end_quote

This is going to get pretty rambly. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNBVzfFApIU][Theme tune go!]]

Are you /actually/ 15 years old? This matters. LW is already a club of relatively similar people, so we probably /are/ very similar people, but the kinds of things I should say to you vary dramatically based on how old you are, what sort of life situation you're in, and what kind of upbringing you had.

For instance, if I /really/ had to talk to myself 10 years ago, I'd say: I fully understand how screwed-up you feel and how fucked-up the world looks to you, but you really need to take a major upgrade to your self-discipline, your work-ethic, and your ability to fool people you don't like into getting along with you professionally, because /you are wasting our precious time/. I mean, I got into university at age 17-18, and got in at a pretty good institution, with honors, but there's a hell of a lot I /didn't/ do because I had far too much of a sense of signaling, an overly cynical view of people, an overly simplistic and cynical view of the world, and very little sense of goals besides "try to get by and have some fun while I'm at it."

I came out a pretty ok, intelligent, decently-off person at age 21, but was burned out at 22 and depressed later into 22 and for the early part of 23, made a decision at 23 that /kinda/ messed me up pretty badly in retrospect for 23-25, and /God only knows/ what I'm going to retroactively realize was a total fuck-up next.

So... rambly advice to a younger person who's the general sort of person I used to be...

- Most people's models of the world are /faaaar/ too simplistic, as a result of which they believe in stupid bullshit like fate and inevitability. /Not only/ is going beyond the impossible and kicking logic to the curb /an awesome way to live/, but /additionally/, the more /specific and in-depth/ knowledge you gain of fields, people, events, everything, the more you realize that history is mostly governed by sheer entropy. Things don't happen because they /have/ to happen, but often because they were just the most likely thing to happen against a background of general unmanaged chance.

- It follows that your ability to increase the orderliness of the world, to optimize for outcomes you want, increases /super/-linearly with marginal increases or improvements in your tools: knowledge, wealth, friends, social skills, privilege of birth, all of it. [[http://gurrenlagann.wikia.com/wiki/Spiral_Energy][In this sense, /Spiral Power is entirely real./]] Most people believe the increase is linear: this is because /most people on the planet/ start from such a /phenomenally/ underprivileged place in life that they have to exert large amounts of their optimization power /just to stay alive/, they've got such a large constant factor to overcome that they never reach the portion of the curve where the returns become superlinear. But if you actually /understand/ what's happening and can do /something/ about it, /anything at all/, you can usually overpower the sheer, unoptimized /entropy/ that normally runs things. Of course, beware unintended consequences, but that's how reasoning and decision-making /always/ work out...

- [[http://blog.jaibot.com/?page_id=5][Almost no-one is evil, almost everything is broken]], [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][/but most people worship evil gods./]] They don't /think/ they worship evil gods, they often don't think they /worship/ anything at all, but by and large, they devote their emotions and actions to things that they would not, on reflection, actually live with -- or even /teach themselves to stop caring/ about [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat][what actually happens]]. The Right Thing is the one for which you can reply to "And then what?" with [[http://xkcd.com/810/]["MISSION. FUCKING. ACCOMPLISHED."]] And unfortunately, trying to /tell/ most people that their gods are evil will simply land you with accusations of having something wrong with /you/, so you can't often talk about this stuff without caging the whole conversation first.

- There are far more wonderful things and people in Heaven and Earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy. As you get older and find your way to more people who're /your kind of people/, you are going to find that you're not nearly as alone in the world as you think you are. But then again, you might be older than strictly 10 years younger than me, and hopefully had a much better childhood than I did. Hopefully you've /already got/ the friends and loved ones that took me a long time to get.

- If you /don't/ already have enough friends and loved ones, a good criterion is to find people around whom you don't have to [[http://he.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hide%20Your%20Power%20Level][hide your powerlevels]]. You're going to be perpetually bitter and resentful at the world until you stop trying to be /normal/ and go be yourself with /someone/, anyway. "Being yourself" is not actually about signaling "honestly" and somehow magically getting friends; it's actually about the /fact/ that some things about you are just terminally valued and you don't /want/ to change them, when you consider everything, so fuck it, just live that way and make the friends who /like/ you that way.

- Blah blah stay away from drugs, debt, and cults; learn a lot of math and science in school; exercise and eat vegetables blah blah

Now, if we're going to continue this, instead of my rambling nonspecifically, we should make a Life Advice Thread on [[/r/LessWrongLounge]] and you should tell me your general life circumstances and goals and such, the better to +exploit you to my own ends+ tell you things that actually help you get what you want.
