I worry about the small things like the economic upset from Walmart (or whoever) automating its workforce, other companies having to do the same and then massive unemployment, Ferguson style riots, a complete loss of control in america and the rest of the world collapsing with us.

Sort of a Elysium style apocalypse. Not necessarily an extinction event, but enough of a slowdown that we remain a single planet species for an extra hundred years and catch a rogue asteroid for our stupidity.
