I disagree -- to put it colloquially ala Ian Malcolm: "Life finds a way."

You are dismissing illness as the MAJOR THREAT because we've invented some medications? Antibiotics, pesticides and any other wiggly-killer will become outdated as high-replication rates put a selective pressure seeking novel mutations for survival.

We are guiding the hand of evolution.

Frankly, an existential threat I worry about is the next terraforming microorganism that becomes ubiquitous. Precursors to chloroplasts flooded Earth with potent oxidants and poisoned the air, causing massive extinction with OXYGEN. Who know what sort of changes could terraform our planet in terrible ways that we can't escape, even if we come up with gravity equations to float to Saturn? (think Blight from Interstellar, except it is infectious and removes the only source of sustenance and air for a species of consumers, reliant on OTHER creatures for energy.
