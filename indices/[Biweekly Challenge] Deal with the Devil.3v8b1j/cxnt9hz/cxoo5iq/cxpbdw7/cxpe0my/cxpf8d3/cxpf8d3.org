Don't assume 10 years per sword holder. The tribe would raise their little cult of prospective bearers by the dozens, if not more, and would often kill one off after a few months, depending on their needs. Of course, this was framed as "honoring the tribe" or some other such thing, so they were more than happy to do it. Plus, if you go too long without completing your request, the undead may just attack you and kill you, if the curse feels that you won't respond to any of its attempts to make you actually complete your quest. So 10 years is too generous. Especially considering that it may take them 3-4 tries to find a cursed bearer with an appropriately worded quest to facilitate their war mongering.

Killing off the souls won't buy you that much time, since they keep respawning if you're not completing your quest. Not to mention, even though it needs you to acknowledge them, they could easily kill tons of people before seeking you out, like the hoodied guy did. Sticking your head in the sand will probably only make things worse, as they'll just keep escalating or kill you.
