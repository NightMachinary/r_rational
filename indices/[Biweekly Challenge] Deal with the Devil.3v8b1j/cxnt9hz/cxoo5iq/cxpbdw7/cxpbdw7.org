The sword's ancient. No one's sure where it originated from, but the earliest records have it appearing as the center piece of a tribe that ruled what is now South America. This was over a thousand years ago, although there's no specific date available. More details for this are in one of my comment replies. Check that for more info for a response to your first and third comment.

Acknowledged doesn't mean they need to be seen. They just need to know you're aware of them. Blinding yourself wouldn't help (plus the curse would probably heal you anyway) as they could easily track you down, and assault you. Or give you a message in brail. Their point is more to be sure the bearer is aware of them, as opposed to having anything specific to say, so getting "acknowledgement" would be pretty damn easy.

The sword doesn't stop aging. It heals your wounds, and pretty much prevents you from getting any as well, but you still age. It's kind of dumb, in that it only heals things along the lines of direct physical trauma/pain, so bullet wounds, stab wounds, punches, etc. You can still get a cold, you just probably won't develop the headache that comes with it. Your nose would just run. So, anyway, you'd die from something eventually.

The curse doesn't give you a script, word for word, more an insistent feeling towards what would be ideal. It has no control over the outside realm, after all, so it filters what input it gleans from the user and forms that into the "feeling" that it gives the bearer. It's sort of like the difference between being given a script and being given flash cards. And its "impossibility" is more in the moral implications, in this case anyway. The sword HAS given physically impossible quests before, but most of the time, the sword's requests are geared towards causing the host huge amounts of suffering. In this case, we have Isaac, who's going to become closer to God, so his guilt towards what he needs to do is going to grow exponentially. Plus, he's going to have a very interesting time being a gay priest, what with Christianity's general abhorrence of it.

As far as valuing lives over your own, the charity thing isn't a great example, as you technically have nothing to do with them being in their situation. You didn't personally starve out any of those villages in Africa, so it's easier for you to justify not doing anything about it. You don't feel responsible. The trolley problem is real. Plus, outside of a few commercials and ads, you're not hearing too much about the situation anyway, so it's not really on your mind. As opposed to undead monsters rising up and killing people, and making it clear they are doing it solely because of your actions. Seeing something like that on 7 news would hit you a lot harder than seeing another red cross commercial. And also, while the sword makes you fairly tough, you are by no means unkillable.
