Your argument is flawed. Or you're misunderstanding mine.

Firstly, let's addressing wanting to want. You can want to want something. A whole lot. But if you just "want to want" something instead of "wanting" it, then you don't, for whatever reason under the sun it may be, desire it enough to truly progress towards being able to accomplish it. At least not at that particular point in time. And yes, you can argue that Isaac wants to kill himself, via his actions. But he doesn't. He really doesn't. Otherwise, the blade would go straight to his heart, no questions asked. The very fact that it doesn't is a *direct expression of his lack of wanting it ENOUGH*. That's canon.

Voice = Brave warrior, brought up as brainwashed sect member, taught to be willing to die *from birth* in a primitive,tribal setting (aka people died alot anyway, due to constant fighting, lack of health care, etc.), lost everything once he ran from village

Isaac = Average American kid in 2015, fears eternal damnation after death, has his whole life ahead of him.

Is it not obvious why one would find it so much easier to commit suicide? Paleo humanity isn't unique in being self-sacrificial at all. But the sect of trabilistic warriors raised to be suicidal on command are most certainly more capable of killing themselves, than your average young adult. Not to mention, as if his upbringing wasn't enough, you don't know what circumstances the voice underwent that enabled him to be in the mindset needed to kill himself. Considering he broke away from centuries of tradition, and everything he knew, we can assume some pretty crazy shit went down, right?

TL;DR: Voice > Isaac at killing self. Obvi. GG.
