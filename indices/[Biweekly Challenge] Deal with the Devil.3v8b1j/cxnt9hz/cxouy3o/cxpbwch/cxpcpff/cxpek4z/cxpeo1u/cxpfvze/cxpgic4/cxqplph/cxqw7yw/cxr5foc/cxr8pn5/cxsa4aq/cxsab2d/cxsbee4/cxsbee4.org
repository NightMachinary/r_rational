Technically speaking, I could point out that the very existence of this world by my pen (keyboard) means that I dictate how its humans work. And I could be a dick and say "Well, my humans are just like humans except [insert authorial fact about misc. shit here]" and I'd win in court. But I'm not going to do that. Because that's an obviously idiotic way to handle this, in my opinion.

What Isaac is doing is the equivalent of standing on a stool, putting his head through a noose, but being too afraid to kick out the stool. He's stabbing himself, but he's so durable that he's still capable of bitching out while stabbing himself at full strength. It's an instinctive flinching away from his demise. In the same way you might kick the stool out from under yourself, but be wanting to live as you're nearing the end of your rope (no pun intended) The curse requires more commitment than that. It needs you to be so willing to die that you would be in a noose, step off the stool, and refuse to put your feet back on it, up to your last conscious thought. You would be drowning, and you would refuse to reach for the hand offered, up to the point where you lost consciousness. That's the sort of mindset you would need.

Isaac...doesn't have that. He doesn't want to die enough that he'd suffer through all of that without saving himself. He doesn't want to save those people enough to do that.
