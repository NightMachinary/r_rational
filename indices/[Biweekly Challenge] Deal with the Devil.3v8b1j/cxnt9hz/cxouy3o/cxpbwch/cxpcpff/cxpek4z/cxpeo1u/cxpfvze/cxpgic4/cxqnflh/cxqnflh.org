If you want a Watsonian explanation, there are plenty of possibilities that retain consistency. The voice might not have a complete understanding of how the blade works and is only making an educated guess as to the requirements (he has only the data from when he killed himself, plus potentially some recursive guidance from previous wielders, of similar dubiousness, which potentially can reach back to the blade's origin but also might suffer from the telephone effect). The blade might not be able to actually determine one's "true desires" (which would make sense, if as you posit those do not exist), but instead makes a check for the existence of any conflict in the decision. The blade might alter Isaac's preferences at the critical moment, and then present that alteration in a way believable to Isaac (who, as the story suggests, is somewhat of a spiritual person and so likely to believe in something like "true desire"). Or maybe, since there are contracts and magical cursed swords, brains in this world work a little differently than the way you perceive ours to.

That aside, I think you're simplifying things a bit. You're assuming that behavior reveals preferences, and to an extent I can agree with that - even if there is a conflict, ultimately what you choose to do is determined by whatever action has the highest utility value. However, there are a lot of nuances. Consciously deliberated preferences can differ from subconscious or composite preferences (with the latter being what actually wins out). Preparations and intermediate actions can have different values from the final task (raising a sword to your chest is a bit different from running it through). Preferences can be different when taken "in a vacuum". The margin between competing options can be small (and that information can be retained and influence future decisions).
