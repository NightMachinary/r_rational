Ok. Well, here's how I see it. You can, quite easily, want to want to do something. For example, I really would like to become fluent in a second language. If you ask me, I will tell you "Why yes, I would love to learn French. I've been thinking about doing it for a while now.". The desire is there. But I'm not taking any action towards doing it. I have the spare time and the resources to learn it, or at least get a lot better at it, but I'm not doing it. I want to want to learn French. But I don't want to. If I wanted to, I would make steps towards doing it. And not just idly think about it. Will this change down the line? Sure, why not? Same with Isaac. He isn't selfless enough to *really* want to kill himself right now, but that could change, after some time spent. Who knows?

The issue here is that Isaac doesn't want to kill himself. Not really. He wants to want to, so that he can save innocents, but not enough. Other cursed bearers (most of them from the tribe I've mentioned in other comments) commit suicide proudly on request of their elders. They've been raised and brainwashed into being fine with it (insert tribe honor fanatacism here) The voice ran off and was able to kill himself because he was more selfless (and braver) than Isaac and he also had nothing left to live for, as he'd left everything he'd ever had behind when he fled the tribe with the blade. The voice was a trained warrior. Prepared to give up his life in a fight. Isaac is not. He's an average, modern young man, who's never been in a fight outside of elementary school, and has no idea how to face his death, other than being extremely averse to it, as he fears dying (as normal) and also fears eternal damnation (as a Christian)

This is the best I can explain it. If this isn't enough, then I guess we can agree to disagree. Because I don't think you are correct here, honestly. Wanting to want something and wanting something are two very different states of being.
