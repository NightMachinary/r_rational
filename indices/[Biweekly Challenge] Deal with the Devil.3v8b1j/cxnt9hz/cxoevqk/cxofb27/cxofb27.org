Sweet, thanks for the typo corrections! It's a little longer than most of my work, and my stream-of-consciousness style of writing lends itself to many a typo. I usually miss a few in my post-reads.

I went back and corrected most of them, although I left

#+begin_quote
  Until such a time when the blade is found once again
#+end_quote

as it were, as it sounds more majestic that way, even if the grammar isn't perfect. Let's blame the voice for his archaic sentence structure! :P

EDIT: Actually, that's a lie. I decided to change the line to

#+begin_quote
  Until such time as when the blade is found once again
#+end_quote
