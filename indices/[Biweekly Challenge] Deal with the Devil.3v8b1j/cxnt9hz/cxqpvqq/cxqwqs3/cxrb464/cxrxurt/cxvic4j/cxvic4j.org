It matters. There's a completely different feel to the following stories:

- Isaac is not told there's a price. Poor guy, he's an unlucky victim.
- Isaac is told there's a price, but doesn't believe it. That idiot!
- Isaac is told there's a price and believes it, but accepts it anyway because he's desperate to get out of the cave. What a coward!
