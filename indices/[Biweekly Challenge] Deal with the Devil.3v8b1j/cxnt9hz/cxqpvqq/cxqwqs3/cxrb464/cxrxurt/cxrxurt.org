I guess? Tbh, I just didn't think it mattered that much. :P Plus, the curse isn't an actual sentient devil, as it were. Isaac is honestly lucky the previous cursed bearer's voice was there to act as a go between. Him simply touching it would've activated it otherwise. It doesn't care whether there's actual consent, it just uses the medium of touch to determine which mortal it afflicts. A while ago though, something changed and consent became necessary. I would assume the tribe did something, to make it a bit easier to handle.
