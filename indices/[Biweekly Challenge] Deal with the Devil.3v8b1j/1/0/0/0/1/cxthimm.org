While it "explains" how they knew stuff, it doesn't really explain why an identity will be worth that much. the agencies sure have large budgets but plenty of people will sell their identities for significantly less from what is shown in the story.

it only really works if you assume the guy is basically going to -be- a spy for them, thus all the arrangements with regards to his cloths and dinner, plans etc.

and then it brings the question of why use random people instead of hand picked trained professionals.
