  More details for this are in one of my comment replies. Check that for more info for a response to your first and third comment.

I saw that after my comments.

Humans arrived in the Americas some 15,000 years ago. Even if we assume 10 years per sword holder and it was already in America immediately. That's still only 1,500 people. And 10 years sounds like almost nothing considering the power it grants you, plus however many gaps.

  Blinding yourself wouldn't help (plus the curse would probably heal you anyway) as they could easily track you down, and assault you.

By that I meant sensory deprivation, like, jumping into a lava lake, or into the ocean, or going into Antarctica with a blindfold etc.

  Or give you a message in brail. Their point is more to be sure the bearer is aware of them, as opposed to having anything specific to say, so getting "acknowledgement" would be pretty damn easy.
#+end_quote

The idea is that you can avoid their acknowledgement or, easily funnel them to their deaths by leaving only one avenue of acknowledgement. If I'm 1 km into the ice shelf inside a nuclear bunker then it's far easier to just kill them as they come for acknowledgement.

  In this case, we have Isaac, who's going to become closer to God, so his guilt towards what he needs to do is going to grow exponentially. Plus, he's going to have a very interesting time being a gay priest, what with Christianity's general abhorrence of it.
#+end_quote

I did not realise he was gay but there are plenty of Christian sects that have gay priests so just don't join the Pope lol.

  The curse doesn't give you a script, word for word, more an insistent feeling towards what would be ideal. It has no control over the outside realm, after all, so it filters what input it gleans from the user and forms that into the "feeling" that it gives the bearer.

That still seems like it knows better than him if it's able to take the same information and tell him how to use it, then it can do the same for moral problems too, ie, having 7 children (which still after thinking I can't see a better solution than that)

#+begin_quote
  As far as valuing lives over your own, the charity thing isn't a great example, as you technically have nothing to do with them being in their situation. You didn't personally starve out any of those villages in Africa, so it's easier for you to justify not doing anything about it. You don't feel responsible.
#+end_quote

Hmm, ok, I still have my doubts about how outside moments of intense emotion you would actually want to die.

#+begin_quote
  And also, while the sword makes you fairly tough, you are by no means unkillable.
#+end_quote

Getting yourself killed by attacking ISIS instead of doing anything is a much easier way to die than killing yourself, as long as you leave the sword in the mariana crater or the old radioactive storage sites.
