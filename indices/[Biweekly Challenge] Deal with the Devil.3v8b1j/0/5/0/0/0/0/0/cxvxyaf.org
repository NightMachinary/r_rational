That's true, it was an oversight on my part. I'm not going to change it, because I don't like updating significant parts of a story post-submission, but I'd probably go with "There's a price, but the blade doesn't say what it is, but Isaac accepts, thinking it can't be worse than dying of dehydration at the bottom of a ravine"

EDIT: So yay cowardly Isaac! :D
