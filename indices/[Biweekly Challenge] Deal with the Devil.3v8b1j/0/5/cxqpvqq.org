Nice story, but if there's one thing that bothered me is that the contract was forged without even saying something about doing something in return. it could have been "in return for this assistance you will be given an impossible mission, do you accept", and the MC would be thinking something along the lines of "nothing could be worse than dying of hunger here right?".

I mean, any lawyer worth his salt would tear that contract to shreds without proper consent being given ;)
