  Wanting to want something and wanting something are two very different states of being.
#+end_quote

First of all, you can apply the same argument you used in the first paragraph to 'wanting to want something.' If you /really/ wanted to want something, you would take action towards making yourself want it, and not just idly think about wanting it. The phraseology of 'wanting to want' does not properly describe this cognitive state.

Second of all, /I agree that this cognitive state exists./ That is not where my disagreement lies.

Third, by your own description of 'wanting to want, without actually wanting,' Isaac /does/ want to kill himself! Isaac was already taking action without even thinking about it. The sword interrupted, and while Isaac may have been "more than eager to delay his own suicide," that does not negate his willingness. He was reminded that someone else would find the sword, so he went to the cave he found it in to kill himself instead! That /is/ "making steps towards doing it!" My argument is based on revealed preferences and you try to rebut me with revealed preferences?!

  They've been raised and brainwashed into being fine with it (insert tribe honor fanatacism here)
#+end_quote

You underestimate the willingness of humans to sacrifice themselves. /Yes, even modern, first-world humans./ This sentence in particular implies a rather disparaging opinion towards primitive humanity as somehow being more tribal and ingroup-altruistic than modern humanity. That is not true. It is the /modes of expression/ of tribality and ingroup-altruism that have changed, not humanity's relative levels of 'brainwashing.'

If you really think that being raised in a first-world society is enough to make young adults recoil from suicide, then I encourage you to look at suicide rates among American adolescents. Better yet, look at enlistment rates, if paleo humanity was so unique in its self-sacrificial mindset.
