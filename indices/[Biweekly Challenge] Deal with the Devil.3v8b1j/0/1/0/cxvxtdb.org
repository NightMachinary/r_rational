Hah. I actually thought about having him do this thing where he tried to go about it with animals, instead of his "wait and see" plan, (edit: I wanted a cursed punishment for him, but originally, I was going to have it punish his attempts to munchkin, as opposed to his procrastination) but I decided I didn't want that for two reasons. Firstly, I didn't want Isaac to be a rationalist, at least not instantly. That sort of munchkinry is the type of thing I'd expect out of a storybook character, but I wouldn't expect a human to be apt to it right off the bat. Of course, I'm only one of billions, so my perspective on that could be totally off.

Secondly, the curse, when giving you the message, also comes with this big feeling of assertion. When Isaac spoke those lines, he knew exactly what they implied (also, the curse doesn't speak english, that's just a rhythmic approximation delivered through the filter of Isaac's brain). So that poem is more for the reader's benefit than Isaac's. The curse delivered upon him a feeling of knowing exactly what he was tasked with. It's why it took the voice no time at all to translate exactly what it meant into "layman's terms"

Now, if that feeling of assertion is just that (a feeling) or is part of the curse's manipulation and attempt to cause suffering is up in the air. I never firmly decided on it. The curse is intended to be a nuanced thing, almost sentient, and I put a lot of realtime hours into behind-the-scenes thinking on its behavior, but I didn't decide whether its curse can be fulfilled in other ways that ran counter to the feeling of assertion it gives. I thought about it, but I couldn't come up with a firm decision, which is part of why I scrapped Isaac trying to munchkin it.
