It seems like Isaac's best plan is now to do all the converting first, then all the killing (and somewhere in there, deal with the one risen spirit). This gives him the maximum amount of time to find a way out or decide to kill himself, and it's probably strategic anyway, since a priest rumored to possess demonic strength whose last six charges died gruesomely under mysterious circumstances is going to have a harder time finding a seventh convert.

He could probably spin the superpowers into some kind of televangelist-y miracles, which might help win converts.
