What is an optimal way to utilize a medical degree? Patient care alone doesn't seem like the best way to create widescale positive change since a physician can only see one patient at a time. Research, especially translational research (since it doesn't overlap too much with PHD research), seems to be one avenue. Public policy work seems to be another. Maybe developing or working for a biotech or health tech company too? What specialties would lend to affecting change?
