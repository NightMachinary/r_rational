I remember Scott Alexander von slatestarcodex writing a sentence to the effect of:

Here is this weird minimal intervention for smokers, and it helps some mildly large percentage of smokers to stop. This is probably the most effective tool I know of for such a large improvement in life quality.

In short, I dont think that

#+begin_quote
  Patient care alone doesn't seem like the best way to create widescale positive change since a physician can only see one patient at a time
#+end_quote

is the end-all here, physicians can do a great deal of good. Should be possible to find something on SSC with regards to numbers. Other avenues with potential high impact that I just brainstormed on the spot (eg. probably low value):

bio-weapon outreach as expert (see high estimates for bio x-risk in lesswrong/ssc surveys)

vaccine buisness in the developing world

Extermination of parasites/diseases? See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracunculiasis#Eradication_program]] , probably going to be only the second major plague to be eradicated.
