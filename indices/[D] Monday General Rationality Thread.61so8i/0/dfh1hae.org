I just had the idea and I'd like to run it by this sub. File it under "Mad economist plots". Essentially, how can you cause a climate investment panic?

Assuming the world doesn't make major priority changes in the near future, various nations and corporations spend money and investment on technologies and projects which increase climate change. This works as long as the projects don't result in any costs to the nations or governments which would increase the price of the projects and make them too expensive. Lacking anything like a carbon tax or more severe policy, or significant climate disasters to damage the nation's or corporation's productivity, they will continue to invest on the expectation of future growth and profit returns.

One can draw a comparison to an economic bubble, where investments and prices increase based on expectations instead of real forces. In this case, the global economy is betting on sustained growth despite damage to the environment, like investors contributing to a bubble before a crash. The costs of the increased climate change will eventually by felt, and at that point the market will be forced to realign to better, less impactful practices (after much weeping and gnashing of teeth). There will be a change; the only question is when, and how much loss is incurred as a result.

What I wonder is if you can provoke the investor panic / market crash early, before the climate is irreparably damaged. I'm talking about something like a run on the banks, where every major investor about-faces and gets out of "climate damaging investments" (I know I'm using that term broadly, but you get the idea). This is still horrifying and would certainly upend the market economy, but we would still be a better planet left afterward instead of the planet's depletion causing the crash. My only real question is how to provoke such a crash; something tells me a carbon tax wouldn't quite be sufficient.
