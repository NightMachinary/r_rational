In the economic toolbox, there aren't a lot of options for this. As you said, announcing a global carbon tax of $50/ton with an increase of $5/yr probably wouldn't work (but might to a small extent). Perhaps global governmental announcements that they will be removing all fossil fuel subsidies (in the tune of hundreds of billions /yr) at the same time as implementing the carbon tax - these together might shock the market enough. Perhaps a third layer of global restrictions to exploitation area - banning the geographical expansion of coal, oil, and gas to existing property held by energy companies through force of law. Those three together, I feel, would be sufficient to shock the market into large scale, rapid reinvestment. Most banks aren't set up for it though - almost no mutual funds, for example, are divested from fossil fuels -, and the requirements of a physical visit by the customer to make trades would mean that it would still be a matter of months before banks could create new MF portfolios, and have all of the relevant customers visit to exchange funds.
