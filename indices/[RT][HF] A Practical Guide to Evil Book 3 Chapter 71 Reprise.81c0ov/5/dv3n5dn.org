Guys... I think I know what name Cat is going to get. First, some facts we know:

- She destroys everything she touches ("a woe upon all...");
- She followed a cold-blooded murderer with a shtick (Black);
- She is a Cat.

There's only one [[http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Killer_Queen][Queen]] with those traits, isn't there?.
