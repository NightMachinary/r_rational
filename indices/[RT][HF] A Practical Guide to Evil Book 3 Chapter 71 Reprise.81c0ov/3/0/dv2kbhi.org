Cats internal monologues and even a lot of the comments in these r/r chapter threads have spoken about Cat becoming more Evil and more comparable to your typical villain. I have never seen it - she's had good reasons for all her previous actions in my opinion. THIS though, this was the first time I stopped and thought â€˜shit that's cold' (excuse the pun) and I actually felt that Cat finally was taking a turn towards Evil.
