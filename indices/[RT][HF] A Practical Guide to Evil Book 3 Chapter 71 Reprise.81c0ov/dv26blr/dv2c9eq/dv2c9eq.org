VERY little indeed. As the comments on EE's site point out, she's turning into some sort of AI. Like the Queen of Summer, she has directives that she must obey and which grant her power.

  My beliefs would just become duties enshrined in ice, as binding and unmoving as those that had doomed the Queen of Summer. I could be fluid and powerless, or unbending and powerful.

You can see that in her interaction with Kegan. She has to remind herself that the Duchess is Callowan and that's the only thing that stops her from bullying her into submission. It's likely that her first duty is some variation of "protect the Callowan people".
