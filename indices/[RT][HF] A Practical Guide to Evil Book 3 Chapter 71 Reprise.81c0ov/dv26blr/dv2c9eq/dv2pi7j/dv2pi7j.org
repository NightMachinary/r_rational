That's curious. What defines an AI from a... NI? (Natural Intelligence?)

I mean, lets take this in a more rational sci-fi direction.

Someone invents nanites that can rebuild cells as nanotech devices instead of individual biological units. But each /nanocell/ can still perform the original functions of the organic cell (/nanomuscles/ work as well as muscle cells, /nanoneurons/ the same as nerve cells, etc), including communicate flawlessly in the exact same manner with the un-converted biological cells (we will assume it has special I/O ports for both biological and artificial cell interaction, the latter being much faster).

The /nanocells/ begin replacing the character's brain, cell by cell. All the chemical and electrical interactions remain, so the same 'thoughts' occur and the person subjectively notices no difference (the 'faster' I/O ports on the /nanoneurons/ are programmed not to activate until the entire system is replaced to prevent processing speed discrepancies). The process is designed to be painless, and doesn't happen instantly, instead taking months or even a year to finalize.

At which point is the person no longer "human"? At which point do they qualify as an AI rather than a NI?
