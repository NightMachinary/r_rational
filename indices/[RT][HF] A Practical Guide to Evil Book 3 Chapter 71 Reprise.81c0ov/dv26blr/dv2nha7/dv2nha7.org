Yeah. I'm kind of worried that, since the Aspects are mostly extensions of the tendencies already present in their Named, cutting out Seek reduced Catherine's ability to plan to mostly the Foundling gambit and doubling down (unless there's a story to follow. Another weakness in the struggle against the Bard).
