Its also interesting that she's agonizing about keeping her goodness and humanity a lot in how she behaves with people face to face, but is much more willing to do casually evil things to people she doesn't know directly. (A bit like a inverse of the Singer drowning child scenario. )

Its like shes trying to monitor herself for doing evil things, but doesn't always notice. Which maybe shows the limits of trying consciously to be 'good' but without feeling it at a deep level anymore. I get the sense she wouldn't feel directly bad about hurting people anymore, she just remembers her own rules of conduct from before which restrain her.
