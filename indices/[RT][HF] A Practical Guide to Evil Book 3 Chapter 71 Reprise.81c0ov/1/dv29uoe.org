  He'd insisted on a full study of my body after that, not that I'd protested much.

Masego you player, you! Everyone thinks Hakram is the womanizer of the group but little do they know that Hierophant is the /real/ ladies' man.

  “Do you play shatranj, Duchess?” I asked, voice echoing strangely.

  This I time I knew why she shivered.

  “I do,” she said.

  “To have a game , you see, you need an unspoken assumption,” I murmured. “That all the pieces will obey.”

Uh oh. Calling it now, Cat is going to turn into a giant snake and eat all the players. She's even cold blooded already!

In all seriousness, it's nice to see Cat move outside of Black's and Malicia's sphere of influence. I'm a bit weary of what she's planning - she says she's not going to rebel - but then, what are you going to do? It would make the most sense for all of the baddies to deal with the existential threat that is the crusade and hash out the details of who rules what afterwards but it seems like Cat has other plans, maybe a coup?

What I find most surprising is Malicia's silence. I would expect her to try and secure Cat's allegiance as soon as possible. Despite not having the Name, she is essentially acting as the Black Knight: dealing with the legions, preparing for war and setting strategy. Especially now, that Black has betrayed her, she should try to secure Cat's support in any way possible simply to have more firepower.
