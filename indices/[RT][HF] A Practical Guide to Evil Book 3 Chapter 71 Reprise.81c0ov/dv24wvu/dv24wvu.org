I'm actually surprised Masego hasn't suggested experimenting with how Catherine reacts to magic. Inform her beforehand, then try to make her go through several types of wards one geared towards humans, one towards fae, the third towards both and the final one being aimed at beings outside creation.

Along with that, attempting to bind Cat (With her prior approval of course) would probably save them a nasty surprise down the road if it turns out that she can be bound like a regular fae. Finally, an experiment to see if she's affected by banishings should be in order, though care should be taken as they have no idea how she‚Äùd react.
