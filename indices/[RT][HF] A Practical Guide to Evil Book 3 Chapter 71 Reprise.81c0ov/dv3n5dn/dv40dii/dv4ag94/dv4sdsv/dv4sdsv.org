A bit meta, but in terms of possible Stands, how would look the ones that would be named after the songs we already heard?

For example,「Dread Crown」is a short-range stand that also allows for some generation of ice, typically in its immediate vicinity. While still invisible to non-Stand users, it can raise fresh and increasingly intelligent corpses.
