I think the reasoning was basically that Kagome is known to be crazy and doesn't fulfill his threats, but Hazou is competent and makes complex schemes to achieve his desired results. Further, he provided arguments for why he'd need to attack a Leaf higher up, rather than just shouting "I'm going to kill you!" That and potentially "there's more going on in the background you don't know about." One way this was foreshadowed was all the times that Hazou said something vaguely insulting or disrespectful to Jiraiya, Inoue tensed, and the only reason we didn't immediately die was that Jiraiya chose not to kill us. That said, I was still pretty saddened by the result (since it eliminated much of what we had gained in the past 4 months IRL or so). Ultimately, I wasn't careful in how I worded the passing action plan, and it costs us months of work.

Part of what the players (at least, what I) like about Marked for Death is the importance of being incredibly precise about many, many things (XP expenditure, how much to boost in combat, conversational paths to pursue, missions to accept, etc.) and the knife's edge balance that such aspects create. If the QMs just gave us gracious rulings everytime, it would feel like they were just making us auto-win. That said, I still wish Hazou had realized saying he'd fight Kabuto was dumb. Or that Inoue had realized what Hazou was going to say and stopped him. But I'm unsure how much of that is just wishful thinking vs. a desire for a realistic interpretation of our action plan.
