  Inoue tensed, and the only reason we didn't immediately die was that Jiraiya chose not to kill us.

Yeah, that is true. Makes me wonder way the players didn't start trying to be more respectful sooner. Still seems like Inoue would give a stronger warning at some point... maybe she did and I didn't notice as I've only read through once.

  Kagome is known to be crazy and doesn't fulfill his threats
#+end_quote

That still implies they are willing to read context into threats enough that Hazou shouldn't have come across as threatening as he did, which make me go back to thinking that their is a bunch of political stuff going on and Hazou just managed to provide the final straw and a good pretext.

  Part of what the players (at least, what I) like about Marked for Death is the importance of being incredibly precise about many, many things
#+end_quote

Yeah, the players seem way to meticulous for me follow, I really need to go back to letting the story buffer so I can binge read and not worry.
