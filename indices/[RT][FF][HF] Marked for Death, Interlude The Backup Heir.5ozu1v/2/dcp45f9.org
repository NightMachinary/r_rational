I must say that I quite like the name our team's been given, the 'Cold Stone Killers', though I don't understand it entirely. I know that the 'killers' comes from the way we killed Joutarou and our missing-nin status in general, and that 'stone' likely refers to the MEW we used to kill Joutarou, but the only reasoning for 'Cold' I have is to contrast with 'Hot Springs' or just for effect. Still, I've heard Team Uplift and, while it's fitting given our intentions, it feels slightly out of place for some reason, whereas Cold Stone Killers is not only somewhat appropriate, but makes it feel like our team's considered important, which is always a nice feeling even if it makes us more likely to be hunted and killed.
