I didn't reply to the earlier update when this first came up, but wow the Quest Masters are lucky that they player base took the nerf with such even stride. I mean the players went from being near even with Jounin given a good match-up relative to their specialties and teamwork, to "lol maybe close chunin, power-curve is a secret lol". Keep in mind that they players had gradually transitioned from barely surviving to maybe we will try to do some good in the world and now they are back to barely surviving levels of strength. Add in the explosion of consequences from a seemingly minor word choice and pushing a little bit too hard on an issue and I would be raging if I were a player. Of course, I binged through the quest as if it were a story, so looking back on it, there were a lot of near death encounters were wrong move would mean a dead main character and there were quite a few choices that seemed questionable that nearly went horribly wrong that the players pulled out of and recovered from, so they are probably more used to it then I am as an outsider.

Anyway, even the justifications for the nerf felt a little gamey... ordinary village genin would probably be doing a bunch of D-ranks and the occasional C-rank so it seems justifiable that a bunch of genin with strong bloodlines who are training non-stop and fighting for their very survival constantly should increase in skill multiple times faster, and be mid to high chunin level now... whatever that means. I know they are only taking broad strokes from canon, but all those Rookie team made it through the first two stages of the chunin exam without being literally slaughtered, and these characters seem a lot more competent than them, so they ought to be like low chunin level at least.

But anyway, I'm a reader, not a player. I should probably go back to letting this story buffer in large sections so I can binge through it and avoid painful cliffhangers. On my binge through, I barely noticed power-level, only that they gradually become more capable and confident in themselves. I guess I at least hope that the nerf won't set them back in the narrative of the story, although there latest flub certainly did, but looking back they had a lot of near flubs and bumps. (Actually, ignoring narrative and thinking realistically, I am really surprised Jiraya didn't kill them off them after the hot springs incident. By now he must think of them as his dangerous rag-tag wildcard team when he really need deniable assets with firepower and he doesn't mind the risk of them setting off political landmines.)

Edit*: I went back and double checked, there was more reasoning and justification since I last checked (I had only seen the first threadmarked post on the nerf and the initial player reactions). It's not quite as bad as I first thought, although it still looks pretty demoralizing. The characters are good within their respective bloodlines, so at least it isn't a narrative retcon inducing level of nerf. I suppose as a mere binge reader I won't mind once I distance myself from the players and go back to viewing it as a particularly sprawling and open-ended fanfiction.

Edit 2*: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-1522#post-7710326][Found a better and more moderate summary by an actual player]] I actually think that the balance nerf makes the problem that high magic introduces even worse, because as the players are now unable to match Jounin in fair combat as a team, they will turn to even more seal muchkinry and work towards world breaking power even harder with more focused specialization. Nerfing the overall magic system, as the player pointed out, only slows the approach of this problem.

Edit 3: Found [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-1523#post-7710615][two solutions]] I like:

  3 Use Aristotelian physics. Make jutsus and seals act towards ends, rather than based off of means. Make seals and jutsu be "achieve a result" rather than "affect the world." Basically, handwave all physics related to chakra and embrace the unphysical aspect of magic. So, substitution conserves what people generally THINK momentum is, not what momentum actually is. What people generally think momentum is is fairly undefined and changes depending on the interaction. This lets you make substitution such that it will never produce city killers, because it doesn't directly interface with known physics. For another example, Air points are exactly as meaningless as they sound, and using them for forms of propulsion etc. are impossible. Explosive seals don't release shockwaves, they just have destruction, injury, and building destruction zones. Make each jutsu work off these sorts of principles, where they achieve a result, and attempts to munchkin that result just result in the jutsu not working (or doing something entirely different).

  4 Let the players find the exploit. Handwave away the fact that pretty much any exploit that the players are likely to find, a ninja in Marked for Death likely would have found earlier, and let the players essentially win the quest (or destroy the world).

And... at this point I should probably just post to the Wednesday world building thread rather than post here because I am getting more into World building problems in general.
