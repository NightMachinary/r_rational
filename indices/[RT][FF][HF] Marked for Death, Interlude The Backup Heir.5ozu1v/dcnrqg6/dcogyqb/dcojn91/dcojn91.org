Yeah, I've lost a lot of enthusiasm for the story since then. I looked up the winning plan and apparently the wording was:

#+begin_quote

  - Talk to Inoue and later Jiraiya about Kabuto

    - Talk to Inoue about Kabuto and bringing his behavior up to Jiraiya. Either 1. Kabuto's supposed to be doing everything he can to find out about all of you, and is supposed to be very good at it, even if that means indirectly, maybe, threatening Akane. 2. Kabuto isn't supposed to be doing any of these things and Jiraiya might be able to help or will find the information valuable.
    - If given the green light, talk to Jiraiya with Inoue so she can give her impressions as well. Stress that whether it is option 1 or 2 Akane is very precious to our team and we are willing to go pretty damn far to keep her safe.
#+end_quote

I guess the plan may have been ambiguous, but it seems to me that the charitable interpretation would be to discuss the whole Jiraiya planned dialogue with Inoue, including the last bit.

I don't blame the QMs for it, because they were very faithful to the plan-as-written. That doesn't make it a satisfying outcome, especially since it could have been prevented with something like "Then Inoue realised that Hazou was about to say something stupid---because she's incredibly skilled at that sort of thing, which is why Hazou ran the plan by her in the first place---and stopped him, just like she does with Kagome all the damn time."
