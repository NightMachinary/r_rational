I'm not even talking about that.

I mean, even if you accept the premise that Ouija boards work, it's a false dichotomy.

Let's change out the "destinations" here.

  What if the next morning, I had seen Control at the airport? Then I would know with all the certainty of science that it was better to travel than to live in New York; that life in NYC was empirically and incontrovertibly pointless, that those who traveled were the lucky ones compared to us condemned to remain in NYC.

  And if I saw her the next morning, bright and lively as ever? Oh God, how much worse that would be! It would mean scientific proof that no matter how wearisome and unpleasant life in NYC becomes, what we would find by traveling was far, far worse. It would mean living in fear of a world whose content was unknown, but whose dreadfulness was incontrovertible.

It's reducing the entirety of existence to the dichotomy of "If Emily thinks [A] is better than [B], then [B] is pointless; if she thinks [B] is better than [A], [A] must be superlatively awful." It ignores the range of outcomes between "[A] is better than the best possible experience of [B]" and "[A] is worse than the worst possible experience of [B]."

And then it leaves it there, with either option being a source of existential dread, but /not knowing/ is fine, which might be the bigger crime against rationality.

If there's a question where the decision you make based on the answer will be the same /regardless of what the answer is/, then you /don't need the answer to make your decision/.

So, if either answer leads to existential dread, he should be experiencing that /regardless/ of the choice Control makes, and even /in ignorance of/ the choice she makes.
