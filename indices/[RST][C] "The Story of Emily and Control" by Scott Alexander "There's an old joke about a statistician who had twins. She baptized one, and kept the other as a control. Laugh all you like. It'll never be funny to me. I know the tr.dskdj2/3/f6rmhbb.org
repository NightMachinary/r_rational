I mean... /I/ would date Control even knowing about the full story...........It's really not that scary to think that "death might be better than the alternative." If so, why not still live life first (since by default you will die) and if it's the reverse, then the rationalist idea of trying to "defeat death" is the right way to go about things. I don't really see the problem the protagonist has.

Good story though.
