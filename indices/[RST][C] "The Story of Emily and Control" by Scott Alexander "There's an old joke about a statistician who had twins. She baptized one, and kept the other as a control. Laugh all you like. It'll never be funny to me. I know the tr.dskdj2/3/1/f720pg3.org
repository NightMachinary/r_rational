  If so, why not still live life first (since by default you will die) and if it's the reverse, then the rationalist idea of trying to "defeat death" is the right way to go about things. I don't really see the problem the protagonist has.

That's along the lines of my main anti-suicide position.

The universe has been around for billions of years, which is a really long time. And, according to current theories, will be around way, way longer than it has already.

If you want to be dead, that's fine, you may have good reasons to desire that. But compared to the universe, you're only going to be around for a small blip of time. *There is plenty of time to be dead, later.* Try to make the most of this unique opportunity you have right now.
