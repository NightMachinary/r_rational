I totally get what you're saying, that's why I described it more along the lines of creepypasta-- it's not a rationalist horror story from a writing perspective, it has plenty of problems, etc. But creepypasta as a genre is very bare bones in worldbuilding and is more about an atmosphere or evoking specific fears emotionally. The dread itself that the story is aiming to evoke struck me as rationalist in its themes. Does that make sense? So, not rationalist fiction, but creepypasta evoking rationalist-adjacent themes.
