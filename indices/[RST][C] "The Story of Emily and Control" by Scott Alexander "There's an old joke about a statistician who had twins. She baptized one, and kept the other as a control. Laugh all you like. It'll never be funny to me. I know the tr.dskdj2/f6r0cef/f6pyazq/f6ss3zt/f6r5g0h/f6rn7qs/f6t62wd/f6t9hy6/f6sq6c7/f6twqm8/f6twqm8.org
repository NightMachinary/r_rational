Hah I hadn't seen that one before, it's cool. The only two that really get me are the one about [[https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/White_with_Red][the pale woman]] and the one about [[https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/The_Portraits][the angry paintings]]. Both have that "OH NO" realization at the end where there's nothing supernatural* or even dangerous, just creepy as hell! (*The linked version of white-with-red has ghosts, but not all do, it's a pre-internet campfire story so there's a million versions.)

The fact that they're both about realizing people were staring at you probably says more about me than the stories themselves, lol.

Also [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuoMasRkMhlj1VNVAOJdw5w][Local58 on Youtube]] does some great creepypasta short films. [[https://youtu.be/3c66w6fVqOI][Contingency]] really gets me because I like stories that translate historical events in a way that makes an emotional connection. Sure, this isn't going to happen in modern America, but the general events /did/ happen in plenty of places historically.
