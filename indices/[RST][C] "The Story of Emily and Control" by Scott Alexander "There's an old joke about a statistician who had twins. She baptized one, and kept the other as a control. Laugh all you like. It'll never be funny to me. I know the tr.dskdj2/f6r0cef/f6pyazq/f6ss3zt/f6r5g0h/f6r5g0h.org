I would think rational horror stories should involve a lot of adult fears (e.g. children acting out bedtime stories with real life fatal consequences) and unnerving or disturbing implications. Like a "road to hell paved with good intentions" kind of thing, or the ending of the monkey's paw where only the vague shape of the horror can be discerned. Fear of the unknown, a feeling of claustrophobic paranoia, that sort of thing.

As others here mentioned ITT, it was a big leap in logic and a suspension of reader belief to think Ouija boards work in that story, without any prior set-up. Otherwise, it just feels like the guy is trying to escape being associated with an ex's possible suicide attempt.
