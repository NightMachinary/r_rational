I do enjoy creepy identical twin stories.

For a while I was sketching out a story involving a mad psychologist with twin children, testing out the common fantasy trope of "twin telepathy" by raising them to believe they were one individual with two bodies. Like sharing the same name, having them do everything together, having the same possessions etc. I didn't know how to expand on that beyond them eventually going mad and trying to swap body parts, though.
