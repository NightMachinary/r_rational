Hmmm... if I were that scientist (and had the capacity to perform unethical experiments on my own children to roughly the extent a very rich person really could, along obviously with having no morality), my thought would be to try and make that "twin telepathy" a bit more literal by implanting a chip in each one's brain somewhere (where specifically would depend on exactly what you wanted to accomplish) connected to a wireless control system such that when there's a lot of electrical activity in the brain region around the chip for one twin, the other twin's chip would generate matching electrical pulses, meaning the chips would basically coordinate to synchronize activity between the twins in that area of the brain. Ideally including some way to inhibit activity in that region too so that it can be adjusted in both directions. Maybe that gives you some ideas?
