But it's consistent with her beliefs to test it! How can you not respect someone that dedicated even after her sister has died. I would have to imagine she'd be looking for a reason /not/ to do the same as her life without her sister is hardly all roses, is it?

But that's just my interpretation. I've found recently that having people support you in times of hardship is absolutely vital for mental health so perhaps what I would say in the context of the story is, I'd want someone to be there for her in a similar way to her sister, and I'd be willing to be that person even knowing the story behind the situation.

But anyway this is getting a little heavy for a fictional story. It /is/ rational horror, that's for sure.
