I'm seriously tempted to read Veritas, but I'm worried that I will be turned off if it's disrespectful towards canon!Superman. I understand why a lot of people don't like him, but I do and don't want to see an indictment of the character. I'm okay with a different take on him, I was actually okay with Man of Steel's version even if I prefer others, just not one that condemns canon!Superman for his decisions based on his values and situation.
