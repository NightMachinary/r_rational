You might be thinking of [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305][this SMBC comic]]? There's also one actual fanfic which is vaguely related, where an AU Clark Kent hears reports of Superman from another universe and decides to start trying to use his abilities to do good... but unfortunately, I don't have the link.
