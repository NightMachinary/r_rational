  I'm okay with a different take on him, I was actually okay with Man of Steel's version even if I prefer others, just not one that condemns canon!Superman for his decisions based on his values and situation.

I've read about a quarter of it, and it doesn't seem to condemn cannon Sups at all. In fact, due to spoilers, at this point it's about a somewhat damaged Clark Kent with powers aspiring to be more like Sups from the comic books.
