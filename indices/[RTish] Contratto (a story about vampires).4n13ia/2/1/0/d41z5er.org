Some day I'll get around to writing the story where the masquerade is mostly enacted by the population that is not "in the know". Certain knowledge is discouraged because ultimately it's about as dangerous as a tank full of small pox virus (visible volume of actual virii protein) wrapped around a tube of nitroglicerin when it gets inside your head.

the individuals that survive such knowledge end up as some flavor of supernatural.
