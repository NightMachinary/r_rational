  I'm curious how there are eleven separate bloodlines.

All eleven descend from a common progenitor. At a certain point, they decided that it was far too dangerous to just have the father of all vampires walking around, so they ganged up on him and stuck him in a hole with no light or sound, force-fed blood once every twenty-four hours like clockwork, since this is safer than having him moving about. This is a closely guarded secret that I couldn't work into the story.
