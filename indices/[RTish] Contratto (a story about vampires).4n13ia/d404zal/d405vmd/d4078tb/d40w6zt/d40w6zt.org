It's a difficult thing to prove either way. Her beliefs have been turned upside down by the revelation of vampires existing. It would be hard for her to just distrust select things MacArthur tells her, especially considering how (relatively) helpful, upfront and in control of his emotions he is.

In addition, unlike with the blood thing, she has no way to test it. It would be a very final sort of test (altho I suppose she could just turn someone, use that person's blood to turn someone and then kill the first person) but most decent people aren't willing to kill two people on a hunch. Especially considering the difficulties she would incur in trying to keep her experimentation secret. I'm pretty sure the vamps would kill her outright if she tried to do something like that, as it would be a closely guarded secret she almost disproves.
