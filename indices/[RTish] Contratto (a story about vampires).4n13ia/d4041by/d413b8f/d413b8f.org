  On the other hand, I really disliked the main character. She had almost no agency whatsoever and as far as I could tell never made an effort to learn anything about her new world. Immortality was wasted on her.

I hear you on this, but that's sort what I was going for. Not unlikabiility per se, but definitely a lack of agency. There are moments of agency, like going to a butcher's and getting some animal blood, but they're shut down. Or, like the proposal to go public, just languish somewhere in the head office for twenty years. Or, like running away, are ultimately countered.

Consider it a meditation on working in corporate culture, if that helps. It's possible that I might have been able to make her more likeable (but still ultimately without agency) by showing her working within the system more, coming up with clever stories and false evidence to mask the tracks of the vampires or something like that. I think maybe I leaned a little too far in the direction of powerlessness. Or maybe reading a story about a powerless person having what little agency they possessed forcibly removed by circumstances beyond their control is just never going to be entertaining.
