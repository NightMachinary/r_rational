  Sheer lack of clue. Clue is slowly trickling in. This is barely two decades of life experience, without even a complete apprenticeship as a Named. But the thought of not being a girl from the mean streets of Laure is sinking in.

Personally I think cutting people with a portal is lower hanging fruit than cutting a mountain into pieces and then dropping that on enemies (which is apparently something she can do without Masego/the Observatory now? She's never really talked about that power up except in reference to it being a thing, probably tied to her growing courts so I've got no idea on the limits).

But my real issue is that this is a tactic she's sort of tried before - see the Spellblade talk above. Apprently somewhere offscreen in the middle of fighting the courts/Akua/the Crusde/the Dead King's minions she realised that her portals could totally instakill most anybody, used it once, and then never thought about it ever again.

  Cat think of looting anything more significant than a language or two from Akua to compensate for the gaps in her education.)

Yeah, this feels like an obvious thing to do. I've been waiting for a while for cat to realise that's there's an easy answer to all her complaints about Akua's superior knowledge and skills. It'd be nice for cat to have a vague understanding of magic, for one. Or negotiation, most certainly. Or about a dozen other things.

  Also, luck; if Cat had cluelessly flashed around portals that much, one of the Mighty with the Fry Lacusomancer secret would have used it.

If Drow had the fry Lacusomancer secret, then she's going to run into issues anyway. For one hing she's holding gates open long enough to drain entire lakes, and for another her current tactics involve opening five portals /around/ a Drow rather than one portal /inside/ it.
