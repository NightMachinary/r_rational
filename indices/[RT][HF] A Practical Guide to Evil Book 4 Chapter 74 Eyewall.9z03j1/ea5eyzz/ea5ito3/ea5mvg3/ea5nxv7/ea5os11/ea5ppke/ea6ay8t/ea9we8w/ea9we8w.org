Vulnerable if her opponent has Pilgrim's "beam o' death" or an equivalent and the reaction speed to use it in the time it takes to instantly open and close a single portal.

I'm assuming that opening one portal to instantly bisect an opponent is less vulnerable to this sort of counter than, say, opening five gates around them and letting the pressure of the water on the other side do the work like she did to the random Drow this chapter.
