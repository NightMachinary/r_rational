Right, I forgot that section because, honestly, I have gone back to Cat's overly comicated plan there since we skipped the actual climax of it all.

But it's worth noting that there's a lot of weirdness going on there. For one, the Spellblade wasn't actually cut in half by the gate, like everything else we've seen have a gate formed in the middle of it. (Which is actually the strategy I'm talking about / the new ability of Cat's I was surprised by).

Now, whether that's a rule about "no cutting living/undead people" or "no cutting the Spellblade in particular" is hard to say, because the Spellblade in general interacted with weirdly, and so did the locale where they fought him.
