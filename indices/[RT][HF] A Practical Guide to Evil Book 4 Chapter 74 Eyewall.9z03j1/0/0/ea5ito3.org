I'm waiting for Cat to just straight up cut people in half with her gates. Since chapter 67 we've seen a bunch of times that she can form a gate passing through the middle of objects, and that this ends poorly for the objects, and here we've just seen how quickly she can open gates... using the ol' [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalCut][portal cut]] seems like an obvious conclusion.

Unless Cat for some reason can open portals through solid stone but not through people, I guess (which might be the case, I don't know. Honestly my mind is still reeling from the reveal that Cat's portals could apparently cut things this entire time).
