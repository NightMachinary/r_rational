The reason the Spellblade wasn't cut in half was because he was an elf, and he decided he was ok. Elves can decide to ignore one Creational law at a time. We first saw that in the Book 2 Epilogue, when two elves simply decided that no one would be able to see them, and so they were completely invisible.
