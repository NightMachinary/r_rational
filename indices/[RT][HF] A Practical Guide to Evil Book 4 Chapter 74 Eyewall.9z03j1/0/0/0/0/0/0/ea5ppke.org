Definitely the most likely possiblity. The epilogue also mentioned that elves can only ignore one rule at a time, and Cat herself noted that the Spellblade only used one trick at a time.

But either way I guess we can move the upper bound on when Cat realised she could cut things / most off her enemies in half with a thought back to her unnesuccesful attempt in chapter 41 of this book. I'm not sure why she hasn't tried that move before or since. It seems like the sort of instakill that has very limited counters.
