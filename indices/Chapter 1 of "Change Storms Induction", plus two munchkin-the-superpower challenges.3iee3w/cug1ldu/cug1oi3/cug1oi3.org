The first one (A Position So Fragile) was a prequel. The second (Acquisition) was the story of how Elly got her thread-straightening power. This one is set about three +days+ weeks after Acquisition, and continues with Elly's story. It's standalone in that you don't have to have read the other two to get what's going on.
