  Neat. Okay just finished reading. Has a couple of spelling mistakes.

Fixed, thanks.

  But I have to ask on what principles does the probability fail mode for explosives work?
#+end_quote

Probability storms just sometime Do Wacky Things. Just like making invulnerable strings makes no sense under physics, so do the explosives fail.

  is that onl for nonliving things and normal humans?

Yes, Changed are much less susceptible to hot areas than norms are. That's why the military couldn't show up...well, that and the fact that there /aren't/ a significant number of line troops around there. I was very surprised, but none of the military bases that I could find around that area were actually combat soldiers. They're mostly supply, repair, and manufacturing depots. There's a base run by the Air Force that is a combination of the previous Macguire AFB, Army Fort Dix and...one other that I'm not remembering. (I'm away from my notes.) I wasn't entirely clear on that one -- not sure if it's combat troops or not. In any case, not a lot of firepower available nearby.

  Another thing i noticed was that Elly can keep thread powers for a few minutes after they leave her area of influence. This would be super useful as an artillery, missile and even crossbow

Yes, although there are some practical issues. First, it's threads, so they don't have a lot of mass, so they won't hit that hard. Without fletchings they generally won't fly straight, either. It could be made to work, but would require specific setup.

That's a fairly apt description. Generally when a kicker squad gets called in for a combat mission it's because the area's braun count is too high for normals and something that defies physics is about to do bad things. Areas with really high braun count get weird -- this area wasn't actuallh that bad, since the ground wasn't melting or turning into giraffes.

Combat missions against monsters are relatively rare, though. Kicker squads mainly get used for hunting Changed terrorists and doing the "rescue" part of search and rescue work, generally after a seeker squad does the "search" part. I'm actually planning some of that for either the next chapter or the one after.
