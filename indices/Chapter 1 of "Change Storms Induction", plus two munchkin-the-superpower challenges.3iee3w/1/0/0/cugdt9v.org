Neat. Okay just finished reading. Has a couple of spelling mistakes. Forgot which ones, so use MS Word to find out.

Story is good, great teamwork and power combos. But I have to ask on what principles does the probability fail mode for explosives work? Because handheld booms are all chemical and the striking needle for the trigger is very big, so if the probs can cancel a chem reaction at that size, whats stopping them from canceling smaller things like parts of brain, cell structures and or the poison in their brain? or is that onl for nonliving things and normal humans?

Another thing i noticed was that Elly can keep thread powers for a few minutes after they leave her area of influence. This would be super useful as an artillery, missile and even crossbow (Foil mimicry) launching needles at high speed. Speaking of artillery, is there a reason there is no outside influence during the few hours of combat? And is the combat area almost always an acid trip made real? Which would explain alot.
