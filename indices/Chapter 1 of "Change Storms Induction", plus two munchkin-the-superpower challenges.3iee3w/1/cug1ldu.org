AWWWWWW YIS YIS YIS. MORE CHANGE! MORE STORMS! ahem So if get this right, the first two chapters you released, the lady senator and lady string hero, are part of a single story, and this SRD guy is standalone? Does that mean that his plot has no bearing on primary plot, or does he not interact with 2 MCs? Will read and report back on how it is later. And weekly drops? Hooray!
