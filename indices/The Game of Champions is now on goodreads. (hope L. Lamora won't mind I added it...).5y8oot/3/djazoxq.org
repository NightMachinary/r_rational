Game of Champions remains one of my favorite stories ever, up there with Rothfuss and Butcher.

I know I'm resurrecting a dead thread, but it came up on my scheduled search for more of Lamora's content.

Origin of species is great, if you're turned off by the premise, it's not preachy or full of itself as you're probably thinking.

I realize I'm posting in a fanfic thread on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], but obviously HPMOR is amazing as well.
