I didnt read hearsay all the way through tbh. it mostly just doest feel like what I am in the story for? I might like it better if read as a whole, but the biggest warning I can give you is im pretty impatient when it comes to reading, I read quickly and tend to not stay as invested in stories with larger breaks in them.

Ok, just read hearsay. I like the bit about the disaster. I like the discussion with the ranger about training the sleep powder. I like that you used giavonni to showcase the use of psychics in conversations. But in general I dont care about the whole chapter, nothing is happening to the main chaaracters to get emotionl about. It feels like reading a detective novel beginning, except leaf doesnt have all those skills and connections those detectives get. it is moderately interesting to me to see how the powerful stay in power and such, but to me some of that has to actually be an injustice against the little guys before it feels like it matters. "Oh no, something is happening to the guy that attacked us. Oh, he is just dead for another reason" isnt compelling, and with the logic that was shown for why they wouldnt let him escape means that if the big reveal that he is alive comes, how or why would we know? He doesnt seem like the revenge type, he has good reason to be nowhere near us. If he is dead and the reveal is supposed to be about that vigilante? Once again why would he matter again? unless they are going to get involved in the renegade process repeatedly (past conversations make it feel like you arent going in this direction) then he doesnt need to be involved. And none of them are vigilante kinda material, the closest being leaf's desire to find the truth or red's desire to give pokemon away for disaster relief.

Third possibility is that other dude saved renegade and faked the death, meaning that they will come for leaf if she keeps pushing. Makes giavonni into a rocket supporter again. We know he is dark (because come on) but he cannot be intellegent and also hurt leaf atm. So more renegade stuff, or her finding more and more corruption. But leaf isnt strong, and making her strong enough to fight an organization makes all of what blue is doing silly (he is busting his ass for strength, while she hangsout with him) so the giavonni is rocket androcket helped renegade path seems unlikely due to leaf having to be involved in rocket stuff more, and then it makes her seem weak if she has to hide behind red and blue.

So, it feels like leaf's story isnt really doing anything major, and on top of that it is only tangentally related to pokemon. The "rich people keep psychics on hand needed to be done to leaf, but the other parts I liked didnt need to be done in this way. Idk, My write up was much longer and I felt it was losing its point. So I deleted a bunch and here we are.
