Game of Champions remains one of my favorite stories ever, up there with Rothfuss and Butcher.

I know I'm resurrecting a dead thread, but it came up on my scheduled search for more of Lamora's content.

I realize I'm posting in a fanfic thread on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], but obviously HPMOR is amazing as well.

U/daystareld you're doing great. I tend to come back to your story every couple months, reading what I've missed, rereading a few chapters back and through again. I didn't know you were involved in HIV research until after CFAR was over otherwise I would have tried to find you. I'm working on TB now, so I wasn't at CFAR, but I work in Seattle.

I kind of agree with the stories of Leaf honestly, she's more of a supporting character, I mean that in the sense you would use for an RPG or MMO, she plays support. I didn't much care about her chapters, her solo adventures, but I also empathize with Red and Blue a lot more.

You're doing amazing well, I'm world building for a DnD campaign I'm Homebrewing and I know how difficult all this must be.
