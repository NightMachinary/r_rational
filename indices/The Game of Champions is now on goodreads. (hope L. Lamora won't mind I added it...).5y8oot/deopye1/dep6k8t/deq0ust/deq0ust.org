I do have to say, Ive been watching your story from the start. It feels like you might be getting to many divergent storylines, which makes the updates feel smaller if you dont like one or more. Coupled with the monthly update schedule I could see that hurting more than it helps, but maybe youre about to wrap up one or more of them? oh well, have fun, keep writing and all that.
