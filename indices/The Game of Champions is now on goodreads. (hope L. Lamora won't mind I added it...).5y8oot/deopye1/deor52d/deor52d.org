Agreed. I've read Sun Soul, Pedestal, and Traveller, and am currently reading Triumvirate and rereading Traveler.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: The Origin of Species]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11273833/1/Pok%C3%A9mon-The-Line][Pokemon: The Line]], both rational interpretations of the Pokemon world, with Origin of Species being the largest so far.

I can also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7917071/1/Symbiosis][Symbiosis]], which has a similar understanding of the Pokemon world as not all sunshine and roses without delving into grimderp. The author recently announced that he's going to rewrite it under a new name after a year or two of planning, but that's not to say that what he's made so far isn't good.
