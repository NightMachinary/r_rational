Thank you for this!

It's funny: in an earlier version, telepathy required no buildup at all, just "hello stranger, I'm speaking in your mind." It might have been simpler to shove the characters into freezing water rather than have them ease in.

A few points (I'm not trying to argue, since any failure to communicate/explore these is entirely my fault):

- First is the claim that in telepathy, defense trumps offense. It's something everyone in the story knows by now, and is generally assumed to be true. If you read chapter 1 before chapter 2 was posted, I hadn't stated this explicitly. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9khn3e/rtwip_lizard_person_chapter_2_lies/e6zlli8/?context=3][Additions to ch1 here.]]
- The fact that it spreads so quickly is a moderate point in favor of Rose and/or claims that defense trumps offense. The world does not appear to have been taken over, and telepathy has been around for 7 years. This thing was never in a box to begin with.
- Alien existence is a bit casual after a couple years. For most people, it affects nothing in day-to-day life.
- There are human telepathy experts (but they're obviously compromised, so that's weak)
- Rose has invested a /lot/ of effort in PR (I really should have described the political climate in more detail)
- Pathogens are plotted away in the same manner as many other things. Rose isn't some random alien.

None of the above points are hard evidence, so no paranoid person should be deeply satisfied. But there's a limit to paranoia. You could always barricade yourself from everyone else, but the physical contact requirement is /obviously/ a lie to disguise the true limits of the power. If everyone on the planet is assumed compromised, what are you supposed to do?

I don't want to get in the habit of putting new information in chapters after posting, but I also don't want to address things after they are most relevant. The correct answer is, unfortunately, to get things right the first time.
