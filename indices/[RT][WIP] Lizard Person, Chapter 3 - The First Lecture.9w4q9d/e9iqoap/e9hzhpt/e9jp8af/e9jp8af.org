I'm not a big fan of this story, character and premise wise. Mostly because every time they casually mention alien presence and telepathy existence, I get a little voice in my head yelling: You are are giving me a time turner to help my sleeping problem?

Only in this case is: You are subjecting the world to mental influence of an alien whose nature you cannot fully understand or even block?

And this time it's worse because apparently all the telepath has to do is make body contact for a short while with a person. Diseases take longer to spread, if there is even a sliver or malice or alien intent in the process or mental sharing then human nature is basically FUCKED AS SHIT.

Never mind things like pathogens, which I understand you as author may have skipped since its boring/hurdle to bypass, or even personal body bacteria.

We are seeing here an alien invader who is given free reign and is the only expert in telepathy and defense against it. This is crazy. Imma keep read tho.
