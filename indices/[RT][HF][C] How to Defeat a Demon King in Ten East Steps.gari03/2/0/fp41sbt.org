  Fun little story! Perfect distraction from work today. Funny, well written, nice trope inversions and good narration too. I like the separate voice for system messages! I'd have paid for it for sure if it wasn't free.

Thanks!

  I can definitely recommend it to any Zelda fan, but wouldn't say it's more than rational-adjacent. It also kind of lacked dramatic tension but maybe that's difficult (impossible?) in any parody?

I'd call it rational-adjacent, too. It's definitely not perfectly rational, since most of the other cast members play so heavily to their tropes. They're more like foils to Yui and the Demon King, who are closer to rational actors.

And yeah, I agree, it wasn't really intended to have a lot of dramatic tension, except maybe when the demon king starts destroying the temples. *Six Sacred Swords* is similar, but has just a bit less humor, and that enabled me to have more of a feeling of risk. I wanted this one to be more relaxing and silly than anything else.
