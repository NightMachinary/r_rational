There will be eventually, but currently there is an exclusivity contract with Audible. So Andrew Rowe is actually not allowed to publish a text version until the contract runs out. I forgot how long it's supposed to be, but it's either 6 months or a year.

I'll probably post about it to here when it's in text form since I follow the author.
