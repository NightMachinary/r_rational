Fun little story! Perfect distraction from work today. Funny, well written, nice trope inversions and good narration too. I like the separate voice for system messages! I'd have paid for it for sure if it wasn't free.

I can definitely recommend it to any Zelda fan, but wouldn't say it's more than rational-adjacent. It also kind of lacked dramatic tension but maybe that's difficult (impossible?) in any parody?
