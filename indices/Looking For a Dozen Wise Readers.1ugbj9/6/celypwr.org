I wasn't bored, but I did get distracted during the legend of the southern lights. I thought it was very interesting, but about halfway through the second to last paragraph I started thinking about "clever tricks" in myths and how they would never work in the real world.

I liked what you did with Korra. So far she seems to me like the same character from the show (I've watched all of LoK and A:TLA, by the way) but I like this version of her better so far that I did towards the beginning of the show.

I understood it all perfectly fine.

I really liked the firebending test. I liked the fact that it showed Korra learning something and going from totally not getting it to comprehending it fully.

I was lost for a moment when the story flashed back to Tenzin backpedalling with Pema about Meelo.

I am wondering what Zuko and Aang were talking about regarding nu lightning bending. There is absolutely nothing on that matter in canon, and it is a highly controversial matter. My personal take is that lightning bending used to be crazy difficult, and someone developed an easier method that got much smaller results with much less skill and motion required, but many fans think it was a long kept secret that was released to the public, probably by Zuko. Your idea seems like a mix of the two.

I liked Arnook's character. He seems very much lawful-neutral. I was confused, as I posted earlier, about his name, since there was an Arnook in canon, but he lived a hundred years before Korra, and would be well over a century old by this point.

--------------

Also: I /love/ the concept of potential difference bending!

And almost halfway down you have the word 'usual' missing an 'l'.

Edit: Started on chapter 2. No Shiro Shinobi?

Her interpersonal abilities make sense for someone who grew up in a military compound.

--------------

I found the council meeting hard to follow. Also, /that's/ where Shiro went, although I think I would prefer if the Southern Water Tribe representative didn't have the former name of everyone's favorite sportscaster, Shiro Shinobi.

I am confused about the life expectancy matter. I suppose there's just a lot of infant mortality bringing the average down?

Hasook is a non-bender... all these changes with minor characters are going to take some getting used to.

...

As are the further changes that become more clear a bit further down.

--------------

I love the way the Equalists are playing out so far.
