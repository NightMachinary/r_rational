OP, if you don't get enough here, there's a site called Scribophile you might want to check out. People tend to have very useful feedback there. And there's an active group devoted to fanfic, so no worries about being (completely) glossed over due to 'prejudice.'

As a note, I prefer not to ask questions of my readers until after I've gotten their feedback. If someone mentions a problem you specifically ask about, that's slightly different than if they mention a problem you didn't.
