Just started reading, but right off the bat, I'm going to say that the intro doesn't work. We don't know enough to be engaged in the passive narration, and there are a number of times where it draws you out of the story:

"although who combed them no one can say."

"What his unfocused eyes see, no one has ever asked."

Additionally, this saying, whether real or not, does not make sense:

#+begin_quote
  As the people of the city are fond of saying, If you don't enter the tigers den, you will never catch its cub. By which they mean, stay out of the tiger's den!
#+end_quote

This:

#+begin_quote
  /First, survive./
#+end_quote

Should be where your story starts. It's far too good a beginning line to waste, and as I think I saw being discussed earlier, in medias res is unnecessary for a character as potentially compelling as the Avatar.

#+begin_quote
  Korra held still, gazing up at the sky, the long green shimmering patterns filling a hazy red sheet. And some part of Korra knew that as long as she remained looking at the southern lights, she would not die.
#+end_quote

Is she becoming delusional at this point? Because as a reader I see no reason for this belief.

The amount of sleepy confusion before and during the celebration is too high. It's disorienting and jarring as a reader to keep getting pulled in and out of lucidity for so long. You can make the same point while still cutting it down, and change the mid-celebration drowsiness to her mind wandering instead.

#+begin_quote
  "/I/ would like to go with Tenzin," Korra said.
#+end_quote

This final comment of hers, especially in context, doesn't really fit, and the emphasis doesn't seem to have a purpose. This entire scene seems a bit off to me, and it might be better to use the cartoon's setting for the same conversation rather than having Korra force it so early.

This leads to my being able to answer the first question of yours:

I like the way Korra is portrayed in some regards, but in others she's just annoying. We want to sympathize with her chafing under Arnook's rules, and Katara's brief perspective helps with that, but in the end he's right: she IS immature and reckless, and that makes it hard not to see her as a brat without redeeming qualities.

Speaking just on a personal note: I would much rather Korra be smart and, if not mature, at least more observant. It's okay for her to be impulsive, but verbally bashing her head into a wall just makes her look dumb. Her major flaws should be her overconfidence and inability to bend: she doesn't also need to be so bad at reading a situation and knowing when those she's talking to aren't listening to her.

  "You will go to Republic City and tell Tenzin that if he doesn't train you, I will cuff him behind the ear. Hmph! /My/ son is certainly not going to refuse to train the Avatar. When I speak to his father about this..."
#+end_quote

Confusing. Whose thoughts are these? It seems like Aang's at first, but "when I speak to his father about this" contradicts that.

Also, think about cutting the whole dialogue exchange with Unalaq, maybe put it at the beginning of the next chapter, especially if you're going to have it be a recurring thing. It doesn't fit where it is.

Overall, there are a lot of small things I enjoyed: Korra's sense of self as the avatar is done really well, especially her belief that, despite others' disappointment in her, she brings something unique to the table. Her using her connection to the previous Avatars is amusing too: I could imagine her faking a trance and trying to "channel" Aang to tell Tenzin off at some point.

The fire bending test was neat, though you use the "dragon" analogy a bit too often: once is enough, and afterword as descriptors (like a replacement for "master") is fine. The other characters work, though I don't feel a particular bond to any of them but Katara, not coincidentally because we have a couple sections from her perspective. One from Tenzin's, and maybe even Arnook's, wouldn't be a bad idea. Right now Arnook just seems rigid and bothersome. If we knew that he knows just how dangerous the world out there has become, it would suddenly make a bit more sense to have him keeping Korra secluded until she's "ready."
