Caution: nerdery to follow.

I'm confused. Wouldn't Arnook be well over a hundred by the time Korra was born? +Was he meant to be Unalaq?+ Or is this Arnook the fourth?

Edit: Oh, and a minor point. Aang didn't master all four elements in the original series. He learned water, earth, and fire, and was already a master airbender, but all three of his masters remark on how unprepared he is during the finale.
