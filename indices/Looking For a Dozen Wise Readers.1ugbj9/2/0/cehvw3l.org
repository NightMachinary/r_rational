Also, typo thread.

#+begin_quote
  "Not," they said, "Yet."
#+end_quote

The "yet" shouldn't be capitalized.

#+begin_quote
  The find the Avatar
#+end_quote

Should be "They find the Avatar"

Is "Human Killer" a name from canon? Because... Seriously? "Human Killer"?

#+begin_quote
  "Everyone is watching you.
#+end_quote

Missing close-quote.

#+begin_quote
  And wasn't Arnook always telling her that the Avatar must be worldly and not tied to one place?
#+end_quote

Shouldn't it be "/not/ worldly"?

#+begin_quote
  Arnook bowed briefly to Tenzin and clasping Pema's hand.
#+end_quote

Verb confusion there. Should be "clasped".
