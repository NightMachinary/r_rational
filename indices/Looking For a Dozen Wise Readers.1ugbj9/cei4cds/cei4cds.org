So let me be clear about something:

Thanks for everyone who wants to critique my writing (it's helpful and I'll use it), but that's /not what this thread is about/. That's what the questions are for. Typos and grammar mistakes are great. Tell me about them, /but not here./ Tell me how to fix my story, /but not here./ Tell me I'm an idiot who should throw away my pen and resign myself to mediocrity, /but not here./

#+begin_quote
  "Huh?" This is when you're confused. Something doesn't make sense. It might be because you don't understand something about the crazy sci-fi world your friend has created. Or it might be because you just can't picture what's happening the way your friend described it. You want to let your friend know anywhere that you kind of lost track of things.

  "Oh yeah?" This is for when the book is straining believability. All books require some suspension of disbelief in order to work--they're all made up, after all--but this is for when something was a smidge too unbelievable. Maybe the hero has been shot six times and hasn't fallen down yet. Or maybe it's that a side character has acted a certain way all through the book, and now they're doing something that seems totally unlike what you've come to think they'd do. Or maybe your male friend's female characters aren't coming across like women. Any time something is kicking you out of the story, thinking, "The world isn't really like that," you're doing your friend a favor to let them know.

  "So what?" Who cares? I'm bored. I can come back to this later. These are moments your friend needs to know about. If you ever find your mind wandering, mark that place in the manuscript. Even if it's just that you put the story down to go get some food, unless you carried it with you there's a good chance that might be a signal things are slow, and the writer needs to know. This might be a single scene or it might be a whole sub-plot, but knowing when readers lose interest is gold for a writer.

#+begin_quote
  When a writer requests the help of first readers, they are not looking to know what their readers would have written. They want to know the effect their book is having in its current form. For example, a writer wants to know:

  Clarity. Do you understand what is going on? Can you picture the setting and the characters in your head? Can you see where everyone is in relationship to each other? Was the fight scene confusing? Is my word choice obscure?

  Impact. Was this part funny or did it fall flat? Do you like these characters at this moment? Are you frustrated with them? Do you love them? Are you afraid? Is this intense? Are you bored? Do you wish you could stop reading? Do you feel like you're there with the characters? Was this part a tear-jerker or were you annoyed? Was the ending satisfying or did I drop the ball?

  Believability. How are my characters' reactions? Does this feel plausible to you? Is this the way you handle a gun in your experience? Do I need to do further research about xyz? Does my fight scene feel real? Does this fit together and make sense?

  Interest. Does this fascinate you the way it fascinates me? Are you hooked? Is this too much detail or not enough?

  Alpha-readers, especially alpha-readers who are also writers, will sometimes try to “fix” the book like an editor might do or “rewrite” it to suit their tastes. The problem with this is that unless you know what the writer is aiming for, you could do more damage than good--or simply waste everyone's time tearing something apart that actually doesn't need fixing. So the less the alpha-reader tries to “fix” and the more time they spend recreating their experience and answering a writer's unspoken questions, the more good they will do. This is the challenge. I am not perfect at it, but I'm getting better.

Wise/Alpha Reading is different from what people are used to doing when they read someone else's work with a critical eye. You're not critiquing, you're /reporting/. You're certainly not offering suggestions. Wise Reading difficult and has to be learned (and I'm new at this too), and that's why Card talks about "training" your Wise Reader and the developing relationship between a writer and Wise Reader.

Wise Readers and writers need to get to know each other. It might be helpful to do Wise Reading Exchanges where two writers will Wise Read each other's works and offer their honest reactions and feelings as they were reading the story. Anyone want to do such an exchange?
