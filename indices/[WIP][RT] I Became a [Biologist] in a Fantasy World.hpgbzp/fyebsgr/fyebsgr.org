I really like it so far!

Eric creating fire bombs is hilarious to me because I am about ten sessions into a GURPS isekai TTRPG, and my PC, a computer scientist/rationalist/prepper named Gwen, and another PC in my party, a mad scientist/tinker named Ivan, just made a bunch of chlorine gas mortar shells and sawdust bombs to protect our nerdy hides from hostile undead. (Gwen is freaking out about the implications of introducing war crimes to this fantasy world and how it will impact her technological uplift plans. Meanwhile Ivan is innovating further on his explosives options and possibly making an armored tank.)

There is just something about scientists isekai'd into fantasy settings that inevitably leads to explosives.
