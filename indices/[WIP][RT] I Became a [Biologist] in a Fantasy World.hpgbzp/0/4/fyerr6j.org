  Had a bit of feedback about the biology being very dense, I'll try and have him simplify it when explaining it to someone, although some of the technicalities might be a bit tough to get through (mostly because I suck at ELI5), especially for the more molecular side of things.

Out of curiosity (and not to sound like an asshole), but you're not actually an immunologist IRL, right (i.e., this isn't a /self-insert/ isekai)? Some of the biology sounded a little... funny -- not necessarily /wrong/ -- mostly just described oddly (on the evolutionary end, which is where I've more expertise, but also confirmed by my partner, who knows her wet bench / cell biology / physiology / immunology). Looking through your previous comments it sounds like you'd be [[https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/72eiqy/how_are_studies_on_rat_behaviour_applicable_on/dniwids/][finishing an undergrad degree]] in some relevant field right about now, which would explain it, unless your account is shared with somebody else?

Otherwise finding the story quite entertaining!
