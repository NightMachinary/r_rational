The story is great! I really love the idea of biology in an isekai fantasy world (particularly taxonomy and phylogeny). The characterization, world-building, and style is also very well done. It sets the perfect stage for a journey of experimentation and discovery.

I do have one criticism, though. And while it only covers a small portion of the story so far, I think it severely harms the quality of the story.

Eric treats vaccines like a one-size-fits-all solution to smallpox despite it being a primarily preventative measure. It was seriously off-putting to see Eric deal with smallpox with the certainty that he could simply treat it with a vaccine. His treatment of Arlett was like intervening in the middle of a war by sending the losing side readily-identifiable copies of enemy drones, then expecting them to manufacture and fight them off with dedicated weapons, all before the the land gets damaged beyond recovery. Not exactly a reliable strategy, right?

I know that there is some evidence that certain vaccines can hasten the production of antibodies, but medical treatment is much more complicated that that and neglecting the curative side of medicine will only stunt future plot developments. I would suggest adding a magical component to the strain of smallpox Eric encounters that allows it to hide from the immune system to some degree. That would make the way he cures it more straightforward and also explain Healers being helpless against it.
