I'm a fan of mobile games, but most of the market is garbage. I only play games that have a one-time fee to remove ads/play. Anything trying to sell me bonus lives has bad incentives. I also like games that allow me to stare off into space between moves, which cuts down on the relevant possibility space.

A few games I like:

1. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magmafortress.hoplite][Hoplite]]: Turn-based strategy
2. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.aifactory.backgammon][Backgammon]]: The option to put in dice rolls yourself helped while I was learning to not feel like it was cheating me on rolls
3. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grapefrukt.games.bore][Holedown]]: There's a million brick-breaker type games on android and this is the only one that doesn't keep trying to sell me extra lives
4. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.gdiac.underhand][Underhand]]: Neat little card based Cult Simulator.
5. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roguetemple.hyperroid][Hyperrogue]]: Roguelike with hyperbolic geometry. Very little of the traditional looter-stabber mechanics of traditional roguelikes, but the gimmick is real cool.
