Here's a bunch I like (may or may not have ads in them):

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.The717pixels.DungeonCards&hl=en][Dungeon Cards]], a turn-based grid-based roguelike puzzle dungeon crawl.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitrome.rustbucket&hl=en][Rustbucket]], also turn-based, and a puzzle adventure. Nice graphics.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.homecookedgames.dungeontales&hl=en][Dungeon Tales]], a card-based roguelike dungeon crawl. Like Slay the Spire, if you've played that.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.sharklab.rogueadventure&hl=en][Rogue Adventure]], a card-based roguelike dungeon crawl. Also like Slay the Spire.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.midjiwan.polytopia&hl=en][The Battle of Polytopia]], a turn-based strategy nation-building game. Sort of like Civilization.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.groundcontrol.zhed&hl=en][Zhed]], an abstract puzzle game in 2d space.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kevinbradford.games.axiom&hl=en][The Guides Axiom]], a puzzle game where you're given images and things to interact with and have to figure out hidden secrets and answers. Probably the hardest out of any on this list.
