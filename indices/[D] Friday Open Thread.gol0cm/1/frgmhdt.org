Got a postdoc offer yesterday! At least a verbal one via zoom, nothing in writing yet, though I also got a follow-up email that HR had approved / confirmed funding availability and was preparing the official paperwork. Very excited! It's at the school my wife matched to for her residency (Stanford) and we'll be working in literally adjacent buildings. First person I reached out to, too, and the #1 recommendation of a former postdoc alum from the school (as a really impactful lab with an absurdly nice, life-work-balance-y PI). Also a bit of a pivot from my PhD focus (in Anthropology -- postdoc is in Pathology + Computer Science, doing computational multiomics methods development in a Bayesian, neural framework); chatting with lab members they were all "why yes I have but a Master's in high-dimensional tensor calculus, only a few dozen papers published, really looking forward to taking advantage of your expertise" lol, but they were not dissuaded by my disclamations. Guess I won't be going into industry after all (though the lab has outstanding industry placement). Should be a lot of fun!

Otherwise this week has been pretty solid! Monday we came home from our evening walk to $40 of misdelivered steaming hot takeout for two -- called the restaurant up and they said to keep it. Coincidentally also vegan! On the same day I received a lens (Sony 24-105 f4) for the camera I just upgraded to (a7iii) -- gave it [[https://i.redd.it/o8zbc0own4051.jpg][a quick spin]] and am looking forward to really putting it through its paces. Sold my old camera gear to friends on FB pretty much instantaneously. And a non-centered reparameterization of a model that'd been giving me lots of trouble increased my sampling efficiency by three orders of magnitude.

edit: also realized that this upcoming Monday is Memorial Day! So I don't need to prep lecture! Ooh, and I think y'all would like [[https://i.imgur.com/lJyWCe4.png][this image]] I tossed together for a talk. Still gotta smooth out the lines on the face, but quite like how it turned out!
