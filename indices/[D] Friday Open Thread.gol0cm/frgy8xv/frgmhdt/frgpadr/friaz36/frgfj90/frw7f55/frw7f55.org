I'm writing a serialized fanfiction, which I intend to begin to publish on AO3 after I at least complete the first arc.

Most of my chapters are currently ranging from 10 to 15 pages (4-6k words) in length, but there's one chapter which is shaping to be a long-ass monstrosity (currently it's sitting at 11k words, but I haven't finished writing out a few vital scenes).

I plan to publish a chapter weekly until I run out of the backlog. How should I approach this large chapter with such a schedule? On the one hand, it's twice+ more content than usual. On the other hand, it doesn't sound fair to promise a chapter weekly and then just drop ~a half of it. What should my approach be?
