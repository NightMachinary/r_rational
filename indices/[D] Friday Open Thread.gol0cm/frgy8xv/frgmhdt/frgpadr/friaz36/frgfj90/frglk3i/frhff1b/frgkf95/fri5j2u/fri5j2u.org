I'd personally agree that a banner and logo, at least, would be nice. I normally have reddit on whatever default settings it gives me, and I've come to associate a lack of banner/logo with unpopular, unmoderated, and/or very new subreddits.

It's like passing by a bunch of coffee shops with colourful decorations and interesting designs, then arriving at this one and seeing it completely unfurnished with exposed power cabes still hanging everywhere.
