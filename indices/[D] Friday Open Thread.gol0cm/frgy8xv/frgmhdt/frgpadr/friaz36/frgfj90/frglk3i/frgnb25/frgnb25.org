I leave them on, but I'm pretty quick to turn it off for any given subreddit. It's nice when they're just a banner, flares, and maybe a unique color scheme. But a lot of subreddits rearrange navigation elements, break functionality, or even somehow manage to make the page lag. So those get turned off.

I just set up a subreddit with heavily themed CSS and while it's not that hard, it is pretty annoying. Reddit's default CSS has a lot of elaborate selectors that do the same thing. And I still haven't really made sense of the extra CSS that RES adds.
