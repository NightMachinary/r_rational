Depends on when you saw a demo build. I kept posting them pretty far into the game's development. The endgame is two technologies that allow you to win the game and a congratulations screen with scoring. There are two more powerful logistics technologies past the endgame ones for people who want to push the tech that far.

I think the versions most people here saw had four "weird things in space" and now there are nine of them.

The last things I worked on were a tutorial and a complete overhaul of the way research works.

My plans for post-launch content additions are one more victory tech, one more regular tech, several more "weird things in space," and some balance changes.
