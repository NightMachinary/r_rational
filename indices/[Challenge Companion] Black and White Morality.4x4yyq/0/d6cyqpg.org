I love how conflicts are handled in Witcher short stories. There are a dozen or so short stories, are based heavily on conflicts between strong characters, where nobody was "good" or "bad", but everybody has different interests and different ways to achieve their goals (mostly because of their character and social position). The result was chaos and conflicts (usually solved by Geralt with sword and philosophy ;) ).

Saga has much less of that, but the short stories collections (Last Wish, and Sword of Destiny) are highly recommended. I especially liked "The Lesser Evil" short story. It's not exactly rational fiction (magic has very few consistent rules, and there is a concept of "destiny"), but the handling of morality, conflict, and decisions made with imperfect knowledge is very good. Almost all characters are rational (given their knowledge and beliefs) and practical.
