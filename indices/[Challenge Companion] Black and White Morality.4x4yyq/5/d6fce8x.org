  Unsong describes evil at one point as "your utility function multiplied by negative one",
#+end_quote

Is it tho?

I don't think thats all that true in that story; "evil" in the story is brought into the world by god's left hand, while god's right hand does nothing; and there is alot of mention about god's hands

On the right hand you have someone extermely powerful but useless, a city high on lsd that all about happiness but that people avoid and in general "holyness" without action and when you move away form the "pure" you find incompetence, the angels are retarded in almost every respect, the most most competent of them all is severely autistic and forgot to give humans all the holy books including the one that would clear up which storys are literal or metaphors

On the left you have T who lies alot and has reportedly done terrible things on the other side of the world in a world where tv don't work(hmmmm, maybe russia in the 80's fall apart due to communism not to hell) a "hell"(that again is only reported on by a known lier) and who in a(only?) direct interaction with a main character asked to be killed and "demons" who haven't really showed up in the story

I think the story is going to get about how its hard to be a "cantor and a singer"(each one being a "hand" of god) but you really /really/ need both
