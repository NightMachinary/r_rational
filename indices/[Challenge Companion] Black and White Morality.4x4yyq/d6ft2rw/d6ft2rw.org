I think that evil and good are nonsense (perhaps overly harsh) concepts, basically like arguing over whether or not there is beauty and ugliness or trying to say that something is attractive. Everyone will have an opinion over what is evil and what is beautiful, but no one agrees.

As such I'm sure that people looking at WW2 would go oh, this story is dumb Hitler is clearly super evil, and Hitler would look at the story and go, how can anyone let those Jews walk free, the Allies are so evil.

Equally I'll look at a sheep and not find it beautiful or attractive but if you're from Wales or Aberdeen then it's totally different.

Amusingly Unsong's definition for example, let's say there's an Evil RMcD, so their utility is -1, now Unsong defines evil as YOUR utility *-1, so evil RMcD reads that sentence, and look at that normal RMcD is now the evil one.
