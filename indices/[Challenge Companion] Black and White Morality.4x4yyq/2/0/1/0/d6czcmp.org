Oh, sure, a utility function opposite to one particular person's exact current set of goals could be set up this way and work. You don't even need to extract and define the referent's utility function first for this; you can just evaluate your choices by how unhappy they would make your referent.

I was picturing something a bit different: a person who is an adaptation-executer for the exact opposite set of adaptations that would result in the original person. So, instead of "coming from a world" where eating food was a good and necessary thing to do (because inclusive genetic fitness), they would "come from a world" where eating food was a horrible idea. The inclusive-genetic-fitness calculation would be the thing being multiplied by -1: the more helpful a trait was in our world, the /harder/ it would be for it to achieve fixation in the design simulation.

In other words, this wouldn't be a creature created to /best thwart/ the goals of person X, but rather a creature created to be /as ineffective as possible/ at satisfying the goals of person X. The creature a resentful mad scientist would build to get back at their boss if asked to design person X. A person X that is so bad at being person X that they are worse than a pile of random garbage, or an empty room, at satisfying person X's goals.

Being really bad at being person X, and terminally valuing anything that thwarts person X, probably look the same if you make them into person X's nemesis. I feel like they're different things, though, if the point is for the invert to serve as person X's employee/avatar/go-between in some situation. A genie that is explicitly against its master is at least /predictable/ in some sense. An almightily incompetent genie, on the other hand...
