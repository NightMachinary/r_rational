You have to resolve pronouns like "you" and "him" to invert utility function.

Opposite utility function to "I want to have all the money in the world and don't care about anything else" isn't "I want not to have all the money in the world, and don't care about anything else", it's "I want Smith not to have all the money in the world and I don't care about anything else".

So in fact 2 people that want to hoard all the money in the world have almost exactly opposite utility functions.
