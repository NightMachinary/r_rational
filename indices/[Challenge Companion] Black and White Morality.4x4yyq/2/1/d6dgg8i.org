I really like this because I've studied economic systems and have found much real world suffering to be caused by a failure to maximize good, but it's rare that the ones responsible could've known better. This perception of evil frames it as an internal struggle against your own faults, as well as humanity's struggle to overcome the faults we realize exist in our world.
