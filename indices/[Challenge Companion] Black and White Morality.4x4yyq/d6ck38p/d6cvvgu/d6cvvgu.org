  I don't think anyone in real life actually has a utility function inverted from anyone else's
#+end_quote

Reifying the concept of an inverted utility function would be a bit like trying to create a systemic definition of Opposite Day. If /you/ have a hierarchy of instrumental goals that derive harmoniously from your terminal goals, you'd think the "anti-you" would have "anti-instrumental" goals that /oppose/ their goals (i.e. an inversely-proportionate amount of akrasia to your own.) If /you/ want to live to continue optimizing, you'd think your dual would want to die as soon as possible. Etc. It seems like a "naively inverted" utility function would necessarily be an /incoherent/ utility function.

(Which is too bad, because otherwise it'd be a pretty cool and simple way to procedurally-generate the villain in a create-your-own-character RPG.)
