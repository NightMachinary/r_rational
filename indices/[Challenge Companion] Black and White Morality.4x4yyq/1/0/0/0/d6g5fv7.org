I would say most creationists deny science and scientific method though yeah there are a few that say they follow it.

Because you can actually define scientific can't you? If he says that he is scientific I would say what is scientific, which is clearly following the Scientific Method. If he thinks he follows that then clearly we're debating what counts as "following" not what counts as "unscientific".

How do you expand on evil?

If you want to define evil as causing suffering, the utilitarians in the world are going to disagree with you. Sadists and masochists will disagree, etc. Evil is morally bad, and that's completely subjective.

In this thread alone there are like fifty definitions.
