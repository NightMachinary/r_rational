No it's my utility *-1.

So what makes my utility go up? Let's say cute puppies being happy makes me utility go up, and cute puppies being sad makes it go down.

For them it would be the reverse. It's not that they would enjoy making me suffer, it's that me having negative utility is me suffering! But for them whenever I have negative utility they are happy.

You know what I just realised you probably aren't talking about evil utility as defined in the OP
