are you describing an evil utility function, or a utility function that considers the utility of people to vary very widely by arbitrary characteristics with no clear underlying rules for why it does it that way? I would argue that this is not a case of someone's utility function itself being evil, just someone who's relying on wrong epistemic methods like "because this is what my parents taught me to believe", combined with scope-insensitivity bias. I find it highly unlikely that someone would want to get rid of all jews or gays or whatever as their /terminal/ values. These clearly seem like surface phenomena, rather than the underlying rules that decide what a person wants or likes or cares about. They probably are outputs that fall out of a combination of utility function and mistaken beliefs. I read somewhere that people who commit genocide pretty much always believe themselves to be the victims. Unless you think that most or all germans who lived in or fought for germany during world war II were evil. And that's a heck of a lot of germans.
