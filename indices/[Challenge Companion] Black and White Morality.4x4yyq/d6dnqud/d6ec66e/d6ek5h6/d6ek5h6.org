  Unless you think that most or all germans who lived in or fought for germany during world war II were evil.

Since the claim is that there is no such thing as evil, I only need to believe that /at least one/ German in World War II was evil.

  I find it highly unlikely that someone would want to get rid of all jews or gays or whatever as their terminal values.
#+end_quote

It's easy to rephrase terminal values as non-terminal values and vice versa in such a way that it's hard to tell them apart, making this unfalsifiable. Someone who has a terminal value of getting rid of X, for instance, could also be described as having a terminal value of getting rid of undesirables, and falsely believing that X are undesirables.

Furthermore, I said that there are beliefs and values which are evil. I don't see how pointing to an evil belief rather than an evil value contradicts that--I said both beliefs and values!
