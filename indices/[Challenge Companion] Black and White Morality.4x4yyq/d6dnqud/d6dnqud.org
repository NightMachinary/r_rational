There are beliefs and values which amount to being evil. "Jews are subhumans and I gain utility from getting rid of them. The utility of Jews themselves doesn't count".

/Indifference/ can also count as evil. "My goal is not to make you suffer, but I don't care how much you suffer in the process of achieving my true goal".
