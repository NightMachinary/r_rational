Well...in my opinion, you could if you were to spin it in such a way that Michael Meyers is mentally impaired enough that he's little more than an animal following certain base urges (I've never seen the movies myself). It would be sort of a modern humans vs. caveman sort of deal; the caveman is physically stronger and has better survival instincts whereas modern humans are more intelligent. I could see you taking that spin and running with it.
