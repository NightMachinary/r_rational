  Since we're letting our imaginations run wild, imagine if there were intelligent civilizations on each planet. They'd grow up being able to watch the others progress, making stories, myths, and legends about them. They'd have enormous motivation to get into space and eventually they would build rockets and visit each other, probably quite a long time after they had developed some kind of communication.

  How amazing to finally meet the races of people you'd been gazing up at for thousands of years.
