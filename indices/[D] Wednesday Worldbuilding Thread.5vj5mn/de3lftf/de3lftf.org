So, something from my vampire-and-werewolf type world (what's this type of setting called BTW? vampires, werewolves, demons, etc - the sort of world that is in World of Darkness, Buffy, True Blood, etc? It's not fantasy because there's no elves, or is it?).

We've got gargoyles. They're big immortal creatures with a couple of forms they can transform between, including a stone form. They have an interesting set of values: their terminal values are satisfied by satisfying the terminal values of others. Basically, they are a "Meet your meat" version of a slave. Wondering if anyone has ideas for how to explore this concept to its logical conclusion?

Here's some other facts about them:

- They are fine with being bought, sold and given away and will take on duties serving their "new master". (Mostly because their old master "ordered" them to do it, and they like following orders).
- They have their own desires extra to "serving their master" - for example, they get married, have children, etc. Their devotion to their families is always less than to their master, but I guess their families deal with it.
- Their "satisfying master's values" is more of the form "they will treat you like a very, very good friend". So if you've got a big presentation early tomorrow morning, they're not going to obey orders to bring them enough alcohol to end up hungover and thus unable to give the presentation. Equally, if you're in the wilderness with your leg stuck under an immovable rock, they'd be willing to cut your leg off to save you. (In reality the rock scenario wouldn't happen because gargoyles are big, strong, and have /ridiculous/ amounts of momentum available).
- i.e. they essentially have a vaguely Three Laws of Robotics thing, except not, because they are still completely autonomous so they don't get stuck in those weird paradoxes.

One interesting conclusion I came to: a gargoyle's desire for a master is so strong, they will seek one out. If they can't find an intelligent creature to serve, they will choose an animal or plant and start satisfying its desires. I imagine those giant forests of clonal organisms being plants that a gargoyle has decided are its master.
