The "fantasy equals elves" was a bit flippant, but I did mean it to say that it seems to me that vampire/werewolf stories set in modern times are a different sort of thing than the prototypical D&D setting which tends to be lots of magic, mythical creatures exist, that fact is commonly accepted, half-elves and orcs are integrated in society more-or-less etc.

Whereas "supernatural fantasy" (I guess?) is modern times, there's a masquerade(ish), magic/etc is not ubiquitous but only available to a very select few, etc.

But maybe that's just a failure of imagination on my part. And something like Harry Potter doesn't fit squarely into either of those, as by my definition just then it's more in the "supernatural fantasy" box, but IMO it has more in common with "high fantasy" in a lot of ways. Then again, maybe it doesn't....
