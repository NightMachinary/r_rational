If a Gargoyle choose to serve a nonhuman master, that could actually be very dangerous. There's no way for them to receive coherent orders or interpret their master's moral values, so one guarding a forest could easily become an eco-terrorist by simply inferring what their master commands.

If these gargoyles do exist, I think they'd be considered insane by their peers since they've basically invented a master they claim to receive commands from that no one else can understand and frequently conflict with the values and common interests of the vast majority of masters.

As for you idea, I like it but I'd tone down the "care more about master than themselves" part. I think they're interesting enough as obsessively good friends, but the idea that they harm themselves or others they care about out of that friendship /without reluctance/ is creepy and makes them harder to see as people.
