  so one guarding a forest could easily become an eco-terrorist by simply inferring what their master commands
#+end_quote

I love this. I don't /think/ a gargoyle would go out and destroy bulldozers if the forest was getting paved, at least not until it became clear that "his" tree would be destroyed. A gargoyle looking after a forest is a desperate creature, and he would definitely have the pity of his equals.

I also think that the second someone says "what the hell are you doing?", something primal will awaken in them - /they've just been ordered to answer a question/ - and when the person follows up with "get the hell away from the bulldozer!" their eyes light up. /Oh my god, what is this? Why do I feel so good? I can't wait to get away from this bulldozer. Who cares about that stupid tree. I want that guy to give me something to do again!/

Now the question is, what does the gargoyle do if the bulldozer operator says "piss off, I don't want anything to do with you"? Do they go on the hunt for a new master, or do they simply go "okay, this guy doesn't want to see me again, but I'm going to hide and watch him and do things in the background to make his day better" (maybe difficult as they do NOT have any even vaguely stealthy forms)

  the idea that they harm themselves or others they care about out of that friendship without reluctance is creepy and makes them harder to see as people.

Yep. i'm going for "creepy" (hard to see as people is a bit different as the nature of a gargoyle is to be friendly and relateable, and so would model reluctance if he sensed his master would like that), so that's a feature, not a bug. Here's a scene from what I've written that pretty much hits the nail on the head in terms of what you wrote:

  “I don't know if this is true or not, but my grandmother always said that there was no such thing as dinosaurs. She said there was nothing bigger than an elephant because bones aren't strong enough to hold up that much weight. So... are your bones like normal... like human bones?”

  “I don't have bones.”

  “Wait, what?” Red paused. “So, are you... flesh all the way through?”

  Julias grabbed one of the dishrags and wound it around his forearm, tucking it under itself to hold it in place. He casually picked up the knife he had been using for the onions and matter-of-factly slid it through the soft skin on his forearm. Blood began to seep out of the wound, which the tall man spread open to give Red a good look, angling the gash so that the blood would mostly soak into the rag.

  About a centimetre into his arm, the flesh gave way to sandstone like that of his statue form - a pale beige with darker stripes in a more orange hue. A few tiny grains of the stone endoskeleton were chipped away by the blade.

  Red swore, grabbing a clean tea towel to try and place on the wound to stop the bleeding.

  “Oh geeze, Julias, what are you doing? Doesn't that hurt?”

  “Of course it does.” He grinned as he placed the knife on the table to hold the rag and the reddening tea-towel firmly on the wound.

  “Are you going to need a doctor?” Red asked, noticing the warm, sticky blood on his hands. The acidic smell seemed to fill the air. He went to the sink to wash up.

  “No, it will heal in a few days.” He said, tying the towel firmly around his forearm where it could serve as a makeshift bandage. “Do you have any more questions?” He picked up the bloodied knife and placed it in the bucket of dirty kitchen tools.

EDIT: another thought I had: if a gargoyle would rather follow a human than a tree, it quite probably follows that after being given an order by a still "higher" form of life (e.g. vampire), he would prefer to obey that, since their desires are "stronger" (maybe? whatever metric would say a new human gets precedence over a tree it might have been nurturing for a thousand years). An interesting thought, with the consequence that such creatures don't remain in the service of mundane humans for long.
