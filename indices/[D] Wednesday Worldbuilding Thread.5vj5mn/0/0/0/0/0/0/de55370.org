I guess for a materialist, if it turns out that Religion A is true, then there must be material reasons for believing as much, so an AI could discover those material reasons and come to those beliefs "rationally".

If you wish to posit that religious belief is inherently irrational then yeah, a computer isn't likely to hold them. (Though it may profess to hold them in order to better fulfill its utility function)
