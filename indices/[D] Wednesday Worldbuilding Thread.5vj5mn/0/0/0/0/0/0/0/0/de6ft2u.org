I don't know. I think saying "an AI mind would be a human mind but with condition X" is just as inaccurate as saying as "an AI mind would be like a neurotypical human mind".

Human minds, regardless of their specifics, tend to have a few things in common - for example, wanting the world not to be made of paperclips, knowing that art is valuable, thinking sugar is delicious, etc. An AI wouldn't have any of that unless it was explicitly programmed. And if you miss one little thing, there can be a /lot/ of values drift as a result.

I'm very wary about anthropomorphising AI. It's almost certainly going to be less like us than a dog is. But at the end of the day, we've got a few years before it becomes a thing, so who knows...
