I'm curious as to how that could actually happen. Under what circumstances do you think an artificial being could decide to follow a religion that humans had created? Most people here are atheists who assume that any rational intelligence would be atheist as well, but I'm a spiritualist so I'd like to explore alternative possibilities.
