Hmmm.. well first you'd have to prove that objective morality as a concept even makes any sense. Currently, morality is purely subjective and a "global morality" only exists as the lump sum (weighted sum?) of a given population's beliefs and values. For a true, perfect, universal morality to exist it would have to be independent of any given population - it would have to be an inherent property of the universe. In that case there would be (assuming quantum mechanics is reasonably accurate) an associated 'morality field' and 'morality elementary particle'... So maybe we just need to build a super duper particle collider to see it!
