I've been thinking about how interesting it would be if there's this one true, perfect morality, the global maximum of the moral landscape, and we've all seen it flawlessly represented in the Bible, but there's a memetic effect that causes us to misinterpret/misread the words. Or maybe we read and understand the words correctly, but our own built-in moralities have been corrupted. Not just that, but our use of logic itself is made untrustworthy by mental meddling.

How would we notice, and what techniques could we apply to mitigate the effects?

Heck, how would Heaven convince us that yes, it's actually a moral problem to mix your fabrics?

I suppose in vague terms that's actually what's probably going on, sans the Bible and active memetic influence bit. Our bodies have been woefully constructed by evolution and our brains are part of that.
