Wisecrack posted a video on Westworld today, and I think part of it might be relevant to this. They explain that theologians concluded man's fall from grace occurred because God wanted man to do as he said, but our actions would be meaningless unless we had the option of choosing not to follow his will. However, what if his will needs to be vague for there to be a choice?

Maybe an easily comprehensible objective morality would be a violation of free will. If you could absolutely convince absolutely anyone what the right thing to do was, then would "right" have any meaning without anyone choosing to do "wrong"? If that's true, then that means it must /always/ to possible for man to act immorally, even if everyone tried to do as God said.
