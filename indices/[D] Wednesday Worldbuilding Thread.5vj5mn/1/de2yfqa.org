So there's some news about worlds fairly near us with some interesting properties. How would it change society to have a couple of habitable worlds within say a weeks travel at low delta-v close to Earth? Obviously space travel would be more important. I think practically we can assume a couple of things. Only one of the planets has intelligent life. Atmospheric conditions are not consistent, pressure and oxygen contents. Things like the biological similarity between the planets are more up to debate. You could make an argument that the most likely is for them all to share a common ancestor
