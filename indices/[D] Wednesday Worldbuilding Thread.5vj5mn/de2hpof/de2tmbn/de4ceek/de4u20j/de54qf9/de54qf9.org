For someone who is comfortable with believing in something that I cannot objectively prove to be true, that seems like a bit of a cop out. It's one thing for an AI to make scientific discoveries about the nature of reality that no human could have, it's another for an AI to subscribe to a belief system without epistemological basis. This whole line of inquiry is probably wishful thinking on my part, but I find the idea that an AI could decide to join or create a religion, with full knowledge of what that entailed, fascinating.

I won't pretend I'm not looking for potential justifications for my own beliefs that have no basis in epistemology, but my situation has led me to believe that religious belief is an inherent component of some people's psychology. I've still abandoned beliefs that didn't pay rent, but I've never been able to abandon the fundamental premise of theism. I'd be really interested in seeing what circumstances could make an AI doubt atheism/physicalism without calling its sanity into question.
