I'm not convinced it's impossible since, as someone with autism, I think autism is the closest analogue we currently have to how a conscious computer might think. It's still a huge conjecture to make, but the basic idea of a mind that intuitively understands logic but has to be taught how to express and read emotions is probably a situation we'll come across with AI. I've thought this over and have come up with two scenarios where I think an AI could develop religious belief.

First, it's possible that a (not Seed, that would be very bad) AI could intentionally be made imperfectly rational so it gets along better with us irrational humans. Second, if an AI could be programmed to dream, meditate, or some other phenomenon that blurs humans perceptions then it's possible that it could decide its subjective visions express something real. As for why anyone would do this, I can only presume that the psychology of a conscious being might require such things in order to function or at least relate to humans.
