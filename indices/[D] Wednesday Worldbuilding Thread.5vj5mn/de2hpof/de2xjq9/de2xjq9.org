I think the whole idea of the moral landscape is probably fundamentally flawed, in that it either leads to wireheading (though there's no problem if you're willing to bite that bullet, but almost nobody is), or totally fails to account for things too far outside normal (let's call the ancestral environment "normal") human experience (in which case the idea of it having a peak is weirdly nonsensical).

Plus as SSC's consequentialist FAQ points out, nobody is likely to actually care whether something is right in some abstract sense if it contradicts our moral intuitions too much. If you introduce incentive systems like graded afterlives, then it stops being a moral system altogether and becomes a guide to acting in your own self interest.

Other than that there's also the weirdness that within your setting there's the question of why everyone is reading the /same/ wrong version of the text. Like interpretations may differ but why are all the wrong literal interpretations converging on the same point?
