When is screaming rational?

When someone is yelling at you? (defensive/anger response)

When it'll get you what you want? (manipulative action)

When there's nothing else to do? (exasperation)

Obviously humans are not rational and conversations are complex, more about being right than logical, but when does a screaming match really make sense to be used, outside of emotional outbursts?
