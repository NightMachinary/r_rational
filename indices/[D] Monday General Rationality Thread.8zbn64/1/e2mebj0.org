Ineffective medical treatments are pseudoscience and they take advantage of people's ignorance. Does this mean that skepticism of the possible feasibility of cryonics is pseudoskepticism? It's fine to voice doubts, but saying it's totally ok to let people predictably 'pass away' into corpses because cryonics has a less than 100 percent chance of working is pseudoskepticism.
