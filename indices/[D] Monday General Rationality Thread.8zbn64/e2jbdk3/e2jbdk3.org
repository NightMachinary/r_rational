I have a colleague who is antivax and creationist (with Ancient Aliens in Mesopotamia, based on ridiculously wild misinterpretation of their creation myths). I retaliate by feeding him all kinds of plausible conspiracies that are incompatible with and encroach on his beliefs (the bicameral mind, hybrid / stabilization theory of human evolution, anticholesterol drug conspiracism).
