I have a friend who believes in god. He's quite similar to me and has been my best friend for half a decade. I've introduced LessWrong to him and taken him to our local rationality dojo. He's quite receptive to ideas I talk to him about and he's willing to openly discuss his religion. he expresses due doubt of his belief but on further consideration, [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/43PTNr4ZMaezyAJ5o/the-proper-use-of-doubt][he may be doing it incorrectly]]. I've read a couple of things Eliezer has said about:

a) people learning rationality wrong and using it to shore up irrational beliefs ([[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Valley_of_bad_rationality]])

b) rational people being incapable of applying their rationality to criticise their religious beliefs (can't find source)

And I'm worried that sharing rationality without careful preparation could be a Bad Idea. Before this, I didn't have any reason to dissuade my friend from his belief (christian protestant); he is happy with it and it has had a net positive effect on his life. Now I am considering properly arguing about it with him in order to check if it's a problem and maybe resolve it if it is. What do you guys think is a good idea? Any passing thoughts or comments are welcome and may be more useful than only one or two comprehensive responses.
