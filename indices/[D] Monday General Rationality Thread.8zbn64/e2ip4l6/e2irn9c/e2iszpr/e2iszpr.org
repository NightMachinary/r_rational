Thank you for responding! I appreciate that you are willing to criticise me about this, but I guess that's the whole appeal of this community. I need to develop my communication skills and how to come across as less offensive, so I'd really like to know what parts gave off my impression of superiority.

I do consider his viewpoint to be inferior, but not fundamentally. For one, I think that his belief has made his life much better, eg. it has been an opportunity for him to meet and connect with people who have positively impacted his life. I am specifically worried that he may not be analysing his belief properly and if so that would be a sign to *do something*. Note that I specifically want to /argue with him/ as opposed* to convince* him: If he is right, then I want to know about it.

As for the losing a friend part; this kind of thing I wouldn't even attempt with most of the people I know. I'm considering this entirely for my friend's well being and it's completely consensual; if he didn't want to argue about it then I wouldn't pursue it.
