Realistically speaking, at some point advances in other fields will let humans armed with ai systems get exponential growth in medical knowledge/ability to manipulate human bodies. That is, I am saying we'll have the current glacial progress continue for some unknown number of decades, and then there will be robotic systems that can be mass manufactured to do bioscience research on enormous scales.

Kind of how the early computers did more math than every human combined up to that point in human history. Millions of robotic lab units that objectively investigate biology, from the ground up, building a model as they go from the data, without human bias and with automated replication of results, would learn more than all human efforts to this point.

With that kind of knowledge - after a few decades of progress at this pace - presently living humans could be kept that way essentially forever, so long as they promptly receive treatment and aren't harmed in a way that destroys their brain. Cryo patients would take longer to recover - enormous advances in nanotechnology required - and bringing them back as "living" flesh and blood beings might or might not ever be possible.
