One thing I considered getting into but cut for space is that there's some inherent risk the whole system collapses while you're asleep. It's a lot easier to be confident in going to sleep for one year or ten years than for a millennium. So I would guess most people would sleep repeatedly for brief periods unless they got a terminal illness, which also gives you clear chunks of time to enjoy your earnings while you're learning enough about the world to figure out whether to go under again.
