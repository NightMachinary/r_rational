There's a problem where everyone wants the perfect cure, but if no one wakes up to take it there isn't enough test subjects; it's possible that the never frozen humans get the same disease and act as the first line of test subjects, but if it's something like lead poisoning where prevention is easier than the cure you might end up with a million who refuse to be the first out stuck in limbo.

Likely they would just wake up a bunch and ask them anyways, I'm sure enough would want to come out once the problem is explained. Longterm, it'll likely be set up that the lowest risk cases are required to be unfrozen first. And anyways, as long as the cure doesn't cause e.g. irreparable nervous system damage they can just be frozen again, plus an additional problem.
