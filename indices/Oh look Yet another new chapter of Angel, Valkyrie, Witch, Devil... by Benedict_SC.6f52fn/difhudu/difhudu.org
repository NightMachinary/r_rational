I'd got my hopes up but I'd already read it :(.

My biggest fear for this story is that as new lore is released it will become more and more AU, to the point where they just take place in similar universes. Think The Games We Play for RWBY, which doesn't take into account season 3 let alone season 4, so all the origin stuff just feels more jarring.

Other than that I'm really liking it.
