Yea, I find that happens frequently with fanfiction about something new. I got into Naruto fanfic back before part 1 had even ended. So we didn't know fucking anything about anything really. Background lore went in so many different ways.

Kazama Arashi was the defacto name for Naruto's dad. The Kyuubi was often characterized as a girl. The sharingan was a product of demons (often times the Kyuubi itself was responsible)

Good times...good times...
