  Put stories in here whose central ideas are relevant to our interests. If you don't know what's relevant to LessWrong because you haven't read LessWrong, don't put stories here. You don't need to be as strict about quality as about concept.

I can't help but think this is overly harsh. I'd suggest that prospective authors spend time here or reading rational fic to get a feel for what rfic is first, and then submit to nominations in addition to the above to sound less exclusive. I can guess you've had a spamming problem, but they wouldn't listen to warnings anyway.
