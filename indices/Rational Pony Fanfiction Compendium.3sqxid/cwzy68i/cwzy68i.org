I recommend in particular [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/57744/happily-ever-after][Happily Ever After]] (2500 words) and [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/138977/the-thousand-year-romance-of-clover-the-clever][The Thousand Year Romance]] (2500 words). /Both have happy endings./

I do not approve of the inclusion of [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/269332/blink][Blink]] (4000 words). It's dumb. Teleportation is not murder.
