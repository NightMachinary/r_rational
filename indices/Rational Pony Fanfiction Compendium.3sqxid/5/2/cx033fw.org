Pony stuff is fine, so long as it is still rationalist fiction. Some people are against it, but they aren't the majority around here so don't take it to heart. Rather, most people seem to be neutral. If a story is interesting I'll read it regardless of if the protagonists are humans or crystal aliens or ponies or gas beings that live in Jupiter.
