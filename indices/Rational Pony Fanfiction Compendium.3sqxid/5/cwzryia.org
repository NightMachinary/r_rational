(Ok, nevermind, I was just being sensitive and dumb, and things seem to be going better now).

It seems like his post has been getting about as many downvotes as upvotes since I posted it. Sorry if posting this was a silly idea. I'm the worst pony. I'm a dumb pony, too. :(

Should I keep from posting pony stuff here in the future? Did I do something in particular wrong with this post, or is there just not a particularly high tolerance for pony stuff on this subreddit?
