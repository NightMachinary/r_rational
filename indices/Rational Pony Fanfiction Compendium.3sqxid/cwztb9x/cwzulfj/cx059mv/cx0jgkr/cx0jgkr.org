NotAHeroYet's reply to your comment is spot on-- that's basically part of what I thought, too. Also, I try to use the same rules and heuristics that the other two admins use when approving stories--and in deciding whether or not to approve things, relevance to LW is more important than quality, or whether or not something's a prequel to a rational fic. So, it would be rude to the other mods, and the community, to approve something that I liked (like Parting Words) if it didn't properly fit into the group.

Parting Words won't be approved because rationality/LW relevant things aren't a big part of the plot, or of the story. There's some munchkining, but that's only a small part of the story.
