... *squints.* Sir, you are aware that Parting Words is a /direct/ sequel to The Great Alicorn Hunt, yes? As in, they are part of /the very same narrative/ and that one provides if not crucial, then at least important back-story for the other?

Parting Words is a /prologue/ for TGAH. It is not a separate story, and I am genuinely confused by your reply to my post.
