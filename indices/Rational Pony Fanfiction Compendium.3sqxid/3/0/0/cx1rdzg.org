If you've read at least a few rationalfics then you probably know what we're looking for but for those just joining us rational fiction is generally found when:

Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
