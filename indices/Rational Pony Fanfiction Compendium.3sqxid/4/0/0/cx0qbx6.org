I take it you've read neither [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/87619/biblical-monsters][Biblical Monsters]] (10,000 words) nor [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/211007/souvenir][Souvenir]] (3500 words). Both are accessible to readers with a minimum of background knowledge. The latter fic is tangentially related to futurism.
