It's not /exactly/ the kind of content that is expected here, but I feel it belongs on this subreddit. I've never lost someone close to me, so I occasionally find my way back to this. It's terribly sad, and I use it to try and remind myself how much growing up the world has left to do, and how important working towards a better future is.
