I'm terribly sorry for your loss, and for humanity's loss of yet another mind.

I can't offer much, but I offer you my ear if you ever need to talk about things, or just rant. Your feelings are legitimate, you are /not/ alone in feeling like you do, and I don't want you to ever forget that. Fuck death and everything about it.
