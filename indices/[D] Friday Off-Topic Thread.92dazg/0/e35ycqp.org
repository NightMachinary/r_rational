So! I started my new job the other day. Turns out for the next few months I'll be doing /fatal crash investigations/. Whenever there's a fatal crash, the team I'm on will have to attend the site within ~2-10 days and take measurements of the road and determine whether it was likely a road problem that contributed to the fatality. We have about ~70 fatalities in the metropolitan region a year (~160 state-wide, so for some remote crashes I'll need to go out there, which'll be great as our state is huge (bigger than Texas) and I have seen hardly any of it). Depressing when you think about it: I'll be light on work unless people die, but I suppose that's the nature of it...

It's not exactly what I was expecting but it's /fascinating/ and I can't wait. They're also going to give me training in becoming an expert at assessing roads for safety in general, and then in a few months when a new system comes online I'm going to start being able to come up with ways to "fix" routes and sets of intersections that have been statistically identified as being high risk for future fatalities.

All in all, it looks like it's going to be a great change of scenery, the people I'll be working with seem fine!
