Huh. I was so sure it was Alaska. Bigger than Texas, a state, roughly half of a low number of yearly fatalities in the metro area (Anchorage has about half of Alaska's population)... I also wasn't aware that places outside the US referred to their subdivisions as states. Canada uses provinces, for example. A quick search says that you're in... Western Australia?

Well, the advice stands. Photography would be a good hobby to pick up, and podcasts are nice. Talk to your colleagues, but I doubt that you want to spend the entirety of a long ride talking.
