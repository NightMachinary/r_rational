... i'm not in Alaska, I'm in a completely different country! My state is also bigger than Alaska :). Only one state in the world is any bigger and that's some giant part of the Russian wilderness.

And I expect to only travel 2 or 3 times in the 6 months I'm here, so won't be a huge issue, and I'll be travelling with my colleagues so you're generally meant to chat with one another.
