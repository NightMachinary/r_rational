You could get into photography. Alaska is a beautiful state, and if you have to go out away from cities, you could get some really nice astrophotography experience. It will give you something to look forward to, when a drive out is more than just going to see where people died.

If you haven't already, I recommend podcasts instead of radio for long drives. You can learn interesting topics from them, or simply tailor the stories you want to hear to your personal tastes rather than hear whatever happens to be on at the time.
