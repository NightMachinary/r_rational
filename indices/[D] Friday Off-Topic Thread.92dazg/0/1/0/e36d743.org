  ...you have way safer roads than we do

State population's about 2 million compared with the US population of 330 million and the Texan population of much-more-than-2-million so that has something to do with the number being so tiny!

We actually fare pretty poorly compared with other states in Australia!

That said, let's work it out:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate]]

Australia has 5.2 deaths per billion vehicle kms; USA has 7.1. Per 100,000 population Australia has 5.4 and the USA has 10.6.

.... oh, wait, I forgot you're South African (25.1 deaths per 100,000) so you actually did have reason to be impressed!

That said, we still far behind the UK (2.9 per 100,0000) and many other European nations though. And, well, everyone's far, far ahead of Thailand (36.2 per 100,0000).

Now I want to go to South Africa and check out the roads. I was constantly shocked at how bad the roads were in Thailand - really poorly maintained barriers in particular.
