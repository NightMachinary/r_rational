  We have about ~70 fatalities in the metropolitan region a year (~160 state-wide, so for some remote crashes I'll need to go out there, which'll be great as our state is huge (bigger than Texas) and I have seen hardly any of it).

[[/flutterkay][]] ...you have /way/ safer roads than we do.

Whatever you're doing, it's clearly working and clearly saving lives. Keep it up. And remember - every time you're finding a road problem that leads to a fatality, you're saving someone's life and they will never even know you did it.
