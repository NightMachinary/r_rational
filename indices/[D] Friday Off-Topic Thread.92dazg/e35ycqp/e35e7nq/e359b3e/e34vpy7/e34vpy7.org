I'm not enjoying Stardust Crusaders that much.

This is a shame, because I quite liked Phantom Blood, and /loved/ Battle Tendency, and now I've spent probably too much time trying to figure out what's wrong. If I had to point to one thing, it'd probably be the pacing? It's much more episodic than parts 1 and 2, and it feels like there's been a lot of episodes I could have just skipped entirely without really missing anything. Also, the fact that each Stand User gets exactly 1 (or 2) episodes means that each episode's pacing needs to stretch around that, which leads to what feels like a /lot/ of padding.

Or maybe it's the characters? Admittedly, characterisation has never been JoJo's strong suit but I'm 22 episodes in (which is almost the length of the last two parts put together) and the only character I've really been given any reason to care about is Polnareff. I still haven't even the slightest clue who Kakyoin is, Joseph feels like a different character, Jotaro is... Acceptable, I guess, and Avdol I still don't really have much of a grasp on either [[#s][spoiler]]

Parts 1 and 2 could get away with having weaker characters because there was always something happening to keep me hooked, but part 3 seems to expect me to enjoy just hanging around with these people for their own sake, and I really just don't.

I don't know, I feel like I'm rambling, are there any JoJo's fans here who can give me reasons to keep watching?
