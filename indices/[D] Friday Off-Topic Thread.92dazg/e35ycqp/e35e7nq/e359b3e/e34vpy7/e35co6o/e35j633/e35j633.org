In answer to your questions: the rest of the books have a pretty similar tone, Alex is back in book 8 but as a supporting character, the eater of souls is the main character of most of the books (not book 7), and I would recommend reading all of them, but you can skip the first two or three because it doesn't really start to have serious continuity until book four or so.

Recommendations: I think if you enjoyed /The Nightmare Stacks/ you'll probably enjoy the rest of his stuff. Probably start with The Merchant Princes series, because it's the closest to The Laundry Files. They're not terribly close genre-wise though. /Bitter Seeds/ and sequels might scratch a vaguely similar itch.
