[[/twiwink][]] Oh, I'm not objecting to your proposed solution - the people whose job it is to figure out a solution to the problem basically tried exactly that, after all, which implies that they /also/ thought it was the best solution. (Their lack of use of GPS boxes might well be a budget thing, or it might be that it takes a LOT of welding to make something that can't be removed by a motivated guy with a sledgehammer and a crowbar). And, honestly, I think it did improve matters a little, mainly by loosening the grip of the taxi industry on transportation.

  More seriously, South Africa clearly has its own unique challenges and hopefully the situation will improve slowly but surely. And maybe uberpool or something kills the minibus system.

[[/twibeam][]] One can hope! And yes, Uber is around (though I don't think they'll ever beat the minibusses on price because the minibusses can take a dozen people at once and get the advantage of economies-of-scale - but again, they'll weaken the minibusses grip on the transport industry).
