[[/twisad][]] I don't think that the /roads/ are our problem. I think it's more the /drivers/. There's a... /lot/ of History behind that. Some of which I can only speculate on.

But, to make a long story short; one category of vehicle found on the roads here is the minibus taxi, which is (as the name implies) a minibus that acts as a taxi, picking people up and carrying them to pre-planned destinations in exchange for fares. What the name /also/ implies around here (though I'm not sure how international these particular connotations are) is a complete and utter disdain for traffic laws.

I don't mean just "ignorance of traffic laws" either. I mean the sort of drivers who will - regularly - drive up on the shoulder of the road or drive the wrong way up a dual carriageway to avoid a traffic jam kind of thing. They're not /deliberately/ suicidal, but they'll do just about anything to get to their destination faster (thus obtain more fares). They'll treat traffic lights as polite suggestions and stop just about anywhere to on- or off-load passengers. (Often they'll at least /try/ to pull off to the side of the road for that, if it's possible to do so at that point, but there are no guarantees).

Of course, this applies only when they haven't seen a policeman watching (because being held up by a traffic official will waste even more time). But you can't have policemen /everywhere/. And even ordinary drivers will often treat a speed limit as a recommendation rather than a rule... and while the minibus taxis are the /worst/ offenders in general, they are far, /far/ away from being the /only/ ones.

But, by and large, I don't think our [[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1364&bih=669&ei=4CdcW6KcGoedgAbG6LrIAg&q=south+africa+roads&oq=south+africa+roads&gs_l=img.12...0.0.0.2544.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1ac..64.img..0.0.0....0.GRES0l1T6Io][roads]] are the real problem.
