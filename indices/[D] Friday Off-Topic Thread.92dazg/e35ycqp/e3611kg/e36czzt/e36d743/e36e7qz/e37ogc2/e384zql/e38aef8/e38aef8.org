  Adding actual bus routes has been tried, not without a degree of anger on the part of taxi drivers who fear for their livelihood. And it's not just road laws that they don't respect, either.

[[/evilcadance][]] I'm sorry, did you miss the part where I was the /czar/? Naturally the existing minibus drivers would be given (paid) driver training and guaranteed jobs as the "new" bus drivers. And the GPS boxes will be made of steel and welded into place with ink packets.

More seriously, South Africa clearly has its own unique challenges and hopefully the situation will improve slowly but surely. And maybe uberpool or something kills the minibus system. (That said, I had plenty of bad drivers in ubers in SE Asia - but then again they were better, on average, than non-uber drivers - so you know)
