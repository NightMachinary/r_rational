  I don't think that the roads are our problem. I think it's more the drivers.
#+end_quote

History aside, the drivers are a product of the roads, of any public safety messaging there is, etc. Driver education programmes are something we do - now I'm sure a bunch of ads telling drivers that going quickly to get more fares is dangerous won't be successful, but if I was the czar of road safety messaging in South Africa (something for which I'm completely unqualified!), I might start introducing it to the school curriculum at a young age, if it's as bad as you say.

There's also ways the road could be modified to prevent some of the actions taxis are making: driving up on the shoulder can be prevented by installing either a crash barrier or even just a pedestrian fence. Red light cameras, even though those are expensive and enforcement isn't the best way to go about things.

  And even ordinary drivers will often treat a speed limit as a recommendation rather than a rule
#+end_quote

This is universal: you don't lower speed limits to slow vehicles down (I recall seeing that a 10km reduction in speed limit reduces vehicle speeds by 4km), you do "traffic calming" - install roundabouts, curves in the road, rumble strips, speed bumps, reduce visibility, etc. Not being local I'm not sure what sort of changes like this would actually wind up being helpful or stuck to, or if there's something that's common over there that I've never heard of. But those are the sorts of things I might try.

(Oh, actually, if I became the czar of South Africa I'd probably ban the minibus taxis and replace them with actual bus routes since that might attack the route of the problem if minibus taxis are as large a portion of road accidents as you're implying. I'd also require bus drivers have special bus licenses and fancy GPSes on their buses that track adherence to speed limits. Also, while I was at it, I'd give every child a unicorn.)
