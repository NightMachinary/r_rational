  Oh, actually, if I became the czar of South Africa I'd probably ban the minibus taxis and replace them with actual bus routes since that might attack the route of the problem if minibus taxis are as large a portion of road accidents as you're implying. I'd also require bus drivers have special bus licenses and fancy GPSes on their buses that track adherence to speed limits. Also, while I was at it, I'd give every child a unicorn.

Adding actual bus routes has been tried, not without [[https://www.itdp.org/2009/04/03/challenging-times-for-bus-rapid-transit-system-johannesburg/][a degree of anger]] on the part of [[https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/taxi-group-refuses-to-budge-over-brt-system-438356][taxi drivers]] who fear for their livelihood. And it's not /just/ road laws that they don't respect, either.

Of course, the ones who get in the news are the worst examples; but those worst examples /do/ exist, will drive without a license, and will probably smash any fancy GPSs if it'll stop them doing what they want (most GPSs are not built to resist being hit with a spanner).

Note, however, that despite the protests the Bus Rapid Transit system /was/ [[https://www.reavaya.org.za/][introduced]] and /is/ working (and the busses aren't the memetic road dangers that the taxis are), but doesn't come anywhere /near/ a replacement for the taxi system.

Mind you, if you could successfully replace the minibus taxis with an efficient and useful public transport system, I do think that would be absolutely wonderful for South African road safety...
