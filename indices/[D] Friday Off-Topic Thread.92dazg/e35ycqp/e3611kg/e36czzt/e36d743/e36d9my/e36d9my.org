  and remember - every time you're finding a road problem that leads to a fatality, you're saving someone's life and they will never even know you did it.

Having been at the slightly further up part of the chain (coming up with ideas and the first stage of implementing them), eehhh. We don't have the budget to do a lot of things, and political pressure comes into it too (ugh). But yeah, hopefully some of the intersections I've worked on will avoid deaths because of my work. It is what makes me proud to do what I do instead of working in the more lucrative mining sector.
