I've done long rides with colleagues before (4 hours) and... yeah, it was spent talking. It's kind of dull but yeah. People in the area were talking about one of the people in our team and all his great stories that he tells and how they'll miss him now he's going onto better things (which is why I have a job there so I guess no pressure to come up with quips?)

I tend to listen to science / reality TV / true crime podcasts so maybe not something that would necessarily be "safe" to put on for all to hear, but something like This American Life or Radiolab might be OK. I tend to listen to everything at 2-2.5x though so listening to it on 1x speed for podcast-muggles would be infuriating.

And good job guessing right once I gave you enough information to perfectly guess the location ;). And our main metro area has 73% of the population but "only" 40% of the fatalities... very sad.

I will definitely be taking photos if we happen to see anything pretty! But alas there'd be minimal time for sight-seeing as apparently when we go regional, we do 12 hour days :| and the places the deaths occurred are probably not the same as the most pretty photo spots. Then again, sometimes the deadly stretches of road [[https://thewest.com.au/news/augusta-margaret-river-times/caves-road-upgrade-plan-raises-concerns-ng-b88765934z][are beautiful]]. There was a fatality at the one mentioned in that article in the last few months (I think after the article was published), and people are up in arms about removing the pretty trees that are just constantly killing people. It's very sad to remove trees and that road is GORGEOUS (I drove it once looking for rare flora markers, but that's another story), but according to statistics 'the community' is willing to pay $7 million to prevent a fatality and those trees have killed pleeenty of people in their time.
