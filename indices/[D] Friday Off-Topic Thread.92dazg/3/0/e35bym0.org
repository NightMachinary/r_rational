I love JJBA and have read all the parts but Stardust Crusaders was definitely a slog to watch it. If you're getting tired of I try reading the rest of just skipping to part 4. The pacing for part 4 is much better. I find that the characterizations get better each part. My personal favorites are parts 6,7,&8. With Steel Ball Run being considered his magnum opus.

For sure give 6 & 7 a try because the stands are incredibly creative and the characters are all unique and incredibly memorable. I think I read both parts in only a few sittings.

The ending of part 3, from when they finally arrive in Egypt and confront Dio, is fantastic. The fighting, the animation, the emotions, all 100% JJBA love. If you enjoyed the Kars fight in Battle Tendency you'll love the Dio fight.
