I took a hiatus from watching Stardust Crusaders for the exact same reasons.

The show started to feel completely different from the first two parts. It wasn't terrible exactly, but it began to feel more like a typical monster of the week anime, rather than a continuous evolving story.

I haven't forced myself to continue watching it yet, though I probably will at some point. But I have heard the second half of Stardust Crusaders is better than the first.
