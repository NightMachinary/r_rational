As I already made a post on The Nightmare Stacks I didn't want to make another thread about it.

So I just finished it and want to read more of the series. How similar are the rest of the books to it? Does book 8 cover Alex as the main character? Is the eater of souls a main character in one of the other books? Should I just go back to book 1 and start there?

Similarly, Id love for book recommendations on similar stories to the Nightmare Stacks, anything Lovecraftian, or anything in the Biopunk genre (like Twig, which I haven't finished yet). Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

ALSO, I'm suffering from clinical depression. I'd really enjoy just having some people to talk to on a regular basis about anything. Even if it's just you telling me about your day or what you're doing in life. I often let myself get too distracted inside my own head instead of reaching out to people and I'm always worried that I'm just bothering those people so penpals would be great.
