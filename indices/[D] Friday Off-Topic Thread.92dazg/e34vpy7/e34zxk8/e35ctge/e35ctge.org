The second half is significantly better as it goes more towards plot progression and setting up explanations without being info dumps. The last quarter of part 3 helps set up part 4 very well and does a good job of foreshadowing parts 5 & 6, as well as bits of 7.

As always, I will recommend reading the manga as it flows faster. But the end of part 3 and part 4 are definitely worth watching because of the superb animation and music choices.
