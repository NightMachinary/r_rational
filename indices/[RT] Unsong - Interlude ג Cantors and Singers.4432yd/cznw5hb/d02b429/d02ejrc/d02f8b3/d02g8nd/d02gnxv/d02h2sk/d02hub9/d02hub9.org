Is making a place so wonderful that you have other things to focus on than your atheist son (who when you arrived was still alive) really mind control? I would think you could it's a more extreme, long-term example of taking someone to a theme park or going out on the town to help distract them from something depressing in their life.

I also think I could come up with scenarios where the same effect could be had without violating identity/free will and don't think there's anything inconsistent with an omnipotent/omniscient being having the capability to do more than I imagine.

To be clear, if your scenario was the true situation I would agree that's the correct course, I just see no reason to think it's any more likely than any utopia scenario.
