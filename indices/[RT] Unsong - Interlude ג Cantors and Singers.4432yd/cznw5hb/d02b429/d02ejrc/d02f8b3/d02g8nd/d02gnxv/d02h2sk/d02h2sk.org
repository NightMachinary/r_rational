The problem is that descriptions of Heaven are not logically consistent when you consider some fairly common edge cases. For instance, theist parents of atheists (like my own) would find themselves in heaven, and not find their children. They would know, for a fact, that their own child, who they love, is being infinitely tortured. Heaven is supposed to be infinite bliss, but knowing that your loved one is suffering infinitely would make bliss impossible unless God was either forcing you to think about other things or just straight erasing your memories of the damned. The first is mind control, the second is killing you to replace you with a shallow mockery, remembering either made-up things or having inconsistent, patchy memories.

So yeah, I don't think heaven makes sense as a concept, and therefore something must be wrong about the idea.
