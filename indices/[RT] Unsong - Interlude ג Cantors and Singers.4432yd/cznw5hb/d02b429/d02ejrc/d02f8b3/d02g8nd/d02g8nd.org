Absolutely. If the Christian deity were real, I would consider it a moral duty to try to figure out a way to obliterate him. Due to Hell, God would be a source of infinite disutility, an infinity which is /not/ countered by the nightmarish mind-control eternity of Heaven. A universe with infinite suffering can't be allowed to exist one second longer than necessary. I would even consider it moral to obliterate the universe, if that was the only way. Null utility is better than negative infinity.
