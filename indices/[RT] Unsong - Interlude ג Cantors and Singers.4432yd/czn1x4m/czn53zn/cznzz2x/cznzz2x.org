Destruction is not just easier than construction, it's easier than maintenance:

Hell is something which /can/ be defeated. It's a standing edifice, ready to be torn down. It would likely collapse on its own without constant influxes of time, effort, and energy.

Starvation (to pick one of our real Singer's sources of suffering) happens through a /lack/ of time, effort, or energy. It would require all of those, in perpetuity, to prevent starvation entirely.

Removing a wicked edifice is always easier than establishing a virtuous one. Not only is the construction expensive, the result is often less effective than advertised, or less efficient, or even ultimately counter-productive. Genuine virtuous edifice are so rare that most effective altruism doesn't take them seriously, and goes after lower hanging fruit instead: Saving individual lives, one bed-net at a time.

Genuine wicked edifice? Also more nuanced than Hell, and possessed of better funded Public Relations departments. They're still more popular as rhetorical targets (Big Tobacco, Big Oil, The Media, Communism) because destroying them sounds like a winnable fight. It has an easily conceivable end.

Fights against suffering are, by and large, eternal.
