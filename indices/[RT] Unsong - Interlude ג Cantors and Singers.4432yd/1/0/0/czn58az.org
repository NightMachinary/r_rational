That's because every chapter has kabbalistic implications, which is not a coincidence, and is therefore kabbalistic.

For example, to 'traverse' an array of some information is to visit each item in the array, such as chapters in a story. An "eda" is a norse epic story, and the person identifying kabbalistic implications of each chapter is Named [[/u/traverseda]]. This is not a coincidence either.
