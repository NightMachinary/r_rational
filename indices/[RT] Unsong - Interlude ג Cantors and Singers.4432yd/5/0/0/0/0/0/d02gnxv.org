I guess it may depend on your philosophy (that's a purely utilitarian argument) and expectation of afterlives then, making this a rather fruitless conversation- for example, I think most people would say that the vast majority of people go to heaven (or if they never had a true chance of being Christian due to, for example, living in a majority Shinto/Buddhist country, then they go to purgatory, which is portrayed as pretty null utility) and would disagree that heaven has any kind of mind control... Which would make the situation a net positive by utilitarian standards.
