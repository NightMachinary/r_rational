I don't actually endorse the tribalistic position from any sort of conscious/logical point of view, and never have. Nonetheless, the acknowledgement that this reaction is logically flawed and not supportable, fails to move me emotionally towards either liking the real Singer more or liking the Unsong singer less.

I have noticed that my emotions are often not tied particularly well to my logical / cognitive parts. I try to make my actual executive function and decisionmaking more by the logical/cognitive results than my intuitive feelings which are often wrong.
