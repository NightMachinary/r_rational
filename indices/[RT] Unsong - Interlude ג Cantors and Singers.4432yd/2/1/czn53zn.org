I had the exact same reaction.

I've tried to analyze my own reaction, and I think in my personal case it possibly boils down to tribalism and near-far perspective stuff - I see a lot Singer's effective altruism stuff as benefiting people unrelated to me, those foreign to me who are not part of my 'tribe', while the destruction of Hell I view as benefiting me and my 'tribe'. Plus the goal seems somehow more concrete & achievable. Plus of course the tendency to love a martyr. However, the first bit is probably what persuaded my emotional reaction the most. That's just me, though.
