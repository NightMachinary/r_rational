So how powerful is Thamiel? One would think he would be on the level of an arch-angel like Uriel, but he needed to put a price on Singer's head in order to have him killed. Even if he couldn't smite PS, you'd think he could dispatch some agents to kill him in some more demonic way than a car bomb. Furthermore, Hell could apparently be laid siege to.

On the other hand, we don't know how powerful the Comet King is to be able to threaten Hell, and the fact that it seems to literally have billions of tortured souls suggests other biblical facts about it and its ruler may be accurate.
