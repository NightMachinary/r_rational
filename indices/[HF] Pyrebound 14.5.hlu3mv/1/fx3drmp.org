After so long, Ram makes what seems like his final return to Dul-K. I'm hoping Rammash can rally the people and the former militiamen into forming a coalition to oppose or balance out the interests of the elites. Only through institution-building can Ram effect lasting change in the region.

On the other hand, he could use violence to cow or disable his enemies, but I don't think that would be productive or profitable long term.
