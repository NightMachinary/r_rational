Also in PB news, [[https://youtu.be/Na3hne7YsKg][I did a podcast about it]] with a couple of friends today. Warning: the audio quality is far from top-notch--I had to use my laptop's microphone, so it cuts out in spots--but it's some behind-the-scenes stuff, a look at the worldbuilding, etc. Also, I confess my fear that one of you is going to call me on my bullshit.

I promise my voice is not usually that dweeby. I think.
