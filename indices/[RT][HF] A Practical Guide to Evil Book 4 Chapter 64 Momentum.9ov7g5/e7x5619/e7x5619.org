I notice a Theme: Persistent conflict retards growth/progress.

Praes and Callow, both backwaters, likely because of their nigh-eternal conflict.

The Fae courts, at an absolute stand-still for millennia.

The Drow, who tore /themselves/ apart, tore themselves from greatness.

The Principate, with constant internal political strife.

The Gods themselves are twisted mockeries of liberty and cooperation.
