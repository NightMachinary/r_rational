1st point) You used evidence of her power and identity being usurped (and voluntarily given back to her) as evidence it cannot happen. So, thanks ;)

2nd point) It is true their title seems much tougher to remove. See your 1st point for a good reason why that doesnt matter.

3rd point) I like Cat. I want to see her succeed and retain her great powers. If she is usurped by Akua, again, then that is a negative to me. Not even a huge one, as I used the word "worried" vs "catastrophic destruction of all her plans and those she holds dear." So you have succeeded in arguing against the catastrophic part (which I didnt say or think was going to happen) and instead you failed to successfully argue against the idea that it makes sense to worry that my favorite character might run into difficulties with her powers (difficulties well documented in-text, thanks for the exact references!).

I am also curious why the pushback. Do the other readers WANT less drama and fewer threats? I love this story, partly due to how open the world is and the variety of threats Cat faces and has faced. If there is zero chance for Akua to ever usurp Cat's mantle (again), then how is she a threat at all? Akua and Cat are both sworn to protect Callow, so why even worry about what Akua will do, except as it pertains to Cat herself? Due to oaths people seem to believe are 100% ironclad (except the story mentions Cat doesnt trust Akua not to find some wiggle room), Akua could move to take cat's power if Akua believes it will help Callow.

I assumed no such thing about it being "just" a title. It is something that was given to her against the will of the old owner (the power itself). It could be a pretty rock or an extra arm and it would be the same for my purposes. Saying "title" is short hand for all it entails.

In this world, nothing appears to be inviolable. Even the Gods themelves had their power taken against their will (by Cat) and used in ways they didnt want it used. Am I to assume, despite massive evidence otherwise (Black Knight, Akua, Empress, Heriophant, Warlock, etc) that Cat is the only one on their planet who can pull off such things?
