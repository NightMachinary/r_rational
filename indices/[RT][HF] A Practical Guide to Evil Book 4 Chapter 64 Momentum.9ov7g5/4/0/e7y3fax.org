Recall that when Akua took over, she summoned Cat back to her body by using Winter powers. So far there is no real distinction between Cat and her mantle so to become a Sovereign of Moonless Nights one would effectively have to become Catherine.

Alternatively, Cat has already made oaths that bind Sovereign of Moonless Nights to protect Callow, etc. That way, even if Akua gained the title she would be forced to act in a way aligned with Callowan interests.
