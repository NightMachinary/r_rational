Or 4) Cat assumes that Akua or the "Backstabbing is a cultural virtue" drow will inevitably find a way to twist away from ANYTHING she has them swear willingly. The contingency is knowing that and being prepared to trade resources gained now for resources spent later putting down the inevitable rebellion. For bonus points, something nasty with Masego and a sympathetic link with the Fae magic in each of the oath-takers would be hilarious.

"I know this will go wrong, and when it does, I/the Woe will solve it by stabbing it in the face" is a very Cat contingency.
