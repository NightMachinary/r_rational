People are moving the goalpost, not I. I pointed out the oaths worry me and suddenly people are acting like no one could ever take her title, no one can usurp her position or body and it is nothing to worry about... which seems like the weirdest argument ever to me, and one rather opposite the text so far. Pointing out their arguments are wrong vs my original point is definitely not moving the goalpost.

Even here where you responded, you said "harder to subvert." So you agree it is possible. I am worried, you arent...why are you arguing again?

I remain clear...it worries me that Cat is having the oaths sworn to her title rather than herself. I worry because Akua is part of her mantle and has usurped her before.

If it doesnt worry the people who responded, that is totally fine. I didnt say "omfg people, its a cataclysm of epic proportions and omfg, how do not see it?!?!" I just said it worries me and everything since has been people telling me it isnt a thing while admitting that it is a thing. If anything I am highly amused.
