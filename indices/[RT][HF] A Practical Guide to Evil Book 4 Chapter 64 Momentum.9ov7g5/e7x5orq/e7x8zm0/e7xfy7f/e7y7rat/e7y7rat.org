You need to step back and rethink your assumptions, the biggest being that the title SOMN is easier to steal than the name Catherine Foundling. You've assuming that SOMN is just a title, when it is Winter itself. A good interpretation is that SOMN is the /real/ thing, and Catherine Foundling is just a role that SOMN puts on. In retrospect there are 3 big hints supporting this interpretation:

- In chapter 71 of the last Book Cat was terrified of turning into some creature wearing the face and identity of Catherine Foundling, and the author loves putting in foreshadowings like this
- Your fae title is an identity not easily separated from yourself: Larat is still Nightfall even after resigning from his post as the Prince of Nightfall, and Cat didn't become the Duchess of Violent Squall after taking his place.
- The biggest evidence is that Akua already usurped Catherine Foundling once before. When she was controlling the construct, she was bound by all the oaths that Cat swore to. Conversely, this means that as far as oaths are concerned, Akua counts as Cat when she is controlling the construct.
