The author saying the oath intentionally is made to the title rather than to Catherine doesnt result in it being wrong to worry the title can be changed/stolen. It validates it. Also, I was commenting on Cat making a mistake, where Errata was responding to someone critisizing the writing itself.

It implies that either

1) Cat is aware and plans to step down from Winter somehow

2) Akua created the wording in order to facilitate her move

3) in a world where Cat proved pretty much anything can happen, there is something she believes is impossible

Mostly I think putting the texts of oaths into the story is tough, because after years of running a Vampire LARP (the Invictus are a big one here) and various D&D campaigns, I do not think perfect oaths are even slightly easy to craft. The simpler the better and I have still seen extremely simple oaths violated in the worst ways due to incautious wording (incidently, demon summoning would be the worst idea ever).

**to be clear, I do not think our dear author made a mistake here. I think it is simply a point to ponder due it's ramifications, especially since it was apparently written that way on purpose.
