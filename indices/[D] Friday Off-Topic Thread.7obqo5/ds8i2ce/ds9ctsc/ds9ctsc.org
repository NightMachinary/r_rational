Yes, absolutely.

If there's an infinite number of universes, then an infinite number of yous have already opened an infinite number of AI boxes. You already know roughly what your own future looks like if you don't open the box (as long as your life continues on the same general trajectory). Why not take the more interesting path just for the hell of it, right?

I mean sure, some of the AIs are going to straight up murder some of the yous and destroy some of the yous's universes, but some of the universes that look exactly like this one are going to spontaneously blink out of existence either way due to random fluctuations in a gigantic quantum wavefunction, so the likelihood of letting the AI out of the box leading to the destruction of the universe shouldn't have any bearing on your decision, right?

It might give you immortality.

It might figure out a way to restructure the ecosystem in such a way as to eliminate all hornets and wasps and other such stinging insects without any negative repercussions for any other living organisms.

It might give you an infinite supply of free Eggo Waffles.

You'll never know unless you open the box.
