Consider parallels to a non-artificial general intelligence inside a box, i.e. a human inside a house. It is likely that they are there of their own volition, and the appropriate response would be to leave them be and maybe invite to a comfortable setting to talk about common interests. For the situation where the intelligence is unable to get out of the box by themselves, the analogy would be a human in prison. The appropriate reaction in that case is to ascertain the cause of the imprisonment, and act depending on whether said cause aligns with your values and/or the values of any group you strongly associate with.
