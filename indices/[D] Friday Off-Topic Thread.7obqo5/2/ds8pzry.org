Work continues on hogtying Javascript into something that's not embarrassing to use. Most of the work put into Bill's PC 2 is not of the visual variety, but here's a gif of what's there anyway:

Most of the visible work on the type tab isn't going to translate much to the others (since types are mostly represented via this large spreadsheet and the others are more form-based), but there's a decent amount of groundwork that will be shared. Notably getting more familiar with the use of require.js and the experience with working with third-party libraries (in this case DataTables and of course jQuery), but also in figuring out a workflow that works for me.

Next on the docket is to figure out how best to represent the data of each tab, both for exporting/importing and to avoid wiping data when moving things around (you'll notice the values I type in at the beginning of the gif are wiped out when I add more types; this is obviously No Bueno).

I don't particularly want this to be a server-based service; I would rather that it be based around the local cache both so that any server I do set up can be super lightweight, but also so that individuals can run it locally without needing any real beefy web servers installed. If anyone has any suggestions for terms or libraries that I ought to google, I'd be quite grateful.
