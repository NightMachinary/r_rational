In the /very/ early stages of writing a little something called [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/][Doki Doki Rationality Club]]. It'll probably be a while before I start posting - having learned from my unfortunately ill-fated Gravity Falls fic Sanity Falls, I don't think I'll begin publishing chapters until I have a considerable backlog, and possibly even until I've actually written the whole thing. That way, if I wind up flaking out, I won't have left people hanging with an incomplete fic. Not anticipating it'll be that long, but I think my attention will be split between this and other projects so it might take a while to write.

Hope some people out there are excited for this dumb meme project that may or may not happen. :P At least I know I am.
