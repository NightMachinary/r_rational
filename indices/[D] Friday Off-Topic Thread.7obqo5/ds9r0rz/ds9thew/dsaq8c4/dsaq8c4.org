Thanks for your feedback! I agree that Vampire Flower Language is long but it's a play on Victorian Flower Language so I'm not sure there's much I can do with it. That said I'm not sure if anyone has heard of so I've added an interlude that spells out that Victorian Flower Language is a thing early on.
