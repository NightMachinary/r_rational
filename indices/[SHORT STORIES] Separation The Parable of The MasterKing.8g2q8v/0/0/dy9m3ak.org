1) it takes a topic that is already a prickly subject (that of religion in general and God and Lucifer in particular) and does nothing interesting with it. It just changes Lucy's dialog to have big, modern sounding words without any actual substance.

2) the dialog is obnoxiously flowery. It attempts to imitate a biblical style without even doing that well. There are at least three paragraphs here that are nothing but name dropping drivel or contentless prose.

3) the spelling is really distracting. Magi is plural (so when talking about one person should be Magus), it's "to and /fro/", etc. Your formatting is bad (each turn of dialog should be it's own paragraph).

TL;DR it's painful to read due to poor craftsmanship, and once one puts in that effort to look past that, there's not even anything worthwhile for the effort. The idea itself has merit but the execution here is awful.
