Pick up an actual fucking dictionary instead on using the internet for everything. When i was in highschool, there was an instance that our teacher talked to us about and showed proof that dictionary.Com is just some 3rd party site with no credibility and was even hacked once with malware and viruses. Nice try shitlord.
