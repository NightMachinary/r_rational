1: lol i literally wrote this in an hour. 2:magi in ancient hebrew culture and in middle eastern culture describes a king, not magician like people think. 3:how about you pick up a dictionary and you'll see that i did in fact use the words in their correct manner. 4:If I Did such an abysmal job, how about you write a better dialogue. How can you say its bad when you don't even know the context of where these ideas mentioned in the story came from? If you do know, then show me the scriptures that speak of what lucifer says before he becomes satan and what his thoughts and ideas were (and yes, there are verses, read the torah and the tanakh). How can you possible make a judgment like that when you don't even know what i was thinking or how i think? lol you are obviously not a real author of any merit xD I've made teachers cry with my work, I've won many awards as a student in middle school and highschool for my writing. To be honest, i think you're making such unfounded and obviously asinine comments to try and piss me off or to look "cool" like half of the other empty-headed, so called "philosophers" on here; the STEREOTYPICAL reddit user Just because you don't find something interesting, doesn't mean that is what everyone thinks; the world doesn't revolve around you lol.

Think before you shitpost

P.S: You obviously have a bias because if you actually READ the short story, you'd see that the dialogue generally ends for each character at the end of said paragraph, but in some cases it doesn't because the story flows better that way and its not a rule that you HAVE to end the dialogue of a character at the end of each paragraph; that is just fucking retarded lmfao. The structure of a paragraph doesn't have to have the same size and even structure as another paragraph.
