BAIT SIGHTED. BAIT LOCKED ON.

  1: lol i literally wrote this in an hour.
#+end_quote

Ah, the "I was only shitposting" defense. Classic.

  2:magi in ancient hebrew culture and in middle eastern culture describes a king, not magician like people think. 3:how about you pick up a dictionary and you'll see that i did in fact use the words in their correct manner.
#+end_quote

Hmm, like [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/magi][Mirriam-Webster]]? You're sending mixed messages here. Regardless, [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frow][frow]] is not used how you indirectly claim it is.

  4:If I Did such an abysmal job, how about you write a better dialogue.
#+end_quote

I have. It's why I felt I would honor your request for feedback.

#+begin_quote
  How can you say its bad when you don't even know the context of where these ideas mentioned in the story came from?
#+end_quote

Because the origin of an idea has little to do with its substance or execution. I specifically mentioned that there was merit to your concept here, but the judgement comes from the only source I have available, i.e. the words in front of me.

#+begin_quote
  How can you possible make a judgment like that when you don't even know what i was thinking or how i think?
#+end_quote

Because the words are right here. You posted them. It was them I judged. [[https://www.xkcd.com/1984/][If you failed to communicate your thoughts with everyone you meet, then perhaps the problem is not with everyone else.]]

#+begin_quote
  lol you are obviously not a real author of any merit xD
#+end_quote

You're right, I should troll niche subreddits more often if I'm to become anyone of any powerful writing caliber.

#+begin_quote
  I've made teachers cry with my work
#+end_quote

This is too good to not quote back. Surely a writer of such prowess as yours would know not to use phrases with ambiguous meanings during an internet slapfight, when their more overt meaning works against you?

#+begin_quote
  I've won many awards as a student in middle school and highschool for my writing.
#+end_quote

I'm sure your mother put them in their place of honor on the refrigerator as was only due a scholar of your magnitude. Spoiler alert: high school doesn't matter, kiddo. College barely does, for that matter.

#+begin_quote
  To be honest, i think you're making such unfounded and obviously asinine comments to try and piss me off or to look "cool" like half of the other empty-headed, so called "philosophers" on here; the STEREOTYPICAL reddit user Just because you don't find something interesting, doesn't mean that is what everyone thinks; the world doesn't revolve around you lol.
#+end_quote

I note that while you call it asinine, you only sort-of addressed the third point (and failed to bring any evidence to bear besides "my teacher told me so"). You whine about no feedback, and then you whine that the feedback wasn't someone patting you on the head and giving you a gold star. If you're actually honest about wanting to be a writer then you're going to have to buck up and pay attention when someone /actually/ takes time out of their day to critique your work.

#+begin_quote
  The structure of a paragraph doesn't have to have the same size and even structure as another paragraph.
#+end_quote

The issue is that you've got a big wall of text. English convention has each side of a dialog in its own paragraph, to break the page into logical chunks and produce an ebb and flow. You'll note I even did it in this post, which makes the alternating back and forth immediately apparent and breaks all the text into nice idea-shaped chunks. It's more effort than a slapfight deserves, but it /does/ make things less difficult for the reader when he tries to extract my meaning.

That's a writer's job, after all--to communicate ideas from one brain to another. Don't complain when people take one look at your bad prose and decide that if you haven't put in the basic effort to make it /readable/, that you also didn't put in enough effort to make it /worthwhile/.

Also, 4/10 bait. Someone's a bit mad if they're going to fly off the handle and delete their post the moment someone doesn't adore it. You gotta keep your cool when fishing for reactions, my man.
