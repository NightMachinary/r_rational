Ivah mentioned that killing the undead can indeed add to the Night, and that's without the fact that they would stand alone against the dwarves.

First tier probably have actual pantheons instead of gods walling off their separate seats of power. My guess is that the series either ends on a conflict with a world power establishing Calernia on the global stage (but the introductions for that need to start soon, because EE initially had this point be halfway through the second to last book, and all the opponents that came without foreshadowing were pretty questionable), or the epilogue to the seventh book will be Cat's more optimistic version of "Tremble, for I am not yet content".
