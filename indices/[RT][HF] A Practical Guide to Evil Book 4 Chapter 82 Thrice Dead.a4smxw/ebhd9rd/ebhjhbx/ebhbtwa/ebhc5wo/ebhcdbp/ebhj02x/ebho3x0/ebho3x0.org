Matron? Patron is distinctly masculine (though that's a tad pedantic).

Yeah, I agree with this the most, it would be interesting if she has her own unaligned capital G god, powering her new name, though honestly I don't think Priestess of Night suits her as a Name. Names are supposed to say something about the person, they /are/ the Name as much as they are themselves, Warlord of Night or Herald of Night would probably fit her better, and it would be cool if she was being called Herald by everyone.
