Difference is in what can be considered "mortal". Villains, as a rule, are immortal but they can still very much be killed. Heroes, as a rule, are not immortal but have longer life expectancy (assuming they can make it out of the starting area before Black has his way with them).

The ambiguity between what is a Name and what is a title make it difficult to see whether Cat is a mortal pleb or a mortal Named (EE, is it really too much trouble to simply italicise and bold new Names when they are introduced?).

But I digress. Priestess of Night was Sve Noc's Name and she could bestow it upon Cat on account of her being god now. We'll see what Wednesday brings.
