So the Dwarves are stronger than the King of the Dead? Sve Noc said that they can't handle the Dwarves at all, but they're willing to go up against the Dead King? Are they counting on support from the Dwarves and Procer as well, or is the Dead King that much easier to handle? Or is it a matter of type advantage, that Night can interact with the necromancy somehow?

As a side note, it's been mentioned before that all of the powers shown so far save the Dwarves are just backwater countries that can't compare at all to the global stage, which really makes you wonder how strong the global powers are. If something like Sve Noc is second tier, then what's first tier? I wonder if the story will ever expand its scope. So far, all the mentions of the global powers, like the Gnomes, have just been for flavor. Is another, bigger antagonist going to show up after the current conflict is resolved?
