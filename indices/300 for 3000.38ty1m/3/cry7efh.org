I would enjoy the contest. $300 is kinda big money for me -- hell, i get $35 per month as my student payment -- and I love writing for contests. (Unfortunately, English is my third language, but I can at least hope).

The thing is, the winner should not be identified with upvotes. The votes for story should be comments, and only commenters who left at least one comment in this sub before should be counted, to protect us from second accounts.
