  Because we want to get the best stories and we want to reward the best authors. Disqualifying some because they've written things before works against that.

Please note: I'm currently earning my /living/ with my writing, and I'm suggesting I should be out of the running for a monetary prize. I and the other experienced authors are going to keep writing regardless of whether we win a prize; we've already demonstrated that we have the bug.

The question here is whether your focus is long-term or short-term. Personally, my goal is long-term; I want to incentivize more new authors to start writing so that the community will have a larger pool of people producing for us. People who have been hesitating to post their story are more likely to do so if there's a prize, and even more likely if they know they aren't competing against more experienced authors. Authors who write a well-received story -- prizewinning or not -- are likely to get the bug and keep writing, making things better for the community as a whole.

All that said, we can resolve the entire problem by just doing what I said above: have a separate category for newbies. That gets everyone what they want.
