  Why?
#+end_quote

Because we /want/ to get the best stories and we /want/ to reward the best authors. Disqualifying some because they've written things before works against that.

  Not sure I agree -- just flip through the top 4 or 5 pages of the sub and ask anyone with more than 3 entries to contribute if they want but please be okay with not being eligible for a prize.

You say that, but you recommended excluding DaystarEld, who has many submissions but (as far as I can tell) the relevant ones are different chapters of the same work. Should we really exclude someone (and as a prime example at that) because they have written one well-accepted work here?

Furthermore, looking at the submissions would tell you very little in most cases, as the majority of users are submitting links to others' stuff in here.

*Edit:* Please, [[/u/alexanderwales]] and [[/u/DaystarEld]] if this happens, don't be discouraged to post. I /want/ to see your submissions as well as the others'.
