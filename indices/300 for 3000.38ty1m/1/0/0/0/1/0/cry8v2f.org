Agreed. [[/u/eaglejarl]] has the right idea in wanting to encourage newer writers: anonymized submissions as [[/u/eaturbrainz]] suggested should be done regardless, but I'm probably going to take myself out of the running either way unless the prompt lights a fire in my head, both a) to give others a better chance at getting recognized and b) because it would cut into time spent writing other stuff.

I've had people ask me to start a Patreon or work from commissions, and while that's something I'm considering, I'd rather the funds from subreddit-wide contests like this encourage others to try their hand.
