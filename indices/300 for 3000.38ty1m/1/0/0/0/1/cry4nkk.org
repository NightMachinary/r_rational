The most likely scenario for me is that I would participate and then disqualify myself as a winner (depending on what the rules were and whether I thought I could do the challenge justice). I mostly agree that the purpose of a competition is participation and variety, which you're less likely to get if amateurs think that they're competing against professionals (leaving aside that calling myself a professional is woefully egotistical). If someone wanted me to write a story, they could commission one.
