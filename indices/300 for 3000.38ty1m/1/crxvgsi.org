Well, I'll be starting a Kickstarter soon....

In seriousness, I think the "give it as prize money in a story contest" is the best plan. A couple refinements I would add:

- It should be used to incentivize new authors. Myself, alexanderwales, DaystarEld, and all the other regular posters should be disqualified.
- Have multiple prizes; don't make it winner take all or trying becomes less appealing.
- The stories should be submitted anonymously so prior rep doesn't factor in.
