I would like to point out, just in case it hasn't yet been considered, that if there will be a monetary prize for writing, it should be original work.

Winning a small monetary prize for fanfiction might not be a big deal to most writers, but it could be used by a writer/publisher to set an example. Nobody wants to go to small claims court for this.
