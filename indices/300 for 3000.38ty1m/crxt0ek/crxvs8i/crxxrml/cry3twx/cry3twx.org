I would run it like a bunch of the other contests in and around reddit. [[/r/fantasywriters]] has [[http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/38f312/congratulations_to_utheclumsyninja_winner_of_the/][one they do every month]], which is well-run. [[/r/worldbuilding]] used to have one, but I think the weekly one has fallen by the wayside. If you run it on reddit, I would suggest the following:

1. Have a "this is what to write" thread, followed by a "submission" thread some time later (two weeks is my recommendation). I would recommend a loose prompt and some sort of guideline about length; you don't want minimum effort posts. If your "length" guideline is long enough, entrants can link to Google Docs.
2. Get a mod to put the thread into contest mode if you want to determine a winner by upvotes ([[/r/worldbuilding]] used to have two prizes: one given based on "best" sorting at the end of the contest period, and one given based on judge's choice).

I would keep the prizes fairly small; the prize is there mostly to incentivize people and increase participation, and it doesn't need to be that large in order to do that. Most reddit competitions only have special flair, community recognition, and on occasion reddit gold, and that seems like enough for most people. At a certain price point you're not actually adding that much to participation/quality because of diminishing returns.

If this sounds like work, it is, but you can probably find someone to run things for you. (I did a small challenge [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/353kr3/challengeprompt_you_find_an_oracle_that_will/][last month]] that I consider moderately successful, and was sort of thinking about how to do this as a more structured thing; that takes away from my writing time though, and to do it like I want would almost require mod powers (for flair, contest mode, and stickied posts).)
