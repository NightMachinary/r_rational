I guess you can use the money to promote the sub so it'll get even more subscribers, but I am not sure how productive that'll be.

Personalty, if I were you I'd probably come up with a premise and run a competition on who can write the best story from it, as it'll both encourage rationalist writers, and the community would get a nice story or two to read.

Edit:Possible premise that might also promote the sub some if the winner ends up really good - a story that involves [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is some way.
