That would certainly reward people who are already contributing, but I see no reason why it should increase growth, except possibly if it generates publicity as "that one sub that retroactively rewards you," or if people post more in the hopes of being rewarded if someone else does retroactive rewards again later.

I think in the post you linked to, it's talking more about solving real-world problems, which usually takes money. Here we're talking about drawing people in and increasing visibility. You can pay for visibility, as has been suggested with paying for Reddit ads. People are drawn in / write stories generally not for monetary rewards (we haven't got enough money to reward everyone enough to make it worthwhile), but instead because they are interested and find it fun. So what we want to do is not to fund established authors, but find the people who have never heard of this sub but would find it interesting if they knew about it, and give them a little extra push to come over. Another secondary goal I see discussed here in this thread is to convince the current people here who for whatever reason do not participate much to participate more.
