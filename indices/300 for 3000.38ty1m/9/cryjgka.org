IF there is interest in making this a little more complex:

Can we think of a way to use this to encourage writers, encourage rational writing, AND to make this subreddit a bit better known?

Maybe arrange some sort of alternate use of Kickstarter?

Here's what I'm thinking:

1) Accept some entries. 2) The person who came up with the idea chooses five (or whatever.) 3) For FINAL judging, Kickstarter the contest by entering each individual story as a Kickstarter entry. (If Kickstarter requires a prize, offer a copy of the story in E-mail from the author or something.) 4) The funds raised from the Kickstarter all go to charity. 5) Whichever story garners the greatest total for charity wins.

The prize money goes to writers, but the voting is done with money donated to a charity.

If there's a better site for this sort of thing than Kickstarter, then sure, use that.
