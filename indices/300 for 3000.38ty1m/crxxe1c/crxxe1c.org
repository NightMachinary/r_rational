Donate to an upcoming author who is already writing rational stories like [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales?ty=c][alexanderwales]], [[https://www.patreon.com/davidstorrs?ty=h][David Storrs]], or [[https://www.patreon.com/nobody103?ty=c][Domagoj Kurmaic]] (the names are links to Patreon accounts) who have Patreon accounts to make it easy to donate to them. (I'm already doing so at the low, low price of a dollar per chapter/month for at least one of them).

I'd suggest FarmerBob1 as well, but I can't find any place to donate directly to him.

Of course it doesn't have to be the people above, they're just the most well-known on this subreddit. But I can't think of anyone else off the top of my head currently/recently producing things other than Nighzmarquls, DaystarEld, and OmgImPwned.
