Have a story competition as others have noted. After that have some sort of impartial method to determine the winner, and some minor prize for the winner- reddit gold, or [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Triple-Trophy-Award-engraving-characters/dp/B00IKTCH6I/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1433694038&sr=8-3&keywords=trophy]] a small gold trophy with an engraving. Perhaps have several prizes, to incentise lots of submissions.

For the best new author also promise five- ten dollars per reasonable length submission for 5 submissions for continuing their story.

This encourages lots of one offs, is fun, cost effective, and encourages long running stories for us.
