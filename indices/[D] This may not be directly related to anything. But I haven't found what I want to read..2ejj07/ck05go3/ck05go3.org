It makes sense, and I understand where you're coming from, but ... it doesn't tend to make for a good story, it's quite hard to do, and most people don't really want to read that. Just for clarification, you /are/ talking about essentially having the section that would make up the epilogue extended to encompass a whole book, right?

So your /start/ would be something like this:

  Matarisvan walked across the marbled floor, with the Sword of a Thousand Forms dragging behind him and cutting a neat groove in the black stone. The spurts of blood from the vizier's neck slowed down to a trickle as his heart gave out, and in the second when he died, the Hyperborean Crown blinked across the distance between them and settled on Matarisvan's head. Matarisvan grunted; the Hyperborean Crown was made of solid gold, and the Ancients had left it free of enchantments in some misguided effort to make the burden of rule a physical thing. He continued on, towards the Elder Throne, and collapsed into it.

  Matarisvan closed his eyes and delved into his memory palace, walking quickly through the battered hallways where the vizier had done his damage. The battle had been fought in both the physical and mental realms, and while Matarisvan had ultimately prevailed in the combat of muscles and swords, the vizier had come dangerously close to achieving a total victory in the realm of the mind. Matarisvan pulled a brick from the wall in one very specific location, and pulled out the Elder Sequence. As soon as his imagined fingertips touched it, the Elder Throne grasped at it greedily, and three seconds later, Matarisvan achieved godhood.

  For the first time in his life, he felt both the physical and mental realms with equal clarity, not having to trade one for the other. His mental self repaired the memory palace, while his physical self worked complicated bits of magic that had suddenly been made simple. He stitched his body back together, sealing the wounds and setting the bones in his left arm. There were manifold improvements to make, muscles to strengthen and bones to solidify, but even as he began to make the changes, he realized that there would be no point to it. He scrapped much of the body, and watched with preternatural calm as his organs dissolved away into nothingness. With his new power there was no need for muscle or bone, no need to breathe or keep a beating heart.

  He idly cleaned the throne room as his gaze swept over it, putting the marble columns back together and cleaning the liters of blood that had been spilled. The vizier was dead, but his brain was still intact, and Matarisvan scooped out the mind that was trapped within it before vanishing the body from existence. Then he turned his view to the wider world, cracked his metaphorical knuckles, and got to work.
