  I want inhuman minds. Really inhuman. Human ambassador characters are cop-outs. I want inhuman minds that would take years to understand properly.

Thinking those up requires extensive study and experience in cognitive science. You have to know how minds are built to build one that's not just an imitation of your own.

EDIT: Actually, I just realized what a weird story you could write if you took seriously the concept of an entire civilization of countryball-like minds. Those things /are/ broadly inhuman, even if the concepts sorta-kinda make sense from a human point of view, when the human is particularly stupid or insane.
