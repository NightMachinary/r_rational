  Most urgent; stopping death and current suffering. He spun of a shard of will and shaped it with spells of indestructibility, unconsciousness, and stasis, then sent it to nigh instantly duplicate itself over the entire planet seeking out any and all living cells to pause and preserve their exact state while the detail work was being done.

  Speed and raw IQ was nice, but he didn't trust any automated spell to improve creativity, wisdom, emotional maturity, and ethics, and those were the things truly needed for determine what to do next. Spinning of a copy of his full mind (minus the knowledge of the Elder Sequence and privileges) and subconsciously accessing the thrones knowledge of neuroscience he started quickly iterating through various modification.

  Enchantments changing the relative weighting, power, speed, and parallelism of different areas. Locking and altering the levels of hundreds of different neurotransmitters, looking at various brains out in the world locked in various states of flow, concentration, and clarity but also those known to be especially compassionate, caught in moments of epiphany about the beauty of nature, or overwhelmed with love for the world. Copying the memories from a myriad different experts and tenderly weaving them together, merging duplicate concept-nodes and checking muscle memories and intuitions with quick practical tests in a temporary body. Powerful scries and arithmancy of mindboggling complexity woven into each cubic millimeter of tissue constantly checking for errors and providing truth on a level below even the subconscious. He must have labored for subjective weeks, even months on this without rest or distraction, but in the movement of celestial bodies but minutes passed.

  Then, the god with the mind of a man, and the prisoner with the mind of a god, simply talked. About everything, big and small, laughing and crying, as hours became days. Their minds embraced, and again they were one, smiling.

  Again he spun of a copy, this time putting it to sleep and letting it's memories drift away. A decade ago he had met a wandering beggar who he had gotten to know over the few weeks he'd stayed in the area, and who were the wisest and kindest person he knew of, an after all this time would have trusted with his life ten times over. His minds eye sought out where he was now and copied the memories wholesale into the sleeping mind through one of the most powerful spells ever devised so streaming them with the true, full formative power of having experienced that life.

  Many lives were streamed - lived - this way. The common man, unusual in no way. A rich and lazy king. The leader of a world religion hailed as just and wise even by those opposing it. An old genius polymath, who had puzzled out from scratch ideas which would change the world several times and all other could but see as miracles. A girl abused in ways no man could ever comprehend, grown up to be stronger in spite of it. The vizier. A starving child. A slave. A master. A mother. The last of a people wiped out. The conqueror, victorious. A fully representative sample of the width, breath, and depth of human experience. Lastly, himself.

  He sat on the throne, weary, seeing with his eyeless vision the sleeping mind, hesitant. But he woke it up, and spoke. About everything, far and near, in argument and in agreement, as days become weeks. Their minds made love, and again they were one, a tear on his cheek.

  Three slow breaths. Constructing a chamber of of inhuman humanity to banish worry. Another spell to assign a number to each person in the world.

  He summoned the first person, an old man, restored their body to ease any pains, and woke them up. Explained the situation, made a bit of small talk getting to know him, asked abaut what he wanted to happen now, his fears and his values. Put him back in stasis. He summoned the second person, a young child. This was going to be a very long night.
