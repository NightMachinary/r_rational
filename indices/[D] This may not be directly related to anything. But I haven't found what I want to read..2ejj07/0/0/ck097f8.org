Also to some degree, A Song of Ice and Fire follows this format. The story that most fantasy authors would tell is that of Robert's Rebellion, where a brave young knight, tutored by one of the wisest men in the realm, rides against the Mad King and his evil son who has captured the young man's beloved. After harrowing fights and tragedies he slays the fearsome Young Dragon in single combat, topples the tyrant-king and is himself crowned, a new hope for the Seven Kingdoms.

A Game of Thrones starts some years later, with the young hero gone to fat and drink, with the "lovely queen" that he won despising him and the best friend who had fought so long beside him retreated back north; the two haven't spoken in years.

And then things get worse, of course.
