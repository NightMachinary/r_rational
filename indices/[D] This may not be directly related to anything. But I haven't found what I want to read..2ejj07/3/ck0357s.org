I wish for this as well-one issue though is that it is difficult to properly show what comes after 'and then I was a god'. You can sometimes find short stories about things similar to this-showing a mind going over and resurrecting other minds, improving them, but the details are usually pretty sketchy. Also, one thing is to define 'inhuman'-there is the section of mind space which is things that have human values, but are exceptionally beyond any human comprehension. The biggest issue is that writing such things is HARD. See-That Alien Message for a sort of glimpse of such a thing, and I can look around for some sort of super human intelligence stuff, but it is very limited just by the fact that it is very hard. Your desire is shared though.
