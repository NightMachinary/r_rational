If you don't mind some pony content (the story takes place in the real world and deals with a super intelligent pony AI) you would probably like [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]]. Hell, even if you don't like stuff with ponies it's still a really good read, and I think it matches pretty well with what you want.
