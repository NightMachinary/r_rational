Yes. What I'm always looking for in sci-fi/fantasy, and what I hope to find more of in this subreddit, are stories that are truly fearless in their imagination. Stories that don't shy away from interesting ideas just because they're too alien, too big or too consequential, by authors who never got the memo that good stories outside of the scope of human experience were impossible, and just went ahead and wrote them.

I think Greg Egan comes as close to that as anyone I've read. A few of the stories in Ted Chiang's /Stories of Your Life And Others/ share that same sort of creative fearlessness. Other sci-fi authors like Stanislaw Lem and Charles Stross often approach it, but never dive all the way in.

Despite a lot of searching, I'm yet to find a good fantasy author willing to write that sort of story.
