Easiest way to find what you want to read: write it. There are a couple of people just in this comments section saying they would read it.

As a point of information, John Campbell had a challenge for all of his writers: "write me aliens who think as well as humans, but not /like/ humans." Given that any such story of decent quality would have been published in the premiere magazine of the time, you can see that it's not people "shying away from" the challenge that's to blame. It's that asking a human being to convincingly write about something that thinks thoughts a human is not capable of...that's obviously impossible. The best you're going to get is a clever facade, where the thing has a strange mental process / value system / etc.
