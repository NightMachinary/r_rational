Peter F Hamilton's dreaming void series is a "sequel" of sorts to his Pandora's star series. It follows humanity well in the distant future when many have self improved to an alienlike state. It does have human characters (as well as a fantasy subplot with very human characters), but also does feature some posthumans with slightly odd goals. Its not quite what you're looking for, but it springs to mind.
