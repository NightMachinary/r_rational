  How cautiously should I take the COVID situation? Is it overblown?
#+end_quote

There are different ways of looking at 'overblown'.

Do I believe that shutting down our entire country / creating a new Great Depression / allowing a massive expansion of government power is worth the difference in the amount of lives saved between a full country lockdown vs a series of more targeted quarantines? No. I think there are several more efficient ways of handling this that won't have as many long-term ramifications. I further think that these aren't particularly hard to see but are driven by systemic bias on the part of decision makers and media (eg, everyone making decisions lives in big cities, and the risk to rural areas is minimal and doesn't merit lockdown).

But for *you* is there any value to leaving your isolated farm to rejoin society? No also. There's no society for you to rejoin. Everything's closed by law.
