  I dunno if it counts as big but I found out that the mods apparently don't moderate.

You had an extended discussion in mod mail over when, why, and how we moderate the subreddit. Posting inflammatory stuff like this is unacceptable, as is spamming it across three comments in this thread. If you do this again, I'll give you a temp ban, and if you keep doing it after that, I'll just outright ban you. If you want to have a discussion about moderation, there are better ways to do it.
