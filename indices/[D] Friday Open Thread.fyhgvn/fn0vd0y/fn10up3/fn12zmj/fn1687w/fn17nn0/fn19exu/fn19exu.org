  (As far as I recall, you did have several conversations within the chapters of Chili and the Chocolate Factory, where people widely disagreed with you.)
#+end_quote

As I told the mods was going to happen, because going to a place where people go specifically because they like something, tends to be useless for discussing why that thing is bad.

  in an unrelated question that's not about moderation
#+end_quote

It was about the general goings-on of the sub and I think moderation should be an important part of that. I think lack of moderation is an important going-on in and of itself. I don't think it's fair to characterize moderation discussion as being completely unrelated to a question about what is going on with the subreddit. Sub moderation is what shapes a subreddit, along with submitters and to some extent voters. Though what people upvote tends to be more or less samey outside of political subs.

  You could have posted what you think are particularly damning responses by the mods.
#+end_quote

I don't publicly quote private conversations without permission. I also thought the general apathy towards removing things, not posted by me and that are not porn or non-fiction, was more disagreeable than anything in particular.

#+begin_quote
  You could have said "I disagree with the moderation of this subreddit", or outlined ways in which we fail to moderate in accordance to your standards.

So [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fyhgvn/d_friday_open_thread/fn116f4/][this comment]] is fine, especially with my edit? I can just link to it in [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fyhgvn/d_friday_open_thread/fn10up3/][this comment]] if that helps clarify my position for that comment. I also deleted my other comment.
