I've been thinking about how things can be improved for [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and I think it'd be nice if stories than are not [rt] were not tagged as [rt] and were not posted here (edit: or were removed by the mods, or if mod policies were clearly laid out on the sidebar and stringently enforced in a consistent, black and white manner).
