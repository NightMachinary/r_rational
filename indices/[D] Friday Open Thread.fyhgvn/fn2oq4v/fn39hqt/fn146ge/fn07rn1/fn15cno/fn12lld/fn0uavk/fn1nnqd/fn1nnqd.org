To be honest that sounds like it would be a recipe for instant drama. There have already been too many emotionally charged disagreements about what 'counts' as rational and therefore welcome on this sub. I could easily see submembers on either side of a vote getting upset at people who vote in a way they don't like. I could also see authors getting discouraged from writing and/or less likely to interact positively with this community when voting goes negatively.
