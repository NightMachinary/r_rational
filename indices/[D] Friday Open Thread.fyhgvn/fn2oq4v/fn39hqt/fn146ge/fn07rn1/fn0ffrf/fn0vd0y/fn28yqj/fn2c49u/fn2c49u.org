Yeah, the limited available jobs increases the availability of individual workers and those workers' desperation for some kind of employment, so quitting is just as impotent of a threat as always.

Also, iirc, not many groups of employees in the US have collective strike or bargaining organizations, so there's no way for workers to negotiate greater pay in response to the exposure risk.
