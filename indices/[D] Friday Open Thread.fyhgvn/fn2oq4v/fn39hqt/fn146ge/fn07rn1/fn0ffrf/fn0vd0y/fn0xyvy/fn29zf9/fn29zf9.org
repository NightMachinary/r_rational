  How cautiously should I take the COVID situation? Is it overblown?Moving back to the farm is an easy option for me if I do it soon.

It's very serious. If you and everyone you live with are able to work from home and willing to take the quarantine seriously, then isolating in the city is safe enough. Whether that's preferable to going back to the farm is up to you.

I also expect the situation to last a very long time in the US, and any other country relying on social distancing to manage the pandemic. Until the government is able to implement case-tracking (very skeptical the US can do this) or a vaccine is developed (could be a year), the disease will pop back as soon as social distancing is relaxed.
