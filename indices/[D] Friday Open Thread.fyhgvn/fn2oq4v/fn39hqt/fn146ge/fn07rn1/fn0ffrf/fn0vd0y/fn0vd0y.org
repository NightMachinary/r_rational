I spent the last eighteen months living on a farm with extended family, intentionally restricting my media and news intake. I had internet access but only went online twice to make sure no one had stolen my identity. I picked a terrible time to rejoin society, but it was a good experience.

What has [[/r/rational]] been up to? I only lurked but it feels slower than I remember. Are there any good new stories/fanfiction/books this community made/recommends that you can sell me on? Humor, romance, and fantasy preferred. I want to laugh.

Any big happenings specific to this community?

How cautiously should I take the COVID situation? Is it overblown?Moving back to the farm is an easy option for me if I do it soon.
