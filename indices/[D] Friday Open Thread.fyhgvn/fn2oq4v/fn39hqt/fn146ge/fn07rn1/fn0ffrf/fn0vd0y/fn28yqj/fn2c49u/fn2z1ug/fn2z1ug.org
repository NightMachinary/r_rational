I would argue no, using analogy with gasoline consumption. As gas prices go up, consumption of gas does not significant decrease. As much as people grumble, they still need to get to/from work. Over the short term, demand for gas is very inelastic. Over the long term, though, people adjust their decisions to recover gas usage. This may be by buying a more fuel-efficient vehicle, by moving closer to work for a shorter commute, or by pushing for expanded public transportation. Over the long term, demand for gas goes down, even though it didn't in the short term.

Applying this same logic to essential jobs, in the short term, it is very difficult to quit when living paycheck to paycheck. Rent still needs to be paid, and food needs to be purchased. In the short term, supply of essential workers does not dry up with drastically changed working conditions. Over the long term, though, people will preferentially avoid taking essential jobs, driving up the wages required to compensate.

Also, this is all with the caveat that economic predictions are based on the assumption that people are inherently rational, and that the market is always at equilibrium. Neither of these are particularly good assumptions at modeling groups of humans.
