Price in a market is a function of supply and demand.

People don't want to go into work because of the virus, so supply has gone down. You would expect a wage increase from this.

However, jobs don't want as many workers, so demand has gone down. You would expect a wage decrease from this.

Demand has gone down a /lot/ more than supply has, so we're lucky we've seen wages stay the same.
