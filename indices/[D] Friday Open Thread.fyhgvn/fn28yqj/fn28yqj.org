Not trying to be pessimistic or anything but this economic/labor question has been bothering me for a while:

Doesn't the prevalence of essential employees working for the same pay during a pandemic mean they were "over paid" before? If we are willing to keep working jobs at higher risk, due to the pandemic, for no increase in personal benefit doesn't that indicate we are willing to take worse cost/benefit jobs in general?

I'm not advocating that anyone quit, especially if your work saves lives, but from an economic view raising the job risk significantly without increasing compensation would be expected to encourage people to quit their jobs. Or is it just that the loss of other jobs raised the value of any current jobs enough to compensate? In the USA this could be explained by people needing job's medical insurance, but I'm not hearing about this in other countries either.
