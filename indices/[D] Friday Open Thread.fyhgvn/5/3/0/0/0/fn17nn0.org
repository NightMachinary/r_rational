  Also, how can I have communicated my point without it being interpreted as inflammatory?

You could have said "I disagree with the moderation of this subreddit", or outlined ways in which we fail to moderate in accordance to your standards. You could have posted what you think are particularly damning responses by the mods. Here's a portion of the discussion, quoted:

#+begin_quote
  How is chili and the chocolate factory rational, rationalist, rational-adjacent or anywhere near any universe where rationality is at least on the cusp of existence?

  #+begin_quote
    We generally don't remove things for being "not rational enough", so long as they're clearly fiction. If it were getting downvoted to the negatives, maybe we would remove it, but it's one of the more upvoted works on the sub. I personally wouldn't consider it to be rational fiction, even if it's written by an author who has a grasp on the concept, but again, "rational enough" doesn't tend to be something that we police -- if the sub is failing to discriminate on this specific work, I think that's probably okay, or there are reasons that it has appeal to the general audience.

    #+begin_quote
      So any fiction of any kind written anywhere can be posted to this sub, so long as it's clearly fiction? Are there post frequency limits? Am I allowed to start hitting up this sub with daily chapters of Agatha Christie and other public domain books and if not, how are those stories different from what's being done here?

      Do you think that doing that would add value to the community or result in highly upvoted posts? Actually, to just answer the question outright: no, you're not allowed, because it would be taken as a protest action that I don't have the time or patience for. You would get an immediate, permanent ban.

      #+begin_quote
        If your question is "what does [[/r/rational]] see in Chili and the Chocolate Factory", then I think that I might be able to answer that:

        - Examination/extrapolation of an implied Dahlian expanded universe.
        - Reference/understand/parody of well-known rationalist ideas/trope e.g. AI box, CISPR
        - People searching for answers to puzzles
        - Metatext
        - Eccentricity and absurdity The fact remains that it's highly upvoted, and the bar for removing highly upvoted things is very high, as is the bar for removing things that mods consider to fail the "rational" aspect of "rational fiction". I don't plan to take any mod action on it.

        If you really hate it and/or think that it doesn't belong, downvote it and move on, or leave a comment on how you think it's not a good fit for this sub (ideally with some charity toward the people who clearly do think that it belongs).

Your characterization of this stance, in an unrelated question that's not about moderation, is "the mods do not moderate". It shows no charity toward our position, nor is it clear. It exists only to slam the mods and/or get people riled.

(As far as I recall, you /did/ have several conversations within the chapters of Chili and the Chocolate Factory, where people widely disagreed with you.)
