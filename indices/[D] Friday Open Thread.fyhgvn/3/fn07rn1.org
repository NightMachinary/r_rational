I've been thinking about how things can be improved for [[/r/rational][r/rational]], and I have an idea that I'm not sure is a good idea or not.

I know that it's possible to write an autobot that can automatically post an update link to reddit for when a story is updated. But we don't do that. Instead we leave it up to the people who frequent this subreddit to manually do it themselves.

Would people prefer to leave it up to the whims of chance that certain stories get update notifications here, or to switch to automatic notifications and lose out on the karma points?

Note that I have no plans yet to actually code up an autobot for this unless a lot of people here mention a desire for it. In which case, I'll post a top-level post for further discussion first.
