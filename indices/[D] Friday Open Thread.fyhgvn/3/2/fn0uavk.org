I'm for it, especially if it's built in such a way that the community can use it organically, e.g. it'll post a comment like the following on all its posts, or as a reply when summoned to a post's comments for the first time:

#+begin_quote
  #+begin_example
    Thank you for using <autoposterbot>.
    Upvote this comment if this story should be automatically posted to this subreddit. 
    Downvote this comment if this story should not be automatically posted to this subreddit.
  #+end_example
#+end_quote

With some reasonable thresholds for enabling/disabling (has to be more than 50 upvotes to start autoposting if it's not currently being autoposted, has to be more than 50 downvotes to stop if it's currently being autoposted (numbers for example only.))

The mods should have override access; that'll prevent gaming the system with vote manipulation (this is already what's in place to prevent spammers from taking over the subreddit, so I don't see that as a step down.)
