Sell magic as something else, something a bit more explainable. If magic users are limited to a strict subset in public, aka /superpowers/ like super-heroes from comics might have, it could be more widely accepted. A watered-down substitute might be more palatable and misdirect attention from how any of the powers actually worked.

You could even /teach magic/ to dupes if you sold it as a method of gaining a strict subset of powers. This way you would create a two-tier system, a set of strictly controlled magic users who do not understand the art and can not safely study further, and the teachers who understand magic and only teach enough to give partial access.
