If you disclose the portal, you'd lose your ability to exploit it. And, you'd probably end up in a ton of social and legal trouble.

Suppose magic allows scrying. The portal-monopoly sets up a law firm. They could scry on their opponent's strategy meetings. That gives them a huge advantage. And gets them instantly arrested if magic goes public.

Or, magic creates longevity potions. That's great if you're in on the conspiracy. But it makes you look like a monster if it comes out that you kept them secret.

Or, gold is just more common over on the magic side of the portal. Everyone gets rich. But they'll face some really hard questions when the IRS learns that they haven't been paying tariffs.
