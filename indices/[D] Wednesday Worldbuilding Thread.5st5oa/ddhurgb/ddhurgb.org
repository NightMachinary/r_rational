How do you plausibly deal with conspiracy. I say this because [[/r/rational]] seems to hate any form of secret society, I think justifiably, but we have to acknowledge that there have been massive conspiracies in the past, and probably are some right now.

More concretely, what are some motives for keeping a portal to to stereotypical swords and wizards a secret. Are there any good enough to actually keep it secret once it's known of and being exploited?
