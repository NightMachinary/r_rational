    The last thing you need for position within an unevenly rotating volume is radius, or position outward from the center. This could be absolute, or it could be strictly within the plane of the ecliptic.

  I don't understand the problem here; we're only talking on a single galaxy's scale, so why would the absolute distance matter?

I'm probably using "absolute" wrong there. Basically I'm differentiating between magnitude of the vector from the center to the target, and magnitude of the vector from the center to the target's projection in the ecliptic. Which of those to use has to be standardized, even if which star to use as the reference isn't.
