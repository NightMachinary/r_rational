Take the elliptic plane of the galaxy. Draw a straight line to earth from the galaxy's center (Sagittarius A*), projecting the line onto the plane. Define wherever earth is to be "above" the galactic plane, giving up and down directions. Then simply describe directions with cylindrical coordinates. Spin-wise of earth is positive angles, and light years works for distance from the center and distance from the elliptical plane.

So a specific location might be "32 degrees from the sun, 40 thousand lighyears out, 450 lightyears down."

Other species would of course use their own favored star (assuming standardization on that point would be impossible), but by following the same conventions, the same locations could be derived.

There is a problem with this-- namely, that planets tend to circle the galaxy at different speeds, but that can be solved by giving a timestamp.

  The last thing you need for position within an unevenly rotating volume is radius, or position outward from the center. This could be absolute, or it could be strictly within the plane of the ecliptic.

I don't understand the problem here; we're only talking on a single galaxy's scale, so why would the absolute distance matter?
