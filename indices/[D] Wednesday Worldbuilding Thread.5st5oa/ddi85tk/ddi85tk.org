What's a sane alternative to the "galactic northwest" nonsense common to interstellar-scale scifi? Galaxies don't /have/ a north unless you arbitrarily declare "from the center towards this star" as "north".

I suppose one could start by breaking down what exactly cardinal directions /are/, underneath the labels we use:

- Spinward
- Counter-spinward
- Towards one pole (the one on your left when you face spinward)
- Towards the other pole (the one on your right when you face spinward)

Galaxies retain spinward and counter-spinward, but towards the poles doesn't work as well due to movement being relative to the /interior/ of the volume, rather than its surface (as is the case with a planet). Towards the poles can certainly be meaningful, but to use "north" and "south" brings implications that aren't helpful. Towards the poles, relative to the interior of a galaxy, winds up referring to up/down relative to the galactic ecliptic plane.

The last thing you need for position within an unevenly rotating volume is radius, or position outward from the center. This could be absolute, or it could be strictly within the plane of the ecliptic.

This seems to make more sense for defining the position, but it's a clunky way to talk about it. Anyone have better ideas?
