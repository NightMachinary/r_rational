  More concretely, what are some motives for keeping a portal to to stereotypical swords and wizards a secret. Are there any good enough to actually keep it secret once it's known of and being exploited?

Here are a few good/neutral motivations:

- There might be other portals, and you want to find them
- Government instability on either side of the portal
- Still in the process of making diplomatic contact between polities on each side of the portal.

Some self-interested, but not necessarily "evil" reasons:

- You want the land rights to both sides of the portal, recognized by polities on each side.
- You've gained a reputation on either (or both) sides of the portal, and to maximally exploit said reputation requires a degree of mystery to your origins/the origins of your power. Ex. as a famous engineer on the S/S side of the portal, or as a stage magician on the earth side of the portal.)

These are all rather temporary reasons, though.
