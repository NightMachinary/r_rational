For sure, I guess the problem is how to keep a small group, say between 15 and 200 people on board with it. You somehow have to make that advantage extend to all of them and make sure no-one spills the beans for a long amount of time.

To-be honest I think something [[/r/rational]] tends to overestimate is the ease with which people would accept it. Flat earth atheists don't make sense, but neither do very convincing illusion of round earth flat earthers.
