Think about it this way. The CIA with all of its espionage over the years, still has exploits that are kept 100% secret despite, say, a hundred or so people in their chain of command knowing about their activities, from the delivery pilots, middle managers, the teams themselves on the ground, and whatnot. Keeping something secret isn't a huge deal for these organizations.

The trick they have is the extreme vetting the people go through before they're even given an interview with the organization.
