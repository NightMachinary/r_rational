Find some good books and\or online cources on the history of morality and ethics and study them.

Also: 1) Download a bunch of [[https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=questions+to+ask][{list of questions to ask your partner before developing a more serous relationship}]] books → 2) sift through the questions to pick those that pertain to beliefs and opinions (filtering out questions about stuff like childhood memories and the like) → 3) organise the remaining questions by categories → 4) answer them yourself → 5) ??? → 6) Profit!

Also: same as above, only with political spectrum questionnaires.

Also: 1) read books \ fanfics in which the protag is an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero][anti-hero]] and\or a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist][villain]]; as well as biographies of various historical figure and people in general → 2) note down all of the protag's decisions throughout the story that you a) wouldn't have made yourself 2) would've been mildly opposed to making 3) would've been strongly opposed to making → 3) analyse the reasons behind the protag's decisions and behind your distaste \ reluctance towards them → 4) scrutinise those reasons \ principles \ decisions to see how accurate they are, etc. → 5) think of some additional ways for making sure that your reasoning in steps #3 and #4 were as accurate as possible → 6A) change your principles --- or --- 6B) don't, if you find the results of a bare-logic approach too soul-crushing \ repulsive (this would also be an indicator that you've missed some things in steps #3-#5).

P.s. Share what you've manage to find here afterwards, because others will likely be interested in checking the same source materials too.
