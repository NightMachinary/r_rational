just watched a short video online of a talk given last year by an old colleague/friend and thought it might be of interest to some here -- [[https://youtu.be/yakg94HyWdE][Bayesian Statistics without Frequentist Language]]. As stated at the start it is /quite/ non-technical, but I still think might be a little hard to get through if you don't have at minimum a very basic understanding of Bayesian inference in the context of regression models (and if you're moderately familiar IDK that you'd get too much out of the talk). Not sure how on board I am with the closing "modest proposal" either, but I guess someone needs to be among the first to move against the tide of linguistic inertia? (and he of course mentions the obvious caveats, e.g. you can still obtain point estimates from the joint posterior given some loss function)
