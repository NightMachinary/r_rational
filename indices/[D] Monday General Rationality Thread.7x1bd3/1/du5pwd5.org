So my PI recently nominated me for some interdepartmental fellowship (that comes with a decent $ sum and a nice feather for my cv), and one of its requirements is that I run a multi-day workshop on a topic of my choice that would benefit those on an academic career track. A few friends have gotten this award before, and it seems for me and mine the easy way out is to do an "introduction to scientific computing/statistical inference/git/R/python" type of bootcamp thing. But that seems kinda boring and IDK that I'd personally get a ton out of it.

Instead, I think I'd like to host a workshop on a subject I've been meaning to delve into for a while now, that of *designing effective slideshow presentations*. For better or worse, keynote/powerpoint/prezi/etc. feature /very/ heavily in lectures and presentations in academia, and I'd reckon in many sections of industry too. And when I've taught classes or given talks in the past I've often relied on it extensively (there'll be lab components/demonstrations that take up maybe a quarter of class time, and discussions of papers and stuff that take up another quarter, but maybe half the time it's me walking around up front using slides as visual aids and trying to stimulate discussion). While I like to think I have a good eye for design and for the visual presentation of data etc., I've never actually had any formal schooling in the matter and mostly just made slides off of intuition. I've also sat through a ton of talks from ugrads, grad students, and professors featuring absolutely dreadful slides. Presumably they intuited their way to those slides too (or just dgaf).

So *what sorts of principles of design actually maximize learning outcomes, information retention, student enjoyment, teaching effectiveness*, etc. etc. especially according to the empirical literature? What practices are demonstrably superior? (and what's good for the goose may not for the gander if there are between-student, between-department, between-culture, between-sex, etc. differences). Some quick googling gives me lots of papers [e.g. [[http://www.ijikm.org/Volume6/IJIKMv6p085-094Brock545.pdf][1]], [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187712971530006X][2]], [[http://www.academicradiology.org/article/S1076-6332(17)30189-7/abstract][3]], [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-016-9381-8][4]], [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131515300695][5]], [[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01138/full][6]], [[http://www.ijikm.org/Volume6/IJIKMv6p085-094Brock545.pdf][7]]...] and general style guides [e.g. [[https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/making-better-powerpoint-presentations/#resources][1]], [[http://www.uq.edu.au/teach/resources/beyond-bullets-web.pdf][2]]], and there are ofc broader works relating to information design and data visualization, like Tufte's books, but having not done any more than a cursory overview of this field I was wondering if any here could lend their guidance and expertise.

edit: whoops, awkward title, but y'all get the gist
