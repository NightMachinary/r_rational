I'm expecting the Saint to betray the group, since she wants Procer destroyed. Killing the Dead King would prevent that from occuring. It could be easily justified, since in her eyes Pilgrim and Sorcerer are both being deceived by a villain. It doesn't have to be an offer taken, maybe just a seed of doubt planted. Like the Dead King saying that of all the group, she'd be impossible to sway, and not making an offer at all.
