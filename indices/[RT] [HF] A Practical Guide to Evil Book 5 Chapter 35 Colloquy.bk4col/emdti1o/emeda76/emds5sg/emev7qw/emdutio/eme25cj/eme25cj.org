You say it is "clogging up the subreddit" but the reality is there are barely any posts on this subreddit and that's why you see so many PGtE posts on the subreddit, because its one of the only stories that regularly updates. If we truly had a ton of rational stories regularly being updated and amazing dicussions and they were being hidden by PGtE I would agree it could go in favor of more on topic content. But the reality is I can go to this subreddit and still find posts from a week ago on the first page. We don't lose anything by having rational-adjacent stories like PGtE posted. There is clearly a demand and a want to discuss PGtE because it ends up highly commented and upvoted relative to average story post.
