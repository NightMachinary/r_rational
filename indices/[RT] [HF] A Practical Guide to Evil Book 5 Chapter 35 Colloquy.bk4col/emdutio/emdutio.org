Does /every/ chapter of this really need to be posted here? I know folks on this sub love it but four of the posts on the front page at time of posting were PGtE chapters.

Disclaimer: I don't like the work and I don't think it belongs in this genre. That's a separate issue from it clogging up the subreddit though.
