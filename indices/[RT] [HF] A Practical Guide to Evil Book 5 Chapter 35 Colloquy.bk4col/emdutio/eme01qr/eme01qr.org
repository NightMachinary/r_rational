I think it's partly down to the Guide being the most regularly and frequently updated story in or around the genre. AFAICT, [[/u/Zayits][u/Zayits]] isn't an alt for [[/u/erraticerrata][u/erraticerrata]], so they're not violating the rule against posting your /own/ work more than weekly. That said, that rule as written has the obvious loophole of an author simply getting someone else to post it and the Guide is clearly the work that runs closest to violating the spirit of the rule.

As to whether it belongs here, I think it solidly ticks a few boxes regarding the intelligence of characters, reflection on goals and motives, goal oriented behavior. On the other hand, no one explicitly aspires to be rational, and the Guide universe explicitly runs on different rules than ours, with narrative tropes having actual, causal weight behind them. It means the major intellectual payoffs in the story come from the characters engaging in competitive storycrafting which is of.... limited import to our world, so even if the characters can be judged to be operating rationally for their world, it still ends up portraying heroes and villains doing their best to /seem/ heroic/villainous which is arguably the primary anti-meme of rational fiction.

Overall, I also edge toward saying that the Guide probably doesn't belong here anymore and hasn't since at least when Cat mantled Winter, but it did more solidly belong here in its early days and has established itself as popular with the community, and is kinda, maybe winding down and closer to the end than the beginning or middle, so...
