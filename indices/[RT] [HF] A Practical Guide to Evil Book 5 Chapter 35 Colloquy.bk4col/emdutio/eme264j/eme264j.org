I like the story myself so I might have some bias, but I like that the MC *tries* to be rational and think ahead. I like the subversion of tropes that at the same time use them at will.

Wasn't the discussion had somewhat recently about "what is rational "? I seem to recall the sidebar being updated?

EDIT: I'd certainly say it ticks at least one or more of the sidebar examples/criteria. If you disagree with the definition then as you say, that is a separate discussion. Given its popularity here you may find yourself in the minority however.
