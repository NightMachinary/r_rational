    “Your right. I shouldn't have brought it up. Anything else I can help with?” I ignored his grammatical mistake, as usual, gave my goodbyes, and closed the session.

I get that old arguments have a habit of reoccurring...but in my experience, old arguments have a habit of falling into two traps: they become toxic and are mostly avoided or can cause big rancor; or, they are brought up enough that they're more about teasing than a serious argument. This argument doesn't seem to have fallen into either end game, and so, in my eyes, it feels a little inauthentic. Not sure if that makes sense...hard to express but this exchange felt a tiny bit off here.

    “You seemed upset from the moment you saw Kurt and Laila tonight. Did they say or do something... um... problematic?”
  #+end_quote

LOL. Does May think Laila said something racist? Confused by use of problematic...I haven't heard too many people use that....when a friend recounts something like that they generally say something like "did they say something fucked up?" or "oh man did they say something weird?" and with close friends there's a sense in which you're kind of laughing at the person who said the bad comment as opposed to just trying to comfort the person you're talking to. Maybe its just my type of friends but when scenarios like this occurred [someone said something mean/racist/sexist/] its about 50% more humor directed at the person who did something wrong and less outright comfort. Its more about making fun of the person who said something wrong than comforting someone...unless the person in question is really sensitive to slights, which is pretty rare, IME, even with people I'd think would be pretty sensitive to that.
