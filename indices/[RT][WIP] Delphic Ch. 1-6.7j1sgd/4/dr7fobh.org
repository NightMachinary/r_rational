    Bill Kurtzwile held court in his plush leather seat. He was easily the largest man in the room, both in height and girth, a powerful white man with less than half a head of white hair and the hard vitality of a man half his age. He gestured with a bottle of beer to the three other men taking up the other seats in the half-sequestered area, each man facing the muted TV from which cable news had evidently triggered the conversation.

3 use of half here-- a bit much

lots of tell not show descriptions from the narrator but I'm unsure if that's on purpose (?) to give readers a sense that the narrator is a very methodical/machiavellian thinker. Regardless, it's a bit much. Maybe tone that down like 10%.

More feedback:

I get that you're trying to sell the narrator as very 'in his head'-- but there are still more 'show not tell' ways to do so.

    In truth, I shared a lot of Bill's concerns, but it appeared my opinion wasn't really being sought. The Bills could easily argue between them until dinner was served.

You could have a little more dialogue here, show the narrator trying to interject, not being all that good at it, then sitting back and observing, which communicates the same type of personality....but in a less 'tell' kind of way.

    I have very little experience trying to actively hide this level of nervousness.

    It had been about three months since SoCAST had asked for my help with a mission, but Polarity was definitely part of the core team at that time -- which is how I came to have seen and heard enough of her to immediately recognize her tonight. Fortunately, she would not have seen or heard me.

Kind of cumbersome. I think you can trim this down a bit and make it less unwieldy.

    Last I checked, she was a card-carrying member of California Combined Super Team (typically spelled and pronounced “CAST”), a standing combat asset for the LA branch (“SoCAST”) with more than occasional assignments to the San Francisco branch (“NorCAST”). A moderately powerful ferrokinetic, she had detailed control over metals in her immediate vicinity, down to the molecular level. Polarity typically wore a half-ton suit of platinum, iron, and carbon, which she crystallized into some sort of strong but highly ductile steel.

If this is supposed to represent inner dialogue, not sure it makes sense to have explanations for abbreviations. Maybe just something like:

    Last I checked, she was a card-carrying member of California's state steam, CAST, and a standing combat asset for LA's SoCAST and San Francisco's NorCAST as well.

Liking first chapter so far, I'll give more feedback when I can.
