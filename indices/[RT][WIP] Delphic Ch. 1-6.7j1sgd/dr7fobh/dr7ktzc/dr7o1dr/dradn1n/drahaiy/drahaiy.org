If you think it'll kill your momentum, I'd keep moving forward but if you think you can edit and write new chapter simultaneously, I'd say go for the edits.

At least for me, I prefer to keep pushing forward with a story when the creative juices are flowing. Just try to keep the stylistic feedback in mind when writing new stuff.

Good luck!
