    I had sight but no sound. Whatever conversation was bouncing between the three men in the car, I had no way of eavesdropping.

Is here currently trying to learn lip reading? If not, why not? Seems extremely useful even if he can't pick it up perfectly...

    Robert F. Kennedy International Airport, named after the second President of the illustrious Kennedy dynasty that had so slickly dominated politics since the 60s, was nestled along the D.C. Beltway and a short of clogged ride from downtown.

I like this bit of worldbuilding, but you don't have to point out he was the 2nd president. Just leave that airport name there, let readers notice it or not then slowly drop more hints about divergence from our world. That's my preference, at least.

Overall some comments: you write well but you're erring on the side of overexplaining stuff. Try pushing more towards less description, letting stuff be implied rather than explained fully by the narrator. Your dialogue could also use a little more spice-- I'm not saying you need a totally natural sounding dialogue, which is annoying to read + hard to do, but a little more authenticity in dialogue would be good. Some of the turns of phrases you use are a bit too flowery but it seems like that gets reduced over time (it was more glaring in CH1 than later on) and you have some nice phrases in there too so that's not a big issue.

Overall, enjoying this serial quite a bit. Looking forward to more :)

    My only sartorial nod to the weather was a light windbreaker; my car's heater blasted chill air that warmed incrementally as I dodged through traffic.

    The really nice areas have little such mixing, nor do the truly poor ones -- if for no other reason than the money skews heavily towards one race and away from the other.

The latter part of the sentence is kinda unnecessary. Known by most readers, implied by the "The really nice areas have little such mixing, nor do the truly poor ones ". I think this is another example of over-describing...the mental narrative has a little too much going on, if that makes any sense.

    As always, it felt like hugging a warm, cloth-covered statue. Her flesh had absolutely zero give; none of the feminine softness we all take for granted when in contact with our distaff friends and relations. Still, my daily encounter with the sensation had accustomed me to it, and it now had the comfort of long familiarity and association with my only sister and best friend. I lingered as long as she wanted; I would not cut short one of the only times in the day that Paris would deliberately touch another human.

A lot of description for hugging his sister...over-description again. Again you're characterizing by telling not showing us their close relationship. Try to let actions speak more than words-- don't tell us they're close, just show it.

    he couldn't hug, shake hands, accept an arm around the shoulder -- any of the above would feel weird to the other person and raise unanswerable question. Romantic contact was similarly right out -- lovemaking would result in serious injuries for her partner, and even a passionate kiss would cause severe bruising.

And it's a bit weird for a brother to so explicitly think through the consequences of his sister's powers...I'd let him just imply those romantic consequences. Most siblings try not to think of their siblings in sexual/romantic situations. They joke about it to tease each other but it generally has an air of awkwardness about it.

    First they get on me because they assume I'm not good enough -- quotas or some shit -- then they get on me because I'm too good. Making waves, disrupting the system, whatever fucking excuse.” She pushed herself half up from her seat and looked me in the eyes. “They just... they don't want me to succeed, Hector. They don't.”

From what I knew of my sister, anger was a better reaction than grief to these frustrations. I kept my own tears of sympathy under control, and nodded. “You don't look like a detective, sis. You're not male enough or white enough to be good at it -- it messes with their view of the world.” I drained my juice. “Fuck them. We'll keep this up, and we'll keep our eyes open for harassment or sabotage. They can't do anything to you for being too good, and they know it.”

Tears of sympathy on his part seems a bit much. And while I don't really mind tons of political overtones in a fic, you're def gonna alienate some readers by having discrimination as such a central theme, IMO. So keep that in mind.

The whole sister encounter just comes across as kind of short too...they met for coffee and talked for maybe 5 minutes?
