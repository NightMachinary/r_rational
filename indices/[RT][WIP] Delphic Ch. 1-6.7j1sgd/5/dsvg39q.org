I'm enjoying this so far, just started when I saw the chapter posted yesterday, and definitely want more; my first impression though is that the character's behavior is quite flawed and vulnerable from a rationalist perspective. There's nothing wrong with this, a flawed protagonist is fine; I just anticipate his frequent missteps to be punished.

First, the moment he suspected the coincidence of the other super's move to his neighborhood, a rational response from an intelligent actor would be to investigate her recent past. He should be PANICKED that the government is on to him. He is obviously an enormously valuable asset and is playing cat and mouse with powerful agencies like the FBI and CIA - lying to them and leading them on with hints of omniscience while not fully cooperating.

It's a given they would be after him if they suspected he was a real person, his power is simply to dangerous to be left in the wild. He should know this, and should immediately check on the motives behind the new super's move in case she's part of a plot to entrap him.

secondly, working for his sister seems extremely dangerous for the same reasons. if a certain otherwise ordinary police district begins solving unsolvable cases, it will get notice. The influence of a super would be suspected, and both Hector and his sister would likely be exposed.

That this hasn't happened yet is surprising. If it doesn't happen pretty quickly in the story, it starts becoming unbelievable and drifts out of rational fic, in my mind.
