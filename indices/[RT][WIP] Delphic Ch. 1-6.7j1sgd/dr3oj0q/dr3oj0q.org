Read the first four chapters.

I found the language overly poetic at first, but eventually it settles in nicely.

Things are a bit disjointed, but in the way that comes pretty naturally from telling a story from the perspective of a well-developed character that's under no obligation to explain everything to the reader.

Has echos of Worm in its setting, but I find Hector's power and the setup he's arranged with the authorities pretty interesting. Kind of like Sherlock Holmes without the massive personality disorder. He seems kind of paranoid, but I suppose we'll find out why that's justified later.

Good enough for me to keep reading.
