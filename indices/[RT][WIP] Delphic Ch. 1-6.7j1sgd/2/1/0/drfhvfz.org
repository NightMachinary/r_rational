I too found this a bit unplausible to cover up - shaking hands, hand to hand combat training, a steadying hand on the shoulder during initial gun training, medical exams, the tactile parts of on-scene police work (stacking up before door entry, etc), subduing suspects, hoisting someone over a fence, and so on.
