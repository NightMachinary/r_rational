  You almost lost me at "The mottled pattern of sunlight through the trees shifted rapidly across the bare earth."

what's wrong with descriptive writing? it's describing the phenomena accurately - he's rapidly rewinding time and the sunlight is changing patterns on the ground. it's a perfectly good visual introduction to the protagonist's power.

I agree with the suspension of disbelief though. I don't see how they are not both outed by now.
