Good story so far. FtP had, id my opinion, a much better resolution than HPMOR (not perfect, but oh so much better), and this seems like a faithful continuation, dealing with greater consequences of the two worlds coming together, instead of focusing on vanquishing one partly sympathetic sociopath.

This chapter is a bit too timeskippy, I'd say, but I assume that this is just the author getting away from this "eleven year olds acting like adults" silliness, and it'll be more 'conventional' later.

I'll trust the author to make Ron something more than the useless fool from canon, so I'll withhold my judgment of this ship carried over from there, until we see more of how it looks like here.

P.S. There's two minor consistency errors I've noticed:

- As far as I know, in FtP Harry didn't see Riddle drink unicorn blood, this happened after the departure point in HPMOR.
- Joel calls Peri 'it' in his thoughts, while Hermione was pretty upset when Pat did this to Xeri. Maybe not all phoenix's companions personify them in the same way, but maybe it's an oversight.\\

Edit: Oh, and of course

Roll credits! Only don't, may this story be long and full of awesome!
