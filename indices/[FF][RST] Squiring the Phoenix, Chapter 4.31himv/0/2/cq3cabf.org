  Hermoine and Ron? Really? I mean, it worked in canon, but the characters are quite different here.

Yeah, I had a bit of a "Wtf?" moment with this as well.

I mean, unless Ron brained up during the timeskips and became a person rather then a caricature, I see no particular reason for him to even exist, let alone for Hermione to be aware of him.

He was a competent strategist during the whole armies arc, but after that he dropped off of the radar and never reappeared, so where has he come from here?
