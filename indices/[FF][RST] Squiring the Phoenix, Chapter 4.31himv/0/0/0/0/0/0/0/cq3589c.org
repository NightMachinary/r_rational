Experimenting with transfiguring gold is also a war-crime against all Goblinkind, apparently. Chapter 15 of MoR:

#+begin_quote
  "You will never Transfigure anything that looks like money, including Muggle money," said Professor McGonagall. "The goblins have ways of finding out who did it. As a matter of recognised law, the goblin nation is in a permanent state of war with all magical counterfeiters. They will not send Aurors. They will send an army."

Which I suppose explains why they would use gold as a currency at all. There must be some reason - if anyone could just make more of it, it obviously wouldn't be worth anything.

But yes, I'm mostly just nitpicking.
