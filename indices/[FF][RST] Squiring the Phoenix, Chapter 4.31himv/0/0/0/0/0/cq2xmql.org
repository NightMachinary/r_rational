From MoR Chapter 4:

#+begin_quote
  Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe?
#+end_quote

So each one weighs about 5 grams. Lower my above estimate to only 3.3 times all the gold in the world (500,000,000 kg).

I'm also pretty sure he autothieves under or around 100 galleons, which would only weigh 1.1 lbs.

Edit: Yes, it was 30 Galleons. Chapter 5:

#+begin_quote
  Harry guessed he'd managed to steal maybe thirty Galleons from himself.
