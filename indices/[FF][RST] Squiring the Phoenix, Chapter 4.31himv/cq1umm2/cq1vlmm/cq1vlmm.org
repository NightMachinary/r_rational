I did that /exactly/ in the hope that someone would have this reaction. :> Are you an "Everything Wrong With..." fan as well?

Bah. I'm having a lot of trouble keeping the three separate levels of source straight. (FtP, HPMOR, HP). Thanks for pointing this out.

Well, I can pull out the "saw it" line and just have it be another thing that Harry learned via the Stone.

  too timeskippy, hope it will be long

I hate to disappoint, but it won't. I view this as an epilogue to FtP, not a separate story in its own right--shoot, I've been having trouble keeping the source material straight over four chapters! I'm not doing another 2YE-style epic under these conditions.

Finally, the reason I'm timeskipping is to show the changes to society instead of just a heroic narrative. That's the part I'm interested in -- how the larger world is affected by magic, not what Harry and Hermione are up to.
