10^{11} * (5 * 10^{1)} = 5 * 10^{12} , which is 5 trillion pounds, or am I missing something? That's like two times US National Debt at the time (at the time exchange was almost two dollars per pound). /Countries/, over the years, if they made a massive effort, maybe they could have paid it (especially if they'd disbanded their militaries).

And I think 10^{11} galleons is within an order of magnitude from 'all the galleons in the word'. Making a generous assumption that there's 1 wizard per 1,000 Muggles on average (canon seems to suggest a rather smaller number), rounding that to 10,000,000 (ten million) wizards in the world, making further generous assumption that there's 100,000 galleons of money supply per wizard in the economy, it gives 10^{7} * 10^{5} = 10^{12.} So with this assumption 100 billion galleons is about one tenth of all the money in the wizarding world.
