In that case, I would definitely have my "weird intuitions" verified. Symbols do not cause headaches normally, and I do a lot of reading. The most important things to get are basic survival supplies and reading materials. I would immediately check the internet for information on such supplies. (See other comments for the type of materials.) I would want everything to be either immediate use materials that I can carry or long term materials that I can store on the other side. The reading materials should be on some small electronic device that can be recharged through solar power or manpower. I would suggest a more rugged version of the device if possible and two recharge methods. The information itself is more valuable than anything else. To survival supplies, I will add that a large knife, a proper backpack (for survival) and basic food supplies would all be important.

The thing that would strike my interest immediately is the pillars. Perhaps they cause headaches, but I would want a record of all of the strange markings on all of the pillars. In a world with magic I would definitely pursue the magic. (Plus, I like mysteries. No, the headache would not stop me from investigating.) I would probably record the pillars through a video camera or mobile device.

The problem with this scenario is that I am not anywhere close to being fit. I find physical exercise to be boring for the most part. So I doubt that hunting for food would be easy. I would intend to find civilization immediately so that I could survive on the food I already have.

I would leave behind a record of my intuitions, a copy of the video record of the pillars and a note about what I did and why. This would be left behind with a friend of mine. At the scene of the portal, I would leave behind a video of the portal itself (if possible, the friend would tape it for me).
