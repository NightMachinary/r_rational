I go to the coordinates. If I find the headachy pillars, I call up the Randi million dollar foundation thing, send them a few thousand bucks so they take me seriously (travel costs etc.) and get them here ASAP. With any luck, within 12 hours I have the media, the government and the world's eye on site and its brains thinking on how to address the issue.

Y'all are doing it way too Gryffindor.
