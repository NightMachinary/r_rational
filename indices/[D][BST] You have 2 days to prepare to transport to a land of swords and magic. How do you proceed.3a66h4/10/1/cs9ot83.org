You travel to the site, and find an old warehouse, with an unlocked roll up for large enough for a semi to drive through. Inside, you see four pillars in the corner of the room, forming a roughly 40' square, and the entire center of the room it's inscribed with strange markings that give you a mild headache if you look at them for too long.

You see no other indication of other human presence in the location, and it is far enough removed from residential areas that you do not expect that anyone would notice if you simply set up camp in the parking lot outside the building.
