First, I set multiple alarms for 4:00, 5:30, and 5:40 on that day (setting my deadline to be at the portal at 6:00), though I'll probably be jittery enough that just the 4:00 one will suffice. Knowing me, I won't be able to get any sleep Saturday night, even though it isn't very good to be tired when going into unfamiliar territory.

Then I find out whether I'm allowed to camp at the site of the portal. If so, then I do that. If not, then I don't want to risk the police evicting me from the area.

Without knowing anything more about the land I'll be transported to, I don't know what I need to take with me, so I'll default to taking everything that I'd take on a backpacking trip (perhaps a bit heavier than usual on the medical supplies), plus books and guns. Books are good because they are a cheap way of carrying a lot of intellectual value that may or may not already exist on the other side, but with a diverse selection of books I'm more likely to have something that'll be of value on the other side than if I were to take any other good. The guns are to protect my interest in that value, though they may be useless on the other side, so I also take a number of blades. I'm probably less than useless in a blade fight and I don't have time for medieval military training, so I'm banking more on the guns. I don't have the resources to take any useful set of any more advanced technology (except in book form), and I don't want to risk stealing anything, so I'm limited to what my meagre savings can buy in a small town.

I can't bring any sort of ebook reader since 2 days isn't enough time for someone in my position to obtain a sufficient portable power supply for such a thing and time I'd spend setting it up is time wasted that I could have spent on gathering hard copy books.

It doesn't matter that I can't obtain gold or silver since it is unlikely that a particular arbitrary metal is of any value on the other side.
