I would place posts on variouse internet message boards advertising for traveling companions to a magical fantasy world. I suspect all my family and friends are too sane to come with me. Exackly what kind of magic is in this world

Guns are hard to obtain where I live but I should be able to get a crossbow. I will spend my savings on new camping gear. Go to a martial arts shop see what kind of swords are available if I can only find wall hanger crud without resorting to mail order I guess a machete will have to do. If the camping gear shops have a crank or solar powered charger for kindles that will be useful if not I will have to restrict myself to a few books of the survival kind. Although I know enough about early medieval, industrial, and electrical technology that I should be fairly OK on those things without reference material.

Spend the rest of my savings on preserved camping food. Allot of people have suggested antibiotics but those are only available with a prescription.
