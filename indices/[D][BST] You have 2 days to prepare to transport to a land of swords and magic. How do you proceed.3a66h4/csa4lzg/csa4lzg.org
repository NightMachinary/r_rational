I grab my girlfriend and maybe some friends. On 48 hours notice I can probably arrange any of that and paying for flights and promising a buttload of my savings to negate them losing their jobs if I'm wrong is probably fine. (So long as I'm sure that I'm right, which isn't entirely certain.)

I'm grabbing a solar charger guaranteed good for a few years and my kindle, loaded with thousands of books on every topic I might need. Also that hand-crank charger, and a movement powered watch. I'm bringing hard copies of any book I want to be able to read/ that I might need when something inevitably happens to the kindle or power supply. I bring food, because who knows what I might need. Either I'll have a gun legally or I'll get a friend who owns several to come along.

I'm buying out large chunks of REI, the grocery store, and places for other supplies and emptying those gas-stationthings of ice. I'm renting a lare truck or several to get these on location. I know how to ride, and I'm not horrible with a saber, so I'll pick up at least one horse and a sword, It's possible that I'll just rent some time on the horses from a stable if I'm low on cash. I know they have insurance, and one of the stables is looking to downsize anyways, I'll pick those horses.

I've got an acquaintance who used to be a professional blacksmith. He's a bit of a handful, but I'll probably bring him and all of his forge supplies. I may or may not be out of money by now, but as my best friends are along for the ride, they sure as shit aren't. We'll bring at least one sailboat as both my best friend, and my HS best friend, who will probably come, are accomplished sailors. With some overlap, the party will include: an economics graduate with a specialty in industrial organization and development, a geological exploitation economist, several computer programmers in case magic turns out to be a Rick Cook type of thing, Several sailors, a blacksmith, A guy with grad degrees in sociology and math, a medieval combat and weapons specialist, a military history buff who knows his Japanese weaponry, a food prep specialist most of the way through a zoology degree, the former commander of a military academy, an electrical engineer, and a civil engineer. Those are within 7 people for those who want to keep count. Core party. I will also be bringing my gf and few jack-of all trades types, plus a close friend or two with no relevant specialties we will just want to keep around. All of our spare,currency, stocks and credit will be converted to gold.

My gf has a psychology and art background which might come useful. she should also bring some of her friends as my core 7 are all male, and only a few of the jack of all trades types are women. Call the party size about 30 as we can add a few current or former IDF members to that list and it seems stupid not to.

I can shoot a bow, ride a horse, and use a sword. My Isreali relatives are all MDs, and former IDF as that shit is mandatory service. We are bringing lots of medical supplies including any likely prescription meds, courtesy of the Israeli doctors. The blacksmith loves to get super drunk and is huge. We've got a bi eagle scout who is multi-lingual (if that matters), engineers, etc. Anything the world wants to throw at us we can handle, at least with some cross training of knowledge unless it involves magic. We can cross-train for anything necessary. Only the Israeli doctors are in their 30s, the rest span from 19-29. Might make a decent fantasy novel.

EDIT: It was pretty close anyways, but edits are successive ninjas after realizing that this was in [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. EDIT: Definitely a bunch of horses in case the trucks don't work, probably some wagons. if the portal isn't big enough, then supplies to build a few wagons. Edit:might as well swap cars with my sister, trading my 2011 for her 2007 4WD SUV.
