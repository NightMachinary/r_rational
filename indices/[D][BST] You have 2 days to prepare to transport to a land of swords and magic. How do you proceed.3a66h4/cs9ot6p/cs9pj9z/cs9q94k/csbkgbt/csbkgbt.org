  I find physical exercise to be boring for the most part.

My advice to you is to not do boring things for exercise, then. Take up a sport, or climbing, or martial arts, or freestyle unicycling, or whatever strikes your fancy.

Running on a treadmill is boring, whereas running in the woods is not, at least for me.

Finding some sort of exercise that you're actually motivated to do is rational.
