The "magic" part of the destination world might work out okay for you with regards to the medication. Certainly take as much as you can, just in case, but once you're over there start looking into how healing spells work and whether they can fix whatever it is that ails you. This sort of thing varies widely, of course, but many fantasy settings have top-tier healing magic that's better than anything modern medicine has managed.
