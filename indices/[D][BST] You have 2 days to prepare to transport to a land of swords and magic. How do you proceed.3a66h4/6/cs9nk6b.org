1. A couple of decades worth of my meds. If I can't get those, it probably doesn't matter what else I take.

2. Physical paper books, maybe 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica if the portal would fit it, as many "how things work" and survivalist medicine and similar volumes as I can fit in the space. And, yeh, some solar powered chargers for my personal electronics but I wouldn't spend a lot of money on them. They won't last more than a few years, books are a different matter.

3. Food. At least a couple weeks worth.

4. Trade goods. Gold, silver, maybe jewels if I can afford some.

5. A couple of firearms and a bunch of ammo. Plus a katana and a shortsword and machete that I already have.

6. My collection of meteorites and australites, a bunch of other interesting minerals, on the odd chance they're magically effective.

Edit: the portal seems to be pretty big, so I rent something offroadable and a standalone gas generator and buy a bunch of gas and load everything I own that can fit.

Edit: and a bat detector that does heterodyne and frequency shifting. [[http://www.batbox.com/duet.asp][This one by choice]].
