Acquire several books on memory techniques. In case magic requires large amounts of memorization. Ditto for meditation, concentration, and the ambiguous-yet-ubiquitous "willpower".

Google "what to do when time traveling to the past" and save several different guides. [[http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=QW-CHEATSHEET-PRINT][Ryan North has a good cheat sheet]]. In fact, dedicate 1-2 hours of contacting Ryan North personally and geeking out with him. Even if he doesn't believe me, he may tolerate me. Best trick: lick a cow's udder to inoculate yourself with cowpox, and thus acquire some cross-immunity to smallpox.

Bonus answer: make a printout of the complete Evil Overlord List. Sell it to the highest bidder.
