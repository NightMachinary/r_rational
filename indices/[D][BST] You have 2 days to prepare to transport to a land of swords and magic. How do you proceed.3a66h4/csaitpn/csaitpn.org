I grab my prepared prepper backpack which has antibiotics, a nexus loaded with useful things, a solar powered charger for said nexus, a few flash drives for extra memory, water purification pills, an axe, a torch, batteries, water bags, my water filter, cutlery and such, my food, my stove, clothing, sleeping blanket, sleeping stuff, my fire starters, my tools, my medical stuff, antibiotics, surgical masks and gloves. I'd remove the emergency money and map and such and the hand cranked radio, keep my binoculars, sewing kit, rope, duct tape, condoms, sun glasses, bags. I can't remember what else I stuck in there.

I live near a flood zone, I don't want to be screwed if the area floods.

I'm surprised I'm the only person who mentioned condoms. All you other rational dudes have a pretty high chance of catching magical siren HIV. Plus if the land of swords and magic is corruption of champions land you're really screwed.

After that I beg/ steal a few guns from my military friends. A grenade launcher would be nice for dragons and such. Maybe some of them can come along too, I know a few of them aren't that happy with life.

I strap on my fencing gear. It's knife resistant so it should give me some limited protection against murderous people with swords.

I use my savings to buy silk, spices, salt,

Some of these popular trade goods.

I'll use my free time to try and make some ricin, maybe a few other poisons. It's colorless, odourless, and easy to make with common natural ingredients. If orcs attack me maybe I can poison their water supply. Maybe I could make some nicotine poison or potato poison as well. Might be able to make some cyanide, though that's a bit trickier.

See if I can get some heroin and other drugs from certain other friends. I don't use it myself, but, fantasy world, needs must.

Not sure I can think of an easy way to acquire biological warfare weapons, definitely can't get tactical nukes sadly. If genocide turns out to be necessary it might be tricky.

Edit. The seeds I have in my backpack are pretty old. I might buy some new ones. The shovel seems fine.
