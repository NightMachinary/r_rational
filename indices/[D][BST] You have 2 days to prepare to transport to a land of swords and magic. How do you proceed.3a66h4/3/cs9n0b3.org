*A compilation of people's ideas:*

*preparation*

- Learn basic phrases in ancient languages. Highly unlikely that the world will have any of the same languages, but might as well try.
- Learn basic survival skills
- Create posts in numerous forums asking what I should do (wait... is OP doing this? :P )
- Ask friends and family for supplies (but misleading them on what it will be used for)
- Set alarms so you wake up on time
- Leave behind a video of the portal

*Supplies:*

- off-road motorbike (assuming portal is large enough)
- Solar-powered recharger & hand-cranked recharger
- Camera
- Survival Gear

  - Food
  - sleeping bag
  - knife
  - medicine
  - Matches
  - cold and hot weather clothes
  - a inflatable boat, in case portal lands you out somewhere in the ocean (and for rivers)

- Taser, guns, sword
- tablet with copy of Wikipedia, and some physical books as backup.
- Trade goods:

  - Spices, chocolate, pearls, gems

- Items that might be magical or work against magical creatures:

  - Garlic
  - good-luck charms
  - rare crystals

*What to do once there*

- Try to find civilization (follow a stream)
- Practice meditation & concentration exercises (in case magic is based on willpower)
- Once in a city, use your knowledge of modern science, rationality, and technology to your advantage. This could be done either by gaining the support of nobility or by using your trade goods to start a company.
