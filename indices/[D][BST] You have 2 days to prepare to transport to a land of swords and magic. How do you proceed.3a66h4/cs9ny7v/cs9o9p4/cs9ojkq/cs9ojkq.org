No availability.

I can't justify devoting anything more than a tiny portion of my time to trying to find such a thing (or parts for such a thing) since such a complex system as a text-computer is sure to be extremely failure-prone in an unknown environment.

On the plus side, I'm more likely to be able to camp out by the portal (and thus less likely to miss it) than someone who lives in a city.
