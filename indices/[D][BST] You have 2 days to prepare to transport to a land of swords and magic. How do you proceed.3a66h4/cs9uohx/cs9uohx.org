My spouse's copy of Pojar. Sword and wand fantasy lands are mostly New Zealand or British Columbia; 50/50 chance that Pojar will tell me what I can eat.

Antibiotics, definitely. The local pathogens will be entirely unlike anything I've experienced, but on the plus side they won't have developed any antibiotic resistances, so I can just bring a few dozen rounds of penicillin and be good. Unless it's radically different, in which case penicillin won't likely have much effect.

The tools I need to rough it for a couple weeks. (Trekking poles, backpack, sleeping bag, iodine tablets, camp stove, MREs, spare hiking shoes.) Nobody said I was going to land in the middle of a city, and even if I did, I'd need to get money and get a place to stay. It might take a few days, especially with the potential language barrier (assuming that's not magicked away).

High-density trade goods. Spices and dyes are a possibility, but most likely people won't trade for an entirely unknown good. Chemistry is probably universal, so I could bring gold and gemstones. (How quickly can I get a large order from [[https://www.etsy.com/shop/AlternativesLapidary][Alternatives Lapidary]]? Interesting cuts of cheap lab-grown gems means a greater profit margin.) As an obvious foreigner, I expect usurious offers, but it's better than nothing.

An inconspicuous locking case for my high-density trade goods. My plan is to find a place to hide this, then grab a small subset to sell at any given time.

Four spare sets of glasses. I'm nearly blind without them.

A mechanical watch. A sextant, and a guide on how to navigate with it. A compass, just in case this planet has a magnetic field. That should help me navigate, or at least not go in circles.

I might be able to purchase a firearm in my area without much delay. If I can, I'll get a 9mm and either a Mosin Nagant carbine or a .30-06 with a fair stack of ammunition for each. Maybe a couple thousand rounds. Failing that, a bow and a pistol crossbow. Knives and poison to apply to them -- if I'm attacked, I want to survive, and killing my attackers before they can kill me is an effective way of doing that.

A knife sharpener. Two, actually: one for the poisoned knives and one for my utility knife. (I don't go anywhere without my utility knife.)

It would be tough to get them in time, but ideally a set of llamas as pack animals. At least one cart, but I'm not depending on landing by a road. Food for llamas, though they're going to forage for the most part. Equipment to care for llamas. They don't have quite the carrying capacity of a donkey or a horse, but they forage better, and once I settle down, I have wool and milk, which I wouldn't with donkeys. Plus I hear they tend to be a bit stubborn if you try overloading them -- clear communication of bad conditions is good.

If I can't get llamas, then an ATV with a hitch, a trailer, and gasoline. I'll probably only get 15mpg, but that'll get me a couple hundred miles within the first day, which might mean sleeping in a bed on night 1 rather than a week of roughing it.

My cryonics medical necklace. I might be heavily deluded about this whole affair. It's not worth the risk of going without it.
