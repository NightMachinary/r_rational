good point, but if the nearest town turns out to be 150 miles away, having a bike would be a lifesaver. Walking all that way would be incredibly slow with carrying the supplies and going through uncharted territory. If I ran out of food, I would have to learn how to hunt and forage my own food, which would slow my progress to a crawl.

Good point, and thanks for the tips. However, I wouldn't buy a bike without first learning a bit about it. Also, i'm not going riding right away - there will be a learning period in which I will be going very slow (and even going very slow would be fast compared to walking).
