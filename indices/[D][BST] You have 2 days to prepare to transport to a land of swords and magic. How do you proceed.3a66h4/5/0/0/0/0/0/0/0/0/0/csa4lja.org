A note on motorcycles/dirtbikes: There are some tricky things involved in riding a motorcycle safely. I wouldn't recommend "learn[ing] in the process of riding it". A few examples off the top of my head:

- Turning is mostly leaning, as opposed to turning the handlebars. In fact, past a certain speed, turning the handlebars left will cause the bike to turn very sharply right.
- How you move your weight around makes a huge difference in low-speed maneuvers.
- Almost all bikes have a manual transmission, which is getting to be a pretty rare skill in the states. Clutch? What's a clutch?
- Importance of safety gear.

So, if you don't know how to ride a motorcycle, I think your chances of survival actually go down if you bring one, since injury would be catastrophic, especially right when you get there.
