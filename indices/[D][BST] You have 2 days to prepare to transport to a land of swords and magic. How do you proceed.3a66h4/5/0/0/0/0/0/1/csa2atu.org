With a portal that size I'm going to rent a couple of U-Hauls and bring /everything/. All my electronics, all my books, all my camping gear, I'll clean out my crawl space. Who knows, maybe old Christmas tree ornaments will be useful as trade goods, or will retain some kind of magical signature from my home universe, or whatever. It turns out that time is short and space is cheap so throw it all in and sort it out later.

I'll rent a bunch of stuff I don't have immediately handy. A generator, an ATV, etc. I'll be somewhat limited by what's available here in the city - I don't expect to be able to find industrial gems in the timespan available, for example. Better trade goods to find on short notice include pallets of fine cloth or a thousand digital watches or such.

And finally, I'll rent a Bobcat excavator. I'm bringing /way/ too much stuff to handle it all right away, especially without knowing what the other universe is really like. So as soon as I'm through to the other side I'm going to bury the U-Hauls before going off to scout and find out what I'll actually need from them.
