Before being transported, you know nothing more about the destination. If you search on Google maps, the coordinates appear to match an abandoned warehouse complex. For more details about the portal, you would likely need to physically travel to the site to see if there's anything obvious there.

The only limitation on what you can bring is that it needs to fit into the portal, and you need to actually be able to acquire it.
