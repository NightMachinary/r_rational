As an obligatory plug, this week's Weekly Challenge is "Portal Fantasy" so if you have a great story in mind, you can post it there. The thread will go up in ~7 hours from the time of this post. (Edit: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a7ypf/weekly_challenge_portal_fantasy/][This thread, right here!]])

I go grab my Kindle, plug it in, and start charging it. I go grab my hand-cranked USB charger from the basement, which gets added to my luggage. I start wiping the Kindle of all unimportant material, and begin loading it down with information, with a focus on technical manuals. I grab a bunch of books on medicine, mathematics, and physics from the 1800s (which will hopefully be less complicated than modern stuff, and won't contain irrelevant information). I go to the store and spend a few hundred dollars from my emergency fund on backups; extra devices, extra cords, extra storage space. I take my laptop too, though battery life is going to be much more of a problem.

I grab copies of survival books from the bookstore. I already have "How to Survive in the Woods", but I want to grab some of those big, glossy identification guides. In case I'm stuck in the woods, they might save my life. In case I can easily find a city, I can hopefully sell them.

I go talk to my father-in-law, who collects guns. If I told him the truth, he probably wouldn't believe me (and I probably would have some trouble believing me either, which is part of why I'm minimizing risks in case this is a delusion). Instead, I tell him that I've been looking for a gun and some ammo. I believe in my state (and the next state over) this is the faster route to gun ownership. Ideally, I'm able to acquire a handgun and ammo for myself, and a turn-of-the-century rifle that smiths and craftsmen will hopefully be able to emulate. I also grab a few of my father-in-law's books on the history of firearms and their construction, of which there are many.

I send out a message on Facebook asking if anyone wants to go on a trip with me. Ideally, some of my friends who play D&D and have an interest in the pseudo-period. Depending on time constraints and how good I am at selling the scenario, I borrow some edged weapons from a friend of mine who does fencing instruction, and a bow and arrows from a friend who does archery.

I say goodbye to my wife, and tell her that I hope to be home before the baby is born. I also say that there's a good chance that I'm just crazy, in which case I will be home in about an hour.
