/I'm/ only going because I have to. If I didn't think it would literally kill me, I'd stay the heck away from the portal (or just tell my friends about it and let them go if they want to). My wife is on too many medications to last long in a non-modern world, and the odds of dying in childbirth are too great, to say nothing of the infant mortality rates. I hope that she would agree with this assessment, but if we disagreed I would just leave her behind and hope that with time, she would forgive me.

My friends (or at least, the likely candidates) don't have attachments that would prevent them from leaving, or could bring their attachments with them.
