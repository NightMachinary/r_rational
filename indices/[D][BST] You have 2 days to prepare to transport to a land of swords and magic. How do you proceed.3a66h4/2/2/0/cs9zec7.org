I'd grab a bunch of stuff from all over the place. The big problem that I foresee with more modern medical texts is that they would tell me to use tools and equipment that I don't have and can't make, or suggest courses of action that aren't available to me given how limited my resources are going to be and how far I am from modern civilization. 19th century might be too far back, but I need some criteria that can give me the best books for my situation.
