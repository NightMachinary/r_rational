I've not decided if that spell even exists in my world, but my current assumption is that if it does, it can only repair damages, rather than reassemble fallen apart pieces, so while mending would be able to repair the glass in some broken glasses, if the earpiece snapped off and the tiny screw fell out, mending would unsnap the side, but not rescrew the tiny piece and thus you'd still end up with broken/disassembled glasses.

(As to what makes things broken vs disassembled, it likely has to do with either perception or some sort of chemical bonds. Hopefully it doesn't come up, lol)
