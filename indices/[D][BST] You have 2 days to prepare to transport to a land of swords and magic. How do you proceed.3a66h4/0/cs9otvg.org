Hm. Things I'd want to bring:

- Antibiotics and other medical supplies.
- Spices and chocolate. They have the best potential for high-value / low mass/volume that I can come up with quickly and have easy access to.
- Industrial gems (the ones that are cheap as dirt but look the same). My second shot at good trade goods.
- Books. Lots of books. Science, technology, medicine, warfare. Printouts of various Wikipedia articles would work, but I'd also want specific technical manuals.
- Weapons. It's nearly impossible to buy high-quality functional edged weapons in the modern era, but we make really good knives, so that would be a place to start -- I suppose a lamb splitter is approximately a short sword. These are mostly for bribes, sale, and arming my companions once I find some.\\
- Camping gear, including fire starters and massive numbers of lighters.
- Clothes of various weights -- I have no idea what the weather over there looks like.
- Waterproof containers for everything, especially the books.

Guns would be nice, but I don't know where I could acquire them quickly.

I would also leave notices for family and friends with as much info as I had and any final goodbye messages.

Finally, one of the first things I would do is post a message on [[/r/rational]] saying "hey, if you were going to be pulled through a portal to fantasyland in 48 hours, what would you do? Oh and, yeah, this is *totally* hypothetical, honest!"

EDIT: Things I forgot to list

A wheelbarrow for carrying stuff. A shovel so that I can bury what I don't bring along. Paper and pencils/pens so that I can make a map of where I buried it.
