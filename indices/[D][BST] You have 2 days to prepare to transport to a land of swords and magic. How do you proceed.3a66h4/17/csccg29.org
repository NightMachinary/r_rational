How can I know what I am experiencing is true? I have an awareness. That awareness is reinforced by accurate depictions of reality (warehouse with unusual totems). Pretty sketchy. I'd probably check in with a psychiatrist. Write about the experience in my blog. Call up a videographer friend and livestream me hanging out at the warehouse, outside the portal, with a goat staked in the middle of it for laughs.

If I was somehow sufficiently convinced (the "awareness" became a compulsion or was otherwise inarguable) then I'd move on.

What can I expect? "Swords and magic" That's not very helpful. Since this is such a bizarre situation, it's likely I'm in a simulation and of all the possible "swords and magic" universe, it seems a good bet to go with the "Camelot" version. The weather will be similar to England. There will be trees and rolling hills. Gold will be valuable. Horses will be in use. There's likely a feudal system of government. Maybe magical creatures. Etc. I will acknowledge "swords and magic" could be a tropical island or ancient China or even something far far different, but just keep that in the back of my mind since I just don't know. Will there be planetary systems as we know it? How does magic work? Will it interfere with modern electronics? Will there be clear good and evil like there often is in my literary tradition? Questions to think about, but not a lot of time.

What are my goals? Short term: Survive long enough to not have my immediate survival a concern. Weapons, food, medicine. Medium-term: Establish a community to ensure my medium-term survival. Weapon generation, Construction, sustainable food. Long-term: Influence society to increase the chances of my long-term survival and the reduce the pain and suffering in my community and in society. Knowledge in the civil, agricultural, and governmental spheres.

Each of those will require different supplies. Ideally I could convince a dozen Navy SEALS with advanced civil engineering and agricultural degrees to come along. I don't have those resources though.

I don't know anyone who I could sufficiently convince that I'm telling the truth in order to be comfortable with "informed consent" so I'm assuming I'm going alone.

The major limiting factor here is time. There's a lot of stuff I'd want that I don't know how to get my hands on in 48 hours.

What could I get in 2 days that will be helpful in those three areas that I could afford?
