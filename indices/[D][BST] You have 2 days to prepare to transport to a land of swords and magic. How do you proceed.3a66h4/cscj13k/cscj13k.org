I'm not sure about what i'd do exactly, but the absolute first thing would be to post about this "hypothetical" situation in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and then read the comments while i prepare for the trip in whatever way i can think about, then do the things that i didn't think about that were suggested in the post.
