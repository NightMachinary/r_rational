Random superman :

a random person gets superman esque powers. Completely invulnerable can fly super strength etc

After a year they lose their powers and another random person gets it.

Thoughts?

I was just imagining this in the last thirty years. Probably Taiwan would be conquered. Many dead celebrities/rich people

Revolution perhaps?

Edit: Some random ideas for what they might do:

Canalman - goes around building canals, like Kra canal, linking Caspian to Black Sea, linking Baikal to Aral to Caspian

Moonman - goes to the moon and makes a big happy face on it or something - at this scale I am not sure how long it would take for superman to do something like that

Xnationalist man - really loves their country and tries to do whatever it needs, so if they're Chinese conquer Taiwan, can superman stop the entirety of the American nuclear arsenal? would the USA threaten that? after all they could just fly to washington and kill the president directly. how many carriers would he need to sink before the USA just let Taiwan and South China Sea go?

doesnt do anything man - some happy person, maybe just had a kid or got married, doesnt want to do anything with their powers, for the rest of the world looks like a year has been skipped

Fuckthesystemman - one thing this power would do would be to encourage the elites to make the lower class happier, cause there's a lot better odds of the lower class getting this power than them, and when the lower class does there is nothing anyone can do if they decide to kill every person with 1 billion+ dollars, etc.

Just cause I have a hammer not everything is a nail man - does something else with their powers that aren't using the force, perhaps just lets themself be tested or whatever

Anyone have a link to a random person generator that will give me a country randomly based on population?

I made one.

Here is an example from the last 40 years, using 2010 population data because I'm lazy:

1982 France\\
1983 United States\\
1984 China\\
1985 Hungary\\
1986 China\\
