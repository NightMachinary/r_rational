Doesn't seem very similar, based on a quick Google.

The idea is that stuff just doesn't happen if there are no observer(auctor) of sufficient gravitas to observe. That would mean that a forest that's completely clear of auctors for 1 year would remain in a kind of stasis. When an auctor entered it again the "universe" would simulate the events there probabilistically, with the potentia(scope of possibilities) determined by the gravitas of the auctor.
