Maybe my original examples were bad. I was trying to keep to the tree falling theme too much, I think.

Realistically, a tree in a living forest would always fall because of the conscious fauna around it, which would combine into a gravitas gestalt. Only in a completely dead forest would a tree not fall.

So to answer directly, yes, insects and bacteria can be, but their gravitas would be very low, especially the bacteria. Plants are not, but long lived plants can become the focal point of a gravitas gestalt and thus develop a type of proto-auctor state.
