You've got the gist of what I was going for, but I think I wasn't very clear in how the system would ultimately work out. My initial name for it was recursivity rather than sagma(which means saddle) because it would exploit the feedback loop between gravitas and potentia. If an event only happens because an observer is there to witness it, doesn't that mean that the observer is intrinsic to the potentia of the event, even if he has nothing to do with causing it? So the system would work by increasing one's own potentia and using that power to completely subvert causality, not just to exploit it by manipulating what counts as observation like you're thinking.

Yes, that's intentional. I like systems which are hard to master and which naturally result in power stratification(i find power dynamics and the resulting social interactions fascinating), and yet where the effects on society are fully pervasive. In this case, utilizing the system would be necessary for even the most mundane occupations, like farming or tanning. The alternative would be to observe everything all the time in order for them to behave "rationally", which isn't feasible.

An analogy would be in a modern video game, which [[https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7v85ff/heres_whats_happening_in_horizon_zero_dawn_every/][renders only the things you're looking at directly]], though in this system the gravitas(power) of an auctor(observer) is more like a bubble of causality enabling, which extends an arbitrary distance around them.

Additionally, my preferred technology aesthetic is "lightbulbs but not vacuum tubes", and this system manages that perfectly. A lightbulb and a vacuum tube are very similar, but one has clearly observable and immediate effects, and the other does not. So a lightbulb can function well enough to be worth the expense, but the vacuum tube cannot, so mundane technological progress would be forever bottlenecked there, and advancement of the magic system would become the focus.
