Refrigeration is easy: put anything in an airtight box. As long as you don't smell the food going bad, it stays fresh.

Mummification stabilizes all wounds on someone unconscious. If nobody can tell they're bleeding, they don't bleed.

A blindfold could be armor, if the person wearing it had enough authority to cancel out other observers. "You peasants aren't authoritative enough to observe me getting hit by your arrows, and I can't see the arrows... so they don't hit me."

I think you need extra rules about when "observation" can come into play, since otherwise a lot of basic processes - plant reproduction? seasons changing? - would get deranged. So, say that "observation" magic is optional, that it has certain triggers, it's not always active.

Skilled fine-scale "observation" should let you really bend reality. It's like the Neo-in-Matrix rule: your belief about reality not changing inconveniently becomes truth.

If you're a skilled enough observation-monk not to observe yourself falling in the water, you don't. You just walk on water.

If you're an authoritative enough observation-noble not to observe people disagreeing with your orders, they don't. People just follow your orders.

Delusion and ultimate power could become the same thing.

To give it more solidity, I'd add rules about how you get observation-strength. Like, do you have to build up a "ideal palace," like a "memory palace," that holds your vision of how reality is supposed to work? That sort of thing. Something people have to do, to refresh their ability to make the world privilege their observations.

But it's a cool idea, as long as it's not totally automatic everywhere.
