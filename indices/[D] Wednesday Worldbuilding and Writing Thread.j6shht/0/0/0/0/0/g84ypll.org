In your example the tree would fall as normal to both of them if they were not actively interfering with sagma, yes. Gravitas is like the rendering cone in the GIF i linked, except a bubble produced by consciousness, and varying in accordance with the "level" of consciousness of the individual. So if two people have overlapping "bubbles of rendering", they would naturally see the same thing.

Maybe my original examples were bad because I was trying to keep to the tree falling theme. Realistically, a tree in a living forest would always fall because of the conscious fauna around it, which would combine into a gravitas gestalt. Only in a completely dead forest would a tree not fall.

Err, does that answer your question or does it just raise more?
