I'm a bit confused about how gravitas plays out innatural cause and effect. I can see how it works with an action that is "opposed", in the sense that two people are trying to define their own version of reality and the stronger one wins.

But what about a situation where, say, a windstorm blows over a tree and a single person is there to observe. Taking two situations where all else is equal except for vastly different gravitas of the observer, do they witness anything different?
