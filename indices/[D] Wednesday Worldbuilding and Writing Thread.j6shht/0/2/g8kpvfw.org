...this has a number of interesting, immediate consequences.

Firstly, things need to be observed to happen. Therefore, things that are not observed do not happen. Therefore, there needs to be a widespread system of observation - like an army of deployable observers - just to ensure that things are observed as-and-when necessary. This will have a certain impact on society;the job of being an Observer will be a low-skilled but nonetheless vital part of society.

Second - anything can be observed. There must be some interaction between observed and non-observed places - perhaps Wizard Dave can use his gravitas to ensure that he can get a thing that he wants (say, a large lump of gold) out of an unobserved location. With the complexity of the desired object making it harder to find (a lump of gold is easier, a smartphone is /way/ harder). But this ability to create things comes with a consequence... what happens if you use it to create /another observer?/

Thirdly, is it even possible to kill the world's best Observer? Given that he never observes timeline in which he is dead (because he would be dead), and given that his observations override anyone else's, how is it possible that his life can end (short of someone else becoming a better Observer)? (Of course, he can still be injured...)
