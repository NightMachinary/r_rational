Here's my attempt to make a cool magic system out of the "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" thought experiment, if the answer were NO, there wouldn't be a sound. That is, if events required observers in order to happen.

The key concepts in this metaphysics are /potentia/, /auctor/, and /gravitas/, which produce the /sagma/ magic system.

*Potentia*: an event scales according to how much effect it has. e.g. A tree falling has less /potentia/ than a nuke exploding, which has less than a star going nova.

*Auctor*: An agent capable of observing an event of any given /potentia/. e.g. The tree fell because there was an /auctor/ to observe it fall.

*Gravitas*: the scaling quality inherent to an /auctor/ which enables an event of any given /potentia/ to occur. An ant has less /gravitas/ than a fox, which has less /gravitas/ than a human. e.g. Despite being riddled with insects, the tree only fell when a human auctor was close enough to observe its effects.

*Sagma*: The name given to the metaphysical system by which an /auctor/ can manipulate the relationship between /potentia/ and /gravitas/. e.g. Initiate Bob expended /intrapotentia/ to knock a tree down, but Wizard Dave resisted with his superior /gravitas/, and it remained upright.
