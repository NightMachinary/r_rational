I can guess what will happen, as this trope is somewhat common. He will quite possibly get an OP artifact or power, as this is how it goes in many other translated Xianxia works. The MC normally finds an OP artifact or the teacher-in-a-ring trope. The teacher-in-a-ring trope means that the teacher will be stuck somewhere and they will need the MC's help to gain a body/get out of spatial ring. In exchange, they help the MC become OP. In this case, he might become rational and decide to help the MC.
