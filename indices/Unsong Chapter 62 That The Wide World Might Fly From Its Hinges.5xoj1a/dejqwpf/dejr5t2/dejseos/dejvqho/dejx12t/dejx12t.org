- The author can take a week to solve something and have a character solve it in a second. Readers will assume that the character thinks fast.
- They can ask experts or research something and have the character solve it on their own. Readers will think that the character has a lot of knowledge.
- They can look into the pure facts of the matter and have the first character solve it from smaller clues. Readers will think that the character is perceptive.
- The author can create the world so that the character only faces problems they can solve. Readers will think that the character can solve /any/ problem.

These are all ways of creating characters that are smarter than the author is, and I think Scott's using all of them in UNSONG.
