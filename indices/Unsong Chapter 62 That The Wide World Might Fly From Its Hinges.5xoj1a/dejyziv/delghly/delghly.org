Perhaps THARMAS just uncovered a Name for its second time! If the first discovery of a Name is the tutorial vision and Names are valid even if klipatified, then it stands to reason that a large number of generated names would be simple klipot of previously-discovered Names.

Perhaps it discovered and then rediscovered the Healing Name or the Mnemonic Name or the Accelerating Name or the Flawless Function Name or some other Name to subvert the restrictions placed on it.
