I loved the animorph series. I read all the books multiple times, especially the Chronicles books, since those were so good at depicting alien life.

But I always hated that 2 hour morph limit. It sucked in so many ways, both Doyleistically and Wastonistically.

From a Doyleist view, it's a crutch, there exclusively to offer the writer easy tension. So many times someone was stuck in a position where the timer was running down and they couldn't reset it because of reasons, that it just got silly.

From a Watsonian point of view, it's even sillier. Why would a piece of alien technology for infiltration have a time limit measured in such neat round numbers, and wouldn't such a time limit be the first thing the engineers who made the device be working round the however-many-hour clock to optimize the device and increase that time limit?

And finally, considering how many of the Yeerk mooks seem to be in their army for the chance to use a proper body, why the hell haven't the Andalites generated asylum boxes based on the morph boxes, which detect a yeerk's touch, give them a limited form of the morphing ability, and forcefully morph them into a body that isn't trapped in an AndIMustScream horror?
