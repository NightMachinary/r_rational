  Why would a piece of alien technology for infiltration
#+end_quote

It's not for infiltration. At least, the Andalites never originally conceived of using it as such. Most of the population never goes beyond acquiring and morphing a bird on their homeworld. It's potential was largely overlooked until it was weaponized by Visser Three, the humans, and a few Andalites in tight spots.

  have a time limit measured in such neat round numbers

No argument here.

  and wouldn't such a time limit be the first thing the engineers who made the device be working round the however-many-hour clock to optimize the device and increase that time limit?

Well, since it was mostly just a toy to them it may not have been a priority. Physical combat? They already outclass most beings in melee. Espionage? They didn't have a grand espionage tradition, and by the time they found out about it the war was already going badly.
