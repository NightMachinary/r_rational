Respectful request: please actually read the posted story before making comments like "I feel like this has already failed" and "you can't really just" and "this is a major departure from canon." I have indeed considered all of the points you're raising, and more, and most of your questions/concerns have already been explicitly addressed even in just these first three chapters.

Yes, morphing has changed in this way. The whole "morphing and then demorphing heals your ORIGINAL body's injuries" wasn't important (or even present) in canon at all until fairly late, and always felt like a weird retcon. For instance, if you're always being restored to your original genetic template, then how come your haircut stays consistent? And what about things like the boys being circumcised, Rachel having piercings, anyone who had to have braces to straighten their teeth, etc. (none of which were addressed in canon, but all of which would matter)? Not to mention the fact that brain structure at the microscopic level is crucial to personality, and is hugely shaped by environment and personal history, and could not possibly be restored from genetic information alone. In this sane-itized version, morphing works by tucking your original body away in Z-space, in stasis, and allowing emulator tech to take control of the morph. That changes the plotline with the auxiliary Animorphs, but otherwise has basically no effect on canon events (it even allows for the weird pullout to the Leeran planet).

Morphed bodies, on the other hand, are constructed from scratch, from a template, each time, so injuries there aren't a problem.
