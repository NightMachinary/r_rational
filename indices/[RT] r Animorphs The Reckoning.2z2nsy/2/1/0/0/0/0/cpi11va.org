Last points first ...

Haven't actually made a decision re: Tobias is Elfangor's son. I've left that open for now while I figure things out. Went ahead and included hints of his affinity for Elfangor because that makes perfect sense either way.

Elfangor having spent time as a human is going to tie in with the ways in which Ellimist and Crayak are fiddling, and those two entities are more than enough to cover most of what the Time Matrix did anyway. There's nothing special about the construction site if the Time Matrix isn't there; the idea is simply that Elfangor had hopes of taking out the pool once his larger weapon failed, but when his ship and injuries prevented that, he landed in the construction site either a) on promptings/prophecies from Ellimist, or b) simply because it was a low-density space and the ship couldn't stay airborne. Outside of providing backstory, it was fairly unimportant in the overall war, and losing it makes the universe about twice as believable imo. True that this question has not yet been addressed in any form in the draft of the story so far.

The change to morphing wasn't done purely to keep Elfangor from escaping. The change to morphing was the first, seminal step in making the story rational and internally consistent without requiring a total break from known physics; it's the key that made me think a rational version could actually be written. There's a lot of other detail behind the changes to morphing tech that I'd be happy to PM, if you want to critique, but that also is inevitably a ticket to spoilersville. Elfangor's lack of options naturally following from that is the sort of happy coincidence that I look for once I've put that sort of constraint on myself.

As he demonstrated by going human for a bit, he's well aware that he can stave off death by stasis-ing himself, *edit ONE* hour at a time. But the need to have the Yeerks think the search is over IS important, in my mind...if they'd landed to find an empty ship, there's every chance they would have brought in ten Bug fighters and started a tight scan for every living thing within the radius of a mile, which (given the level of tech) could have provided them with enough raw data to track him down anyway. Rational agents could definitely disagree over whether it was worth sacrificing the eight or twelve hours he might have snagged by repeatedly morphing and demorphing before his original body died, but it seemed within his character to a) buy the Animorphs some time and some secrecy, and b) take at least one last shot at Visser Three.

As for Tobias and Ax fighting in their "natural" states---yes, this ups the ante for them, and requires a different approach, just as the absence of mass-nothlit-as-final-solution requires the war to end differently. It's important to note that the absence of sapient nothlits changes Tobias's role in combat anyway, and the fact that the Animorphs have access to an Elfangor morph removes the need for Ax to "stay in character" to provide them with cover. Given the choice between an Ax body and an Elfangor body, I think the Animorphs will prefer to have Ax morph something more powerful anyway (especially since odds are that he will be younger than he was in canon). If you look closely (especially at Marco), you'll see some threads worth tugging on that can allow for breaking/abusing the morphing power to solve the healing injuries problem, but I wanted the characters to have to find those answers rather than just having them dumped in their laps.

Basically, the rules behind making changes to canon have been like this:

---Change morphing such that it is believable, internally consistent, and at least plausible given known science (assuming a thousand years of progress in microbiology, nanotech, and physics).

---Change all characters such that they are personality-consistent but otherwise as reasonable and intelligent as possible (e.g. reduce dumb mistakes that no real person would make that were written just for the sake of driving the plot).

---Make cascading changes to other events and technology that are logically required by the two changes above.

---Where possible within the bounds of reason, avoid any change that would tend to power up the Animorphs. In certain places, this can't be avoided (Elfangor would not have denied them an Andalite morph, there's no way the Andalites would lack infestation prevention this late in the game), but given a neat idea that would help them and a neat idea that would handicap them, I'm preferring the latter. I don't actually know if they can win this war; I'm fighting on their side and trying as hard as I can to solve the problems, but simply MAKING THE PROBLEMS EASIER isn't particularly interesting.

---In all four of the rules above, stick to the spirit of canon rather than the letter. Dropping the Time Matrix makes readers cry "foul" if what they care about is the HISTORY of the Animorphs universe, but if what they care about is the characters, the feel, and the spirit, I think most honestly won't mind. It all boils down to what things you consider "sacred," and for me, that's pretty much ONLY the following:

-->Yeerks' thirst for hosts

-->Andalites' arrogance and questionable morality

-->The core personalities of Jake, Cassie, Marco, Tobias, and Rachel

-->Morphing tech as an unexpectedly powerful advantage

...anything else is fair game.
