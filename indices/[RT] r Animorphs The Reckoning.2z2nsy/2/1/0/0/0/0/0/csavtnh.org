That answers my question actually: I was super curious if you had a plot planned out where they "win" or something like that as in canon and in HPMOR even though the enemy is more competent. In particularly, Rachel's foolhardiness, and generally the group's teenage idiocy, while believable, seems to make that unlikely.
