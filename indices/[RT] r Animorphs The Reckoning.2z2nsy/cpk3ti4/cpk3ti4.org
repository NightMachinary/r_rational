Ok this is pretty great so far. When it was Jake's viewpoint I wanted more Jake and hated the switch to Marco.

But then Marco goes and ups the rationality power so I wanted more Marco and then Rachel's turn comes up and I hate it for lack of Marco's brain, but then Rachel goes "Nuh uh I am muchinkin this to the max", and then I go "Yay Rachel" , but then Rachel tells the enemy of their existence, so I'm sad now.

I don't know what to think anymore except, gib more.
