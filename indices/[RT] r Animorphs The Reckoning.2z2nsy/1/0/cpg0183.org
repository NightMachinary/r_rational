I understand /why/ the two-hour limit had to be imposed; I mean, without it from a Doylist point of view that limits a ton of the tension that comes from A: espionage and B: outright fights, since both sides know there's a time limit and can plan around it. Without it, a lot of the time-based tension then goes back on "I can't blow my Peter Parker persona", which is a particular brand of drama that I've never, ever liked.

(Also, my headcanon was that the actual time limit was like 2 hours, 3 minutes, ten seconds, and that was only the beginning of the closing of the window, which allowed difficult if possible transition for another 3-5 minutes after that. You're an alien giving advanced tech to middle-school-aged dorks, you tell them "two hours" and leave it at that. It's not like it's a good idea for them to experiment with this limit when your only means of falsifying are to see /if you can come back from the morph or not/.)
