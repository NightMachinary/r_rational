The best explanation I could come up with is that the Andalites didn't really invent morphing technology. The Escafil device is actually a child's toy developed by a now extinct race of aliens that ended up in the Andalite's hooves. They figured out how to replicate it but still don't actually understand it.

Also, the two hour thing is almost certainly just an approximation. Even in the books, the time limit seems to be fuzzy at the edges.
