I welcome a rational Animorphs story, it's a world I loved as a kid and has a very rich mythology to play with.

However, having only skimmed the first chapter, I feel like this has already failed in one aspect that has bothered me ever since I read the original series.

Why does Elfangor stay behind? Even after you take into account everything that the Ellimist did to manipulate his life, there's no reason he couldn't have crash landed at the construction site and then morphed some alien bird to escape. And from what I gathered here, even with the changes to his personality and actions he takes, there's still no good reason why he wouldn't just see Jake and friends tell them to run and that they'd meet up later. Especially if the Time Matrix is buried in the construction site, which IIRC was the whole reason he goes there in the first place.

In fact, I think having Elfangor live could have a very useful role from a story perspective, especially a rational story perspective. A mentor figure for them to play off with. I think you should rethink this, or at least present a plausible reason he couldn't run.
