"Having only skimmed" caused you to miss the fact that Elfangor's wounds were fatal. Also, I'm doing my best not to level the Animorphs up/give them advantages that do not logically follow from necessary changes. Keeping Elfangor around as a mentor definitely qualifies as a significant power boost from the original story.

Also: Time Matrix is likely not a thing.
