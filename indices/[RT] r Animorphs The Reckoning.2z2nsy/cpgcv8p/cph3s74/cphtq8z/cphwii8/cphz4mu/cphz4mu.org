Actually, I've read the story since my first post, it just didn't occur to me that I had to tell you. I don't see why you're taking objection with me pointing out that something you have changed from canon, is indeed, a "major departure from canon". While you might have it so that does not Tobias become a nothlit in your story, Ax almost always fought as himself too, so in your story I guess he'll be doing much less of that, since there's no way for him to heal, huh? That's a pretty major change, sure the original story didn't give an explanation for things like fingernails and hair, but it's still the way it worked every single time Ax was in a battle, IE since the beginning. And Tobias did routinely fight as a hawk too (as dumb as that was), and morphing healed him. It's not a retcon, though KA certainly did a fair amount of stupid retcons in her time.

But the biggest problem with this change that I see is this; if you made it purely to justify that this is why Elfangor doesn't escape, it still doesn't address it. I looked it up, the Kafit bird is a species on the Andalite homeworld that is used when teaching morphing. Ax knew of it, and Elfangor uses it in the Andalite Chronicles. So, he does have it, and in fact most Andalites do. It doesn't matter if as an Andalite Elfangor is hurt, he can still give morph a Kafit and escape. He can even give the Cube to the kids. I'll admit that I missed this pertinent change to morphing you made when I skimmed (I was quite sleep deprived, it's nothing to take personally), but this is still a problem from what I can tell. Unless I'm missing something?

The posted chapters do nothing to explain that you've somehow removed the Time Matrix from the story, yet kept Tobias still Elfangor's son (or at least existing at all), claim he's spent time as a human before, and just happened to land in the same abandoned construction site where the Time Matrix was buried.
