It doesn't really matter how fatal Elfangor's wounds were. Morphing heals any injury that isn't genetic. Unless you changed that? In the original series the characters routinely suffer wounds that are incredibly fatal, and they still manage to will themselves to demorph through the pain, and turn out perfectly fine, though incredibly rattled. The original series relied on this heavily. This is even how they were able to recruit the Auxiliary Animorphs at the end of the series. How is it that Elfangor morphed to a human form, but demorphed to a damaged Andalite, if he received a fatal wound in the crash? This is a major departure from canon, if I'm interpreting this correctly. This would imply they need to, what, heal wounds for each of their individual morphs naturally? Like Jake as a Tiger is going to need a few weeks rest, 2 hours at a time, to recover from some Hork-Bajir cuts?

Also, you can't really just remove the Time Matrix. It's an incredibly OP and poorly explained artifact, I admit. But too much of series' backstory relies on it, you can't just say it isn't a thing unless you've got a way around everything it affected. You mention Alloran directly in the 1st chapter, so maybe you've got a different story lined up for Visser 3, but without the Time Matrix Elfangor is completely different. Tobias only exists because of the Time Matrix, how was he born without it? How can Elfangor say he lived as a human once without it?

I get it's an ongoing story so, you might very well have these changes mapped out in your head. I don't want you to spoil anything I guess, but have you considered these things?
