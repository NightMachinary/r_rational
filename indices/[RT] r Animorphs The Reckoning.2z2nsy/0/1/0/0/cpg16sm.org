Somehow I doubt this would make it past the planning stages. I mean, it seems like if that were possible the Andalite fleet would be made up of thousands of copies of their greatest warriors morphed from space-lizards or something barely sapient enough to do an accidental aquiring/morph. Or even if not, you'd have self-deprecating arisths copying their War-Princes after a particularly depressing day, or all warriors could keep copies of /themselves/ acquired from someone else's morph and thus restore 1:1 perfect backups after major injuries, which Elfangor obviously didn't do.

I dunno, that seems like it would be a rabbit-hole of munchkinism if it turns out to be possible. Nonetheless maybe /that's/ Tobias' arc, I could totally see him doing it out of depression/desperation, though my personal guess is that since the acquiring happens at apparently a DNA level and not a full-body particle scan, you would not get memories or anything like that. You'd have an infant Andalite (or worse, a brain-dead Andalite) stuck in an adult Elfangor's body.
