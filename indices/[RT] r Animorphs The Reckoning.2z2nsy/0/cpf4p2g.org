Not sure yet if it's going to be firmly RST, so I'm hedging my bets.

Two chapters right now, and it's doing pretty well. Two notable changes from canon:

[minor spoilers, first chapter]

1) "[If your two hours run out then] the construct body will persist, as it is real and does not require power to maintain. But the pocket dimension will collapse, taking with it your true body and all of the computational hardware upon which your mind and memories are stored. You will simply cease to exist, leaving only the construct in your wake."

It appears that Tobias will not be getting trapped in bird morph.

2) "There are forces larger than any of us at work, and evidence that we have been maneuvered into place by those you might call God. I do not know the future, but I have seen its broader strokes, and can rank possibility far more finely than you would credit. This meeting was not by chance, and if there are few paths to victory, at least be assured that you walk upon the widest."

It appears that the Ellimist exists, or at least that the war has so many improbable elements that Elfangor suspects something of that nature to exist, and I would rank it as probable that high-ranking authorities, at least, also share in this belief of Elfangor's.

Which I think is /really interesting/, even more so than the bit about morphing. I have to wonder what it'd be like to look at the situation and realize that there's strong evidence that you and the other guys are being manipulated by a superintelligence whose motives you can only guess at.
