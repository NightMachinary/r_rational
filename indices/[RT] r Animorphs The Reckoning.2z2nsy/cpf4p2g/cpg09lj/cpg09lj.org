I'm wondering what's going to happen with Tobias. I mean, that's kind of his /thing/ from a narrative standpoint, being a nothlit. Do human minds screw with the tech enough to leave a sliver of a conduit open? Does the Ellimist wave his hand and say "no, this is how it's going to be"? Does he get trapped and the Animorphs keep the hawk out of respect, only to find a way later to re-link the mind without restoring the form?

On the other hand, assuming nothlits really don't exist, what does this mean for the Animorphs? He's /going/ to get shunted over to the other coast sooner or later, does that mean a second chapter of the Animorphs is going to get set up? I'm really looking forward to how David is introduced (if he's introduced), that was one of the most terrifying trio of books in canon, and figuring out how to screen people is a definite must, and they /have/ to do it sooner than 7/8ths of the way through the story.
