I've only read the first chapter so far and it's been a long time since I read the books, but I don't really know why Elfangor's being portrayed as a cold utilitarian. In canon he would never have destroyed Earth just to slow down the Yeerks, especially considering that he used to live there, and I'm not sure why you made that change. Even his speech style is different, more stiff, formal, and harsh than in canon. He dies at the very beginning of his story, so it's important that within that time the reader comes to like him so that his death has maximum emotional impact and so that the mission he gives to the kids has a personal loyalty component. It's also rather important to Ax's character. Aside from that, I really liked this chapter and am looking forward to the rest. Everyone else's voices seem spot on so far and I've always wanted to read a rational Animorphs story.
