Even if he was going to do something like that, he could have just used a quantum virus like they did with the Hork-Bajir. It would have at least left some humans alive while killing enough so that the Yeerks wouldn't have enough humans to work with, so causing an extinction wouldn't have been necessary. In any case, I'm not so much bothered by the morality of the situation as by the radical, perhaps unnecessary, changes to Elfangor's personality. He wasn't a utilitarian in the books IIRC. He was appalled by how one of the other Andalites nearly wiped out the Hork-Bajir.
