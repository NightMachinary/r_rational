Loving this so far. I thought about writing rational Animorphs for a bit, realized the task of optimizing everything was a herculean task and utterly beyond me, and gave up. I'm looking forward to hopefully seeing the idea done justice, and, from someone who spent hours trying to work out exactly how everything would play out... good luck.
