My comment had nothing to do with animal rights.

In canon, Cassie acted based on her feelings and assumptions about what was true. She got very angry at anyone who wanted to run the war like a war. She didn't discuss things, she just did whatever she wanted to / felt was right. She got them in trouble all the time because she wanted to act "morally". She got infected by a Yeerk and then let it go, hoping it would keep its word. She eventually gave Yeerks the morphing power, which could have gone ridiculously wrong, mainly because she felt bad about having to kill some of them. These decisions worked out in the end but not due to a secret master plan, just due to luck and author fiat.

In chapter 3 of this FF, Cassie says she's not going to do anything just because the others tell her to. This independence and sense of morality can be a strength. But in a war for the survival of the species, it can also be a liability. There are ways that the author might steelman Cassie, and make her moral demands advantageous for the group. But IMO most of them would involve contrived situations and would sacrifice realism. That said, I'd love to see rational!Cassie pulled off successfully without any author cheating.

Maybe Cassie could manage the psychological health of the group, and think about ideas long-term (perhaps "after the war" goals could be established, in the very long term). Cassie could be more aligned with the Ellimist's way of thinking than a traditional rationalist's, perhaps. In this story, it looks like Jake handles short term tactics and group coordination, as the brain of the team. Maybe Cassie keeps them from going insane, as the team's heart and soul.

But for this to happen, she'll need to develop more realistic ethics. I'd suggest the author gradually play up the "animal assistant" angle - farmers can be ruthless when it's for the greater good of their family farm, veterinarians put down pets in pain when there's nothing else they can do to help. I'd also suggest Cassie get some vaguely Red Tribe steelmanned values, to complement this characterization. This conflicts with her characterization thus far though, because she was the first person to think about the rest of the galaxy when Elfangor mentioned it to them. Perhaps a segment showing how different alien values REALLY are from human ones would allow her to change direction on this, though.

Otherwise, perhaps Cassie could be the group's liason to other alien groups, such as the Chee. The Chee seem rather likely to appreciate her pacifistic ethics, even if no one else does. Although the Chee's programming has its own severe problems, in a more rational setting. For one, it's slightly surprising they didn't AI Foom, or that their restrictions didn't somehow backfire.
