Reminded me a bit of the later parts of [[http://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure]] for spoilery reasons, and Vernor Vinge's Zones of Thought universe (where technological progress is more or less limited depending on where you are in the galaxy). I liked it, though it was one of those things that I might have liked better at novella length (although there are always risks that an unlikable protagonist can't carry a longer work).
