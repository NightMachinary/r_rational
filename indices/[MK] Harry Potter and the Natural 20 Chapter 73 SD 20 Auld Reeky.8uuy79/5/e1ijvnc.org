Is there a good synopsis of the preceding events anywhere? It's been a few years since I last read this and am foggy on the details -- what I remember last involved a muggle detective trying to unveil the wizarding world and repeatedly getting her memories deleted/altered*. Can anyone point out where that arc took place, and maybe link a good summary of what happened prior?

*(which, as an aside, forcefully robbing someone of such a core component of their identity seems as much if not more a violation of agency and self than mere torture or mind-control, though of course continuous variation in each doesn't match up 1-to-1, i.e. I'd rather forget the last year than be tortured or mind-controlled for a year, but I'd rather stub my toe or be made to do 10 minutes of unpleasant chores than have a day of memories removed or replaced. It not being an unforgivable curse is an affront to my sensibilities. I can imagine cases where it might be justified as a lesser evil, as well as therapeutic uses, but still feel its application should be restricted in the same way state-sanctioned killing, e.g. in an active shooter context, or the administration of chemotherapy drugs are restricted).
