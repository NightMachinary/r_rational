Thank you for a new chapter! I'm really enjoying the additional chapters - chapter 1 seemed very haphazardly produced compared with these, which tell a story, have some great development, and don't waste time. Can't wait to see how it ends! Thank you.

I thought chapter 1 was very good so it's a compliment for chapters 2-4 rather than casting aspersions on chapter 1.
