You know, when I had finished the oneshot and tried to figure out who the main antagonist of the story should be, I wasn't sure Rafiki was really impressive enough to fit the bill. But the more I think about it: He's a mystical kung-fu battle wizard who uses obfuscating eccentricity to hide his true power. He's basically a Naruto villain!

(Does anyone else see the potential for an /amazing/ crossover with NTBS???)

Also, regarding Simba's vision: In Hamlet, I can't help but notice that the ghost tells the MC useful information such as "by the way your uncle totes killed me, you should fight him". Does Mufasa do this in canon? Nope. In fact, Mufasa only tells Simba exactly what he expects to hear - that he's shirking responsibility and that he should feel guilty about that. Realizing this played a big part for me in deciding how exactly I wanted the spirits and their powers to play out in this story.
