I like my personal, very very vague creation story:

#+begin_quote
  In the beginning, there was nothing. And, it would have been rather boring, except that there was no concept of rather boring. So it would have been just kind of nice, if there was a just kind of nice. And this was the state of not-things for an infinite amount of not-time. And then something happened, because, after an eternity of nothing, something was bound to happen eventually. And the only thing that could happen at that point was everything, and so everything did.
