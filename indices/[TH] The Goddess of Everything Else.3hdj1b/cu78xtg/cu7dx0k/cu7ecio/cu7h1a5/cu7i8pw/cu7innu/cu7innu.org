The meaning of intelligence used in the orthogonality thesis is instrumental rationality, or the ability to choose and implement the actions that best accomplish your goals.

EDIT: Your intuitions of what goals and intelligence levels are compatible probably comes from the fact that you, like all humans, have certain instinctual ways of modeling other intelligent agents, but those methods are optimized for humans and contain certain assumptions of humanlike psychology. Of course certain (intelligence level, goal) pairs are incompatible in people, but that doesn't mean anything about all intelligent entities, just about people. Your system 1 processes on this matter are not trustworthy, because they were optimized for predicting humans and animals, a certain subcategory of intelligences, not intelligences in general. Humans mostly have certain similarities, certain shared values.
