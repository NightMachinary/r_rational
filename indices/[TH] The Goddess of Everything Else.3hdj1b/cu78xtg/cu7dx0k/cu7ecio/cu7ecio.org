His fundamental message is, "ignore Gnon at your own peril". Myopic thinking is just one of the weaknesses of such a system - good luck optimizing the universe to reject evolution in favour of omnihedonism, without a single Darwinian creature surviving to abuse it - your optimizer is probably just as likely to become one in the process. That takes the idea of ignoring Gnon to a whole new level. And remember, it only takes one Darwinian to reduce omnihedonism back down to a murder-eat-fuck rat race. It's just not a stable position in any way.
