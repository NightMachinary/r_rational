I'm not sure. What does bother me about its proponents, though, is the binary assumption that you either believe the thesis or its stated opposite. The thesis doesn't make sense to me on its face, but only because there is a class of (intelligence level, goal) pairs that seems utterly incompatible with any meaningful definition of intelligence - ie, the "superintelligent" paperclip maximizer. This is not a claim that all superintelligences' goals should naturally converge.
