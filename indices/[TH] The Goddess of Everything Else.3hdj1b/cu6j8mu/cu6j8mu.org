I feel like the Goddesses could really use a sit down to try and talk this whole thing out, actually communicate instead of dragging their toys into a proxy war on their behalf. Why is EE playing with Cancer's toys? Can they share ownership? What do they do when the toys get tired or break or refuse to be played with anymore? Aren't they too old for these toys? Are they too young? Who are you? Where am I? Do you know where the restroom is?
