This is a very interesting take. I like how Scott manages to start with humans being created by the evil deity (a traditional no-go trope in myth) and still ends with an optimistic story.

The funniest thing about this is by far the first few comments, which ... really seem like they're sucking up.

  I thought my sense of awe had died sometime back. Simply beautiful.
