Skilled mages can make perfect lenses of nigh-arbitrary size and arbitrarily sharp edges on blades. You can make things inside of things so the outer things have no seams.

Surgery and optics are now easy.

You can get a heat "laser" from the optics. Your lathes are arbitrarily sharp so require less energy than normal.

Steam engines are trivial, so you have railroads.

Microphones are easy.

You can make arbitrarily small things, like circuit boards. That will require additional knowledge of course.

Hm. Magnets, maybe? If you produce iron slowly, inside an existing but weak magnetic field, I think all the magnetic domains would align, giving you a stronger magnet. Jumpstart the process with a natural chunk of magnetite and you're good to go. With strong magnets available, electrical generation becomes easy.
