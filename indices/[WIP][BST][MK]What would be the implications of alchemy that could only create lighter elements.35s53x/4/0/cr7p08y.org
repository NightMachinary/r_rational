  Note that life basically seems to follow the rule of "if it can possibly be used, it is used", in the real world.

This really is the main problem. I have lots of ideas, but a city of millions would have many times more. The people in this thread have already given me several great ideas that my characters would have thought of but which I the author had not.

I like Zeppelins, but while my world will include them it will mostly be as a historical curiosity. From the invention of them until the end of high-tech there is a world war, and shooting down zeppelins is much easier than would allow them to be practical.

Rockets, however, will be present and dialed up to 11. I've been internally thinking of the genre of my world as High Fantasy/Diesel punk.

For most of my history magic is extremely restricted, because once you know how to use it you kinda walk around with flame throwers and rocket launchers for the rest of your life. In Evil Capitol everyone could use magic and it was used all the time everywhere, but this is not the norm. Using magic is more tiring than jogging (depending on how much you use), so while you have great incentives to train your magic muscles, you can't keep it going all day. Most non-human creatures don't use it, but some do. Magical genetic engineering also creates a few monstrosities that use magic a lot. By the time of the actual books (300 years after the technological high point), one and a half continent are uninhabitable due to magical creatures that don't play nice, and the oceans are home to basically midgard serpents.

  Can you, say, target, all the mercury in a person, but nothing else, and clear out their heavy metal poisoning?
#+end_quote

You /can/, but you have to be exceptionally good at it. Excellent healers do exist, and this is how they would get rid of most poisons, but it's not easy. Poison is still a concern for the rich and powerful.

  Can you do this with only the, say, carbon in a cyanide molecule?
#+end_quote

Yes. This breaks up the molecule just like the decaying of a Carbon-14 atom would in real life.
