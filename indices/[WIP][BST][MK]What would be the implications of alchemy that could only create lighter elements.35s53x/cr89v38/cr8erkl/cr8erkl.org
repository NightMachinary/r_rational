  Can you partially convert materials to make alloys?

Reading up on what an alloy actually /is/, the answer is yes, but only as solid solutions. You can't make them chemically bonded during the alchemical process. This is interesting, and I'll have to read up on useful alloys and determine which would be candidates for this. Thanks!

Control varies with skill, but among the best and on a small scale, yes, you could smooth out or sculpt surfaces better than with any tools their non-,magical technology would allow. On an industrial scale, no. To do a lot of work many magician have to work together, which decreases precision.
