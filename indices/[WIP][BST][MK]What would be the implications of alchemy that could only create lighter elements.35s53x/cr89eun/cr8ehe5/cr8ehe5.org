Yep. Barium is high on the list, and will be used as raw material for much. I didn't know about silver's antibiotic properties, but I've read up on it now, and it's definitely interesting. The characters will find some texts that have survived, and something about silver used in medicine could make for a good opportunity to introduce alchemy to the reader. Thanks!
