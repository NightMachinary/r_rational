tldr: ceiling, walls.

There are no stars in the conventional sense, and atoms were made by my version of gods. The 'planet' is flat on top, (But with mountains, oceans, etc) and extends in a half sphere down to where the "Soul of Creation" is. Which is basically the sun. The energy pouring out of the SoC does keep the planet's innards hot akin to Earth's, but most of the heat and magic is swept away by a magical storm of soul destroying black fire which functions as the walls of reality. The storm flows along the world from below, and then breaks through where the world ends. Where there are oceans. So the oceans flow over the edge and are carried up by the extreme, world-surrounding storm, and are lifted high into the sky. Most of the water is expelled within a kilometer or twenty from the edge, where it falls in an enormous, never ceasing, very deadly, almost boiling waterfall. Most of the water that flows into the storm falls close to the edge and is among the water that flows over the edge again, but some is carried away back into the world as clouds, so surrounding water /is/ pulled toward the edge. The edge of the world is not a safe place, and there is nothing that lives close to it for long. The extreme forces involved crush any normal creatures that come too close, and anything that actually reaches the storm is subjected to the soul destroying black fire. Though it's possible to fly close and study it, if you can keep the flight going and avoid the falling water. Sailors that go close enough to get caught in the pull don't survive.

The storm continues upwards and converges in a slightly egg shaped form. All the energy from the Soul of Creation that remains after travelling to the top of the world is destroyed, creating light and magic. This is visible, and looks like the sun does from Earth, though it is smaller and closer and not made of gas but of burning soul stuff. The point where the storm converges changes in a 24 hour cycle, which looks like day and night does on Earth. The interior of the planet also receives a lot more heat during the night. From above the planet looks like a flat circle, but the 'equator' if you will is considerably to the south of the middle, as a result of the sun never passing through the Soul of Creation but some distance away from it.

The Soul of Creation itself is a portal to the place where souls come from and where they go upon death. It's also where the gods came from, although at this point they are all dead. If you somehow survived the trip you could travel to other worlds from there, but there are easier ways and while my universe does have multiple worlds, there are only as many of them as the gods created, and almost all of them were destroyed or left lifeless before my book begins. A few remain, but are not important to the story other than as history. There are not infinite worlds or parallel realities.

The 'moon' is one of these limited worlds, sort of. It was made by one of the gods, who designed it to withstand the soul destroying fire of the storm, and set it drifting. From inside the world it looks like our moon does, though without craters and with long, enormous lines instead, carved by the wind of the storm over millennia.

The year is 365 days long, divided into 13 lunar months. Every new year's is a new moon and every midsummer is a full moon. So that's 12 months with 28 days and one in the middle with 29, to make the moon and sun synch up perfectly.

Gravity pulls towards the soul of creation, ie down, but only from within the world. Think of it like magnetism. The force pulls into the SoC from above, but then throws things out into the storm, away from it in every direction. Or imagine an egg. At the top of the egg, gravity pulls down. Near the bottom, gravity folds out like the shell of the egg. Because magic.

My characters are never going to traverse the storm itself, but they are going to weaponize it towards the end, because what could possibly go wrong.
