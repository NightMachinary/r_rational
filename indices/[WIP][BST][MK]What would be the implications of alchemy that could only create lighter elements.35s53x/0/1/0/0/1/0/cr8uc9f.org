  Do you have plans for where the heat goes?

I should have included that in my comment above, sorry. Your suggestion is interesting, and I'll see if I can do anything with it, but the main mechanism that keeps the world from overheating is that same storm of black fire. The incoming energy is all from the SoC, which is carried by the storm, some of it transferring to the water that is swept up (which is what causes it to boil), some of it reaching the top and becoming the 'sun' phenomenon, and some of it being consumed by the black fire. But while energy is added to the mantle, the boiling water and the sun, the rest of the sky bordering the storm is cooled by the black fire, which destroys energy. Magic can break thermodynamics left and right in my world, and while the black fire is not capable of containing all the energy spat out by the SoC, it does in total consume about as much, keeping the world relatively stable. Remember, the shape of the 'planet' may be a half sphere, but the shape of the storm is more egglike, so there is a lot of atmosphere bordering on the storm.

Souls pulling energy with them could be really interesting, however, and I will think about it. Would give a whole new meaning to 'cold as death', and also give a morbid utility to killing people for cold when you need a sudden temperature drop. Plus, battlefields would be full of deadly cold as well as the firestorms I've planned. An interesting idea for sure, and I'll think about if it works. Thank you!
