You mentioned that it is easier to convert heavy elements into slightly less heavy elements than than converting them into moderately less heavy elements. Does that mean that the elements aren't actually split apart? As in, if you convert Iron into Titanium you only get Titanium with no byproduct of Bervilium or smaller?

If that is the case then do converted materials actually become lighter, thus effectively destroying matter in a closed system with just some amount of light and heat as a byproduct? Or do 100g Iron somehow convert into 100g Titanium?
