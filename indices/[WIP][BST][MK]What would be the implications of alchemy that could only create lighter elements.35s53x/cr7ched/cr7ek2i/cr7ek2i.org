It becomes lighter, and the energy is released as light and magic. You'd get less than 100g of titanium, and the mass of the world would decrease. Second law of thermodynamics does not apply, however, and energy can also be created, though not in a way that any of the characters will be in a position to munchkin.

My original idea was to have the conversion only produce slightly lighter materials, but thinking on it more closely, I realize it should be permissable to split the atom into more than one smaller piece, as with normal fission. What would normally come out as subatomic particles, however, just comes out as photons and magic.
