Yes. This is because I don't want atom bombs of any kind to be a thing. That's the only reason fission creates magic. Magic is also very energy dense for the same reason, so you don't get much extra magic out of it. There is some heat produced, and you can definitely weaponize it. It just doesn't blow up cities.
