You can travel to the moon, but not with a rocket (Because of the storm). You have to go through the deadlands and survive the killthings and find the hole in reality in the Persian lava ruins. So... portal. Thingie. Not that anyone on team Good knows that that's the moon. It's just the horrible nightmarescape with all the soul destroying black fire to them.

It's land locked, and you could only stand on the side furthest from the SoC.
