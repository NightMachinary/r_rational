Interesting world design, but it raises one question for me: where does all that heat go? In other words, why is the world not an oven?

We have a world that is heated from above by a sun, below by this SoC thing and surrounded on all sides by a rain of boiling water. Using magic creates more heat. So far there are only heat inputs with nothing to pull the energy back out. Do you have plans for where the heat goes?

One idea I had was that when a living being dies its soul pulls all of the heat energy out of the body it is inhabiting. This heat energy then is freed when the soul goes through the SoC, powering the soul destroying black fire. This would provide a sort of control loop to keep the world from overheating. I'm entirely sure what this would do to the climate as that depends on how much of the heat is delivered via the sun vs through the ground and walls. If the majority of the heat comes from the sun, you would end up with a world that is relatively temperate in the center and fairly tropical near the edges.

Of course that doesn't do anything about the heat created through magic. One possibility is that the energy released by the SoC actually pushes the world away from it. As more of the heat that had been released through magic returns to the SoC, the force of the energy pushes the world farther away. This additional distance could be roughly balanced so that the heat energy added matches the energy flux through the additional transit volume. That is to say that since they're farther apart there is more energy in flight between them and the extra energy in flight needed for that farther distance matches the heat released through magic, so the world's heat balance is unchanged. I don't think this would be perfectly stable, so magic use may eventually lead to or hasten the end of the world.

Interestingly this heat model would mean that gravity and temperature of the world would fluctuate for a few years after large massacres or large releases of magic. With much death the world becomes colder and the SoC pushes it farther away (higher gravity) with more energy. The energy warms the world up leading to a time of plenty (normal gravity) so the natural death rate declines. The decline in death reduces the energy from the SoC so the world falls back down (lower gravity). Lower energy causes famine, increasing the death rate, etc. These oscillations will continue, but should eventually dampen out so that the world reaches equilibrium again.
