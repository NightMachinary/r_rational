Thank you. This is a great list. Chemical warfare is already in, and the pressurized chlorine bombs make for a great addition.

  Can it be used for element-specific purification? Two possible applications I can see are turning salt water into hydrochloric acid (by removing the sodium), and reusing magnesium as a light source (by removing the oxygen from the ash and leaving the metal behind).

Yes, though it's harder and more demanding than converting pure elements. Recycling ash by cracking the oxygen sounds like a good idea.

Would high quality alloys lead to many things not succumbing to rust over the course of 300 years? Not everything will be rust proof, of course, but I have some difficulty figuring out whether anything at all would last that long, and if so what kinds of metals would last.
