During the low-tech times an apprentice mage would not learn any kind of physics beyond "Burn the air to make fire/heat." During the prime time of Evil Capitol they'd have the periodic table up to Uranium, but as there are no protons, atoms can't be modeled beyond being little nuggets of magic and energy. More for heavier elements and less for lighter ones.

  Just to double check, can I turn a large, heterogeneous volume into a homogeneous element?

Industrially, yes. As a single magician, only if you are very good at it, as well as have lots of time. A hundred magicians working together can work at more than a hundred times the speed, but precision is lost.
