Thanks!

As for ratios, think of it as forcing fission, just without any subatomic particles. You change each atom independently, although you do so with many atoms at a time. Mass decreases, total energy decreases (Magic can break thermodynamics in both directions, the creating bit just isn't munchkinable).

You can't control the structure you get. As in reality, when an atom in a molecule splits, the molecule is almost definitely toast. Though the atom might still be stuck inside an otherwise unbroken crystal.

  What natural resources are important because of the structure of the elements, rather than the elements themselves? Diamonds are still rare, while gold and silver aren't

Good point, and one which I should have mentioned. In my world they don't have the technology to make diamonds, so diamonds are valuable. Though they don't have the artificial scarcity thing going for them, so valuable but not as much as in reality.

A lone mage couldn't make enough water that way, but he could survive by pulling water vapour out of the air with unrelated magic. In a factory setting, similar strategies could definitely work, however.

Thanks for the charts!
