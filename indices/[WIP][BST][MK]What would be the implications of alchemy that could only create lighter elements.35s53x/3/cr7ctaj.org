What's the ratio between the reactants and the products? Is that ratio by mass, volume, number of molecules, or something else? Is there a even a common ratio?

I'm also assuming you can't control the structure of the element you get (Can't turn a ring into diamonds by transforming the iron into carbon. But then, do you keep the old atomic structure or something random? What happens if you turn the all carbon in Benzene into more hydrogen?)

Supposing I could make enough of anything...

What natural resources are important because of the structure of the elements, rather than the elements themselves? Diamonds are still rare, while gold and silver aren't (Although, given their "Height" on the table of elements, they may still have industrial value)

It should be an easy trick in a desert for a mage with two bottles to turn some sand into oxygen, then turn some air into hydrogen, then combine to make water. Anything else that requires pure elements but otherwise has simple reactions should also work.
