It occurs to me that if you converted something slowly enough (and the right thing to the right thing), you could get it to keep the shape, as the new atoms crystalize into the old one.

I think this would also work if you convert it fast (and purely) enough - look up carbon vapor deposition - although it converts into crystals of the new material.
