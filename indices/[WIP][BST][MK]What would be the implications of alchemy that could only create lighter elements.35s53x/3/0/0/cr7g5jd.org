I'm having a little trouble modeling this without protons. Can you tell me what an apprentice mage would learn in the theoretical-physics equivalent?

Just to double check, can I turn a large, heterogeneous volume into a homogeneous element?

Industrial application: Energy/Electricity is cheap because you can burn coal, take a waste gas, get energy from gradually reducing it to hydrogen, then burn the hydrogen gas.

I don't know a ton about the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process][Haber Process]], but it seems like it would be easier to do with pure Hydrogen and Nitrogen.
