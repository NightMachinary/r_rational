  Would high quality alloys lead to many things not succumbing to rust over the course of 300 years?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure what would rust away and what would stay. As a reasonable benchmark, a copper roof has a lifespan of about 100 years (presumably without leaking). Good quality stainless steel is both more corrosion resistant and stronger, so I could see it lasting 300+ years in the weather. I /think/ that titanium is better than stainless steel, but I'm not sure. Aluminum is somewhere in the middle, possibly just having surface oxidation after that time.

EDIT: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation_%28chemistry%29][Passivation]] is something worth looking at. It seems like good alloys/metals could last practically forever out in the open.
