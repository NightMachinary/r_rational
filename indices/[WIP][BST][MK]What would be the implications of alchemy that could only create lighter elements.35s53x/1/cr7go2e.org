Simple list of possible/cheap things:

- Aluminum everything. It's a pretty great metal that can replace wood, stone, plastic, and porcelain in many cases. Fissioning it from silicon in the dirt makes for an endless supply.

- Titanium everything. Iron is harder to get than dirt, but titanium's advantages over aluminum make it worthwhile.

- Rare metals that are good for alloying things. Beryllium, vanadium, and all the rest of the good ones make high quality alloys much cheaper and easier.

- Alkali metals. Throw flaming chunks of sodium at your enemies! (Phosphorus can do a similar job)

- Fluorine. It's really nasty.

- Probably not relevant yet, but tungsten is much more common than the rare earth metals.

  Fine control during the conversion can allow you to change only part of an 'object', but you aren't going to get a 100% conversion rate, so usually you want to be able to separate the product from any waster or unconverted material at the end of the conversion.

Can it be used for element-specific purification? Two possible applications I can see are turning salt water into hydrochloric acid (by removing the sodium), and reusing magnesium as a light source (by removing the oxygen from the ash and leaving the metal behind).

  You could convert something that is inside something else, however, if you don't mind a little impurity and a lot of extra effort.

Can it make extremely pressurized gasses? Iron would convert atom-by-atom to a gas at about 3000 atmospheres of pressure if I ran the numbers right. Simply get a cannonball and change the middle of it into chlorine for an amazingly effective chemical weapon.
