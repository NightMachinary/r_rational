Spontaneous gaseous pressure, as you sublime things with an energy release. Carbon -> Helium, boom - just because the helium is less dense than the carbon. Hell, just go to Oxygen and let it react with /itself/...

ZEPPELINS. Because you have ungodly amounts of hydrogen and helium.

+Rocket+ fire EVERYTHING. Because you can make all the hydrogen and oxygen you need, exactly when you need it.

Gah, the weaponization... What's it take to actually do this?

Oh! And medicine. Can you, say, target, all the mercury in a person, but nothing else, and clear out their heavy metal poisoning? Can you do this with only the, say, carbon in a cyanide molecule?

In general - How much does life use Magic in it's every-day processes? Do only people do it (that would be weird) or do, say, bacteria, also make use of magic?

Note that life basically seems to follow the rule of "if it can possibly be used, it is used", in the real world.
