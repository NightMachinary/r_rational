At the cost of a small amount of amnesia and a messed up circadian rhythm, you can negate most physical risks/harms (other than very quick death).

Examples:

- Rest and eat well, then make seven copies of yourself. Run flat-out for an hour, switch to copy two, run for another hour, switch to copy three, etc. When you switch to copy seven, remove the amulet, make seven new copies, and repeat.

- Do the same thing before a battle, so you don't get tired or (non-fatally) injured in the middle of a fight.

- Also, before something risky but planned, like surgery or disarming a bomb.
