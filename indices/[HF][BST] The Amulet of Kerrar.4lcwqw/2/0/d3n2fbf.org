It's interesting to me that so many people are suggesting short-term uses for the amulet, rather than long-term uses like life extension. Sure, it's a form of life extension with a lot of downsides, but ...

Let's say that you were 90 years old and in failing health. A genie comes to you and says that he can make you thirty years old again, /but/ he's also going to remove all of your memories from the past sixty years. You will have ample time to write out instructions to yourself, to set your affairs in order, to warn your friends and family that you're taking this step, etc.

That seems like a great deal to me. But it's even better than that, because at 30 you can prepare for the moment that you're 90. On top of that, you're not actually losing your self, you're being stored. Your new 30-year-old self can bring you out for visits with friends and family, or to take part in celebrations, or to see some new events.

I mean, obviously I post to see what other people think, but the difference in mindset is intriguing.
