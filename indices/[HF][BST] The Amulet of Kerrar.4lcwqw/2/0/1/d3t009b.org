It's not life extension when you can't transfer any experiences between copies. At best it's a shitty form of forward-only time travel like going into a cryogen tank.

If I were 90 and ill, I probably woundn't take the genie's deal because me at age 30 isn't me-now and me-now essentially has to choose to die to bring me-at-age-30 back to life. Fuck that.

The reason people don't feel like they die when they go to sleep every night is that memory provides continuity. If you take that away, it no longer feels like the same self.
