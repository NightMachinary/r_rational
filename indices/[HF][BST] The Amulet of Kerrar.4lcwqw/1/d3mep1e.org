Can other people activate the gems?

If so, what happens when you die? Can other people bring you back to life?

The biggest problem I can see is the complete discontinuity of self when swapping an old copy back in... You swap your accountant back in and he has to take in the scene and understand exactly what's going on, and not immediately continue thinking about making a backup, which is presumably what he was thinking about when he made the backup... I feel like this would be disorienting at a minimum every time.
