Useful if there's other mind-altering magic you need to be protected from. Create throwaway instances of yourself to absorb memetic weapons or mind-wipes, then remove the amulet to destroy them.

Protect yourself against boredom, as done in [[https://www.ida.liu.se/%7Etompe44/lsff-book/Vernor%20Vinge%20-%20The%20Cookie%20Monster.htm][The Cookie Monster]] (posted a few days ago on this subreddit). Keep that first-day enthusiasm going all week!

Since other people can see the amulet and watch you use it, you can commit to mind-wipe yourself as part of a negotiation. For example, a freelance spy offers to sell you blackmail material on your enemies, but you're not sure if the information will be worth the price he's asking. Put the amulet on and press SAVE STATE 1, he tells you the secret. If you think the secret is worth remembering, pay him the price he asked for. If not, press LOAD STATE 1 and remove the amulet so he knows you've forgotten it.

Otherwise, it doesn't seem that powerful. It doesn't affect your body or your carried items, and the amulet needs to be on your person at all times to work, so it's mostly useful as a sort of self-mindwipe. In most situations, forgetting some things will be strictly worse than just remembering everything. I think its main application is that you can forget something in a way that's provable and visible to other people.
