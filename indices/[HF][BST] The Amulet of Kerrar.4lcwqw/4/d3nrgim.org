Copy of the wearer's mind and body eh? And when it's removed it's gone. Which means you can't copy over someone else.

...But that restriction is clearly arbitrary rather than fundamental.

Imagine for a moment, that the society in which this amulet existed also had brain transplants. You could save, swap brains, load, and have two of you. I suppose it depends, to a degree, how the amulet defines being 'taken off'. Best case scenario, maybe you can copy yourself with only some minor flaying. Worst case, it recognizes 'being worn' by whether or not it's indirectly connected to your brain, (and therefore can't be used to duplicate you after all... well you could do a brain transplant piece by piece maybe...)

Speaking of which, copies don't include items worn or held? What about items sewn into my flesh? Surely, there has to be some exploitable definition of 'body' here that can somehow be added to. And besides, even if we can't add anything to me... we can still dupe anything I already have. Spare livers, kidneys, and hearts for everyone!

This amulet also becomes exponentially more useful the more medical tech your society has. With advanced enough medical infrastructure, you can make yourself into Ben 10.. er 7. (a few extra arms for one clone... a stinger for the next...). Or with our lousy tech you could still make one of your copies an inhumanly strong steroid abuser I guess.
