Seems rather useless except for dealing with info-hazards or doing things and not remembering that you have done. As written all the jewels contain the wearer, so all you get is a chance to divide your timeline, but no extension of your capabilities. It's reversible amnesia with the opportunity cost of forgetting another segment.
