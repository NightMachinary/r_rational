If you're worried about the brainstorming rule, try the monday and Wednesday threads!

My thought would be on the whole constant access to myself when I'm at my top motivational levels, to identify when I'm working hard and save myself in that state and then keep bringimg that version of me back.

The only thing i would worry about with the amulet is, do i lose all the expertise of my copies or is there a way to merge then all into myself?
