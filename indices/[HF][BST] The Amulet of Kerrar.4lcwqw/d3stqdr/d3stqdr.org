IMO this seems pretty useless. The copies can sorta communicate by writing something and then switching but it's really inefficient and lossy. Since time is only ever passing for one copy you're not gaining parallel learning speed increases--you don't even gain the ability to work 24/7 because copies don't sleep in the gems.

As you mentioned, to a small extent you could break up short term learning tasks into domains and then switch when you need a skill, but you might as well just learn normally. If you had a bunch of clones all rested up and ready ahead of time, you could cram for a test by bringing out a clone to spend several hours learning each section of material then switch during the test. But if you're planning ahead this far, it'd be easier to just have the one 'you' learn all the things the old fashioned way--especially considering that you'll likely need to know the material anyway eventually for a test down the road.

Worse there are a lot of downsides. Any human interaction would need to be done by a 'primary' copy to remember and develop relationships properly. Spend 20 years mastering say painting, and then store painter-you in a gem? No. The problem is that it's still 20 years later and when young-copy wakes up he has lost his connection to his generation and culture while gaining no skills. This gets worse for each successive copy.
