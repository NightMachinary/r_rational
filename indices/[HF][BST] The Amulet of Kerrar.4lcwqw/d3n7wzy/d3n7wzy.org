So basically, if any span of time since your last backup didn't meaningfully improve your mental or physical status, you can trade it in for getting that bit of life expectancy back...

Revive: Create a backup before doing anything dangerous. If you die, you can be rebooted from the last backup as long as the corpse still wears the amulet.

Loop mode: Prepare to do a repetitive task. Copy yourself. Do the task. Boot the copy. Do the task again. Boot the copy. Do the task again. You can now do any repetitive task without aging or running out of willpower. Subjectively it will feel as if you have only done the task once. No fatigue or need to sleep or anything, so you can get tremendous amounts of work done this way. You can also fast forward boring moments. Of course this requires you being comfortable with amnesia.

Phoenix: There's always a younger version of you around to "rise from the ashes" when the old version dies "die". So you're kind of an immortal amnesiac.

Break conservation laws: For example, create a fat version. You now have infinite fuel and food that you can repeatedly generate from your own body. Plus if you're ever trapped in an enclosed space you can escape by going to fat mode. And if you've got some engineers handy to take advantage of the moment of change it's a short hop skip and jump to extreme amounts of energy gained with each transformation.

Travel sized: Chop off all but your most vital organs to make an extremely lightweight version of yourself. Depending on how the amulet works you could use just your head, neck, and shoulders, if you don't necessarily need to be alive to be reboot.

Perfect Recall: You can use a backup to "memorize" things, in the short run.

Sex God: The stamina of 7 people, regarding anything physical.

Instant sobriety: If you get to drunk to walk or drive home, you make a sober version of yourself do it. I suppose also this is nice in combat and stuff.
