Do you actually have a story idea in mind, or are you just throwing things around in the universe at random? From the questions you ask it sounds like you might not have any idea what you will do or want to achieve with this story. If that's so, I don't think you should write this.

Are you wanting to write a story about a young heroine who teaches herself how to use magic and reaches such a level of competency that she defeats all the evil magic users? If so, what is the twist that will get people interested? Are you wanting to write a story about a young noble who uses her influence to reform a corrupt government? Do you like to think about military battles and political intrigue normally? If not, why are you writing a story that will probably involve them?

Over and over again in your post, you mention that the movie already achieved X, so you need not cover it again. What is it that you /are/ planning on doing that was not done in the movie? Is this mostly a worldbuilding exercise for you? You want to repair minor plot holes, make the movies more realistic, that sort of thing?
