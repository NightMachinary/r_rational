  and the protagonist almost always says "Never!" even when it would make perfect sense to agree.

Worth noting that it would makes sense /regardless of your actual intentions/.

Want to rule the empire? Agree, work with the current person in power, succeed them.

Want to take down the empire? Agree, let them drop their guard a bit, assassinate them (it's easier than a straight out lightsaber duel).

An exception to this might be if you have to take on some dark force to agree (normally some metaphor for anger or occasionally drugs), thereby risking that their goals will be changed (join me, but you have to let the dark side take over, which will make it so that you don't want to take down the empire).
