You can keep Luke around as a foil, while underplaying his role. Maybe he wasn't actually that much of a hero, his success was due to other people propping him up. The attack in the Death Star's trench was a diversionary tactic, it was actually sabotaged... but he gets credit to protect an important source.

You could borrow L. Neil Smith's "Libertarian Lando".
