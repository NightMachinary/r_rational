That would be Bayseian evidence that in an actual universe with physics like that of Star Wars, someone showing the abilities that Jar Jar does is a jedi.

Star Wars is fiction, and therefore can contain errors and inconsistencies. Claiming that Jar Jar is a Jedi on these grounds is like watching Dr. Who and claiming that the Doctor must be a psychic who believes nonsense about science but unconsciously influences the universe to make the nonsense science work anyway.
