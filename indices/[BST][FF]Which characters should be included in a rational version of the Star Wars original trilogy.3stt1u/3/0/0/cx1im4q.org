Well I have never seen Dr Who. Most fictional series contain inconsistensies, which most of the time can be sucessfully handwaved via technobabble, eg. in-universe coherent explanations. I assume this must be the case for Dr Who as well.

In the case of star wars its the force; in the case of Dr Who its Galleyfreyan(?) technology.

To use an accepted in-universe explanation for "weird" stuffs that are out-universe caused by bad writing is fundamentally different from introducing a different, non-accepted in-universe explanation to explain the bad writing.
