  The Emperor - The Emperor in the Original three movies isn't really a character, more a plot device and symbol. He mostly represents the dark side and almost all of his dialogue lines could be transferred into internal monologue in a written story. So I tend towards cutting him and just having the Empire ruled by the top strata of the military. Is there anything he would add that I'm missing?

This depends on how much of the expanded universe you are using. If the emperor is someone who routinely moves into his owned cloned bodies as he dies, and electrocutes himself to do so if the body is getting too old, (I think this was the dark horse comics but I never really got to read them) then you might be leaving out an opportunity to have a MPMOR Quirrell level nemesis.
