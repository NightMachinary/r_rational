If you can find it, I recommend a copy of "The Rebel Alliance Sourcebook", published by West End Games. (Depending on your local jurisdiction's copyright laws, you may be able to find a torrent containing it.) It covers a lot of detail about why the Rebellion did the things we saw it do in the movies, and what it did off-screen. For example, a significant part of their overall strategy is to cause so many problems as to draw the Emperor away from Coruscant to deal with at least one of them, giving them a shot at taking him out and ending the Empire once and for all, to head off decades of civil war.
