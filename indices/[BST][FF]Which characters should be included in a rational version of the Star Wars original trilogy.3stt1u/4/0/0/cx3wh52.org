Thanks for the detail. I think Han seems potentially useful for discussing logistical issues about supplies and statecraft issues like crime, and Luke could be turned into some kind of gear-head like his father Anakin once was, if you want to deal with technology at all. In /The Phantom Tollbooth/ there's this dichotomy between two characters that represent rationality, named Rhyme and Reason, one likes quantitative thinking and the other likes qualitative thinking, and maybe a similar kind of difference could exist between the twins. Leia is interested in heuristics, patterns, and the Force, while Luke is more rule oriented.
