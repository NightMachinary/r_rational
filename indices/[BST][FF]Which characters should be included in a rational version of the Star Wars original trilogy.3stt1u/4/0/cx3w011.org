I guess the reason that it looks like I'm throwing around ideas at random is that this post is about characters with who I'm not sure if they have a place in the story. (I should probably have given a little more exposition about the general gist of the story.)

The main conflict is pretty clear to me by now. Leia wants to topple a dictatorship, Tarkin wants to keep it in power. Both have their ideological reasons for it (grounded in interstellar political theory) and employ different and changing long term strategies. (This is one of the things that the movies don't do: They focus on battles, not on the war.)

The other main part of the plot is about her investigating the Jedi religion and its claims. Because Obi-Wan claims there are powers and insights in it that could be vital for her cause. Also, Force believers who are not really Force users will get quite important later on.

(The primary thing I want to achieve is using Star Wars as a framing device to discuss some of the research and theories on politics, religion, and, to a lesser degree, psychology. While also taking the plot down a different path.)

The things the movies have already achieved are Luke's hero's journey and Han's character development. I don't see a point in redoing them, so the plot of my story will diverge significantly from more or less the third minute of A New Hope.
