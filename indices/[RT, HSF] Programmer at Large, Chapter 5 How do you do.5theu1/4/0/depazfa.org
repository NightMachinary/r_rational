Thanks!

I've been [[http://www.drmaciver.com/2017/03/looking-into-starting-a-phd/][a little distracted]] this past week or two, so tomorrow's chapter is currently completely unwritten. I know what will happen, so I'll probably write it this afternoon, but it may be a little on the short side...

Update: It's actually ended up a little on the long side because I couldn't wrap up the beginning of the chapter as quickly as I'd intended. Chapter will be up in the morning as per usual.
