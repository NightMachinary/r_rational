Not a big fan, but some people really like it. During the beggining in directly uses dialogue from hpmor. The main character had read hpmor you see.

Hits its stride a ways in. It gets better.

It's a shared universe fic. The concept is that a bunch of gods are selecting champions, mostly from the human worlds. They give them powers, and throw them into a world.

Lots of very low qaulity works in the chessverse, lots and lots of powerful self-insert characters. This author chose to go a different route, making their author-avatar a rationalist instead of giving magic powers.
