Whilst I've read and admittedly enjoyed the Spatterjay trilogy mentioned in another comment, it does read like it's been written for young adults. Predictable in places but overall enjoyable.

Whilst not especially violent Iain M Banks' The Culture remains the best science fiction creation I have ever encountered. I don't claim to have understood all of it but they are fantastic books if you haven't read them.

I remember Use of Weapons being particularly dark in places.

EDIT - I haven't spent long in this reddit so apologies if this is a frequently made recommendation,
