/Marooned in Realtime/ by Vernor Vinge is the best science fiction book I have ever read. Hell, it's the best book period I have ever read. And one of the few that has ever made me cry. He really makes you feel the wonder of the possibilities of intelligence enhancement and related tech by the device of (among other things) showing people who had previously been enhanced to very high levels operating without many of their enhancements and resources and doing things that look to the reader positively superhuman, but which seem to them rather pathetic.

Hmm, I don't think I explained that very well. That's only a part of it. The rest is a lot of absolutely brilliant writing, and also a heartrendingly sad story of a person marooned in a hostile environment without support struggling with everything they have against the inevitability of death and decay.
