Yeah I couldn't help but feel the author had let their main character grow too fast, too quickly and thus had to come up with a contrived scenario to make things interesting. And, you know, in general just trying to make anyone aligned with the protagonist happy/successful with no backlash.

Crackfic at the beginning, though, and very well-written. Maybe it's because I'm taking an interest in RPGs but I also felt like the author did a wonderful job fleshing out their characters.
