I don't want to force you into reading something that actually makes you want to vomit, but I feel compiled to mention that the art improves dramatically after the first ~27 pages and the author shifts art styles several times throughout the entire comic depending on the narrative scene (there's even Adventure Time-style art!). If it's only the beginning art that bothered you, I recommend starting with [[http://www.all-night-laundry.com/post/27][Chapter 2]].

You wouldn't be missing too much, just Bina meeting Gregory, a guy who acts weird before leaving the laundromat, her doing her laundry amidst strange noises and a flickering TV, Bina finding a bloody tooth on the floor, and then a creepy dog monster crawling out of her laundry and chasing her until she gets knocked out by green light glowing from its eyes. Chapter 2 starts with her waking up in mid-fall before she lands somewhere...

Regardless of what you do, thanks for giving it a try and my apologies for your unfortunate experience.
