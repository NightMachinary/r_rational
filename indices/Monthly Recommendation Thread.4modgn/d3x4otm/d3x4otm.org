Recommending [[http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Sankarea/Sankarea-1?id=3097][Sankarea]] manga. Really interesting dark and weird supernatural romance story about zombies.

I like the Transhumanist angle of trying to overcome death that its explored a little bit in the later arcs.

The characters interact nicely and the story picks up after the first arc conclusion. I like how they discuss their problems unlike most clich√© works where all the drama comes from misunderstandings. Be warned though that its not a rational work.

Also looking for something like [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]. I love time travel stories and protagonists that try to optimize their situation, particularly if they use logic to overcome their problems.

Already read Metropolitan Man which comes close on the problem solving angle. Any other you would recommend?
