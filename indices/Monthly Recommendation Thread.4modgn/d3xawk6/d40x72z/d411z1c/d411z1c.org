Eh, I'll concede "rational-ish" because the universe seems to have some help guiding it, but I would say that for their stated values the main character acts consistently and logically. It's not high quality fiction though, I'd agree, just entertaining.

Definitely also agree that the main character's sexist views are annoying. Along those lines, I wanted to warn that literally the day after I posted this, the most recent chapter took a rather disgusting turn so I'm going to edit my post to note that it's graphic.
