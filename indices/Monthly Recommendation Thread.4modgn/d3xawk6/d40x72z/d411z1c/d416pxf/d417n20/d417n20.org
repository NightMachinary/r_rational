  do you feel that, excluding the sexual content of the story, if the characters were 15-16 years old instead of 19-20 it would work better?

Hmmm, maybe... but I feel like [[/u/whywhisperwhy]] is correct when he says the characters act consistently. The MC /does/ act like a socially reclusive and antisocial late teen without any higher education might act. If their ages skewed lower the behavior might be more forgivable and less alienating to readers. But even at their current ages I think it's still believable. Heck, I'm sure we all know people several years older than the characters who behave and think far worse.

I actually think it would be less believable with younger ages in some ways. At 15-16 you could be jaded and cynical, but usually it's based on emotional rebellion (feeling superior because you're stand-offish and act like an asshole). At 19-20, I more easily buy that the MC is just depressed and cynical, but still has the life experience to detach himself from others and think about the situation in a different way. He's an asshole not because being an asshole is cool, but because he expects nothing from the world and doesn't give anything back to it. I see that as requiring more years of experience than a 15 year old would have.

Yeah, thinking about it, the ages work. If he was 5-10 years older he'd probably have his temper under control and at least be smart enough to think before he goes off on people. At 19-20, he has enough experience to recognize the illogical actions of his group but not enough to stop himself from making things worse with his outbursts.

Not sure if that answered your question or just rambled ;-)
