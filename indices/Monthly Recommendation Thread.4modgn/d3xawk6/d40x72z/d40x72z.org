Seeing this recommendation I decided to try it out. Like [[/u/Drexer]], I was... less than impressed with the beginning. The main character is so damn unlikable. But the chapters are short, and sometimes wit, humor, and memes showed through, so I stuck with it.

Now it's less than a day later and I'm on chapter 80. I've laughed out loud plenty of times. The MC is still really unlikable but more in a curmudgeonly way than an outright asshole like he first was. Still pretty frustrating with his sexist tirades, though. I don't know the age of the author, but I wouldn't be surprised if he was mid-20s or younger - the immaturity that oozes through the MC's words just seems too genuine. But hey, if the author is instead a woman in her mid-40s or something, damn good job getting into the head of an annoying male college student!

I wouldn't necessarily call it rationalist fiction (because the MC lacks the social grace to make rational choices and seems to have INSANELY good luck), but it's really humorous and catchy. I feel like the story caught its stride after the first score of chapters - probably about the time they found the, uh, unicorn bunnies.

Thanks for the suggestion!
