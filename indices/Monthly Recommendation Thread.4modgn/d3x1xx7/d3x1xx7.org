Recommending Berserk, a dark fantasy manga (and old anime). Nobody's /stupid/, but the mc does solve his problems with the power of a 600 pound 'sword' rather than using his brain. What it has going for it though is very good characters, a world darker than Lovecraft, and demons.

In a somewhat unusual way of structuring things, I recommend (strongly) that if you read it you start with the 'Golden Age' arc, which starts at the end of volume 3 and runs all the way to volume 14. This is where a 'flashback' starts that is about 100 chapters long, and the plot twist at the end of it is revealed in the non-flashback chapters that precede it. Reading everything in publication order is like walking into the cinema to watch Lord of the Rings with giant posters outside saying "You'll be so sad when Gandalf dies, but then he doesn't!"

Anyway. The anime agrees with me. It skips most of the stuff before the 'flashback'. Though even there, skip the first episode for optimal enjoyment.
