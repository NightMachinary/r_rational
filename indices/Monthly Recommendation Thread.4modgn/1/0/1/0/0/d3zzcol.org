It's a rational story primarily about the Kalliam's, the troupe, the bank, and Geder trying to accomplish their goals; economics isn't a focus, as you said. If after the second book you don't feel much interest, it's not for you. The plot threads aren't all in place until the second book, so with that and your level of interest in lives of the main groups decide whether you'd like to read any more. For what it's worth, I didn't think any of the other books were thematically like The Dragon's Path as a whole, but rather more like its prologue.
