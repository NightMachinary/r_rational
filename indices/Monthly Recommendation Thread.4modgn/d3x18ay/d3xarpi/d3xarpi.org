I found myself annoyed at the inconsistent power levels. They describe mages as /very/ powerful, and that doesn't mesh with the amount of them there are when you look at their effects on society.

Then they revealed that the nation they've spent months traveling through is a small, probably third world, "island" nation. It's the size of eurasia, but not big by local standards.

Then everything started to make sense. I appreciated that.
