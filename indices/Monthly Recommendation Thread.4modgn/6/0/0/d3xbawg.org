Not a huge spoiler by any stretch of the imagination, and not really relevant to much besides this point, but watch out if you don't want anything spoiled. The disproportionate influence of the mages really clicks when you find out that they have ways of communicating other than sending someone on a horse for half a month or more. Official magi can make what is basically a short range radio in the form of a magical glyph or symbol unique to them. They can place this anywhere, even on people, and use it to talk to anyone near one within it's range. The people on the other end can call up the magus, too, but it requires a level 3 acolyte's power to call it up. It's a method of communication unique to magi that allows much greater communication and organisation of forces and therefore bestows a huge advantage to any magi that decides to command an armed force. Never mind the magi's own personal clout, just imagine what would have happened if, say, Napoleon got ahold of an easily reproducible radio. The magi are in power for a very good reason.
