[[https://omatranslations.com/table-of-contents-wmw/][Warlock of the Magus World]] is pretty much what you'd get if you gave Quirrelmort an AI chip in his brain and dropped him in a world where everyone has to be ruthless to survive. It's translated from chinese, but the translation is done well, with a new release every couple of days or so.
