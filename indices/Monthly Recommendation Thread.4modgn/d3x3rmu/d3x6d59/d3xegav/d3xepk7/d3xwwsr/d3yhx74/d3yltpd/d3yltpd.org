  And vore, don't forget the vore.

The vore is hard to forget. One of the more memorable parts of the game, I'd say. Now you've also given me the gift of an amusing mental image of a poor monster-girl trying in vain to stuff a beefy protagonist down her gullet.

  I have to admit the story was impressive and I loved Promestein's character and last lines. She could have been a great rational protagonist too and her cause was just even if her methods weren't.

I thought the story was a bit simplistic, to be honest. It felt like Promestein's side-plot was tacked on without being properly integrated with the main narrative and underdeveloped overall. It's a bit disappointing, since it resonates much stronger with me than the trite "love that overcomes all obstacles" main plot.
