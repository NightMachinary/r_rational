The text there implies protectiveness and no small measure of moralizing tendencies. Kindness, actual fellow-feeling for others, not so much.

But on the other hand, conceptually-focused scifi almost /never/ manages actual kindness and fellow-feeling for others, so maybe the lack is just genre convention.

I mean, also, looking back with adult eyes, the author had a creepy torture-porn fetish which he felt the horrible need to push on his readers.
