She seems like a stereotypical grandmother to me. If she had a different backstory, or became a death Jockey after becoming bored/discontented with virtual reality, I wouldn't have a problem. But she went from a state of constant agony (her nurse was stealing her opiates) to a healthy body in it's prime, with the ability to do anything.

The jump to immediate suicide/torture doesn't make sense to me.

  She shook as the memories flooded back. She had been an old woman, frail and helpless, she had never hurt anyone in her life. She had six children, nineteen grandkids, and God knew how many rugrats running around Cyberspace. Her first great-great grandchild had been born shortly before the Change, and in one of her rare lucid moments her granddaughter (Cynthia, was it?) had managed to make her understand, and she had found an instant of happiness in the midst of the pain. Had that really mattered to her? Had she but known. She was an old woman, a simple woman, a woman who would pass unremembered in the texts of history and did not care. A woman who had her family, her long life, her virtue, her community. A woman who, if she had known of such a creature as the Queen of the Death Jockeys, would have been horrified, would have shielded her kids, would have been the first to run her current self out of town. Or, perhaps, had she known enough, to call for her head on a pike.
