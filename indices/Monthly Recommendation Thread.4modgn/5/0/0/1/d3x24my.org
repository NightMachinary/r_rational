  I liked it even more because of the torture porn, it's rare to come across stuff like that that's also well written.

Have you read the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944073.The_Blade_Itself?from_search=true&search_version=service][First Law]] trilogy? One of the main characters happens to be a torturer, who despite being a rather horrible person, manages to be sympathetic/entertaining to read about.
