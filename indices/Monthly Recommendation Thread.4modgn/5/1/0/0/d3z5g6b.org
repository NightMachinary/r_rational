God I hate his stuff. He is just the worst popular writer I have ever read. His stuff is all blah, blah, unsympathetic people doing odd things for no reason that I don't give a damn about, then weird writing techniques like repeating parts of phrases over and over again like he's trying to be edgy, then some kind of horrible sadism torture scenes that don't make a bit of sense logically for the way any kind of real people would act, with people eating each other with blade dentures or sewing their mouths to other peoples rear ends centipede style or some such, then some knife based emasculation (he has at least one emasculation scene in every book, like he runs on a checklist), then some supposedly super intelligent AIs doing something that they claim is going to be awesome but which really, really isn't, and then finally the main character giving his all and generally dying to accomplish . . . absolutely nothing of importance, and then some secondary characters acting like something great happened. Blah
