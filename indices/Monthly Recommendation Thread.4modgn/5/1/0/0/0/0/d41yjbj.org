Forgive me if I get some of the details wrong or mixed up between books. It's been a while.

Consider Phlebas opens with the main character being tortured by slow drowning in sewage. Later, some time after he escapes from that, he is captured by a bunch of people from a high tech society who have formed a cult worshiping an enormously fat toothless guy, who enjoys eating his followers using blade dentures, and making all his followers eat nothing but his excrement. This scene goes on at rather great length. I forget exactly where the dick cutting was in Consider Phlebas, but I remember noting it, and it likely relates to the fat toothless psychopath's liking for what he calls "sweetmeats". Also the ending is pointless, empty, and boring.

In The Player Of Games, early on the main character and some other guy are walking through an amusement arcade when they happen upon a mud wrestling match between an alien female and an alien male from two different planets. The female holds the male under the mud to drown him, but his, um, reproductive organ bobs up to the top and the main character's companion remarks that the male can breath using his organ. Someone in the crowd of spectators tosses the female a knife and she cuts off the male's reproductive organs and holds them up triumphantly to the crowds general approval, while finishing off drowning the male. Neither the main character nor his companion seem bothered by this. The kinda bad guy gets killed in the end of this book, so I guess the ending wasn't quite as pointless. Sorta meh, though.

In Use of Weapons I forget exactly where the emasculation scene takes place, but there was one. I seem to recall some kind of party where naked slaves are used as servants and the guests are invited to mutilate them for their greater pleasure, or something along those lines (possibly the guests were mutilating each other with the aid of high tech healing devices). Once again the ending is pointless, empty, and boring. Actually, in this one the whole plotline is pointless. The main character felt kinda guilty about something or other, so he committed suicide. Wow, that's deep there. Real deep.

The Wasp Factory is all about emasculation, grossing the audience out by creatively disgusting descriptions of disgusting uses of various disgusting bodily fluids and excretions (sorry for the repetition of disgusting, but the book was also /very repetitious/ on the subject), and gleeful descriptions which rather fail at being funny of a child murdering various innocent people. In that one the main character supposedly has his reproductive organs bitten off before the book starts, and there's much on the subject. Twist ending was mildly entertaining for its audaciousness.

After I got to that point, and after I skimmed Look To Windward and didn't notice anything better than in the other books, I swore I would never read any more of his trash again. I'm glad he could release some of his psychological problems in writing, but I fail to understand why people enjoy reading torture and disgustingness porn wrapped in a thin shell of poorly thought out science fiction/fantasy elements.

No, seriously, Star Wars is more scientific than the "science" in his stuff. Gridfire? Cheap FTL travel? Matter synthesis from nothing or the practical equivalent? The science makes little difference to the plot except to sound cool, like a coat of shiny paint the author mixed up and slapped on (unlike in Niven's Ringworld which also has a lot of those elements and yet where the science and its results are breathtaking and awe inspiring, making up for the flat characters)? Yep. And that's fine, I don't mind science fantasy as long as it's internally logically consistent and has interesting characters, societies, and plot lines.

But in Banks' Culture, many of the citizens are apparently bored out of their minds from having super powerful AIs grant their every wish, and what with there being little for humans to do because AIs do everything so much better and are so much smarter. And this society is shown as stable and stagnant over thousands of years. And yet apparently not one single Culture citizen ever said to their personal wish granting genie, "I'm bored. Entertaining myself in more and more extreme and dangerous ways is getting old, but I can't do anything real because I'd screw it up. Hey, why don't you make me smart enough to figure out something worthwhile to do?". And though citizens leave the Culture for various purposes when their entertainment needs become too extreme for the Culture to satisfy (and other reasons), apparently none left to get mental enhancements which their AIs denied them in the interest of preserving their stagnant society.
