Alright, what I'm really looking for right now are at least semi-rational romances along the lines of *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11840095/1/What-Do-You-Want]["What Do You Want?"]]* from one of the latest writing challenges here. I have always been a sucker for romance, but I do hate manufactured drama and stupid characters. So stories where the characters deal with issues reasonably and the story isn't driven by drama that could be solved with a five minute conversation. Anyone have stories like this, whether fanfiction or anime? The romance itself doesn't have to be the main focus of the plot.
