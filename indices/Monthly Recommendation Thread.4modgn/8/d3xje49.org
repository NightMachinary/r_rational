Well....I had a list of things I wanted to recommend, but I misplaced it so I'm going to go with the only three I remember.

[[http://www.all-night-laundry.com/][All Night Laundry]] which is an awesome interactive illustrated serial story about time-travel and Lovecraftian abominations. Fairly rational since the characters are intelligent and the readers actually want Bina to succeed unlike other MSPA forum stories where the readers were just giving goofy commands. Been updating *daily* for three years now and the author has never missed an update deadline yet.

[[http://www.prequeladventure.com/2015/10/3834/][Prequel]] is a really good character-development story about a Kajit from Elder Scrolls trying to turn her life around from alcoholism and inexplicable nightmares by running away to another town to reinvent herself in an attempt to improve her life. It's not rational, but it's not irrational either, since she has very good reasons for messing up. She genuinely struggles with bad luck, alcoholism, and being homeless/poor (and maybe some depression), but it's all about being optimistic and taking matters into one's own hands to make life better rather than relying on luck or others to do it for you. The first few posts should be enough to decide if you like it.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/235720/dark-horse-a-five-score-tale-from-the-dresden-files][Dark Horse]] is a really good cross-over between /My Little Pony/ and the /Dresden series/. Nothing glaringly rational or irrational. I don't think any more needs to be said.
