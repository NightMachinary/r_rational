No idea. I just asked two days ago how much of the plot he had planned and he said that it's a very strongly interactive process where the readers and the characters do just as much of the planning/writing as he does. But for a few weeks in July, he's going to take time off his job as a holiday and spend some of that time on planning an ending. I suspect the story will be ending somewhen between a few months as a lower bound to two years as an upper bound.

Don't worry whenever it finishes, I'll post about it to here. ;)
