[[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][The Two Year Emperor]] [link to my Patreon, free download] was the thing that that got me to this subreddit; that's about 350,000 words.

[[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][The Change Storms: Induction]] [link to my Patreon, free download] is a rational superhero story; it's about 98,000 words.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]] is the rational Naruto quest I co-write with [[/u/Velorien]]. I've written 67,000 words for that and he's written about the same, I think.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko][Team Anko]] is a Naruto fanfiction and about 164,000 words. I think it starts out pretty well but I'm not satisfied with the later parts.

There's [[http://www.amazon.com/David-K.-Storrs/e/B00WCPXLMA][the stuff on Amazon]] under my name:

- The Draugar War: Opening Salvo: A Tale of Anundj√• (15,600 words; same universe as 2YE)
- One Hot Night (9300 words; same universe as 2YE)
- A Position So Fragile (8500 words; part of The Change Storms series)
- The Change Storms: Acquisition (11,000 words)
- Pay Attention (17,700 words; rational horror)
- Baby Blues (rational horror and, IMO, the best thing I've written; 15,400 words)

Then there's various odds and ends, plus the various things I've done under pen names. I'd guesstimate that's about another 300,000 but I haven't counted it.
