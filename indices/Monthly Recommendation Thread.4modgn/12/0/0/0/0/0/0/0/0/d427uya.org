EPUBs, MOBIs, and PDFs are available to Patreon patrons, but otherwise what's there is the raw HTML, which is what I write in.

EDIT: As to there being multiple directories: if you look around a bit you'll see that you're getting more than the story. That is an archive of everything related to 2YE -- the notes, the cover (which, incidentally, I paid for), etc. The various directories are how I organize things when I write. Also, there's only one file per chapter, so I'm not sure what you're seeing. If you see files beginning with _, just ignore them. They are an artifact of the OSX archive tool which I haven't figured out how to get rid of.
