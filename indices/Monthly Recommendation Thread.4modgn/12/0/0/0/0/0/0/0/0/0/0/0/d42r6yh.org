I'm not sure because I haven't messed around with it much, but isn't the EPUB ebook format basically HTML, or am I just imagining things. When I messed around with formatting an e-book in Calibre the text was formatted in HTML - was that just the editor simplifying it for me, or is the actual file format not that far off?
