  Cleaning no Jutsu

I've had this plot bunny for a while of a ninja team that is formed explicitly for doing only D-Ranks, all the time. I think it's funny that someone else had an idea along similar lines (disgruntled protagonist cleans up everyone else's messes). I think I'll revisit it when I become a better writer.
