"The Dagger and the Coin" Quintet by Daniel Abraham.

It's entirely rational except for one thing, which is perhaps explainable with in-universe reasons.

The author's been recommended here before for a short story, and I've recommended him as well. I've heard good things about his other works, but can't attest to their rationality myself. I'd wager they are, though. He seems an author of a thoroughly rational bent.
