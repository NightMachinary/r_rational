Some of the main characters weren't very interesting to me, Dawson in particular. Also, I think it was recommended to me as fantasy involving economics, which... well, Cithrin is a banker, but it's not particularly relevant to her part of the plot. I may try the later books at some point, if I hear that they improve, but while I didn't dislike The Dragon's Path, I don't think I'd invest the time to read another like it.
