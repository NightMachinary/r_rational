I listened to the entire series on audible. It's definitely a work of rational fiction, and a good one at that. However, it takes place in a pretty realistic late medieval/early renaissance setting, and there's very little magic in it. The characters don't have access to modern neuroscience, economics, decision theory or any of the scientific literature we have on heuristics and biases like we do in the real world. Because of this there is a limit to how rational characters can be, and you won't be seeing as much munchkinning in this story as you might see in some of the other stories here. That being said, there is still munchkinning and it is pretty impressive munchkinning even by the standards of the modern world.
