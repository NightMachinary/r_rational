Ugh, yeah, just got to that part.

The only other explanation I can think of is that she lied about needing healing, since he remarked later there was no blood (but he might have absentmindedly wiped off his hands). Which just makes it seem weird to me - if that was the case, [[#s][]]

To me that just reads like... well, the strange hypersexualized fantasy of an immature late teen/early 20s guy.

Still enjoying the story, but that just left me feeling all kinds of weirded out.
