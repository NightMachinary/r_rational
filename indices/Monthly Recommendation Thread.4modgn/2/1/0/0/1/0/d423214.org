It did both things, but do not worry because that was the purpose of my question. :)

To me the question of the ages was less about the main character and more about the other visitors, as their organization in stereotypical high-school groups seemed to me much more of an younger behaviour than a university behaviour. But then I reminded myself that my local culture and behaviours in that regard can be wildly different than the UK one, so maybe it's minimally consistent?

It just seems to me like the behaviour of the other groups/characters is far too similar to what one would expect from a teen movie to feel realistic.
