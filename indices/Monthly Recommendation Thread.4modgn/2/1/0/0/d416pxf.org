What was exactly that disgusting turn? I'm either desensitised or I skipped a paragraph because nothing in the latter chapters jumped out at me as specially problematic.

The sexism of the main character doesn't bother me as much because it's clearly the main character, and the story lampshades it enough while his thoughts seem more taken from the frontpage of reddit than someone would think and write non-ironically. I'm more bothered by how the universe apparently agrees with him.

Actually, one question [[/u/whywhisperwhy]] and [[/u/AurelianoTampa]] , do you feel that, excluding the sexual content of the story, if the characters were 15-16 years old instead of 19-20 it would work better? There have been a lot of occasions where their stereotypical behaviour has seemed unfounded to me for their age, but could easily be justified by pulling them towards the more common years of immaturity of their adolescences.
