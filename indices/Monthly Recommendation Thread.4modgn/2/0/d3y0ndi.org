I've read 11 chapters, does it get any better?

It's not that the character is blunt or rude, although the fact that he's an asshole even beyond his anxiety to communicate with others doesn't do him any favours. But between his obsession that he must be in a game and so many avenues of exploration left unsaid, it kind of gets on my nerves if it won't ever grow into semi-competent exploration of the situation.
