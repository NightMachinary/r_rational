[[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/][The Gods Are Bastards]] is an on-going high fantasy web serial that is rational and has very high writing quality. The world itself is based on standard D&D worldbuilding, but is just starting to undergo industrialization and has a very modern feel to it.

The primary focus is on a small, eclectic group of young adults who are essentially maturing adventurers at the beginning of their careers, but the overall cast builds up to least ten unique, fleshed-out POV characters and there's a dizzying amount of intrigue once the story starts going. Again, it does draw some inspiration from standard high fantasy stock but overall the plots and characters are creative and have a lot of depth. The magic system isn't anything special but it is very consistent and logically ordered.

I think its best points include: 1) very witty, pithy dialogue, 2) characters are pretty uniformly rational and capable of learning, and 3) the overarching plot is epic and mysterious with good pacing. The main downside is that with so many POV characters, the world can start to sprawl slightly and plot can move slowly (however, to be fair I would describe ASoIaF this way too).

It consistently updates 2-3 times a week (MW, periodically F) and has a ridiculous word count at this point.

I would suggest reading the first several chapters and deciding if you like the style, it's pretty consistent.
