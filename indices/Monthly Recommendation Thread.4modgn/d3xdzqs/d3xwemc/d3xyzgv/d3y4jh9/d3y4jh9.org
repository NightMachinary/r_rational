Well, I'm not going to ask authors to simulate a genuine super-intelligence for me. That said, avoiding dumb mistakes that appear obvious to my human-level intelligence shouldn't be too much to ask, if the author is going for a clever character. If you're telling me that a character is a genius, then I may let you get away with not making them actually smart, but they had better not be obviously dumb.
