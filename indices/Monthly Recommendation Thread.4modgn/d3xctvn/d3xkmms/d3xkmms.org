I geniunely like reincarnation fic, but it's just a subset of my like for portal fics in general, so it gets kind of annoying how they drown out everything else. My theory is that they're extremely easy to justify (built in ROB) and the wish-fulfillment helps people get over the initial worldbuilding hump. Notice how all the early munchkinry and being absurdly competent for a child happens at the same time as most of the boring exposition?

I would like to see more "portal between the planets" stuff, though. The MLP fandom had a shitload of it, for whatever reason, but it's pretty rare in the general sense to society-scale instead of just main character-scale interaction.
