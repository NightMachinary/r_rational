Kind of cool that it's MBA reading now; I remember when it was controversial. Goldratt wrote a bunch of sequels, including Critical Chain, It's Not Luck, and Isn't It Obvious? -- and those are just his novels. All very nice examples of "real world" rational fiction and munchkining, with ways that ordinary society has almost been as dumb (in retrospect) as the wizarding world, in missed optimization opportunities.
