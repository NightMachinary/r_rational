I've written a post on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3bo9z4/the_goal_a_process_of_ongoing_improvement_rst/][The Goal]], which is rationalist and takes place in the real world.

  1. If a character goes off and makes a million dollars by doing something smart, there would always be the lingering question of why, if this actually worked, the author has not already done this for real instead of writing fiction.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_M._Goldratt][Here's his Wikipedia page]]. From the sound of it, that's exactly what he did. He was a consultant. He told companies how to have better business practices, and wrote books about it like The Goal.

  2. The real world destroys plot. Plots tend to be unrealistic by nature. A good plot is supposed to have twists and turns, an interesting antagonist, a crescendo to climax, and a falling action that returns things to a calm but significantly changed state. In reality, there are often no climaxes or specific antagonists, just slowly aggregating trends and ever-insidious entropy.

The antagonist /was/ the slowly aggregating trends and ever-insidious entropy. The main character was the floor manager of a factory that was doing great on paper but losing money. He had to find all the ways they shot themselves in the foot and fix them. Maybe some people find that less interesting that killing an evil wizard, but I thought it was awesome.

  3. Reality is hard to get right. If you build your own magical world, you know everything about it, but if you write about real things, you have to learn real physics, real history, real geography, and so on. Even works that supposedly take place in the real world have little reality-defying caveats; for example, blunt-force trauma to the head in almost literally any work of fiction is just a knock-out button that causes no permanent damage. In reality, it can cause serious brain damage, permanent facial disfigurement, and a visit to the intensive care unit.

It was mostly fairly abstract. They never said what the factory actually made. Few of the machines involved were named, and the ones that were often didn't have descriptive names. But those details don't matter. He was making a bunch of different products by doing a bunch of different things with a bunch of machines in a certain order and selling the result. Everything else was based around that.

  4. Exploiting magical or sci-fi worlds is just superfun, and ever since HPMOR, people have been trying to recapture the fun.

Perhaps, but The Goal was written to educate first and to entertain second. This isn't something I found out about through Archive of Our Own. This is something I found out through my brother who had it as assigned reading for his MBA. And I think part of the reason I loved it so much is seeing clear rational fiction outside of the LessWrong sphere.
