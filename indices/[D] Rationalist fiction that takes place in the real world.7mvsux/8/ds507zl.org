Genghis Khan biography can be seen as rational story. From empoverished noble birth warrior to ruler of half of the world. More like Quirell from HPMOR, his rationality was destructive. Using enforced conscription of conquered people into kind of penal companies for human wave attacks ("Hashar"), absorbing whatever war tech he can get his hands on (including early rockets), complete genocide of conquered people if it was advancing his goals, religious tolerance because it was profitable. Discipline, organization, tactic of his troops were rivaling early modern armies. Like evil genius of rationalism.
