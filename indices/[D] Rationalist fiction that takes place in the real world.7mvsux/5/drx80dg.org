I recommend Ken Follet books, and other historical fiction / spy thrillers. The /Century/ trilogy is a good starting point.

Though Ken Follet books bend reality a bit by having their characters meet each other and witness historical events a smidge more often than plausible. Like, in /A Column of Fire/, how plausible is it really that the head of Secret Services grew up in the same town as the leader of Catholic opposition in England, married the spymaster of Protestant opposition in Paris (who happens to be the ex-wife of the Duke of Guise's right-hand man), and that the latter two also met each other several times for unrelated reasons?

You're only limited to sci-fi if you want all your conflicts to be about incredible things. Real life has plenty of optimizing, and you can make interesting stories writing about them.

(a thought that comes is you could probably make interesting stories riffing on Wildbow stories, keeping the social elements, and removing the fantastical parts)
