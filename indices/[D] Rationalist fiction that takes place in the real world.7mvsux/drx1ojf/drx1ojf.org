This is a very well developed and thought provoking post. I agree with many of the things you said.

I'd like to add that I believe that's the reason that rational works tend to mostly be fanfictions. It's easier to take a world someone gives you (especially a world designed to be cool, entertaining and interesting over sensible) and be like "Oh, this and that doesn't make sense. Here's what the story could look like if it did!"

Mind, I still wouldn't go so far as to say it's easy, in and of itself, but I do think it's much easier than trying to do a rational take on reality since that's kinda just...reality. Lol.
