I can think of one example of rational real world fiction: House of Cards (at least the first two seasons as that's all I've watched and can vouch for). All the characters have constant motivations and the protagonist is able to use that for manipulating them in a realistic fashion. It's one of the reasons I enjoyed the show so much I think.
