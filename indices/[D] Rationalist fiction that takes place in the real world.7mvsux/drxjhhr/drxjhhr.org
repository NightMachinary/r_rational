I have a story that I am writing, that I care about approximately 3x as much as I care about r!Animorphs. It is set in the real world. It was not explicitly meant to be rational, but three separate readers each independently claimed to me that it was more rationalist than r!Animorphs, and one of those readers claimed it produced a similar reality-clarifying effect on his cognition as HPMOR.

So. Uh. There's that, which I'll pick up again once r!Animorphs wraps, hopefully no later than summer.
