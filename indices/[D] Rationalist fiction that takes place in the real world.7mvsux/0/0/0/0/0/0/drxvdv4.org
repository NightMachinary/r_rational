  you might as well just read non-rational works of fiction about the real world.

I mean, I think you should read both? But you often won't find a real-world biography that turns out to be the kick-ass autobiography of a brilliant, transhumanist mathematician who finds a million dollars in the woods and has to fight the mafia with his wits, while coming to interesting philosophical realizations that the reader can apply to daily life. Even though this could in principle happen in real life. I stand by the things I have previously said.
