  But you often won't find a real-world biography that turns out to be the kick-ass autobiography of a brilliant, transhumanist mathematician who finds a million dollars in the woods and has to fight the mafia with his wits, while coming to interesting philosophical realizations that the reader can apply to daily life

Well yeah, but you'll find /zero/ fictional works with those (or rather, similar) qualities that also manage to be rational/ist. I'm not saying you can't find rational/ist works that are also good stories, but you can't find rational/ist works that are also good stories that also stick to the consistent set of rules set by the real world. Because with the real world, the vast majority of stories end up being boring, depressing, or both unless you only tell the stories that are interesting. Writing fiction, you /make/ the story interesting by force, effectively removing any claims to rationality unless you had specifically set up the universe's rules so as to generate interesting stories. And that's why rational fiction sticks to non-real-world-scenarios; that's why they come with a "gimme". It allows writers of those stories to set up their self-consistent world so as to guarantee that, however they write their story, it end up being of interest.
