  it's unnecessary

  Where fiction shines, with relation to the real world, is deliberately non-rational tales

Disagree. I mean, all fiction is "unnecessary." I expect that real-world rationalist fiction has much less widespread appeal than alternatives, which is why it doesn't really exist [yet]. But if people are willing to read classic Dostoevsky novels set in the real world, I'm sure some people will be perfectly happy reading real-world rationalist novels.
