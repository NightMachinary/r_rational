  “rationalist” with HJPEV-like characters, no.
#+end_quote

"Rationalist" still-yes. Just choose biographies about mathematicians or scientists.

Now, HJPEV-like characters aren't particularly common, but that's also because HPJEV-characters aren't particularly believable anyways. If they were, they'd show up more often in non-fiction works.

  Maximally fun and interesting given the constraints, no.
#+end_quote

To maximize fun, you have to contravene "nothing happens because the plot demands it" or it's just functionally identical to a well-written nonfiction work anyways, so you might as well just read non-rational works of fiction about the real world.
