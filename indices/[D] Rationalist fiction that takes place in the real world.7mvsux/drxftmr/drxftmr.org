The lack of rational fiction about the real world exists for the simple reason that it's unnecessary. If you want to read a rational story set in the real world, there's a superabundance of rational /nonfiction/ because all stories about people in the real world, with the sole exception of those about people with impaired judgement, feature

- Nothing happening solely because 'the plot requires it'. (because there is no plot)
- factions defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil". (because there exists no objective "good" and "evil", religion notwithstanding.)
- Characters solving problems through the +intelligent+ application of their knowledge and resources. (characters aren't always intelligent, but, barring impaired judgement, do see to fulfil their values as best as they can, to the limits of their understanding of what "best they can" is.)
- A world with consistent rules. (self-evident)

Where fiction shines, with relation to the real world, is deliberately /non/-rational tales, using the real world to boost character relatability, but fixing all those pesky issues like "lack of objective truth", and "not finding meaning in our short tragic lives" to maximize wish fulfillment.
