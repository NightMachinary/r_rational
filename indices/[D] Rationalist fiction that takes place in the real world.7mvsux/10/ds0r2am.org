I don't think #2 should be a problem since rational works should have things happen for real reasons, even at the expense of plot; I think the main reason rational works in the real world don't happen is because of #4: it's boring, compared to magic and supernatural stuff. Why not just read nonfiction? Also, the low hanging fruit has already been picked as far as discoveries go so no finding out new things. There is the potential for spy novels, detective stories, political thriller, etc which already exist as genres since that's something that the author may not have been born in the right time/place to do or decided not to pursue a career in, which is why they are a writer and not a politician to explain #1. As for #3, you don't have to get /everything/ right. If you're doing a Cold War era spy thriller, then you can research the technology, but you don't need to know modern classified technology since the audience probably won't know it either.
