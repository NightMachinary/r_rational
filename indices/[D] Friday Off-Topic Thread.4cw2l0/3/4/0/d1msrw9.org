Even disregarding all the issues related to getting information out of the machine, this doesn't work for more than /maybe/ one invention.

If you don't have a credible background, don't do any research, can't answer any technical question, and lots of people have reasons to pay close attention to you, how long do you think it'll take until someone puts two and two together? And that's when powerful people find /some/ way to get you to spill the beans.
