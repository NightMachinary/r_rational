Use the machine to make a career as a genius inventor, producing massive advances in all fields. Then, use the machine to find a way to make a massive device for producing a constant stream of EMPs, hopefully strong enough to negate Earth's magnetic field. Convince people that this is going to be the greatest advance yet, enough power to fuel all of humanity for the forseeable future. Radiological destruction rains down from space as the ionosphere breaks down.
