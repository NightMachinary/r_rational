Was it ever specified how ties are resolved?

A good start would something like this:

- Fork enough times to create a 1 GB large file and rename it to .exe.
- Run the exe on a computer connected to the internet, but not connected to the machine.
- If nothing has stopped you from entering 0 after a month do it. Then use get a replacement program from the best universe.

This guarantees that you will get an AI that is smart enough to figure out how to stop you from entering 0 into the machine and instead enter a larger number. It does not however filter for an especially malicious AI.
