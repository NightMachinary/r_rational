  Also, do you really think 1gb is enough space to hold a seed program which unfolds into a paperclipper in only a month?

There is some amount of force multiplier here. Maybe you can't get Clippy in 1GB, but one of the outputs will be a chatbot that's really effective at convincing you to talk to /this/ guy and hire /that/ guy who just happens to have amazing AI programming potential, and one thing leading to another, eventually someone writes a 20TB Clippy.

(The other you's will not get to use that Clippy to destroy the world though, for reasons I leave as an exercise to the reader.)
