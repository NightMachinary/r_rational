Whatever AI happens to actually take over the universe in the next few infinity years, and has the largest amount of negentropy left over to type digits, /and/ likes what its universe number says.

Even most AIs who would like to do this won't end up doing it because they know another AI can type in a larger number.

And so we made an AI that was actually friendly, and all that CEV shit worked, and it still ended up killing us all and tiling the unvierse with computronium because it needed to enter the highest number.
