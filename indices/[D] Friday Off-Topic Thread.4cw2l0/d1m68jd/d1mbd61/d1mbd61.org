One great result of playing /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings][Crusader Kings 2]]/ was that I learned about the hilarious multiplicity of interpretations of various religions. The Historical Immersion Project mod, for example, recognizes literally /fourteen/ separate varieties of Christianity:\\
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church][Catholic]]\\
- - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism][Cathar]]: The God of the Old Testament actually was Satan\\
- - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraticelli][Fraticelli]]: Churchmen should shun worldly possessions and temporal power\\
- - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldensians][Waldensian]]: Ditto\\
- - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollardy][Lollard]]: Ditto\\
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church][Orthodox]]: The Bishop of Rome is only one among several equal Pentarchs, not the sole leader of Christianity\\
- - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogomilism][Bogomilist]]: Satan created the material world\\
- - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulicianism][Paulician]]: Ditto\\
- - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monothelitism][Monothelite]]: Jesus had only one will (as opposed to two, mortal and divine, like his natures)\\
- - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Iconoclasm][Iconoclast]]: Religious icons are idols and should not be used in worship\\
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miaphysitism][Miaphysite]]: Jesus had only one nature (as opposed to two, divine and mortal)\\
- - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophysitism][Monophysite]]: The single nature of Jesus was entirely divine (as opposed to a mixture of divine and mortal)\\
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestorianism][Nestorian]]: Jesus had two separate natures, mortal and divine\\
- - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchites][Messalian]]: Perfection can be attained solely through prayer (rather than through the church)
