  That system is certainly something. Did you have much success with it?

I'm not sure I see how a system of codenames can experience success or failure. However, the system of friendship (without scarequotes) that I was using at the time was fairly successful. It essentially was the same as my later "friendship" system, but with three members (including me and the people who later would become "Friends" One and Two--then referred to as Demigoddess and Demigod) rather than two, and with no recordkeeping. (This method was made convenient by Facebook's "Group Messaging" feature, which allowed each conversation thread containing three or more people to be separate from the others as its own "Group Message".)\\
This arrangement collapsed after the person later known as "Friend" One temporarily (for several months) stopped responding, for unknown reasons. IIRC (my memory is fuzzy here), I continued interacting with "Friend" Two for some time before finally instituting the more-organized "friendship" system, into which One was inducted later on.
