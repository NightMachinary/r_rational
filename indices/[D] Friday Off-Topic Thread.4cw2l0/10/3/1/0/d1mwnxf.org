Of course it could be edited. Everything on the Internet could be a lie. But it's hard to make friends when you react to every personal revelation with distrust and paranoia - I'm willing to trust that [[/u/ToaKraka]] hasn't tampered with those screenshots just to deceive us.

As for image metadata - PNGs don't usually have that, the format supports it but it's rarely used and Imgur strips it anyway. It's more of a JPEG thing.
