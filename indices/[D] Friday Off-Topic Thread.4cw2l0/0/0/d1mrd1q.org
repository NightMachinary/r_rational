I refresh the page. Same message. I trace my ethernet cable back to the router in case this is some belated April Fools joke and I'm connected to my son's network. Still plugged in - still my router. I check the gap under the door to my son's room just in case - no blue light. I put my ear to the gap - no humming of the computer fan. Not a prank, then. I return and refresh the page. Same message.

Darn.

--------------

I stop by the book store on the way to work to see if the author published in print as well. Nothing - either he's an unknown or using a nom de plume.

--------------

I lounge at my desk station pretending to ponder the reports arrayed before me, twirling a pen in my off hand. My solution. My solution to the final exam. What's being examined? Story comprehension... ability to solve the Iraq war... JKR style magic, since Hussein has a wand? Maybe, if Bush will die and be resurrected in three weeks time. So, Saddam is a wizard, JKR style magic is real, and Bush will die and his corpse perfectly revivified by necromancers. Hmm... Saddam who? Maybe it's not Hussein. Maybe it's just some wizard named Saddam. And could resurrect mean... no, that's a stretch. Necromancy it is, then.

So I need to take a Saddam and have him while naked and holding his wand face the cardinal direction from which Bush et al. approach - whenever that may be. Where to find a wizard named Saddam?

/Ding-dong/.

Oh, that'll be them! I change into my lead-lined hazmat suit and answer the door. "Hello! You'll be the Obliviators, then?"

They look confused, but realization and determination soon replaces their confusion. "Sir, we're just going to have to ask you some questions about your editorial in the weekend edition, then we'll be on our way."

I affect a moue of confusion, myself. "I'm sorry, I don't quit- ah! Of course. I forgot you think I'm a muggle. Haha - what a cock up that would be, eh?" I try to chuckle when I realize verbalizing the onomatopoeia 'Haha' isn't a convincing way to pretend at laughter.

"Yeah, listen, I'm actually muggleborn, Hogwarts class of '82 - my wife didn't take too kindly to the whole magic thing, and I agreed to put my wand in a locker while I warm her up to it a bit. I don't know where the magical area here is, even, haha." Darn - chuckle more, chuckle more... they're buying it, keep chuckl- okay too much, stop chuckling.

One relaxes his hand. "Happens to the best of us. My cousin moved to Germany; had the same thing happen to him. Made for a rough first few years. You're newly married?"

"No, will be a decade next year." They're chuckling, now! Chuckle at their pace, not too fast, not too little - damn I'm good at chuckling. "Anyway, sorry to bother you and all, but do you know a wizard named Saddam?"

The silent one looks to his partner and back, then nods.

"Great! If you wouldn't mind telling him to stop by any time in the next three weeks, I'd really appreciate it. I heard a prophecy that very clearly indicated he will die unless he does some rather silly things at a specific time."

"We'll be sure to pass along the message, sir. Have a good day, now, and if you need to contact us again, just head down to Ivers and Mounipe; there's a cobbled alley there. Head in to the dentist's to the alley's left."

"Thank you, and I'll remember that, thank you. Ivers and Mounipe, dentist to cobbled alley's left. No more editorials for me."

I close the door.

--------------

"Now turn... three degrees clockwise, Saddam! No, that's four! No, that's two! That's four again! There you go. Just stay like that for a couple hours. I'll make us some tea."
