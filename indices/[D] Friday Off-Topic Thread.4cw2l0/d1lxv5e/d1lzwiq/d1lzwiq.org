I'm on the same boat although usually manage to overcome procastination by having a rough guideline of how I want the story to end and dividing it into small steps.

Then I usually write a rough chapter in one sitting and start fixing it iteratively or even publishing the rough draft as it is to get feedback. Of course the later is not recommended as you get some really low quality stories.
