So, I have a tendency to find a new 'favorite thing ever' once every few weeks. It's the novelty...

Anyway, this week, courtesy of steam sales, I found the point and click adventure game Deponia! (90% off this weekend)

You get to play as a classic point-and-click puzzle solving protagonist who is also a comically apathetic narcissist with anti-social tendencies! Plus the setting is great in general.
