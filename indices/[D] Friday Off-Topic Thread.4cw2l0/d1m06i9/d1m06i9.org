Been working on the thesis, got to read some of the SpikeProp algorithm for supervised learning but still have been unable to grasp temporal spike encoding or find much data on it.

Now unrelated to that topic, this week I was wondering on the limits of superintelligence or how a character with it may still be limited by the lack of resources and the physical world limitations to achieve any result.

Giving the example between getting Flash's speed force and Lex Luthor's intelligence, which would be better? I argue that even if Luthor got the means to harness the speedforce, it could be limited by being too expensive to be affordable perhaps requiring exotic materials or beyond the technology of our era, take several years to develop it or just being deemed impossible.

Meanwhile Flash speed would allow to directly break those physical limitations and a character with it would thus be able to achieve a greater intelligence by using the timespan required by the character with superintelligence on iterative methods and enhancing his brain. He would be limited by the perspectives and flexibility of his mind but may be able to reach superintelligence iteratively.

This thought came from the search for limitations on the capabilities of a genius rational character on a story. Its said that sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic, but can it really break the laws of nature? I think it could only find a way around them and be limited by the costs and resources required to achieve the same effects.

Thoughts?
