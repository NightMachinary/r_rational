Depends on which Luthor and which Flash.

As you say, several DC characters have successfully harnessed the Speedforce using handwavium (mostly Batman and Flash villains), so sufficient intellect might be enough to get you both with a bit of prep time. It all depends on the setting.

On the other hand, quite a few versions of Flash have considerable mental enhancements; the current one [[http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111159554/3983771-3304356-bfr1.jpg][can use his "speed mind" to accurately simulate the universe several years into the future]] and [[http://imgur.com/a/C1fhN#3][perform path-to-victory]].

There's really no right answer here. But personally, I'd go with the Flash - Luthor's plans always fail, so whatever he has going on that lets him build death rays can't be that useful.
