It's more likely that it sets up a series of circumstances where you die for reasons unrelated to the AI in that month. Freak bus accident, that sort of thing. I'd make a shorter wait period to decrease the likelihood that mere bad luck, rather than a malicious AI, was what killed you.

Edit: Also, do you really think 1gb is enough space to hold a seed program which unfolds into a paperclipper in only a month? I know we like to pretend things are that easy here, but I've never been convinced that such a seed program would be that small.
