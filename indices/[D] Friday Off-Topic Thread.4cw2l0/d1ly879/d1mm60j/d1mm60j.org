Generate a random DNA sequence. Find a company that will print it for you (I'm pretty sure they exist; you can always use the machine as a search engine here). Lock yourself in with canned food and news access. Wait a month to see if a pandemic has destroyed civilisation.

This is slower than AGI, but /much/ safer than anything that involves interacting with random computer files.

(Safer as in "the file that gets shared by the machine is probably the one you actually want".)
