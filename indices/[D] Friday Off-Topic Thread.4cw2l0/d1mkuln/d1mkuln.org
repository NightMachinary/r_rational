So I've updated my resume, since I probably should start actually looking for a job.

[[http://traverseda.github.io/]]

It's still missing anything other then work history (You can see the full resume [[https://github.com/traverseda/traverseda.github.io/blob/master/code/resume.yaml][here]]).

I also can't for the life of me get the print preview to work in firefox, which sucks.
