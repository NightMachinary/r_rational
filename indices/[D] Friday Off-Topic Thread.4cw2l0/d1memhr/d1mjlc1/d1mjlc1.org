I /loved/ it. But then, I'm not in it for the /rationality/ but for the /emotion/. The music and atmosphere were so poignant and dark, and, I thought, superbly portrayed Batman's angst and despair. So refreshing compared to "feel good" Hollywood cliches.

Does the plot make /sense/ ? No. There is no rational universe in which Luthor can take the mother of an invincible demigod (with ultra-fast reflexes) hostage and not die instantly.

But none of this reduced my enjoyment even a little.
