Agreed. Not to mention that Cap's side seems terribly unbalanced and given the stakes on this conflict, I would expect the government to be backing Iron Man all steps of the war instead of just letting them "duke it out" and accept the winner's proposal.

I mean even if Cap wins, why don't they just shoot them? They're all humans mostly.
