I think you misunderstood several parts of the plot.

Lex Luthor didn't want to kill Superman because he was scary powerful. He had an ideological dislike of the idea of a "godlike", all-powerful being, and wanted to prove to the world that he was "either not all good, or not all-powerful". This is stupid, but he behaves reasonably in pursuit of this goal.

Superman does not have super-speed in this setting. I can see how you might have missed this in Man of Steel, but they explicitly had a scene where he wasn't fast enough to stop an explosion.

/Batman/ was the one who argued that Superman was too powerful to be allowed, a threat to everyone, etc. He has several scenes where he talks about his fear that Superman will snap, including an extended nightmare sequence.

Superman was looking for (following?) Batman because he didn't like him, not looking for Kryptonite (he has no idea it exists.)

Not a good idea to wield Kryptonite melee weapons near the guy who can vaporize/crush them. Better to depower him first. Not sure why he made a melee weapon in the first place, though, instead of say, a gun - maybe he doesn't like guns? Obvious explanation, but never established, plus he uses actual guns.

The time travel makes no sense and will never be referenced again, probably.

This film has a bunch of actual plot holes, obviously, but I wouldn't say the characters are incoherent, and I enjoyed it.
