Those are mostly fair points.

  Superman was looking for (following?) Batman because he didn't like him, not looking for Kryptonite
#+end_quote

That was my guess, but it's awfully clumsy. Like "we need a scene where Batman steals the kryptonite, oh and also a scene where Batman and Superman have an early tussle, and oh god will you look at the runtime, let's make it the same scene. Oh and Batman is going to need that kryptonite, so we'll have to spend a quick shot to undo the outcome of that fight."

  Not a good idea to wield Kryptonite melee weapons near the guy who can vaporize/crush them.
#+end_quote

Lots of things would be a better idea than leaving the weapon in a fairly distant location and hoping for the best.
