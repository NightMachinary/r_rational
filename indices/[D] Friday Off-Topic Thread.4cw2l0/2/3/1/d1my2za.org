The recent crop of Hollywood superheroes movies (and I guess you can put Star Wars in the same bucket) have mostly been quite fun. Definitely not rational, but not the naked absurdity of BvS. And they make it up with good action scenes and/or good banter.

Man of Steel was a warning sign, but still, one could reasonably hope DC would get better rather than worse.
