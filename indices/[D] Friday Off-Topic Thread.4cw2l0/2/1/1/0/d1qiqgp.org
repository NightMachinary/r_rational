I might do a similar review for /Civil War/. I have a nasty feeling it's going to be really quite bad (while still having good moments, given the beloved characters and such.)

The central conflict stems from Iron Man, who has spent his films running his own personal military interventions and vigorously defending his right to do so from the government, fighting Captain America, a man empowered by the government using secret government science because he was such an incredible patriot, who has worked for the government almost continuously since that day (his childhood dream,) and whose only break with the government has been because he (correctly) felt SHIELD weren't receiving sufficient oversight ... except Iron Man is fighting to make superheroes work for the government, and Captain America is fighting to let them do whatever the hell they like. Also, much like the comics, Iron Man's side is clearly correct but Cap's side will clearly be treated by the narrative as the "heroes"* (and, unlike the comic, will probably win.)

This does not seem conductive to a character-driven narrative.

*[EDIT: this was an accident in the comic, according to the authors. Iron Man was /supposed/ to be a hero going too far in a good cause, not the villain. There's a reason the comic isn't exactly well-liked.]
