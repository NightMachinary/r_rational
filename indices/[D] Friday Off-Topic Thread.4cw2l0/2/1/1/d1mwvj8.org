Wow so it was that bad. Honestly the comic the movie's based on is also highly criticized due to Superman and Batman's confrontation not making any sense. It didn't have Luthor there as far as I know but DC needed to accelerate the formation of the Justice League to compete with Marvel's Civil War.

If you ever do a review on Civil War I'd be happy to read it. I hope it makes more sense than Batman vs Superman.
