/Batman v Superman/ is such a fart of a movie. My least favorite parts:

- Dream sequences all over the place.
- Batman indiscriminately killing people with a machine gun.
- Enormous plot holes.
- Unclear motivations from most of the central characters.
- Conflict that could have been cleared up by just talking about things for five seconds.
- Conflict that gets resolved in stupid ways.
- Interesting questions that get abandoned in favor of giant setpiece battles.
- Extremely poor tie-ins to future movies.
- Lois Lane saying, "Superman is many things, but he's not a killer". /Holy shit, are you fucking kidding me, he publicly killed Zod in the only other movie in this continuity./ He's a killer in the sense that he's killed someone, and he's a killer in the sense that he's proven himself capable of killing if there's a need for it. She is never called on this. I would accept this at a bad retcon if /B v S/ didn't have the events of /Man of Steel/ so central to it's piss-poor plot. It's not a retcon, it's just stupid.

I didn't go into the movie having high hopes, but it failed to live up to even my lowered standards. And I suppose in that way it was bad enough to be entertaining. Also, it had some good cinematography, so I guess that's nice.
