/Have you ever made any funny April Fool's jokes?/

I made three attempts in the last three years--but each was rather lackluster, in my opinion (I'm not a creative person), and I couldn't think of anything at all to do for this year.\\

- - This one (or maybe the discarded one at the bottom) probably is my favorite, in retrospect. (I'm nowadays rather less inclined to agree with the sentiment expressed in the footnote, though. See also [[/r/tulpas][r/tulpas]].)\\

- - I've mostly given up on the various multi-axis rating systems mentioned as being too finicky for significant usefulness. I still enjoy idly rating people from 1 to 5 (occasionally with half-points) on "hotness", though.\\

- - The hierarchical-pantheon system of codenames for what I then termed "friends and almost-friends" is a relic of the rather-confused few years before the final crystallization of [[http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png][my "friendship" system]].\\
- - The mentioned snippet of /Naruto/ fanfiction can be read [[http://i.imgur.com/Hto5ZDE.png][here]]. (Yes, I see that typo at the top...) It's the first of approximately three occasions on which I've gotten vaguely close to writing an entire story of reasonable length (the other two being the two long summaries on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4098737][my fanfiction.net profile]]).

Each of the rather-ancient games /[[https://www.gog.com/game/europa_universalis_ii][Europa Universalis 2]]/ and /[[https://www.gog.com/game/victoria_complete][Victoria]]/ contains literally /dozens/ of tracks of period-appropriate music, licensed from [[http://www.naxos.com][Naxos]]. The files even still have their original ID numbers, so that you can look them up in the Naxos catalog and find the albums that include them. (More-recent [[http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza][Paradox]] games have less-voluminous (but still pretty good) original soundtracks composed by [[http://www.andreaswaldetoft.com][Andreas Waldetoft]].)

/[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/221380][Age of Empires 2]]/ has a pretty fun soundtrack. I like the original game's ten tunes, as well as the first tune in the /The Age of Conquerors/ expansion (included in the base version of the linked Steam re-release), but I have little liking for the other nine /Conquerors/ tunes, and I've bothered to copy only six tracks from the /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/266840][Age of Mythology]]/ soundtrack out of the game folder.

The YouTuber [[https://www.youtube.com/user/RagtimeDorianHenry][RagtimeDorianHenry]] has uploaded literally thousands of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI][MIDI]] transcriptions of old ragtime tunes.
