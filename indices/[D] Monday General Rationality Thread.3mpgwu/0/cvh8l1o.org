Do any of you know of a practical, online, and iterative Bayesian calculator that is easy to use? There are calculators and apps that function partially to demonstrate Bayes' theorem, but they aren't actually helpful in successive multiple calculations that utilize the posterior probability as a new prior probability for a new LR(-)/(+).

I'd like to be able to direct medical trainees to it when they use resources like JAMA's Rational Clinical Exam series.

For example, if someone in the ER has shortness of breath,, nighttime breathing issues, leg swelling, jugular venous distention, and a history of heart disease, what is their posterior probability of having the diagnosis of congestive heart failure, given a prior probability of 25%?

Doctors have the concrete stats to make these sorts of calculations routinely, but we don't do it. We need it to be fast and easy (take <1 min to work) or it won't be clinically useful.

Help me help medical trainees maximize their Bayesian reasoning at the patient's bedside! Thank you.
