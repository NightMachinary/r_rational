We have published likelihood ratios for a set of conditions. The associations for a family of functions probably could be calculated from the initial studied data set, but convincing a doctor to manually plug in the LRs for a condition is hard enough.

Mainly I'm looking for something that uses the standard Bayesian nomogram and does the math for you -- and if it's not precise, well that doesn't matter since there is an illusion of precision anyway. The ranking of relative LRs in an intuitive tallying system is what docs use anyway; it's called "pertinent positives and negatives" which cluster under a set of illness scripts and are pattern recognized to fit with a specific medical diagnosis.
