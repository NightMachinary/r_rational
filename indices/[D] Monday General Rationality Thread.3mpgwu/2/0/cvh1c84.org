About as long as it takes until the AI chooses to voluntarily reveal itself which is in turn dependent on the personality of the AI itself. Is is a puppeteer-from-the-shadows or is it more direct about controlling the world?

I don't think being Friendly or a paperclipper would imply the AI would reveal itself, because the paperclipper probably could warp the world's culture and economy into producing whatever it wanted and the Friendly version could be a gentle parent nudging its child into being a better person all without realizing the deeper implications of certain actions.
