a blind kid learned to click and echo locate well enough that he could roller blade. While researching this, the son of the lady doing the research (while visiting his mom in her lab) thought it was cool and so /he/ learned to do it as well. The son was like 14 or so? took him like a week of practice to pull it off.

If we could wire into the brain safely and easily, with low damage/rejection, the things we could pull off would be amazing.

We have all ready done the equivalent of telepathy wiring two peoples brains together, so extra senses are just the tip of the iceberg. For zorian, who has the special ability to be /better/ at normal humans at processing outside information dumped directly into the brain? yeah, he should /definitely/ be building all kinds of divination devices that run non stop. the power of that is hard to explain, especially when you are talking about things like magic and the possibilities involved there.
