He has been being very cautious with his mental augmentation, and I certainly don't blame him, it isn't that he doesn't want to make more useful changes it's that he cannot yet, his main focus at the moment is sinking his mind magic and soul magic to do something with his simulacrum that helps them mimic the hydra and the cranium rats, it would essentially give him up to 6? times (I'm not sure how many simulacrums he can make at the moment) and instead of having 6 autonomous clones he would have a single hive mind with 6 semi autonomous drones, and once he has done that he will work on further mental augmentation with his increased processing power.
