no augmentation is required. Innate mind magic is /entirely/ around him being able to process information that is dropped into his mind, it's what they basically explained what being 'open' as being. He doesn't need to augment his mind, only build a spell/device which constantly does the divination and drops the info in his mind, just like every other divination spell for information he is currently using. The big change is leaving it on all the time this will quickly (mostly) force his brain to make it natural and automatic to use.

Heck, if we could just get the information dumped into our /own/ head, it would work the same way. This is the same principle behind human echolocation, the tongue echolocation device, the remote controlled robot arm, etc etc. The brain is remarkably plastic on what it considers 'itself'.
