Wait five restarts? Does that mean the ppl they worked with had their memories reset? Also they haven't fought the dragon in those five restarts? I feel like we're missing a whole lot because a lot can happen in five restarts with fully aware time travelers.

Edit:After the story ends, a side story would be awesome of MoL. I just love so many of the characters. I'd hate to see the end of this world after Z&Z defeat red robe.
