Hate to say it, but epic fights aren't the author's strong side. At least that's my opinion. So I agree, the first two arcs were the best because Zorian was keeping a low profile, and the chapters tended to be more personal. There was a lot of growth potential, both magic and personal. And a lot of things weren't going Zorian's way. We still get some of that when a particularly strong character appears, i.e. the lich's public persona and Silverlake, but most of the time ZnZ just plow through and there isn't any banter.
