At this point in the story Zorian has access to enough tools that he's able to quickly learn new things as well. Early on we got to see him get better, now it's just a matter of where he placed his attention. He doesn't struggle to convince powerful people to teach him anymore because he's either got the skills to prove himself to them or the money to pay for it.
