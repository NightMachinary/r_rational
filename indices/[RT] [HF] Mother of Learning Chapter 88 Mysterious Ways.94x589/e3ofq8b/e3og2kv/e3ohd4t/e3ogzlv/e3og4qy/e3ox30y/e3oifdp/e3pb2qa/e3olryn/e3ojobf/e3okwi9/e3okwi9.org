I have to disagree. The author has commented about long timeskips, saying that it's just slow progress and would be boring to slog through. Additionally, it is readily apparent that the author really cares about the story, what with it being lovingly crafted with tons of worldbuilding including supplementary lore posts.

We're in the final stretch here so I expect it to pick up soon
