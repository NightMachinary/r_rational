One of the things which bothers me about zorians mind magic is that he hasn't taken the obvious advantage of augmenting his mental /senses/ beyond the single incident of creating a reverse direction eye.

That's all Z? come on man! create a device which is /constantly/ divining 5-60 seconds into the future (whatever seems reasonable to the author) and dumping it into your head. Now /that/ is a power up. At first it will be horribly distracting, but eventually it will become second nature...and instinctive short term divination will instantly turn him into a power house combat mage on the same order as Zack.
