Not at all. We can just wildly speculate with zero evidence instead. Pretty much what the MOL sub is for. Example: Taiven is a swarm of cranium rats who have excellent makeup skills. This is supported by her referencing Zorian as cockroach and thrashing him - hunting behaviour - as well as always having another trick up her sleeve and being described as swarming him in these incidents. She is also red robe because reasons. Her master plan is to escape and cause the overwrite process of the gate to turn every.living entity on the planet into one giant swarmmind with her at the head.

Some of that may even be factual.
