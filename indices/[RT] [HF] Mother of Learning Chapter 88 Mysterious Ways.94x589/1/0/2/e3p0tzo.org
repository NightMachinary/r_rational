I noticed in one of the chapters they said something about each person having 12 restarts. Not sure if that was saying that the temporary marker lasted 12 restsarts or they had 12 left before the loop ends. I didn't pay too much attention and I think they stated that they had more than 12 restarts left when they brought everyone into the loop.
