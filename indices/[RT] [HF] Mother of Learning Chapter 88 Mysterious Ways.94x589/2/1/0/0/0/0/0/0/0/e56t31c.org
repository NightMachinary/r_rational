There's a doctor (V. S. Ramachandran? Maybe?) That works with people that have lost various senses. One lady he worked with had lost her sense of balance due to inner ear damage caused by inappropriately prescribed medicine so he modified a hard hat with two accelerometers that were wired up to an electrode array that is worn on the tongue. When the head tipped forward or back the front or back of the array would activate, or side to side the corresponding side of the array would activate. The lady didn't even need excessive training with the device, her brain recognized the information as relating to balance almost immediately and she could stand and walk normally just minutes after pitting on the helmet even though the signal was coming from her tongue rather than her inner ear.
