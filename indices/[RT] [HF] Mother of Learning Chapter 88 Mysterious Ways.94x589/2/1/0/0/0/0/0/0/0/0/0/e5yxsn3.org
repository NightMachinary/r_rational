I think the issue with that isn't Zorian's ability to process the information, it's the mana required to keep a bunch of divination spells going non-stop. He's already keeping several simulacrums active constantly draining his mana, and needs enough mana spare to be able to cast spells. I don't know how mana costly divination spells are, but it's likely too much to be worth it.
