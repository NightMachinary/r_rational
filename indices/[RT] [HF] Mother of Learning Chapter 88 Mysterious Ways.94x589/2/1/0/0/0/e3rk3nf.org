My best guess is that the staff is either a shaping aid (the typical use of a staff for a wizard) or grants psychic abilities, as it is one of the more useful abilities that could be given to a human, lately I have been wondering whether Zach's huge mana reserves are more useful than Zorian's psychic nature, and I don't really think they are. Zorian is likely the best human mind mage on the planet at this point and he reached that level in 8~ years (although through the use of Infinite resources and some rather unscrupulous behaviour), if that is worthy of being a divine gift, I don't know what is.
