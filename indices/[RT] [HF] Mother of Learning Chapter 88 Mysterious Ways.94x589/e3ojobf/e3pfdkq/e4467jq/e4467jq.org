Yeah, I'd actually argue that the focus on ramping and conflict is the biggest issue more recently; the best parts of the story were back in arc 1, when Zorian was fumbling around poking at the edges of the time loop and seeing how people react to various changes and learning to care about others through it. Things like the question of what was going on with with Akoja and the way Zorian's initial assumptions about Taiven and Kirielle fell apart were what I was /really/ reading for, along with the sneakier understanding-based loop progression where Zorian was mostly expanding his options and figuring out causes and effects while trying to stay under the radar and knowing that brute force was simply not a viable way to stop the invasion. We've had a couple of nice character moments along that line in more recent arcs, like Taiven's breakdown and the subsequent loop, but overall it feels like the best parts for bringing those back, like the magicless loops, just got timeskipped over.
