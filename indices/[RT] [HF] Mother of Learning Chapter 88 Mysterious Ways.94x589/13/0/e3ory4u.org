I feel that Princess and Ibak can use some more attention this chapter. Peculiar hydra and grouchy suspecting oldman are interesting characters, but they feel flat. Passages on Princess are of lower quality when compared to Novelty; who displayed unbound enthusiasm first time she's appointed as Zorian's tutor, or giving an off-hand dismissal when Zorian talked about creation of glass apparatus. And Ibak is the same when compared to Haslush Ikzeteri; who's friendly but still commanding respect.

Zorian brief interaction with lizardman children could also use some work. Moving the description of their big build earlier (when they're touching Zorian wondering if he's a fairy) would allow better flow when they play with mudman construct.
