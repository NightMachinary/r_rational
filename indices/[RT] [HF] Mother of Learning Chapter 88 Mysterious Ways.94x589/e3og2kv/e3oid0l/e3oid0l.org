Don't worry, finding the Staff is the only thing they strictly speaking need to accomplish. Once they know where it is, they can grab it, take the Ring, steal the Dagger, unearth the Orb, and then take out QI for the Crown, and then leave.

There's still the question of how to get Zorian et al. out, but the last truly big challenge is finding the Staff, and it looks like they're getting close.
