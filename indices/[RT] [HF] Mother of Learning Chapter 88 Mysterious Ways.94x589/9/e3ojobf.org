Last several chapters I've had the feeling that the author is kinda tired of the story and is rushing to get it finished ASAP. Constant timeskips and summaries. Maybe that's not the case, but that's the impression I get from the style of the second half of the third part. Maybe that's the consequence of the characters growing too strong for interesting and believable conflict?
