I feel the same rushing or tiredness, but I disagree it is caused by time skips or summary. I infer they're due to insufficient attention to character interactions. I wrote my criticism [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/94x589/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_88_mysterious/e3ory4u/][here]] because it's not the problem with the story. It's strictly the way it's written.
