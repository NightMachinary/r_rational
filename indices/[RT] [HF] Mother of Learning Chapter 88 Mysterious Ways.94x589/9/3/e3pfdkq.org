"Maybe that's the consequence of the characters growing too strong for interesting and believable conflict?"

some of the best chapters had nothing to do with conflict. I enjoy the exploration and discovery and growth. Getting out of the loop is secondary to me, I wish we could just continue to explore this world. For instance if they spent an episode figuring out how to get the lizard mage to teach them, that would be fantastic. Or visiting the dragon and going through all her treasures.
