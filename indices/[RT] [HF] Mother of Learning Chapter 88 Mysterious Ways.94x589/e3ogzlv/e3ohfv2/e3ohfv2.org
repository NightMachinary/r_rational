yeah, I wasn't the biggest fan of the time skip either. It felt like we were getting to some of the most interesting stuff, then . . . woosh

yes we spent 3 episodes on this one loop and things might need to be sped up a bit, but . . .

I hope we get at least a couple of episodes covering everything they discovered in depth

On a side note, I was wondering how they were going to keep progressing the 'orb as black room' research without informing the researchers. Because at some point they are going to recognize their own work.

too bad they weren't able to talk about the sandworm

hope he visits the lizard mage again, his tricks are top notch and sounds like he could be a tremendous tutor

and of course VISITING A DRAGON. We've only seen them offscreen, it would be great to see one in person and either learn from it or steal all it's precious precious treasure
