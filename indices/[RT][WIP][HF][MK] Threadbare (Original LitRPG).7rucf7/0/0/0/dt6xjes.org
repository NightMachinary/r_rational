You are very kind to say the writing quality being not jaw dropping. I read this in RoyalRoadl and the transition from fun adventure in a cave into high-stake combat involving side character newly introduced is a nose dive, imo. To expand; POV keep changing, priority getting reshuffled again and again without strong cause, with just slightest clue about what's actually happening. It was confusing. After finding such confusing style persists for several chapters, I just did not have the will to go on.

Actually, that stage will become much more readable if author spare some chapters early on to show readers who the characters are, what's their motives, how they react in tense situation. What I've read, author only describe them. That only enough for relaxing type of adventure.
