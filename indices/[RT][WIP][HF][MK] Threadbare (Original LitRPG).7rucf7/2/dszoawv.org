Dunno about [rt].

  The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.

The fictional world's rules keep getting adjusted because of all the new skills.

  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

In concert with the first point, the characters get new skills as they're needed to overcome challenges, because the plot requires the characters to live.

I do like the story though.
