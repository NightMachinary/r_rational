The consistent rules bit I can probably let go because the part that's inconsistent is the magic system and then HPMOR would be inconsistent because it has spells too. The overworld system itself is pretty consistent.

[[/u/Flashbunny]] agreed about the characters getting skills they need in the beginning of the story and [[/u/LordGoldenroot]] agreed that a character got a skill that might have been crucial in one of the latest chapters. So I think we have a consensus that while this story may not break that rule as bad as something like yu gi oh, it does dabble in deus ex machina periodically (though infrequently) and I'd therefore think it's not really [rt].
