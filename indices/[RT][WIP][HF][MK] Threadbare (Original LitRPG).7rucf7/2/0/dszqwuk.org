The world does have consistent overarching rules. (Well, in the recent past those rules have changed, but that's a big plot point.) That the characters are unlocking new skills and abilities isn't inconsistent with the worldbuilding at all - if entirely new ways of gaining skills were suddenly introduced, that might be an issue, but that the characters don't have access to all information and powers from the start doesn't break that rule.

I also don't think the plot is pulling new skills out to "save" the characters. In the beginning this was arguably the case, because starting from nothing meant that whatever they gained in the short term (when levels are easier to gain) would be used to solve the immediate issues relating to "not dying". Later on though, the characters develop skills much more slowly - where skills are needed to overcome a specific issue, the characters clearly work towards unlocking said skills, rather than them dropping from heaven into their hands. That's just making use of the existing system that they're aware of.

I appreciate this genre (where discrete new abilities appear as characters progress) does often fail as you've described, but I don't think it's happening here.
