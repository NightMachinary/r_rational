  The fictional world's rules keep getting adjusted because of all the new skills.

I haven't read all of Threadbare, but this does not strike me as inherently irrational -- changing rules and paradigms are a natural part of how the real world operates.

For example, in the early part of the middle ages, one of the "rules" of conventional warfare was that stone castle walls were an impregnable barrier, and most methods of assaulting a castle consisted of trying to surround it and cut it off from outside resources and trying to indirectly attack the castle's occupants with hunger, disease, and thirst rather than trying to actually penetrate the stone walls.

Then humanity unlocked the "cannon" skill and the rules changed.

Whether rule changes "makes sense" is mostly related to how closely these rules can be tied back to first principles. For example, we can treat "gravity" is a first principle (or about as close as you can get to it), while "it's impossible for a human to vertically jump 3 meters" is not. If tomorrow we discovered a human who had a vertical jump of 3 meters, it would defy a lot of assumptions, and break a lot of ideas that athletic coaches have probably been enshrined as "rules" about what the human body is capable of, but it wouldn't fundamentally alter our understanding of the universe.
