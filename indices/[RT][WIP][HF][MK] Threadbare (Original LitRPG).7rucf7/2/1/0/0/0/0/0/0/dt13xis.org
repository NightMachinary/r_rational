Really, "rapid healing by accelerated cell division" runs aground on the shores of modern physics just as hard as teleportation, it just bothers your intuitions less.

(For what it's worth, the "healing" thing bothers my intuitions less too. My sense is that "(living) objects change over time" is fairly natural, while things having to move through space at a finite speed is an object permanence thing, or something innate in the way I run my visio-spatial sketchpad.)

That said, we've been pretty sure that the world of Threadbare doesn't run on physics for a /long/ time. [[#s][spoilers]]
