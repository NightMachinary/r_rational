Eh, Ok, actually doing the calculations for relatively minor healing (the 10g of muscle required to close the stab wound - that number pulled from thin air) shows that it only requires about 9000J of energy to be dissipated. While this would boil the effected tissue twice over if done instantly, it could probably wouldn't cook anything if it happened over a couple minutes.

Over a couple minute time frame, you can probably scavenge the required protein from the blood, though you'll be essentially loosing a small quantity (~1/3 pint) and replacing it with saline. You almost certainly need new blood vessels to form to feed the rapidly growing tissue, but that's no big deal, I suppose.

I'm pretty sure you still need the literal "exotic magical nanoassembly" function of the exogenous enzymes, but you /might/ still be in the same genre.
