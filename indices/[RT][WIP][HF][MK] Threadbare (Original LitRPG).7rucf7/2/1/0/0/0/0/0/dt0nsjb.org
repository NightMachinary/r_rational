I don't think healing is as big a departure from the laws of nature as something like teleportation is. Healing in golems in particular seems to be pretty straightforward because they're just cloth and stuffing so the stuffing can repair its host by just dividing until it finishes filling its container like mold or bacteria and then the cloth can repair itself like skin in humans. Healing in humans and animals can be explained by some factor that reduces the odds of cancer since AFAIK the biggest hurdle to rapid healing in animals in nature is cancer resulting from cell division that is too rapid to correct for genetic mistakes.

There's nothing in nature that can suggest any method for teleportation to be possible, that's why I think once that's introduced physics go out of the window.
