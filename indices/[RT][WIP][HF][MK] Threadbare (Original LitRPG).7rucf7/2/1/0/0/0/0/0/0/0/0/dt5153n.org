It's possible that we have different definitions of "fast" here. I'm expecting "heal" to cure a stab wound in less than 6 seconds. (1D6/round or so, right?)

1) Normal healing is a metabolically expensive process. It takes a lot of calories to do, and generates a lot of waste heat. Where's the heat go? (First law of thermodynamics)

2) There was loss of blood and perhaps other tissues. These need to be replaced. Where's the mass come from? (Conservation of mass)

3) Cells depend on enzymically catalyzed chemical reactions to do things like heal - reactions which often only don't go faster because the enzymes are working full time - "rate limited by availability of enzymes". Healing magic would either have to provide this cellular machinery (not enough room to put it), change the laws of chemistry (requires changes to how quantum mechanics works), or change how fast time goes (yikes).
