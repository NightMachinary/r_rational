Earlier, and below, I am assuming the energy consumption during healing occurs only in the tissues being healed:

2000calories / 10 grams = 200 c/g = Δ200°C

200°C is twice the boiling point of water, so "boil it twice over". If we wish to be pedantic, we may note that, of course, the liquid can't reach 200°C - it boils first, so instead:

10g water @ 40°C + 200c/g → 7.5g water @ 100°C + 2.5g steam @ 100°C

Depending on the speed of the healing, this steam either: Doesn't exist, because the healing is slow enough that conduction ensures that the tissues never get that hot; escapes slowly, cooking the adjacent tissues in the wound; violently blows the healed tissue apart, as 1 cm³ rapidly tries to occupy 2000 cm³.

The above of course entails making a silly assumption that these enzymatic processes continue, regardless of the temperature of the place that they are occurring - but that's half the point. Steam is hot; if the tissue gets hot enough to boil, things like "replace the damaged proteins with intact ones" become impossible, as the new ones are immediately denatured (cooked; destroyed) by the heat. (And it should be noted that conventional enzymes are proteins, BTW.)

(BTW, I like how you kept three/four digits on my calculations. Let's just say that my sources were of the ±10% nature, and that only got worse during the three steps of mental math involved...)

Anyways, yes, if you wish to modify the body in advance if the insult, more options open up. My own opinion is that, at that point, you might as well just replace the flesh with magical steel, but to each his own...
