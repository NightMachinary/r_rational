I'm not sure where you're getting the "boiling twice over" part.

9 kJ is 2151 calories, which is enough to raise body-temperature water (probably not too far off) to boiling point, and then convert it into steam approximately 0.4 times. You'd suffer severe local burns, but it wouldn't be boiling the tissue.

As for the general argument, I'm not convinced you couldn't get around that. For example, by storing reservoirs of these building blocks/enzymes/more efficient enzymes throughout the body, paired with more nutrient flow in the blood than typical, with damage triggering a local release. This would especially be the case if the healing process was prioritized. For example, stop bleeding fast, rebuild a basic "scaffold" within a seconds/a minute, and then fully regenerate the tissue and restore functionality between minutes to maybe an hour.

I mean, we're talking about non-real world fiction, so there's already a certain level of suspension of disbelief involved.
