I'm just going off the sidebar criteria for [rt]. Having said that,

  Whether rule changes "makes sense" is mostly related to how closely these rules can be tied back to first principles. For example, we can treat "gravity" is a first principle (or about as close as you can get to it), while "it's impossible for a human to vertically jump 3 meters" is not. If tomorrow we discovered a human who had a vertical jump of 3 meters, it would defy a lot of assumptions, and break a lot of ideas that athletic coaches have probably been enshrined as "rules" about what the human body is capable of, but it wouldn't fundamentally alter our understanding of the universe.

I'd argue that depends on how the jump was accomplished. If it was done because there was faster than light communication between the jumper's nerves and muscles, that's pretty major. Same if it was done because energy was created out of nothing to give lift and same if during the jump the jumper's bones magically withstood the pressure despite material physics dictating that they should break.

If the jump is within the range of possibility provided by human biology and it happened because of training, etc. then sure it wouldn't mean much for the world of academia.
