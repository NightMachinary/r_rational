For me, Threadbare was most enjoyable when it wasn't trying to be much more than a fun, unique take on the litrpg genre that didn't take itself overly seriously and focused on its protagonist.

As soon as the author started changing the tone a little, prioritising plot more and adding in side characters left right and centre, it exposed the quality of the writing a lot more. When i'm reading a story that's aim is to be fun and not take itself too seriously then i'm a lot more lax in how critical i am of character motivation, competence, realism etc. but as soon as that tone starts to shift i feel the standard i hold the story up to starts to shift with it. And Threadbare hasn't really met that standard for me.

Ceclia and Fluffbear are the only side characters i have any real attachment too, I don't particularly care about Cylvania or its citizens, i dont believe many of the characters have strong motivations or more than the smallest amount of depth and i don't find the plot particularly engrossing. None of this is overly surprising when the author is pumping out 5k words a day but if you're going to pump out 5k words a day in effort of a story with a large character list and a 'serious' plot with 'serious' consequences then, well, good luck.
