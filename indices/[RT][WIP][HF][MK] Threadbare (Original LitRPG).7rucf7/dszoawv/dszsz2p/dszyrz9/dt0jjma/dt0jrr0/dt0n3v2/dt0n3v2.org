Well, I dunno if magic eliminates a tendency (or reasonable expectation on the part of the audience) for consistency of physics.

Magic in threadbare seems to "just do what it's supposed to": healing /increases health/... Why do you ask? What's that have do do with the /giblets/? I would be surprised if something had mechanistic consequences. (but not that surprised - as someone noted, the author is going /fast/ and is quite eager to introduce new details... (Nevermind that characters have pretty solid plot armor.))
