Yeah 6 seconds probably does violate physics. To address your concerns when a longer timespan is the baseline though:

#+begin_quote
  Where's the heat go?
#+end_quote

Radiated from the skin. So I guess a 6 second heal would leave whoever is healing that way with burns.

#+begin_quote
  There was loss of blood and perhaps other tissues. These need to be replaced. Where's the mass come from?
#+end_quote

Same place the mass comes from in any other healing, the nutrients broken down from previously ingested food/fats.

#+begin_quote
  Cells depend on enzymically catalyzed chemical reactions to do things like heal - reactions which often only don't go faster because the enzymes are working full time - "rate limited by availability of enzymes". Healing magic would either have to provide this cellular machinery (not enough room to put it), change the laws of chemistry (requires changes to how quantum mechanics works), or change how fast time goes (yikes).
#+end_quote

Maybe a new enzyme that would make for a better catalyzer and therefore faster reactions? It's not physically impossible for a better enzyme to do that, is it?
