  "At the moment" is kinda vague but by upvotes and discussion this subreddit is a "mother of learning" discussion and fan forum that sometimes talks about rationality and other stories.

I feel like upvotes within this sub is a reasonable metric of popularity and that popularity among [[/r/rational][r/rational]] subscribers is useful evidence to give to someone posting to this sub if they're trying to determine whether to start a fiction.

If i completely misunderstood you and you're comment was aimed at my misstatement that WTC was the most popular fic on this sub then yes, MOL is more popular though i did edit my comment to this effect immediately after posting and realising.
