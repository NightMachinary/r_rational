Character development in /Worth the Candle/ is much deeper. The problem of Threadbare is it's difficult to add much character depth to toy bear. He/It don't have history or memories. It's quite like to write about non-humanoid alien. It's either too human or too alien to care. The protagonist character is threadbare by necessity.
