So what now Bard? I mean you said to the Swordsman that her brand of Evil wasn't guaranteed, that the gains for the small folk weren't set in stone but enforced by a single regimes strength and that it could all end with the next Dread Emperor/Empress? We've seen the little bits of influence that she had on the Tyrant, the Dead King and even bits of a plan for Amadeus. So what does she see wrong here?

I mean Cat's big thing is the somewhere between transitions and the finding of a "Better Way/World" we've seen here marry Praes training with the steadfast nature of the Callow people, we've seen her marry Summer and Winter ending their reigns for the possibility of something new, we've seen her change in both big and small ways the Drow's culture all the way up to influencing the Night Goddesses themselves to be better. So why is there only a problem now Bard?
