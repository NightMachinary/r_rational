In one of cordelias interludes is showed that the saint influenced the priests to name cat the arch heretic of the east and making every treaty with her invalid and peace wih her almost imposible. This would in turn deprive cordelia of allies/give her another enemy while the dead king pounded the door and eventually destroy the principate. All that because the saint though that the principate is rotten to the core and must be cleansed.
