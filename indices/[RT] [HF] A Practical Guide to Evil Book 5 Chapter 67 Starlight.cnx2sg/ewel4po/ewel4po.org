Looks like this is probably the last chance to theorycraft on the Bard's plans. Final theory from me is that the Liesse Accords are what she's been working towards. She's:

- Made sure the Doom happened to give Cat the idea.

- Killed Captain to make sure Black would take her seriously as a threat and destroy the weapon.

- Set up a Crusade against Praes so Malicia would make a deal with the Dead King to get everyone at the bargaining table

- Broke Cordelia's trust in the heroes and made sure peace couldn't be made with Callow so that the only route possible for Procer to survive would be through the Accords.

- Stripped Hierophant of his magic too...idk, we'll see what happens. Maybe so Sve Noc would end up reading his mind, and then they'd get a wake up call against blindly walking into stories that'll kill them and obliterate the drow, who'll probably be a key part of the Accords.
