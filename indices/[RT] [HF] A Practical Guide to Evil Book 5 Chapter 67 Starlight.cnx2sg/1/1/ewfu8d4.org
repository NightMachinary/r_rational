It can't /just/ be that. Remember, the Dead King (who was risking - and ended up losing - a /piece of his soul/ to perform a ritual to find out) heavily implied that if the heroes and villains knew just what the Bard was up to, they'd all turn on her in an instant.

The Liesse Accords are definitely a piece of it, but, if that were all, why would old Neshamah think that people would be /that/ pissed off at her? Sure, this plan of hers has cost hundreds of thousands of lives, but it has the potential to save tens of millions, or more. The heroes would grumble at the methods used but bow to the greater good, and the villains would applaud the sheer ruthlessness she used to achieve her goals.

No, there's something else she's trying to accomplish. Something that requires the Liesse Accords, yes, but something a lot less popular than those have proven to be.

And I can't wait to see what it is.
