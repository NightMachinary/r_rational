If you like rational fiction, then you can read Savage Divinity as 'rational protagonist against an irrational world', with some mental trauma thrown in as spice.

If you like rebirth / transported, then this is one of the better selections available in that genre.

If you like Wuxia, then Savage Divinity can scratch that itch without the broken English and bad grammar you would be subjected to while reading most of the other content in the genre.

If you don't like Wuxia... well, give it a try and it might change your mind.
