Seconded.

This story also suffers from a real lack of good villains. [[#s][spoilers]]

Also, just look at this chapter. I know for a fact that no one is gonna tell this concubine goddamn anything. This whole "teacher" thing is gonna last a really long time, and no one is going to fill in this lady in on the culture of Bekhai. She's a professional political concubine, shouldn't adapting to different cultures be something she's trained in? Instead she just assumes the worst out of the mc because he, a young adult who they know is new to the city from an isolated mountain culture, isn't perfectly fulfilling a role in their culture.
