I have actually submitted this story before about two years ago. I thought it was worth resubmitting, especially since the author has been very productive in that time.

The reason that I submitted a bunch today was because I just got the end of Joie de Vivre and Far Strider by Raga which are both more traditional Rationalist Fiction. Basically self-insert fanfics where the MC munchkins the magic the industrialize the settings.
