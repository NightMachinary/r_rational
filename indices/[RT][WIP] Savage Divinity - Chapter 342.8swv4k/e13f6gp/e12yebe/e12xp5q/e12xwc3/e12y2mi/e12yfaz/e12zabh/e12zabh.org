I find the world building to be very good. The author does a very good job thinking through the consequences of how the "magic" of the world effects how people and society work. The focus of the story is not really science industrization (that is more of a side plot that has come into focus in the last few chapters). I definitely find that the story follows the characteristics of a rational story.

Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.
