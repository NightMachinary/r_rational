Here is the story description

A modern man finds himself reincarnated in the body of a young slave with no skills and quickly fading memories. Follow his journey to find normalcy while living in a savage world, filled with myth and legends, monsters and Demons. In a land where the strong rule, the weak serve, and bloodshed is a way of life, peace is a luxury few can afford.

This is a cultivation style story and in my personal opinion one of the best. The author dispenses some of the worst traits of these types of story's. Arbitrary levels and non sensical exponential economies. The MC slowly gains power and tries (most often failing) to use science to revolutionize the world. Another it is really only after ~300 chapters that you start to see this. The reasons that he fails so often is because this is a different world then ours and the author has well reasoned world building to explain why gun for example would not work.

I also find the characters well rounding and the story over has made me laugh out load a lot and nearly cry serval times.
