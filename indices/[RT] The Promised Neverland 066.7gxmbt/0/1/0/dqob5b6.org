  I hope it isn't him. Because it would imply that the farmers and the poachers are working together, which would make the world of the monsters feel less interesting in my opinion.

Fair. I do think having competing factions is more interesting from a world building standpoint.

  Or it's possible that he escapes on his own, but even that makes all the trouble they went through trying to escape seem trivial. Especially since they likely know that he knows the truth at that point.

Agreed. I doubt he escaped on his own, but I do expect some sort of twist with his fate at some point, even if it isn't this soon.
