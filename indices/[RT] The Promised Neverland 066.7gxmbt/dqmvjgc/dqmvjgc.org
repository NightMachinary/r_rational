I already had my doubts, but now I'm seriously questioning whether Minerva ever existed.

Either he was just a fabrication made by the poachers to lure unsuspecting children to their hunting grounds, or the poachers somehow discovered that escaped children where gathering at that place and decided to make it their base of operations.

Or alternatively Minerva was fully aware that he was leading the children to the base of the poachers, but there is some vital reason that the children must go there in order to cross the boarder to the human world (or accomplish whatever Minerva's real objective is).

Either way, it seems as if the children can no longer fully rely on Minerva's information to lead them to safety.
