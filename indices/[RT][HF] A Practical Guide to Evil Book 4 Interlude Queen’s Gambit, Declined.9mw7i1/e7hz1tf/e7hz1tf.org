well shit. An unexpected place for the end of the Black knight, but I suspect this move and the pilgrim himself needing to come down and deal with him will leave a shit ton of headaches for Cordelia to deal with. The use of the plague, taking heroes off the dead king's frontline, the major part of the legions and grem still being in one piece... even after he's dead Black will continue to cause his enemies problems.

Also wondering if the knife wound Cat gave him had maybe a sliver of winter in it... considering the whole talk about the "ways of the younglings" and how they must earn the right to shape the world...

oh

Ok so here's a hypothesis... from the beginning of the story, the Black knight was an oddity in that he was pragmatic and practical in the way he did things. He did not slaughter people "just for evulz". Right from the start of the story, he was shown to be having less Name power to draw from compared to his predecessors because of him not sticking to the role. The further you stray from the role, the weaker your Name becomes.

And now, after breaking with the Dread Empress, his reserve is at an all time low. The Black Knight role was never meant to exist solo, it always had someone it swore fealty to, someone to eventually betray. Till the last moment Black went against Malicia's wishes at only one crucial point, and arguably that was the height of his pure Name power.

But it wasn't followed up by climbing the tower, deviating from the role even more. Resulting in his Name power becoming so small he couldn't even directly do battle anymore (see Vales defence).

Remember that, near the end of Book 3, Black had already prepared to die and have Catherine take up his position as the Black Knight, but it was narrowly avoided.

I suspect (and the story hints) that Black very much knew his time was coming to an end. This whole expedition was simply to do whatever damage he could do to the principate while he lived.

BUT he also has unfinished business. The story of the Black Knight is linked to that of the Black Queen, as an observer. Black wants to /see/ the "Better World" that Catherine comes up with, even if he's not there to /experience/ it.

So here's what I think happened. Black has given Scribe his soul in a jar. That's why he wasn't recovering, using his aspect, or showing his Name at the end. So when he "dies", Scribe will get back to Catherine and Black will join Akua as a fellow soul-in-cape.

However, this is slightly less plausible since he doesn't have a master wizard with him right now. Thus, another alternative is that, along with being his "One last ride", this is also his way of testing Catherine. He has been branded with the weight of watching Catherine "make a better world" and then decide if he wants in or not. He knows he will die sooner or later, so along with doing a lot of damage, he wants to test how much "Weight" Catherine carries in the story. Whether that weight will prevent him from either dying/disappearing, either with a last minute save (unlikely) or the preservation of his soul (plausible). Black's plans, and their generation's plans in general, have almost always been win-win type plans. So this plan, centred around his eventual death, fits very well.

Back when Cat stabbed him, she was high on emotions and holding Winter's power. So I suspect Black has a small fragment of winter inside him. What it will do, we will come to see.

I'm pretty hyped.
