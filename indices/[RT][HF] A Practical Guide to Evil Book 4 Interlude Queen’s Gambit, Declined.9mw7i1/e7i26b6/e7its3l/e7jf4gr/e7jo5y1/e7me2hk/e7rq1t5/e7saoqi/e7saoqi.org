yeah but the problem during cat's fight is the law of conservation of ninjutsu, where multiple heroes were fighting one villain, which made it equally matched. In Champion v Captain, she had the story support because she was a hero fighting a monster who killed 72 virgins or whatever that levantine story was. What sort of story did the Pilgrim have to wield against Cat? He was part of yet another proceran expedition force wanting to subjugate callow, and she the rightful defender of her homeland, and doing so after multiple offers for peace were rejected. Which is why she avoided stuff like wide scale massacre until they were desperate, and when they did try it, it lead to both Cat and Masego being out of commission for a significant chunk of time. This, and Catherine being kinda-sorta peace oriented was the reason that ultimately the Pilgrim decided to try a redemption story on her.

I also kinda feel that, because of being sort of Fae-ish now, Catherine isn't as affected by stories set in creation, though this is unproved.
