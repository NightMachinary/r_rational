I'm saying story supporting heroes in general is ill-defined, since that's literally the only case where we've seen it work for the heroes- except no, we didn't even see it work. Any other time where you'd think it would help a hero, it doesn't, like when pilgrim was in his iconic story and not only couldn't touch cat he couldn't even save the younger heroes. It's essentially a deus-ex-machina for that one fight that doesn't even have the decency to let itself be shown on screen.
