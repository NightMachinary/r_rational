Her death was foreshadowed at the end of her interlude though. Yes she was dominating the fight, because she had control over her beast form. We know how, in any fight vs a hero, it isn't really a good idea to slowly beat them down, because they will eventually reach their lowest point, where heavenly intervention along with narrative can basically ensure their victory.

Remember how that interlude ended, Captain whipping the crap out of Champion, but slowly and steadily... and it ended with the beast starting a charge against the champion while "Sabah watched". Which sealed it.
