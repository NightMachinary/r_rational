Wasn't on screen; when we leave off captain is dominating the fight completely and utterly, even after champion whips out her aspects, and then bard talks her to death offscreen via an ill-defined story mechanism. It's slightly better of an example of heroes accomplishing stuff onscreen than, say, the defeat of triumphant, but /only/ slightly, particularly given that it required Bard, a specialized monster killing name, and sacrificing a different named to pull off.
