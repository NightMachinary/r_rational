  The Black Knight is most assuredly gone.

The Grey Pilgrim does seem to think Names can be stripped by Gods, so maybe it has been, and he is gone. Be a good story if the former villain, fighting for a future for his people, found himself attacked by heroes, cast overboard and survived with an entirely new (and neutral) name. Or even a heroic one, though you'd need to twist the Pilgrim's acts pretty hard to make it work.
