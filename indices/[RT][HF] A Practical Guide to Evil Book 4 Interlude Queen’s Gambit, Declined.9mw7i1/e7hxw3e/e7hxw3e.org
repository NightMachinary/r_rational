I'm holding out little to no hope of Black surviving this but what are his resources here for causing as much damage as possible?

*Goblin fire.* Filling his barge with goblin fire seems both the most plausible and the least likely as yet another trap and/or plan involving copious amounts of goblin fire in a single location would be seriously lackluster. I would also expect Pilgrim and co. to check the hold of the barge and those of the surrounding barges as the whole 'blow shit up with goblin fire' idea doesn't take a genius to come up with it.

*Warlock, Assassin & Ranger.* Going from least to most likely - *Ranger:* Apart from requiring an ability to cover huge amounts of ground in very little time it would also require him to have a way of contacting her without the help of anyone to scry. We've been given no hint that either of these things is possible so far. It would be petty much deus ex machina. Very unlikely.

*Warlock:* Him being able to travel vast distances in a short amount of time would be not entirely contrived bullshit. I could maybe, sorta, kinda see him having something like that in his bag of tricks that he could pull as a one off. I could certainly buy that Black has a way of contacting him over large distances. I don't buy it on a doylist level because a) separating Warlock and Black many chapters ago for no other reason but for Warlock to swoop in during his moment of need is lame and b) Warlock has his own plot over in the Wasteland that involves Masego and who knows what. That entire side plot becoming stillborn or simply existing as a way of separating and then rejoining Black and Warlock for dramatic effect would be some poor writing and i don't buy that EE would go for it.

*Assassin:* This seems by far the most likely. It's eminently plausible that he has been traveling with Black this entire time. He's been an enigma, linked to Black and the Calamities, and if there is going to be any pay off to his mystery then it's likely to be now before both his links to the story (Black and the Calamities as an entity) disappear.

We could spend time fruitlessly theorycrafting ways that Cat could save Black but the chances she up and takes a detour from her plot over with the drow is so unlikely that i'll let the more optimistic spend words on that.

Assassin + a Black with no Name and little to no resources is still supremely unlikely to come out of this alive but it is the sort of combination to do some damage before they go and I think that's probably the most we can hope for :(
