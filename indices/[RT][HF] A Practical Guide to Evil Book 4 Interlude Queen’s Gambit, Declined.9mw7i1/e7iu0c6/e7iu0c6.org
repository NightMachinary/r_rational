I have to say, I'm very pleased by this chapter. Black was a treat, ranker was a treat, the proceran guard captain felt like a real person, Auger's handling was about as good as could be expected given the circumstances, and we've finally seen a bit of heroes living up to their own hype. I haven't liked a chapter from PGtE this much in a long while, but this makes up for a lot.
