Holy. Shit.

I ... I've gotten so used to seeing The Grey Pilgrim as just Gandalf if he were a human instead of a maiar. His hypocrisy regarding the "greater good" back when Cat approached him with terms I took to be a significant, but not unrealistic character flaw.

This, though. Goddamn. I can't really call him a hero after this. It might be that the Gods Above and Below are pushing "Good" and "Evil", but it's pretty clear at this point that those words don't mean the same thing as "good" and "evil" at /all//
