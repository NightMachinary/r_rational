I'm still not sure why Black thought this invasion was a good idea, but here we are.

  “Planning too deep will be seen through by the Augur,” Amadeus reminded her. “We stay a step ahead so long as we make short-term decisions backed by superior pace.”
#+end_quote

I'm glad the Augur has finally been addressed. Her powers are the sort that they loom over most every conflict, and the fact that no one but Black seems to think about her will, I assume, bite a lot of people in the ass sooner or later.

But I still don't know how she failed to see that Black had spent months rigging a mountain to explode onto the Crusade.

  “I can think of few things more foolish than to underestimate Alaya,” he quietly said. “Even now. She's never been one to act without a plan, and that we do not understand her moves should be source of fear and not contempt.”

  “Odds are she's the one who made a pact with the Dead King,” Ranker said.

  “It could have been Catherine as well,” Amadeus frankly admitted. “She thrives in chaotic situations. It's led her to the bad habit of creating them knowing it improves her chances of victory even if it significantly increases collateral damage as well.”

  “The Black Queen,” the goblin mused. “There's another trash fire of a situation. One you've stepped lightly around.”

  “The Conquest was a way to achieve objectives,” Amadeus said. “The annexation was ultimately a consequence, not the purpose itself. I hardly mind surrendering unnecessary gains if the actual objectives are met through the gesture.”

  “The arithmetic holds,” Ranker sighed. “It always does with you. But there's more to this than the numbers, old friend. We made an order of things, and now it's crumbling.”

  “And now you wonder what will replace it,” Amadeus said. “And if in that new order, we will still have a place.”
#+end_quote

I figure this is full of foreshadowing. If the story turns to Cat vs Alaya with the Liesse Accords as a centre point, which very much seems to be happening, then this segment will be good to keep in mind.

The entire Black and Ranker talk is great. I'm quite sad to see Ranker go.

  Then dawn came, and with first light came the realization that the Praesi were gone.

So the Iserre plan failed, as absolutely everyone expect Cordelia knew it would. Interestingly, it would have failed even if Black, barring heroic intervention.

Still, she has the Grey Pilgrim there to clean up her messes.

  Crafting the plague had been easy as snapping his fingers, and mayhaps that was the most distressing part of it. The Enemy delighted in displaying its power, raising massive contraptions or weaving elaborate schemes to praise its own cunning and cleverness. Like it was the only side capable of doing those things, like it wasn't a choice to turn away from the unsightly means of the Gods Below. The Grey Pilgrim could have birthed diseases and disasters that would raise the hair on the Warlock's neck, if he so wished.
#+end_quote

And the Pilgrim, it turns out, is quite terrifying. The Army of Callow should be grateful that he didn't birth any "diseases or disasters" against them. I'd worry about the possibility of him having set something into motion during his short stay in Callow, but most everyone else who was there is dead now anyway.

And we learnt more about Heroes and the Choirs, and Mercy in particular, which was quite cool. Actually, there was a lot of fun little lore tidbits through this chapter.

  The Black Knight, Tariq thought, was not a stupid man. But he'd been arrogant enough to think he saw all the rules of his world, and arrogance was ever the death of villains.
#+end_quote

Well if anything was ever going to kill Black, it would be his own arrogance. I'm a little surprised that his blind spot is "other cultures exist", but I guess that's what you get for crushing the same enemies again and again for decades. Still, you assume he would have learnt from bard pulling a similar kind of trick with stories rooted in Levantinian culture (although that was wordplay, rather than a different breed of hero).

Still, I'm not going to complain too much about heroes /actually achieving something/ for once.

  “Let's see,” Amadeus of the Green Stretch said, “if I can at least leave a mark.”
#+end_quote

And that's the end of Black, unless he pulls a serious deus ex machina out of nowhere. Which is possible, I guess, especially considering that there's unresolved weirdness around him being brought up in the chapter and that it'd be a little sad for him to go off-screen. But I think he's gone. Which is a big shame, considering he's consistently been one of the characters I've been interested in watching, far and above the Woe. He'll be missed.

(Well, until Cat super-necromancies him back, or whatever, which I wouldn't be surprised by).
