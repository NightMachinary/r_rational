That's what gets me. We already know he is able and willing to use body-doubles to escape otherwise unwinable situations. What better way to accomplish this goal than to put a green-eyed soldier in his armor after having his mages make him somehow immune, then swim to shore himself? He could also have used Alaya's body double trick to do it.

It's worth noting that he's still accomplished his stated goal of controlling the location of the heroic response. Tariq is probably days from anywhere important, and the majority of Black's force is still alive out there. This could all have been a feint to misdirect a dangerous foe.
