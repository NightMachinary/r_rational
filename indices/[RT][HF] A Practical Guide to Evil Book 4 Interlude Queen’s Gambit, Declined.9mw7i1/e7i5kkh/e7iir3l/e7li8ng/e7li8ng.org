Meh. Captain was a side character who I barely remember. I don't even recall why she could turn into a beast anymore. Black, our beloved psychopath, will leave a big gaping hole in the story that the loss of Captain can't remotely compare to. This isn't about that people can die. It's about whether important people and emotionally close(to the reader) characters can die.
