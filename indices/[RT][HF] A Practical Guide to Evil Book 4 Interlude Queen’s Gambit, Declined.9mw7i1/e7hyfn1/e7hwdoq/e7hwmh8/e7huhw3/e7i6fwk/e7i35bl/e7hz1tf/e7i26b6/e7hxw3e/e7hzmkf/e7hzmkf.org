I think Black knew that he was going to die soon either way. But I suspect that he will live on, as either undead, a winter court member or a soul-in-cape.

Deus ex machina isn't really erraticerrata's style, so I suspect that this is really Black. Assassin has been conspicuously absent for the entire book, likely helping Cat behind the scenes since thief isn't really much good against Malicia. I suspect the reason Malicia hasn't been able to destroy Callow even after all the murder, and Thief having second thoughts, is because Assassin is working behind the scenes.
