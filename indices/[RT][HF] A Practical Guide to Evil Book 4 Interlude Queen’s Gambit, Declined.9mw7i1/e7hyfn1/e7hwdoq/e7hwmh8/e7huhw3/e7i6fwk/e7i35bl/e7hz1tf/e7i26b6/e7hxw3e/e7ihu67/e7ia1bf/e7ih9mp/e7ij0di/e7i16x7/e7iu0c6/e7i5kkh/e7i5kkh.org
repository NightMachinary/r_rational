I'm sort of torn about this. We haven't seen any of the important characters dying off yet though I keep getting the impression that it's absolutely possible. In a sense I would like for Black to die here just so I can be more on edge about the other characters. Simultaneously I hope that he'll survive because he's an interesting character.
