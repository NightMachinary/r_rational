I think Thief and Cat show that letting go of a Name isn't limited to Usurpation, divine intervention or geographic location. Role alone plays an important part not to mention everything else. Furthermore the Gods Below have never been shown to intervene in such a way and why would taking his name away be worth the cost of intervention when his death looks assured. Not to mention he was still giving Good a good kick in the teeth.
