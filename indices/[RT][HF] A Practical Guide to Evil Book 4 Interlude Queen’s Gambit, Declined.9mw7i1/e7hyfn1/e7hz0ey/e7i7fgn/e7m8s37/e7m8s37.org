The GA and GB perspective of good and evil is like ours but with the value of human life and agency reduced to how we think of bugs or rodents. Does crushing a bug, or even a few hundred, make you evil? Of course not. In this perspective of good and evil, Praesi are like locusts, Procerans like grasshoppers.

IMO that one change changes it completely but from another angle its just one small change.
