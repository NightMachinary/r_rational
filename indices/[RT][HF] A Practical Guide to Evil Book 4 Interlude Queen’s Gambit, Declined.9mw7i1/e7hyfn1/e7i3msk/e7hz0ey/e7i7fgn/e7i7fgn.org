    “it always messes with me having to remember that the way that Good and Evil are defined is distinct from actual benevolence or malevolence and other things associated with the lower case good and evil”

  I don't recall ever stating that. *The Gods Above and Below do roughly correspond to “lower case” good and evil, as far as entities that far removed from mortals can be understood.* That neither side of the equation intervenes directly means there's a lot of room for interpretation in the respective philosophies they preach, but the bare bones are there.

Although independent vs god-directed is definitely another point of delineation between the two sides.
