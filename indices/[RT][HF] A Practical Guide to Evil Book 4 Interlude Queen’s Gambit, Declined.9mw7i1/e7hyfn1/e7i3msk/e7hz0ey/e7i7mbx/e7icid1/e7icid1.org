I get his perspective, and maybe I've just been drinking the wasteland kool-aid a bit much, but killing 2000 soldiers and ~100 civilians with what amounts to biological warfare isn't what I'd call heroic behavior.

It's unfair/asymmetric that the heroes have to not just win, but win in a way that upholds their ideals and vision for a world that's better for those around them, but that's also why they get the balance of Creation itself tilted in their favor.

Yeah, it's definitely a great way to get Good to win the present conflict, but if that's to be worth anything, I have to imagine the result of the victory has to be something other than "those in power use whatever means necessary at their disposal to ensure their dominance and control". Sure, we can kinda hope that the government/world vision that the Pilgrim would prop up would be somehow better than one run by villains, but at the same time, I can't really imagine Cat killing a hundred Callowans as collateral damage to kill off an expeditionary force. Hell, she deliberately pulled her punches against Procer to ensure they wouldn't be too resentful of fighting her to consider peace terms.

Cat's maybe not a fair comparison since her villainess status is more a label than a descriptor at this point, but I gotta be honest in saying that given the choice I'd rather live in her Callow than the Pilgrim's Procer at this minute.
