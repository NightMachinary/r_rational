  This, though. Goddamn. I can't really call him a hero after this.

Can't you?

I can kind of understand his perspective, honestly. He knows that Black is planning to loot cities (and sack them if they fight back) to undermine Cordelia right when she's about to face the Dead King.

He used an incredibly efficient weapon to make sure that didn't happen, and made himself feel the pain of everyone the weapon killed. I mean, sure, in the big picture he's working to sustain entrenched power structures that favor the powerful over the masses, but overall his actions are consistent with that of a really, really ruthless hero.
