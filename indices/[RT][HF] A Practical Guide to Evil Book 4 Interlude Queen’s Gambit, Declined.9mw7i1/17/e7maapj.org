It does seem like EE wrote himself into a corner on this one. On the one hand, letting Black live seems very narratively cheap, on the other, having Black still present on the ship seems incredibly out of character. Even if Black's trying to get himself killed.

Edit: I mean sure, the hints are there. GP is playing the roles of at least 3 kinds of archvillain and attacks in a group while BK is the underdog, which guarantees a win for BK and BK has all kinds of unusually flawed reasoning behind his actions in this chapter which hints that they're really excuses for something he doesn't want to reveal but it still feels like only disappointment can come of this setup. Well, disappointment and an unresolved cliffhanger as we get back to Cat next chapter.
