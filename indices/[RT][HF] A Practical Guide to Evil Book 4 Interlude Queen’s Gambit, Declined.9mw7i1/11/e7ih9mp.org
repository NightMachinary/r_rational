I know I've said it before that the Wednesday cliffhangers are particularly depressive as a general rule, but /holy shit/.

Black Knight still has an opportunity to survive, even narratively - fourteen thousand legionaries and Scribe are not the kind of assets the Story would just leave lying around until the heroes come for their heads - yet from his narration we know this isn't something he would (or had time to) plan for. Sure, the rest of the army is marching towards the same coast he's been sailing for, they have at least one (regretfully vulnerable to heroes) flying asset, and Amadeus had a couple of days to recuperate, but the best preparation he could have managed would be to raise as many corpses onboard, maybe a few snipers on the neighbouring ships, and mine the prospective battlefield to high holy hell.

We've all been optimistic for the Capitain, when this happened the first time, but this is the same setup she died from: going in blind, losing access to their powers (disobeying Black for Sabah, losing everyone under his command for him), getting cornered by Bard-assisted heroes armed by an unforeseen story. That might be it for Amadeus.
