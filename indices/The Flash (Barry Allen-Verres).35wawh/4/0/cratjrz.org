I actually have a character a bit like this in my Change Storms series. ([[http://www.amazon.com/Position-Fragile-Change-Storms-Book-ebook/dp/B00XER9MPA][First book available on Amazon]], /shameless.)

What she does is steal time from her future self. She can say "I'm taking two minutes from my five-minutes-from-now self." She now has two minutes which the rest of the universe doesn't have -- everything is completely frozen around her. [1] In five minutes she will automatically time travel two minutes into the future; the rest of the universe has time she doesn't.

[1] There's a few provisos about "the four fundamental forces work" so she can see, and she has a small aura that she can use to pull things into her timeline so she can interact with them, etc.
