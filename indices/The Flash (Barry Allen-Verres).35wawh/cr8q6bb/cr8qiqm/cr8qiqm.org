That's... not anything close to like The Flash in almost any way. You just created a brand new superhero that has nothing to do with this thread. That's not even super speed. That's super cognition. That's like saying Rational Thor would just be a guy who's immune to lightning. If you're gonna try and sell me a concept for Rational Flash, at least make it someone supersonic next time.
