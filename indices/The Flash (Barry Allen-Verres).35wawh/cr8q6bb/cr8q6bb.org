Super-speed is already a complete and utter game-breaker. Applying rationality to it is just going to turn it into a munchkining exercise.

So.. Very limited super speed.

"Esprit the Hyper-escalier"; Thanks to an encounter with an alien auto-doctor that decided to treat a neurological disorder the obvious way, your brain has been scooped out and replaced by an equal-sized chunk of computronium running a Moravec upload of your gray matter with the problem edited out. Computronium is, of course, orders of magnitude more efficient at computing than neural tissue, so even after paying the emulation "tax", this gives you the ability to slow your subjective perception of time down by a factor of up to 951 to one. This does /not/ make you able to move 951 times as fast. Your body is flesh and bone. At maximum speedup, you are effectively a lock-in case inside a statue that responds at the speed of a glacier. You can do as much thinking as you like and can tolerate in this state however.
