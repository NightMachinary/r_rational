I didn't actually read very much of it (I found the style somewhat odd), and I'm not that knowledgeable about Flash, but in the first chapter the main character has to save her friend from getting hit by a truck when her friend is in an unknown overseas country. It ends up taking her 3 seconds to travel from somewhere in the U.S. to London.

EDIT: I found the summary. "This is the first chapter of a novel I wrote, The Fall of Doc Future, set in a world similar to the present day, except with metahumans. I consider it Science Fiction or â€˜Hard Fantasy'--there are unusual abilities, but I try to treat the consequences seriously and consistently. The main characters are Doc Future, the smartest man in the world, currently having issues with insomnia; his adopted daughter Flicker, a speedster and high functioning autistic; her best friend, Dr. Stella Reinhart, a mind control researcher who does a few other things as well; and Donner, a metahuman rock musician with an unusual voice. It's about 170k words. I will be publishing a cleaned up ebook version at some point, so watch this site if you are interested. Follow the previous and next links at the top and bottom of each chapter to read in chronological order. Enjoy! - WDR"
