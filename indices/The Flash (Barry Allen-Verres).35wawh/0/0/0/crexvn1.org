I'd actually like to hear your take on how you can beat an FTL opponent when you're not FTL yourself. The obvious thought would be "lay a trap", but I can't think of any trap operating at sub-light speeds that could affect a FTL target, short of a wall.

That reminds me of EVN:Delphi, in whose universe it was discovered that putting FTL drives on your nuclear missiles was really quite effective and rather hard to counter. Nowadays, capital starships do battle at very long distances, and whoever has the best sensor technology wins. (The game is a yet-unpublished mod that has been in the work for nearly 10 years, but the author /still/ regularly posts high-resolution graphics for more ships he's designed. It's honestly ridiculous, and I will play it some day even if I need to dig up an ancient computer to run the game.)
