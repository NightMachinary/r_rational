I like how happy he is. He takes some real joy in being a superhero, in a way that Superman, Green Lantern, and Batman only rarely do. He runs at a significant fraction of the speed of light, and he's /laughing/ because of how amazing it is. Spider-man is one of the only other superheroes to do that, and with him it always comes off as something of a defense mechanism. With the Flash, he's laughing because he likes his life. (Which is not to say that Flash hasn't gone dark and brooding - but DC superheroes are mythological, and they cover a much wider range of characterization than Marvel heroes. The Platonic ideal of Flash, in my mind, is happy in a way that the other members of the Justice League are not.)

When the writers aren't in the middle of forgetting about it, his powers are amazing - catching bullets in mid-flight, solving problems in seconds, coming in like a blur and just ... fixing everything in the blink of an eye. Superman does that too sometimes, but with Superman it's often more about brawn, which I find less awe-inspiring. The Flash's powers are more constrained in many ways, more focused around this one single thing: /speed/.

And with that said, I think that there have been far fewer "good" Flash stories than there are Superman or Batman stories. But I like Flash better all the same, because he seems to promise more of the things that I like.
