There is a story called "Fall of Doc Future" found [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][here]] that may not be exactly what you're looking for, but it does involve slightly less physics defying speedster /named/ Flicker. It isn't set in DCU, though I don't know how important that is to you.
