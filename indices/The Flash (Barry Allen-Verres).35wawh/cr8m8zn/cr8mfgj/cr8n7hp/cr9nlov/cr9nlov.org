Glad to hear that a number of people here like my stories. Flicker was indeed inspired by the Flash--in particular this quote about him (in an old obscure issue of Swamp Thing by Alan Moore):

"There is a man who moves so fast his life is an endless gallery of statues."

I wondered what that would be like, and what it would take to have a vaguely plausible world with a speedster who could go close to the speed of light in it... and I created Flicker. Similarly, Doc was inspired by my frustration with how 'smart' characters were portrayed in fiction.

The first two novels, "The Fall of Doc Future" and "Skybreaker's Call" are complete and available in web-serial form here: [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/62787551366/stories]]

I'm working on the 3rd book now, "The Maker's Ark", and posting new chapters every two weeks.

There isn't a battle really worthy of Flicker's power until the second book, I'm afraid, as it took some doing to set up. 8-)

Oh, and there are telepaths, but no gorillas yet. Sorry.
