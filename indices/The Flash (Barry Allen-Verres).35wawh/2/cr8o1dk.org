I think first you need to flesh out the mechanics of super speed. Does it involve high kinetic energy and momentum, with all of the destructive potential that brings? If he carries a magnet with him or gets a static charge somehow, does it result in an EMP? Can he think at super speeds? Does he have super reflexes, but no real conscious thought at that speed? Does have ordinary reflexes, so he has to plan out his entire path before running and he has no way of reacting to obstacles? Does he have less obvious results of the power, such as being able to vibrate through walls and wear pants made of goes fast?
