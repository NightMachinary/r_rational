Well the Speed Pants obviously have to go. Under my revised definition of the Speed Force, he is actually going that fast, with all the energy and strain that implies. That means he likely can't go FTL except in a vacuum, since he'd be torn limb from limb by atmospheric interference. His reflexes and thought rate are probably superhuman, but still limited by the speed of neurons, and thus not real-time for a Speedster. As far as vibration intangibility and arm vortexes and similar side-powers, I think I don't know the physics well enough to know if they'd actually be possible for someone who's Just That Fast.
