I'm studying physics, so that'll be the topic of this particular comment.

Your comparison to the Higgs field is very interesting. Since the Higgs field is really slowing things down from the speed of light by adding mass, if the Speed Force was really just a way of manipulating the Higgs field, is could decrease individual mass + increase individual speed. Except that Barry obviously isn't losing mass as he speeds up, and one needn't be massless to travel at the speed of light.

By the way, there's huge warfare potential in the form of relativistic kill missiles. But I digress.

So yeah, the ability of things to go faster than the speed of light, but not travel back in time through any reference frame, is a little bit crazy. On the one hand, I'd like to imagine this as a nigh-perfectly Newtonian universe, where /yes/ two things can happen simultaneously because /yes/ there is an objective reference frame. But it /is possible/ to travel backwards in time, so.

Does something just go faster than light? The particle-carrier for the Speed Force, in this case, whether it be a modified Higgs repellent or something much more complicated. I can't even imagine what the Dimensional Barrier would be beyond the Time Barrier, and the ultimate Speed Force Barrier seems to be "instantaneous travel/existence" when really that should come before Time. Whatever.

Or - and this is probably the best theory, and also most in-tune with the DC Comics universe: an ancient race created the Speed Force. It's not natural at all, and it has very little to do with existing physics. It's an artificial imposition on top of the laws of nature, maybe a la /Fine Structure/. Easy transport, easy communication, that sort of thing, and while they could access it naturally, humans need to mutate (via chemical reactions or time travel) to gain access. [[#s][]]
