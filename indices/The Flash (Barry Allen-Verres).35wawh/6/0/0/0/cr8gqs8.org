I actually wasn't thinking the Speed Force and Higgs Field would be connected in any direct way. I was just using Higgs as an example of the kind of system I wanted the Speed Force to operate on. That is, the Speed Force gives things speed in the same way the Higgs Field gives things mass. Speed Force as Higgs-disruptor is also interesting, with its own separate set of physical ramifications and logical limitations.
