Not sure how relevant this will turn out to be, but it seems like as good a place as any to put it out there:

For a while I've been thinking about this half-idea to use, as a plot device of some sort, a 'mirror world' consisting of the simple, literal, /other side/ of physical reality found rotated halfway through a 4th spatial dimension.

Maybe Mirror Master's power involves forcing such a rotation on a target (always exactly halfway round for access to the mirror world, any other amount for discrete pocket dimensions)

I also feel like, even after overcoming the conceptual limitation as above, he should keep using mirrors because a) themes and b) secrets are fashionable in the super community.
