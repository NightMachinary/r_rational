That's a good fit, with a built-in alternate character interpretation. The biggest issue is that you have to establish limits to what said pocket universes can and cannot contain. Does he have power over the mirror worlds he creates or are they all just empty voids with earth-like physics? Are they literal reflections of reality with which he can spy on people invisibly? Or can he do any of the above. And for that matter, if Barry gets trapped in a reflection is there any real way for him to get out without Mirror^{Master} setting him free?
