I will second [[/u/alexanderwales]] on the Flash being my favorite superhero. For me the best thing about him is that he's powerful, but his abilities mostly require at least some intelligence. Superman has laser beam eyes because /reasons/. When the Flash wants a ranged weapon he has to use tools -- usually flung rocks. Superman flies and can therefore catch falling window washers because /reasons./ The Flash has to move really fast to set up cushions of air. And so on.
