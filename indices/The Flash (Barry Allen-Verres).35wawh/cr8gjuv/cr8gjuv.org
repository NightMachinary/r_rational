I love the Flash. He would be my favorite superhero ... but his powers don't make much sense, and his villains are pretty lame. I have a piece of Flash fanfic sitting in a folder somewhere (titled "Flashback" because it's a time loops story - god I'm clever) which is never going to be finished.

Good to luck to anyone that wants to try it, but it's going to be an uphill battle. You either need to power the Flash down by a huge amount, or power the threats he faces up by a huge amount, maybe both.
