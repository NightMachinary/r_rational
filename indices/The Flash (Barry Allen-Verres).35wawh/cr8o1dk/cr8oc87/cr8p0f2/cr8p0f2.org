Can he travel faster than sound without sonic booms destroying everything in the vicinity? Running even the speed of sound should probably shatter his bones, along with the ground. Does Speed Force allow him to speed up without the necessary action and reaction stuff? Or does he just have super strength and nigh invulnerability, along with the floor?

How does FTL work? My guess would be that light is massive, visible light moves at around the speed it does in real life, and the Time Barrier is the DC equivalent of the speed of light. This would require messing around with some stuff. Radio waves would travel at speeds comparable to the speed of sound. Either nuclear bombs would weigh almost exactly the same after they go off, or they could potentially be much more powerful, depending on exactly how fast the Time Barrier is.

Could you take him out by shooting him from behind? If the bullet's travelling faster than sound, he won't have a chance to hear it until he's hit. But if he can survive running at that speed, a bullet shouldn't do much. He might be able to keep running so you can't target him, but from the sound of it I'm not sure his reflexes are up to that.
