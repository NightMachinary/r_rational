If he can grant himself momentum, can he fly? Does he just have to be touching the ground or something?

  That means G-Forces won't kill him but air and debris still might.

If you can fill the air with debris, then he can't use his power. I don't imagine confetti would do more than papercuts, and anything more substantial won't stay in the air long. You could hang a bunch of beads from the ceiling with string.

  I don't entirely understand the bit with atomic bombs. Could you explain that some more?
#+end_quote

An atomic bomb converts a gram or so of mass energy into heat energy. If you're in a universe where c is a thousand times faster, then mc^{2} is a million times higher, so converting the same amount of mass energy would result in a million times the energy being released.

Come to think of it, all the potential energy stuff should be the same, so elements would just weigh a lot closer to the mass of the protons and neutrons. Although if protons and neutrons still weigh the same, beta decay would be much more energetic.

  The bullet question depends completely on if he's already moving or not.

So the question is: can he enter the scene, do everything he needs to do, and then leave without ever stopping? And possibly without running around in a repetitive pattern while he thinks?
