Sonic booms are a problem he'd have to deal with regularly, assuming we don't up the Sound Barrier to make Speedster combat more viable. Like I said previously, my redefinition of the Speed Force allows him to essentially grant himself momentum without gaining it legitimately through effort. In essence, speed without acceleration. That means G-Forces won't kill him but air and debris still might. Although he'll still be a bit tougher than human, with probably a pretty good healing factor from an enhanced metabolism that would require a higher caloric input.

I don't entirely understand the bit with atomic bombs. Could you explain that some more?

The bullet question depends completely on if he's already moving or not. If he is, he's going to be almost impossible to hit. Speed of thought is still faster than speed of aiming. If he isn't, he might at least be able to rob the bullet of a great deal of damage by running forward at similar speeds. But if the bullet hits, he's gonna get hurt.
