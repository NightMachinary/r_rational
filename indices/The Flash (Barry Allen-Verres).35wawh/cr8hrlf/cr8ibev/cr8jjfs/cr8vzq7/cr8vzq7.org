Interesting idea. Are there living people in the mirror world? If so, are they mirrored versions of the inhabitants of the normal world, or are they their own distinct civilisation? If not, is the mirror world a barren wasteland, or does it somehow contain buildings and machines even though nobody is there to build them?
