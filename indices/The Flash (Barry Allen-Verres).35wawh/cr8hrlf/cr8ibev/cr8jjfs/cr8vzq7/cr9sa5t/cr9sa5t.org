Originally, my thought was that it was really just the regular world, as viewed from behind, and maybe someone gets stuck there.

In Flatland terms, a scalene triangle (with the appropriate superpowers) could visit Mirror Flatland by flipping all the way over, appearing to everyone else to suddenly be facing the other way; from his perspective, however, everything else would be backwards.

Or like the Mirror tracks in Mario Kart games. Unfortunately, the adventures of a guy who has trouble reading, writing, driving, and digesting food aren't that compelling by themselves, so my second thought was to add some metaphysical quirks to the setting. Maybe souls usually only exist on the one side. Maybe if you rotated only a tiny bit out of line instead of all the way around, you'd end up in a slightly distorted Smudged Lens World, with some real Hell Dimensions roughly perpendicular. Of course, at that point, it would also start to matter which /direction/ you were rotating in 4d each time you used the power if you ever wanted to make your way back.
