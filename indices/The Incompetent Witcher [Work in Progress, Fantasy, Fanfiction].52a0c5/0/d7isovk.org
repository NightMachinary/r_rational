  "As every graduate from the School of the Wolf, you may take a steed from our stables," he began again. "You will also find there a bag with all you need to begin your new life. Provisions for a week of travel, a few coins. A chest of books: Ritual Plants, Physiologus, Ghouls and Alghouls..."

I fail to see how man, whose most of the life consisted of physical training and swordmanship would so randomly choose to become a troubadour.

Overall, from lecture of the first chapter it seems, that author is not very familiar with the Witcher universe, while Thyssen is anything but rational.
