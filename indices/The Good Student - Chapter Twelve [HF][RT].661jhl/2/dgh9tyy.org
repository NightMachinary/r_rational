Ooh I just found this and read through to the current chapter. Entertaining stuff! Always in the mood for academic power fantasy/competence porn, and the author's technical writing is solid. I also dare say I see something of myself in Nic. We share the same name (though mine differs by a letter -- Nik), we both lost our fathers when we were very young, we both had working mothers (mine worked as cleaner for a time, even, as did I), we both were voracious readers and spent tons of time in libraries (I often read >100 books a year lol, and easily spent hours each day in the school libraries, from middle school through uni, even working in one as an aide), we both attended ritzier schools on scholarship (I had my costs mostly covered at a ~15k/year high school and covered with plenty to spare at a ~$60k/year uni), we both did well at those schools and at exams (e.g. I graduated /summa/ from the latter), we both had childhood friends/romantic interests at school who /hated/ us. I was even a friendly student to a demonologist in highschool (well, an exorcist, but close enough). There are some differences, though -- I'm nowhere near as industrious or smart and was never socially ostracized (for socioeconomic reasons or otherwise) and had plenty of friends and hobbies, including the physically-active sort. Still, it's uncanny! Though I guess in many ways any old nerd could find plenty of similarities between themselves and an eponymous “good student”.

I'm liking the subversion of expectation in some cases (Dizzy -- to which I'm always tempted to append /Sma/ -- being wholly imperfect) but not others (the OP, still-slightly-mysterious Simole, other classic fantasy tropes). Characterization is great, too (my favorite being Davo, I think). Curious to see where the story's headed!
