(Just read through the currently-available chapters.) The writing was pleasantly easy to read. I liked the semi-subtle hints (especially early on) about the nature of the nation, such as the off-hand comment about there being no modern equivalents of the older books looking at how the government worked.

The main character's attitude towards libraries has been very comfortable to read about.

I read the 12th chapter first, then the first 11; from the 12th chapter I was worried that there would be a strong Hogwarts smell from the entire main story, but the earlier chapters (with demonology and the Arcanum) reassured me it would not be to any extents I had feared.

I find myself wondering where the protagonist's story is going, in the long run. Seeing him zoom over the heads of his classmates (academically) is plenty fun on its own, granted.

I can see various plots and grand-phenomena foreshadowing, but I find myself hoping he finds a path that no one else could have guessed at, one that only he could follow... well, that 'binding a demon by convincing it of your lie' sounds really tempting, too.
