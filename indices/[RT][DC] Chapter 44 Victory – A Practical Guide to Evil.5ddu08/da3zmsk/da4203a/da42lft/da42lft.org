I'm not so sure.

That necromantic ability is tied to her name, and she just burnt the last chunk of her power to cast the curse.

Not to mention she does seem like the person to happily sacrifice herself for something as big as keeping a Hashmallim from entering the world.

If she survives I expect it'll be because of a new name that she receives in that moment, some shenanigans with a name that's less beholden to causality, or some shenanigans with the rule of three that she's still got with the Heiress.
