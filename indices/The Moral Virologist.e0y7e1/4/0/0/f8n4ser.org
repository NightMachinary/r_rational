It's definitely illegal, it's bioweapon development research. That's an international crime for most countries, and would provoke strikes into non-signatory countries.

It's also defacto illegal even if not recognized: It wouldn't get approved by any research regulatory groups, there was a big backlash from research that created a airborne flu virus awhile ago that tightened those up. They would also classify the research as biosafety level 4, meaning it can only be done in certain (government) high security places.
