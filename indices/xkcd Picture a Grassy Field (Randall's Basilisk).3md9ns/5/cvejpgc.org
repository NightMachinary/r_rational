Ah, but the ability of the basilisk to brain-travel is dependent on its form being maintained by the brain it is in. If the brain is not actively thinking about it (i.e. it's thinking about literally anything else), then the basilisk cannot travel as it lacks incarnation. It may also wind up lacking agency permanently if it is forgotten about.
