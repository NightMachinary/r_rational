I want to talk about a topic I find endlessly fascinating: single quotes versus double quotes. To begin with, here's how I operate.

If I am directly quoting a phrase that both relays the words and intentions of a given speaker, I'll use double quotes. For example, the universal declaration of human rights begins with "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world."

If I instead point out a specific word or phrase, or a snippet from a larger quote devoid of it's context, I'll use single quotes. For example, to point out that the beginning of the UDHR starts with the word 'whereas.'

If I want to have a multiparagraph-quotation, I'll start each pharagraph with an opening double quote, but only include a single closing double quote at the end of the quotation.

"This is the first paragraph.

"This is the second.

"This is the final one," she said.

"'And of course, I follow the standard English convention of alternating between single and double quotes when I have nested quotations,' she said," he said.

How do you all use quotation marks?
