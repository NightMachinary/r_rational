Please, never use that approach to multiparagraph-quotation. I trip over it every time I see it, and I swear I'm not trying to be pedantic on purpose. It just takes me right out of the story.

It doesn't help either that a lot of online writers simply forget to end some paragraphs with a quote, either. And then when they do it on purpose, they assume that they don't have to specify that the person from the first paragraph is still talking. Argh!

The end result is something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Steve smiled. "Hey, how are you?

  "I'm great," said Anna. "Actually, let me tell you about my day. So first of all, I went to the supermarket.

  "That's a lot of fun, going to the supermarket, right? Yeah, I think so too. But then, something crazy happened!"
#+end_quote

There is *no* reason for this. Okay, I get that you might want to avoid walls of text, but if you really don't want to combine the two paragraphs into one, just end it with a double quotation as normal and add an extra dialogue tag for the next one. Or better yet, insert a short reaction from the guy she's talking to in between the two paragraphs. Surely that would be a better way to break up the text.
