Listen. It is simply a fact that most stories recommended on this site, even the *good* ones, do not have access to an extensive editorial process. If you write a My Little Pony fanfiction and you don't end a line of dialogue with an end quote, your average reader is going to assume that you simply *forgot*.

I don't care how good you think your MLP fanfiction is, it's simply not reasonable to expect your reader to go "Aha, unlike the last seventeen times I have seen this error, I can only assume that this particular author is doing it on purpose as part of an elaborate scheme to achieve nothing of use whatsoever."

This is not a matter of me not knowing the basics of the English language, or me not understanding the 'correctness' of your rule. I am just informing the OP of a factor that they might not have previously considered. That's all.
