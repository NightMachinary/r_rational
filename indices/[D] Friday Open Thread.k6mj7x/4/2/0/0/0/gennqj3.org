Sure, rude is a societal concept, but I don't see what your point is here? Is your point "isn't rudeness as a concept interesting" (sure, it is, but... not relevant to my whinge here), or is your point "maybe this situation doesn't have a person being rude and you're being unreasonable?" (like i said, if there's some sort of personal crisis/etc then sure but assuming he just decided not to respond to my messages because he changed his mind, I don't think I'm the rude one here)
