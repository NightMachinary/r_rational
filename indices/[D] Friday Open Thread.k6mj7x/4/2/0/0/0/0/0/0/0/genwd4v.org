I'm happy to show you the text messages in question if you really want lol; FWIW in discussing it with [[/u/callmesalticidae]] earlier he said of my message "that all seems super reasonable and A+ to me"

TBH I'd honestly be interested in a fanfic of this situation where I am in fact crazy / from the guy's POV dodging a bullet / etc.
