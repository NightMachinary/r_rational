I am of the firm belief that words should serve humans, not the other way around. If it trips at least some % of readers up, that's probably something worth knowing about.

Now, if you personally have a strong preference in the other direction, that's fine.

But intentionally using a style that needlessly annoys readers because it is the "correct" method... that's not something I would recommend.
