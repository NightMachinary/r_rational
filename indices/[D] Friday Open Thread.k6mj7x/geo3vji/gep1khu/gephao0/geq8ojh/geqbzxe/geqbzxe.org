I wouldn't say that I have a strong preference.

It's simply like many other aspects of the English language - like using the correct spelling of homophones, or the correct placement of apostrophes in the possessive form of words that end in 's'; any person will be tripped up by it until they learn the standard.

'It's annoying to people who find the standard confusing' is a really low bar to base your behavior on when the entirety of the English language is full of other rules like that.
