Murakami writes beautiful fantasy, but it is difficult to say his works are inherently rational. The setting is often surreal and unstable; the characters are often unsure of what their goals even are, never mind how to achieve them.

In this, paradoxically, they are perhaps closer to the real-life experience of the aspiring but not often successful rationalist than many of the ideal spherical-HPMOR-in-a-vacuum style works commonly discussed here :)
