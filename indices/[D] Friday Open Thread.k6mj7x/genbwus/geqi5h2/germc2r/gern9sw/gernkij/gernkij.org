Yeah it's so weird to see all the podcasts/blogs/media talking about the pandemic and masks and how bad it is and we are just sitting here whining that we can't leave our state to go on a holiday. It doesn't feel real to us, only ever did in feb/mar/apr while we were in the process of eliminating it.

I feel like I'm missing a big part of "world history", but it's also made me look at other parts of the world and want to scream at them to do a proper, full on, heavy elimination strategy because our state's economy had positive growth this year because our stores/etc were able to open in full in June and have been open ever since.

And I know we're privileged with our isolation, and everything, but Melbourne went from 700 daily cases in July/August to having 0 cases for the past month, so it can be done.
