Can I ask about how you were willing to arrange for a date during the current covid pandemic? Because I'm not sure where you live, but right now in USA, I consider it to be mildly crazy behavior to go out on a date with a stranger who you have no idea is a carrier for covid or not.

So I'm just wondering how you stay as safe as possible while going out on dates currently, or are things that much better elsewhere that covid isn't a big concern?

Also, that guy sucks for flaking out on you without even a text to apologize for dropping out. Good on you for having an excellent night in spite of him!
