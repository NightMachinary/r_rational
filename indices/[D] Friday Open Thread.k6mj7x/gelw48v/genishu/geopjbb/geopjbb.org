I sorta disagree, but it's hard to explain.

The nature of the development of high intelligence through evolution means any species which does it must come from a background where progressive tiny improvements in intelligence were always more beneficial than having a slightly more massive brain was detrimental. You can't have an environment where a high-intelligence niche opens up suddenly and something rapidly evolves to fill it because having a giant, well-networked brain is too complicated to develop quickly. Furthermore, brains are so expensive that evolution does not attempt to maximize their size unless each increment succeeds.

In practical terms, this means you need some kind of recursively changing environment where becoming smarter means the next generation will also benefit from being smarter. This means you either need some highly unlikely series of adjacent different environments for a species to develop into, or one environment which changes with increasing intelligence.

On Earth, this environment has always been social. In a social setting with other members of your species, being slightly smarter is nearly always an advantage, as you'll be able to make better plans than anyone else. But this is a runaway process. Once it starts, it becomes self-perpetuating, as the only factor spurring the rate of intelligence improvement is the intelligence of the species itself, and the only limiting factor is food. Which becomes less and less limiting as you get smarter. Which removes the primary evolutionary downside to large brains entirely.

On an evolutionary scale, this can happen pretty fast. It took tens of millions of years for land-dwelling mammals to become streamlined whales, hundreds of millions for the earliest arthropods to settle into the general shapes we're familiar with today. Gross bodily shifts, streamlined and perfected for new environments, are really slow. But the earliest evidence we have of human-like behavior among apes was only a couple million years ago.

Our bodies haven't had the time to rearrange themselves to be ideal at what we do yet. Perhaps the most salient example of this is not our awkward, dangerous locomotion, but the birth canal. Our brains literally cannot grow any larger now, and the limit is the width of the hole in the female pelvis. The positive feedback loop which developed human intelligence worked faster than basic things like optimizing reproduction and walking.

The last bit here is that our ability to walk upright may have catalyzed this positive feedback loop. Communal persistence hunters benefit from higher intelligence, which was apparently enough to start the runaway process. You have to have compelling reasons to stick together and rudimentary planning capabilities to hunt like that, and those are also what you need to start playing social dominance games where intelligence has an outsized effect.

Taken all together: it is reasonable to assume that the evolutionary process which produces high intelligence requires specific conditions. However, once those conditions happen, the actual development of intelligence can and will outpace the physical improvements which seem "obvious" to the na√Øve observer. We went from literal dumb animals, to tool use, to modern humans, all in around five million years, and if we don't wipe ourselves out it is reasonable to think we're going to begin colonizing the rest of the galaxy in the next evolutionary eyeblink. This "stupidly designed" body is nonetheless likely good enough to be the one human immortals remember with fondness.

Which means we can reasonably speculate that all evolved alien species will also have some obvious design flaws in their evolved physical bodies. Maybe it won't be stupidly designed backs and pelvises which limit brain size, but it will be /something./ The evolution of intelligence outpaced the evolution of the bodies best able to wield it in every case on Earth, and it is reasonable to assume that will also happen elsewhere.
