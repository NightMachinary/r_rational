Everything you've said regarding double quotation marks is the standard correct method, to my knowledge.

For single quotation marks, I tend to use them when /not/ directly quoting something. For instance, I use them when paraphrasing what a person or group has been known to say (example in the last sentence of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gkaryj/d_friday_open_thread/fqrgefv/][this comment]]). I also use them as a sort-of caveat for words that embody philosophical concepts with a very subjective, and sometimes contradictory, meaning (i.e. 'good' or 'evil').
