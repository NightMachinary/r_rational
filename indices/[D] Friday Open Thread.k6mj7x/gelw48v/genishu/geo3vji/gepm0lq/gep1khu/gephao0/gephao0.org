  Please, for the love of god, never use that approach to multiparagraph-quotation. I trip over it every time I see it, and I swear I'm not trying to be pedantic on purpose. It just takes me right out of the story.

But... that is the actual standard rule for multi-paragraph quotes in English. You'll see it done that way in plenty of published novels. Amateur writers doing it wrong isn't a good reason for everyone to abandon the correct method.
