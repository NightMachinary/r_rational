  I don't care how good you think your MLP fanfiction is, it's simply not reasonable to expect your reader to go "Aha, unlike the last seventeen times I have seen this error, I can only assume that this particular author is doing it on purpose as part of an elaborate scheme to achieve nothing of use whatsoever."

Wrong. I expect my readers, and especially the bronies, to be geniuses, and if they aren't, they don't deserve to read my work.
