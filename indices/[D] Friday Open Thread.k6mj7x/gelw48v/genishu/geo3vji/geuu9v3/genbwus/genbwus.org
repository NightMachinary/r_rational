So I had a guy just fuckin' ghost me (leaving me on read) after we'd already made plans for a third date (AT MY HOUSE, /if you know what I mean/, and he'd said that he was interested in that sort of a date). I'm hoping it was just anxiety and he'll come back and apologise in a few days because he was /super short/ and I was /so into that/ and now I'm going to spend two weeks prowling dating apps for short guys and for some reason everyone on dating apps is more than six feet tall UGH.

I'm mad that he was rude but I ended up spending the whole night watching reality TV, eating shitty food, and just chilling out and then I slept in this morning so I actually had a great night.

EDIT: I live in a jurisdiction where covid is eliminated, so we are living that blessed pre-covid life except for our borders being closed.
