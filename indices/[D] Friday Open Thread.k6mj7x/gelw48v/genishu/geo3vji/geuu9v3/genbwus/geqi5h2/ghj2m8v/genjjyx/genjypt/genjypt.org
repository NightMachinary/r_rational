  You have this code and the other person has violated it, yet potentially, they have not violated their own moral code.

I don't know: I think if you've made firm plans with someone (date/time/location specified), and they send you a couple of messages asking to confirm these plans, including stuff like "if this was too forward I'm happy to go out for dinner or something", and you read the messages but don't respond... in what universe isn't that rude? In the universe where you don't have to respond to messages from ugly women or something?

Like I can definitely see it not being rude if e.g. he's in the middle of a major mental illness attack, close friend or family member is in crisis, his phone was dropped in the toilet, etc. But with the facts as presented, flaking on plans several days in advance and not giving notice is rude.
