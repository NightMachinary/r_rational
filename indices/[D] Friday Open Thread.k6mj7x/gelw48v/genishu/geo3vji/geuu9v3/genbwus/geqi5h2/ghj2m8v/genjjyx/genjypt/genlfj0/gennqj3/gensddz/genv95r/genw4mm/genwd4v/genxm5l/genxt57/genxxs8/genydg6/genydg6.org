I'd be interested in the "fanfic" for the reality where he thinks he's right. I mean, you can do either of the simple options:

1) "Something sufficiently important has happened in Man's life that makes keeping a date commitment no longer high on his list of priorities"

or

2) "Man doesn't think two dates is enough of a commitment for the woman he's dating to need to be told that he is no longer interested; she'll work it out from the lack of replies to her messages"

But #2 IMO means that he's "objectively" rude, i.e. a third party observer from our culture would put him in the wrong.
