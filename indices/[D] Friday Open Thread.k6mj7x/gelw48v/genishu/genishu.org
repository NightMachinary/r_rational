I've been a bit annoyed at fantasy / sci fi species VERY frequently having human posture and walking manner. After having read some human evolution books one thing becomes quite clear, humans walk very strangely.

​

Pretty much no other animal walks like us or has a posture like ours ever. It's a pretty unique movement method suited for persistence hunting, but it's worst for pretty much everything else compared to other more common locomotion methods, it's slower, less controllable, more prone to falls and other kinds of accidents etc.

​

Given that, few if any sentients should move or walk as modern humans do, unless they are related to us. If you want to make a bipedal sentient look at birds and dinosaurs that's the normal bipedal body type not ours.

​

It feels incredibly lazy and cliche to see +95% of sentient species in fiction being portrayed as humans with masks / make up. On TV or movies where there's budget limitations and special effect costs it's at least understandable but in written word and comics there are no valid excuses. We can do better..
