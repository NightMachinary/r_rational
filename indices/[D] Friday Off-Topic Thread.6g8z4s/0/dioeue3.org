My apologies in advance for having two different topics I'm willing to discuss, none of which have any relation to each other. If you want to respond to both, do so in separate comments.

--------------

Recently at work I was partnered with a socially conservative man for a day who was completely civil to me and votes democrat, but explained that he didn't think gay people had a right to get married specifically because the Bible says it's a sin. He explained that he doesn't take all of the Bible literally (even if he didn't explain how he concluded his interpretation was correct), though he sternly stated that he sees the Bible as factual and rejects alternative interpretations. He made it clear he wants the law to discourage people from thinking sinful behavior is morally permissible, so he doesn't want gay people to adopt children or hold pride parades.

I told this man I was pansexual and tried my best to deconstruct his arguments when I had time to speak to him, but I failed. I thanked him for being more polite than most homophobes, but I still feel disappointed in myself. Not just for failing to persuade him, I feel conflicted over allowing myself to empathize with him at all. When I see Facebook posts celebrating LGBT pride I impulsively feel some disgust because I allowed myself to consider that perspective, which makes me feel guilty for thinking that way and thinking it was in any way okay for him to continue thinking that way. I wonder if I should've been more aggressive in my rejection of his ideals.

I don't think aggression would've been more likely to persuade him, I'm just uncertain whether I should be the kind of person who adamantly sticks to my morals. I have allowed myself to consider alternative perspectives that I know are false and reprehensible, and that feels like a betrayal to people I do care about and should care more about. The fact that I didn't implicitly hate such casual homophobia using distorted religious doctrine as justification, when I am a religious liberal myself, makes me question just how morally upstanding I am. Shouldn't I hate him or at least what he believes more strongly? Can I just...decide to feel differently?

While watching the show Gargoyles I found myself wondering what the basic emotional appeal of the gargoyle as a mythological creature is. Vampires, werewolves, ghosts, mages, and The Fair Folk all reflect obvious wonders and fears in human cultures, but the origin of the gargoyle appears to be as stylized gutters in gothic architecture that somehow because associated with protective spirits. It's harder to rationalize a fantasy creature when there isn't a clear narrative purpose for them.

Then it occurred to me that Gargoyles may not be an urban fantasy since it doesn't have that same appeal. It's more like a gritty reimagining of the Ninja Turtles. Most of the time the heroes fight adversaries born of science and industry rather than magic. Even when magic does show up, the way they deal with it tends to be more about exploiting logical rules than narrative weaknesses like in many fantasy stories. I think I may have stumbled upon a under-explored genre, urban sci-fi.

The purpose of urban fantasy is to bring fantasy worlds into our own, often at a local/personal level. It's a similar kind of escapism as fantasy, but is designed to relate to the reader's life more directly by drawing direct parallels between the fantasy world and real world. Few stories seem to have tried the same with sci-fi and I think more should. It may help breathe new life into a tired formula, while having just as much potential for interesting adventures.

It's easy enough to make sci-fi analogs to, say, The Dresden Files. Wizards are savant geniuses, human-like creatures are mutants, inhuman creatures are robots, The Fair Folk are aliens, and minor gods are AIs. The dreaded Masquerade is completely optional since even if people keep weird stuff a secret they'd still be willing and able use it for something eventually. The whole point of sci-fi is to challenge the status quo, so there's no need to protect it from unearthly influence.

It might be difficult to rationalize evil use of science. It's easy enough for dark wizards to inflict mayhem and horrors upon the world, but how do scientists and engineers do it? For that matter, how could an evil corporation do it? The real R&D field is pretty heavily regulated and there's so much money to be made legally that no one wants to commit crimes or let projects get out of control. I don't think we should just wave our hands like we do with gadgeteer heroes and mad scientists.
