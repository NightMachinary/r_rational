  I don't think aggression would've been more likely to persuade him, I'm just uncertain whether I should be the kind of person who adamantly sticks to my morals. I have allowed myself to consider alternative perspectives that I know are false and reprehensible, and that feels like a betrayal to people I do care about and should care more about. The fact that I didn't implicitly hate such casual homophobia using distorted religious doctrine as justification, when I am a religious liberal myself, makes me question just how morally upstanding I am. Shouldn't I hate him or at least what he believes more strongly? Can I just...decide to feel differently?

"Love good, hate evil" is a religious doctrine. Does it do more good to hate someone for views you find wrong, but within the scope of empathy? Or is that just virtue-signaling to yourself? Where's the virtue in hating someone for getting the facts wrong?

  The real R&D field is pretty heavily regulated and there's so much money to be made legally that no one wants to commit crimes or let projects get out of control.

There's a whole lot of money made in committing certain kinds of crimes. Hacking, war crimes, surveillance, counter-surveillance, anti-surveillance, bank robbery (/Ocean's 11/, for instance). Lots of stuff you can come up with.
