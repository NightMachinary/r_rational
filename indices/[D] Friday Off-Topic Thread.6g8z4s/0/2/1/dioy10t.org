The problem isn't so much finding reasons for individuals to commit crimes, but to create a trend of it. I'm trying to avoid Cut Lex Luthor a Check, why would so many people (usually educated scientists and engineers) specifically choose to use their creations to commit crimes when they could just make a ton of money legitimately? It's not like no one would pay them.

I like heists as much as the next guy, but explicit theft is uncommon among well-off people. Espionage is more plausible, but would require the story to be a conspiracy thriller. I'd prefer to leave it open for a Monster/Case of the Week formula, which means criminals have access to gadgets, experiments are escaping, and projects are being stolen.

It's not that White Collar crime isn't interesting, I actually think it's so interesting that there's no point in exploring it in a sci-fi adventure. There has to be an economic reason why people in the R&D sector aren't doing legitimate work in the public eye...I've got it, aliens cause a economic crisis!

I already figured aliens would be in this setting, so if they had access to technology beyond anything humans have and countries considered trading with them, that would throw whole industries into disarray. Investors pull out so the people get laid off and have to take their work home or on the street.

The people still working for a company would become desperate enough to seize any advantage they could. Risky projects are approved with cuts to the budget and staff, competitors are sabotaged at any cost, and illegal conspiracies would be supported to influence or delay trade treaties.

The antagonists are trying to maintain what relevance and financial security they can while they still have a chance. I could even explain the prior buildup of weird science as a military-industrial complex fighting unruly aliens, but now their more civilized opponents have shown up and are out-bidding the human lobbyists.
