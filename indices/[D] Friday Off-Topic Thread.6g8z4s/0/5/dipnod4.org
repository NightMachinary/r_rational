So! Gargoyles.

Funny you should mention them. I have one as a minor character in the novella I just recently co-wrote and am now editing (anyone want to be a beta reader? [[/u/callmebrotherg]] , were you still interested in giving it a look or do you not have time to give feedback for 50,000 words of content on a volunteer basis?).

I've never actually seen the eponymous TV series, and since my vampires are different, my gargoyle is naturally different too. We went with a gargoyle because we wanted a "statue/human" duality type thing - he's a statue sometimes, human other times. His job is to protect his "master" and he has blue and orange morality due to that, but he also has a family, a son, etc.

I'm not sure why the concept of gargoyles isn't more explored. I think the stone being trope is cool, but golems aren't explored either.
