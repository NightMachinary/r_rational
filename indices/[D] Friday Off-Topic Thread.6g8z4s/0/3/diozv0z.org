  The fact that I didn't implicitly hate such casual homophobia using distorted religious doctrine as justification, when I am a religious liberal myself, makes me question just how morally upstanding I am. Shouldn't I hate him or at least what he believes more strongly? Can I just...decide to feel differently?

You're morally fine.

Imagine I'm talking to an Anti-Vaxxer. I'd vehemently disagree with their policy suggestions. I think they doom children to horrible pointless deaths.

But I don't hate them. I don't even disagree with their moral position.

Instead, my logic is:

1. We ought do what's good for children.
2. Vaccines are net-good.
3. So we ought vaccinate children.

Their logic is:

1. We ought do what's good for children.
2. Vaccines are net-bad.
3. So we ought not vaccinate children.

Our morality is entirely contained in the first statement. And we fundamentally agree on that. Our conflict emerges from our beliefs about facts.

The anti-vaxxer is mistaken. Tragically so. With terrible consequences. But wrong isn't the same as evil.

You're in a similar spot. Both you and your opponent want to do things that promote human flourishing. And you both care enough about others that you'll put effort into advocacy. That's the core moral question.

Your coworker is wrong about what creates a healthy society. His mistake is tragic. And it could lead him to advocate things with terrible consequences. But you sensed that he's doing harm with good intentions. So he's mistaken, not evil.
