I don't think you should feel guilty for empathising with someone whose conclusions you strongly dislike. You said that "The fact that I didn't implicitly hate such casual homophobia using distorted religious doctrine as justification, when I am a religious liberal myself, makes me question just how morally upstanding I am."

Does your system of morality really require you to hate people with substantially different beliefs to you? Does it even require you to hate their beliefs? Why is it a betrayal not to get angry at his viewpoints, and instead to empathise with them without accepting them? What are the principles that you're upholding by hating this man or being angry at what he believes?

Personally, I consider the ability to empathise with opposing viewpoints to be a moral good, not bad. The sad truth of the world is, most people believe they're in the right. Pro-life people believe they're advocating against the murder of unborn children, while pro-choice people believe they're advocating for women's autonomy. And they're both right.

Both sides consider the other monstrous because they lack this empathy you're displaying. If you're pro-life, pro-choice people want to murder babies because it's convenient. If you're pro-choice, pro-life people hate women and want to remove their choices. The counter to such skewed viewpoints is the ability to empathise with the other side - even if their argument is wrong.
