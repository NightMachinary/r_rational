Well, I would sympathize with them if an injustice was perpetrated against them. I've never wished violence on a person no matter how reprehensible. I don't even like revenge stories, I find The Punisher unbearably boring as anything other than a antagonist.

I agree with you intellectually, though I'm uncertain from an emotional perspective. The thing about children, though, is that while they must be disciplined when they refuse to listen. When I cannot discipline someone for refusing to learn, I feel frustrated and it makes me doubt what I'm doing.
