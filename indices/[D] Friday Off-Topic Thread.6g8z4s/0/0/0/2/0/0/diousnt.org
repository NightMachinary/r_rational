Humanity has too many children and too few people who could be at least /considered/ adult. As such, the more rational people can't be disciplining everyone all the time, or they simply won't have time for /anything/ else, so most of the "children" are running around unattended. I can absolutely understand being frustrated at it, though since I myself have long lost that feeling, I can't offer any advice. Try to limit engaging with them unless you think you have a good chance of changing their mind or it's a /really/ crucial issue?
