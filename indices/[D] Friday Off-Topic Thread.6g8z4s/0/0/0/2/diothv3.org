  Does he deserve empathy, though?

Aren't all sentients do? Would you sympathize with a tortured inhuman alien? With an AGI? With a paperclipper? If so, not sympathizing with unpleasant humans, and /only/ with unpleasant humans, seems oddly specific and inconsistent.

Personally, however arrogant that is, I can't help but think of such people as children who can't really be responsible for their actions and beliefs. They deserve to be either pitied or not taken serioulsy, but actually /hating/ them seems silly to me: they just don't know any better. They could learn, they could be /taught/, but wasting time trying to do that to every grown child you encounter while they try to deny you with all they have is an exercise in futility.

I know that it's an extremely dubious standpoint bordering on dehumanization (ironically), so feel free to discard it.
