  He explicitly said that he wants to impose his arbitrary rules upon myself and used illogical arguments to back up his point

Are you very libertarian? If not, you probably commit a similar sin somewhere in your own political/philosophical beliefs. Should people who strongly disagree then hate you for it? If not, then you certainly don't need to hate yourself here.

  couldn't even reason with him the way I'm supposed to because I was too stupid to think of better arguments in the moment. His rebuttals were contradictory, but I didn't point that out because I thought he wouldn't listen to such statements and he ended up ignoring my logic anyway. I didn't even try to convince him that sexuality wasn't a choice or remind him to "love thy neighbor", I just kept giving ground to him hoping that I'd find an exploitable opening but he was too good at mental gymnastics.

I feel for you here. I am /terrible/ at in-person arguments like this, so I generally just avoid the topic as much as possible (much harder this past election cycle!), smile, make a generic, noncommittal response, then go argue about it online later.

The problem with your strategy is that it's too much playing the long game. It would probably be a good tact to take if you two were locked in a room and had months to argue it out. In the heat of a relatively fleeting encounter, you'd be better served seeking a line that would short-circuit his train of thought. "Why would a god who loves me make me this way just to suffer? And besides, the Covenant of Christ supersedes the Covenant of Moses, so all that anti-gay stuff is just for historical reasons, it's no part of Christ's teachings."

  while days later I see pictures of same-sex couple and think the disgust bigots would feel instead of feeling happiness of seeing symbols of acceptance.

Umm, please take this in the charitable desire to be helpful it's intended, but are you perhaps just incredibly impressionable? Taking on someone's implicit beliefs after a mere day of association, and having it last multiple days is very unusual.
