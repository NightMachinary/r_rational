On a tangent:

I smile when people talk about "taking the bible literally." It makes me want to meet the Literalist Christians.

I don't mean Christians who take Genesis seriously, or think that Jesus wanted them to give their possessions to the poor. No, I want to meet the person who reads Song of Solomon 1:15:

#+begin_quote
  Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves.
#+end_quote

And recoils in confused horror.

Or understands Song of Solomon 2:9:

#+begin_quote
  You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
#+end_quote

To be a dire warning against getting into an incestuous relationship with a sorceress. How did that poor guy retrieve his heart from her gemstones!

Literalism would make many of Jesus's teachings all that much more complicated. "Jesus," the disciples might ask, "why are you always telling that story about the time that woman lost a coin? Should we sabotage coin purses, so angels can rejoice more often as people find their money?"

I do a similar thing when people talk about "9/11 conspiracy theorists."

I hold the standard conspiracy-theorist view. I think a dozen-or-so people met in secret, planned a criminal act, and then took steps towards committing that act. Conspiracy.

I've met people who advocated a less-plausible theory where government officials met in secret, planned a criminal act, and then took steps to commit it. Odd. But also a conspiracy.

But i really want to meet the guy who's ruled out any kind of secret, unlawful coordination between individuals.
