  What angle can you pursue here?
#+end_quote

Publicise my values. It does more than you'd imagine.

  Literally everyone in this subreddit is a liberal

Clearly not.

  It's not like anyone is going to write fiction that promotes your values

There's actually quite a few works I enjoyed here. "Rational fiction" that isn't an omnihedonist author tract like HPMOR can be pretty fashy in the right context, and, for example, UNSONG is great as a crash course in "this is what the tribe actually believes". I dare say it could be the next Protocols in terms of propaganda value. It got /a lot/ of attention in counter-semitism spheres.
