It's fine, I was irked a little but not legitimately upset. On the logical level I could tell that the context encouraged contrast between authoritarianism and libertarianism, which you translated into conservative and liberal. The irk was mainly hindbrain, the reaction to the statement at face value instead of what you very likely meant.

I made my reply out of a combination of both satiating that irk and the subtle worry that, if I had misread you and you were honestly under the impression that there weren't any conservatives here, that you might possibly come to see this place as 'not for conservatives' under the wrong circumstances.

I'm not upset, really. The fact that you used different and not entirely accurate labels when your point was still clear isn't something to be guilty about.
