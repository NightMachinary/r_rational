While I do agree with you in the context of this conversation, I feel compelled to mention as a tangent that while most people here are liberal, there are some, myself included, who consider themselves conservative to one extent or another.

I shy away from things as heated as political debates and the question of whether I'm liberal or conservative doesn't really come up apart from that, especially when I share the majority of opinions here anyways, but I do admit it irked me for people like me to be dismissed as nonexistant because the majority here are liberal.
