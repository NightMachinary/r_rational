Well I definitely hate you since you're openly racist and fascist, (at least the homophobe believes in some of my rights) so why are you bothering to engage with me when I'm your enemy? Hell, you're giving away your intentions by telling me you want to fight so I will happily deny you that.

What angle can you pursue here? Literally everyone in this subreddit is a liberal, so why even bother fraternizing with people you hate? It's not like anyone is going to write fiction that promotes your values, and whenever you mention your political views we /will/ downvote.
