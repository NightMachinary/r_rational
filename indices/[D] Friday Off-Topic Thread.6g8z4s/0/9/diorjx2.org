  Shouldn't I hate him or at least what he believes more strongly? Can I just...decide to feel differently?

As a general rule, you /should/ hate your enemies, their tribe and their ideas if you wish to preserve your values. This seems like a pretty clear attempt at influencing your values to me.

Speaking for myself, coming from closer to the other side of the debate you described, I wouldn't even attempt to engage you shortly after noticing your unconditional support for degeneracy and sin. There is nothing worthwhile to be gained from such an engagement. I'll fight liberals when there's an actual war.
