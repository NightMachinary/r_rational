There is virtue in wanting to fight injustice and those who perpetrate it, but I failed to fight it for reasons I explained in another comment. Why should I tolerate someone who explicitly believes that tolerating me is immoral? It's a violation of the social contract, so I should've been ready and willing to defend myself until the end but ended up buckling under the pressure.
