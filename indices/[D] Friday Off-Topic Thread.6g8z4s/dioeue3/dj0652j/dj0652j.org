Figurative or literal shouting matches can be enjoyable, in that they cause us to feel righteous, but they rarely have any other utility. I'm a gay and I don't think you betrayed anyone.

For future reference in case you didn't use this one, I've yet to meet someone who cites Leviticus as a reason to oppose LGBT rights who has the same opinion on people who eat (or have touched) crayfish despite the fact that the same guy said the same thing about both. There's also some stuff (not by the same guy I think) about how rape victims who don't cry out for help should be put to death.
