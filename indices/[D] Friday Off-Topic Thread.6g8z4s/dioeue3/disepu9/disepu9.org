  The fact that I didn't implicitly hate such casual homophobia using distorted religious doctrine as justification, when I am a religious liberal myself, makes me question just how morally upstanding I am. Shouldn't I hate him or at least what he believes more strongly? Can I just...decide to feel differently?

So..... you're worried about the fact that you /didn't/ immediately hate an opposing viewpoint?

I don't think that's a problem. You looked at the point of view of a person whose point of view was opposed to yours. You engaged him in debate, listening and /genuinely considering/ the benefits of his viewpoint. After doing so, you looked at the situation and decided to stick with your original viewpoint. And not for irrational, tribalistic my-tribe-is-always-right rules (at least, I assume not) but because you really thought, after considering the opposite viewpoint, that your original viewpoint was /right/.

That all seems well and good to me. I don't think it would have been any better to have rejected him out-of-hand.

Consider it the other way around; when debating with this colleague, would you have preferred him to argue as you did - considering your viewpoint, thinking about it, and so on - or would you have preferred him to reject you out-of-hand?
