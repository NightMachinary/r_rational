I recommend the show if you like action adventure cartoons, kind of like TMNT, but the plot and characters are generally more intelligent than most cartoons from the time. In the show, gargoyles turn to stone breakable by a sledgehammer during the day (even if they're underground), have the strength to bend steel and leap 10 ft into the air, claws that cut through stone, tails prehensile enough to trip people, and wings that let them glide on air currents. However, they aren't much more durable than regular humans.

The show focused more on the way they interact with humans who fear or want to exploit them, but it is stated that gargoyles have a strong instinct to protect the land they call home. It's a bit vague just how strong that instinct is since it's really used to justify why they don't tend to run away from danger and most of them seem to like fighting crime, though those could be due to standard character traits or cultural norms.
