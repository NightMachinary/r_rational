I'm super late to this discussion but I just wanna say that i definitely empathize with /you/, [[/u/trekie140]]. I recently had an argument in a related vein with my religious mother about America, more specifically Donald Trump. She tried to give me the whole "America was founded on Christian values; look how great it is" to justify why Trump, despite all of the blatantly /idiotic/ shit he's done, is doing a decent job so far. Apparently (I haven't researched this, so I took her at her word), he's made some decisions that conservative Christians really approve of recently, as far as certain laws go.

I continue to be in jaw dropping awe of how my mother can support this guy. I went on to expound on how, just because America has "In God We Trust" on its money and God is mentioned in the Constitution doesn't mean its entire success is predicated on its "Christian" values. She would refuse my logic and ask me questions like "So how is a country being founded on such values bad?" and when I give several examples about how theocracies have /sucked/, she ignores my points or moves onto another point. It felt like I was landing free throws, only for my opponent to ignore the scoreboard and stubbornly claim they're winning.

Anyway. Sorry for the rant about me, me, me. But I get you; it's frustrating to argue with someone that you know (and by know I mean, you can pretty much empirically prove) is wrong. Some people refuse to be swayed by logic and I find that religious people are very much this way. It takes a certain amount of stubbornness to be religious in modern society and this shows in arguments with them. I have no trouble with people being religious; believe what you want, do what you want with yourself and your choices and pray to whatever deity(ies) you believe in. But when those beliefs start spilling over into areas that affect others and infringe on others' rights to not be *fucking sheep*, I have an issue.

At the end of the day, OP, you're a good person for empathizing. There can't be any understanding without some amount of empathy. You can't come to any sort of agreement with a non like minded individual if you're not willing to emotionally invest to some degree. Otherwise we'd all just be caught in never ending cycles of violence and anger and nothing would get accomplished. Empathizing with someone is the emotional equivalent to sitting a child down and asking them "Why do you think it was ok to push Suzy down" as opposed to simply striking them and telling them not to do it again. While you /may/ get the child to stop pushing Suzy down with the latter option, you haven't helped that child in the long run. That child isn't a more understanding and mature person that slowly learns to care about not harming others. He's simply afraid of you and will restrain himself in your presence. This isn't about my being for or against physical punishment of children; I'm more so saying any sort of punitive action should have a component of empathy and respect. Otherwise the person in question won't grow and change for the better. It takes a big man (or woman) to do that with someone who's so fundamentally different from a moral standpoint. In my own little internet, reddit, [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community member way, I'm proud of you.

*TL;DR: My mom supports Trump, wtf. Arguing with religious people about topics related to their religion can be infuriatingly cyclical and pointless. They should keep their theological beliefs out of anything that affects other people, such as state wide legislation. Your empathy is a strength and something to be proud of, not ashamed of. It's the most important step towards mutual understanding.*
