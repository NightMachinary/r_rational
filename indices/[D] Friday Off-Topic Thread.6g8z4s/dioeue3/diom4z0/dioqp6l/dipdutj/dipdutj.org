I don't think you made a poor argument because you empathised with his position. It seems you made a poor argument because:

- You didn't want to explicitly contradict him, out of politeness. This hamstrung your ability to argue with him.

- In-person arguments are really hard.

The ability to empathise is a crucial tool for changing people's minds. To go back to the pro-life vs. pro-choice example, both sides are generally TERRIBLE at convincing the other side.

Pro-life: "Abortion is murder, you're murdering a baby just because you don't want to carry it to term, and that's a horrible thing to do."

Pro-choice: "If you don't want an abortion, don't have one. You have the right to your choice, and I have the right to mine."

Except those arguments are terrible, because they don't address what the other side /actually believes/. "Don't murder babies" is not a good argument for the pro-life side, because their opponents don't believe it's murder. They'd be better off convincing the pro-choice side that life does, in fact, begin at conception. If they could do that, the pro-choice advocate would agree with almost all their other points immediately.

Similarly, the pro-choice argument of "If you don't want an abortion, don't have one" is terrible, because pro-life advocates believe abortion is murder. "If you don't want babies murdered, don't murder them" is hardly a good argument, but that's what it sounds like to the pro-life side. The pro-choice side would be better off trying to convince the pro-life side that life doesn't begin at conception after all.

Similarly, it seems your homophobe has a different prior to you, which is causing him to behave logically from his perspective. "Homosexuality is both a sin and a choice" is his prior. It's wrong, but it's what he believes. Given that viewpoint, a lot of his actions make perfect sense.

This means that homosexuals are going to hell...so you would naturally try to convince them they should stop. You would probably be civil to them (as he was to you) and wouldn't go around calling them faggots or beating the shit out of them. But you probably wouldn't be a fan of gay marriage or gay pride parades - that's legitimising a lifestyle that causes people to be eternally damned.

If you want to argue effectively against a position, you do have to empathise with it to some degree - at least enough to treat your opponents as human, rather than The Other who believes horrific things for no reason, like that we should murder babies if we're too lazy to carry them any more, or that we should subjugate women's rights because we're cartoon-supervillain level misogynists.
