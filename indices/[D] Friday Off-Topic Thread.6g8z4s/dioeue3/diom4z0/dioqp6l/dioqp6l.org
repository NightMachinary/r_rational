Does he deserve empathy, though? He explicitly said that he wants to impose his arbitrary rules upon myself and used illogical arguments to back up his point (he believes America was founded on "Christian principles"). I countered his casual insistence that I deserve to be discriminated against not by pointing out why his actions were reprehensible, but by attempting to uncover inconsistencies in his beliefs that he refused to acknowledge.

I couldn't even reason with him the way I'm supposed to because I was too stupid to think of better arguments in the moment. His rebuttals were contradictory, but I didn't point that out because I thought he wouldn't listen to such statements and he ended up ignoring my logic anyway. I didn't even try to convince him that sexuality wasn't a choice or remind him to "love thy neighbor", I just kept giving ground to him hoping that I'd find an exploitable opening but he was too good at mental gymnastics.

I put on a shameful performance for a morality debate because I was afraid of alienating him by explicitly contradicting his beliefs, when the mere fact that I wasn't a conservative Christian was probably enough for him to not bother listening. I completely failed to assess the situation and now he will continue to commit injustices believing them to be virtuous, while days later I see pictures of same-sex couple and think the disgust bigots would feel instead of feeling happiness of seeing symbols of acceptance.

I failed at arguing about morals, my dwelling on that failure is interfering with my moral instincts, and I shouldn't even care because choosing to discriminate against LGBT people is a repulsive choice. The fact that I don't feel disgust towards this person's beliefs, and the fact that I was concerned about alienating him when he probably wouldn't care anyway, makes me question how much conviction I have. I was tolerant of someone who is intolerant of me when I should've been righteously indignant at a violation of the social contract.
