Sorry, I should've said "in favor of equal rights and the rule of law". That is not exclusive to liberals. I could've said I was talking about classical liberalism, which is a key part of conservative principles as well, but I didn't and I wasn't thinking about that at the time so I deserve the criticism. I am in the wrong here.

I was stereotyping all conservatives due to my concern over authoritarianism and prejudice against minorities, but fascists who embrace such ideas openly shouldn't be compared to conservatives regardless of how they practice their principles. I was wrong to refer to you and others in the same breath as Nazis.

I'm worried that the way I phrased the above statement will cause it to be taken as a back-handed comment, but I swear I do not mean it in that way. I feel incredibly guilty about what I said and mean what I say now completely literally. I beg your forgiveness for my I inappropriate comments.
