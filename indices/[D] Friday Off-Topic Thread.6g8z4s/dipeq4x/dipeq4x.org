How do you do /subtlety/? I'm fucking terrible at it. Like, I can be blunt as hell, I can keep noticeably silent, and I can also keep a secret at level 2 (concealing the existence /of/ a secret) or 3 (deliberately directing attention away from even fairly obvious evidence). What I'm really bad at is being /subtle/, where the thing I'm trying to signal /is/ in fact signaled, but not overtly Because Social Reasons.

Many of my attempts at subtlety actually end up without the person I'm trying to be subtle to noticing I was trying to communicate.

What do?
