My experience in it is limited, but isn't it a matter of attention?

I.e., you want to utter a subtle statement X. If the person A it is intended for doesn't direct full attention towards you, that person is unlikely to /think/ about your statement to unveil the hidden meaning, reacting only to its surface meaning. You need to draw their attention towards your words first, /then/ be subtle.

Make sure to be intelligible, as well.
