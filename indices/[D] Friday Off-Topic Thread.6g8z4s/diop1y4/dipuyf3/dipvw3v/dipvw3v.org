The belief that life is meaningless unless it is immortal is an extreme example of my beliefs, and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6g8z4s/d_friday_offtopic_thread/diponag/][it appears to not be consistent]], in the light of some statements here.

I still think that non-eternal existence and death, even by the Heat Death, would make humanity frustratingly insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but not exactly /meaningless/.

I disagree that life is beautiful by definition, I would prefer omnicide to Moloch's victory, but it indeed seems to be a fundamental disagreement.

  As for our future, I choose not to be fatalist because being fatalist is not useful in any way

I agree. I do dislike being fatalistic, as well.
