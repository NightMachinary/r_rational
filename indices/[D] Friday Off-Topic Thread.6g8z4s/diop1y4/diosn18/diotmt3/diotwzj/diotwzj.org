No, I understood that as "if you find yoursellf in agreement with people who convinced themselves that commiting evil actions is a good thing, perhaps you're making the same mistake in reasoning as they and so are on your way to convincing yourself that evil is good as well; alarm bell, try harder to reconsider". Kind of similar to association fallacy, except it has a grain of sense.
