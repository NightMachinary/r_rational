  It was the end of the workday, I'm stressed out over other things, and it kinda seemed like you were intellectualizing to that degree too. I dunno.

Perhaps. I'm not actually sure how the way I choose to express my reasoning looks from the outside.

#+begin_quote
  I guess our disagreement is that this seems mathematically incoherent to me. If a sum matters, the individual summands matter, because summands add up to the sum.
#+end_quote

They matter from the /inside/ of the system, but from the /outside/, from the perspective of an entity that chooses starting conditions then doesn't interfere, only the total sum matters. My argument is that the system of humanity could be considered a system that is not worth initiating, from the perspective of a human placed into the position of such an entity.

... My wording is totaly convoluted as well, isn't it.

  blaming the universe
#+end_quote

Eh, that line of mine was half-serious to begin with. The universe is not sentient, so blaming it is not useful, but being irrationally frustrated at the universe for not being sentient and caring is valid, if irrational.
