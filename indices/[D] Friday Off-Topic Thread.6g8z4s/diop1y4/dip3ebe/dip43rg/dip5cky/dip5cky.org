If the proportion of bad ends to good ends worries you, then simply live in a way where you maximally influence events around you toward a good end. Don't worry about events outside your control, focus on ones you know you can control.

This gives two potential outcomes.

1. A bad outcome occurs. While you may experience one of the bad outcomes, you at least have some satisfaction in knowing you did what you can to influence events.

2. A good outcome occurs. And you receive satisfaction knowing that what you did helped to influence events slightly toward what you perceive as a good outcome.

Nobody is omniscient, you don't have to find a perfect path to save all of humanity. All you can do is what you can influence within your own life and those around you.
