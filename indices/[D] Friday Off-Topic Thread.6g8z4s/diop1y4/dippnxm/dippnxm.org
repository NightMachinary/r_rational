For me it's a matter of perspective.

As you put it, we may well be living in the most pivotal time in human existence, with myriad bad ends available to us. Personally, I find this inspiring. We aren't just witnesses to the future coming into being, we can also influenceâ€‹ how it plays out. I'm filled with purpose by the thought of being able to nudge humanity a little closer to a better future, and I intend to live my life with that goal in mind.

(Potential extinction or worse is also all the more reason to make the most of the superstimuli this century has to offer)

I'm in agreement on pettiness and outrage, I find it quite liberating to be able to dismiss the latest insignificant controversies and not bother having any strong feelings about them.

As for ranting about gravity, it's important to be able to recognise that there is an issue to be overcome. That's one step on the way to space travel :P

Humanity probably does have a long series of existential hurdles ahead. All we can do is to leap over ours, and trust in our successors to handle the next one. We haven't failed so far!

We can't change history and avert all the suffering that has already occurred, but we can mitigate the pains of the present and the future. I think that's a worthy aim, regardless of whether we'll be going extinct in a hundred years or a billion. Besides, unless you think suffering is infinitely worse than happiness is good, we wouldn't need an eternal utopia. I'm sure a million years would be more than enough to pay off our utilon debt to the past :P
