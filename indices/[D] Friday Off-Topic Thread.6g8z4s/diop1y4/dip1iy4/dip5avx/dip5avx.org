  Just because there's more bad than good doesn't extinguish the good.
#+end_quote

It doesn't, but does /any/ amount of good justifies /any/ amount of bad? Someone was tortured for fifty years, then was shown an entertaining 5-minute video before being killed. Was it worth it? Are you sure humanity is not in such situation?

#+begin_quote
  I've seen people act like they know exactly where the world is going to go, they create there own little model of the world. But that model is undeniably biased by their own experiences
#+end_quote

Well, yes, of course. I'm just speculating based on my best understanding of the situation, as well. I can't predict unexpected breakthroughs or discoveries, but some general trends, such as technological progress or political changes, seem apparent, so I assume they would stay unchanged and try to imagine broadly what happens. I could be wrong; I /hope/ I'm wrong, I even said as much.

But so what? /Not/ think about the future at all? That's exactly how many of these existential threats wipe us out, /if/ they ever become actual. Better prepare and then be proven wrong than not prepare.

  Many people forget this but the people in power aren't fucking stupid. At least the ones with the most power anyway. Also they're human
#+end_quote

Exactly. They're human, prone to making mistakes and being impulsive, some more than others. Some could think it's better to die than let the Enemy win, some are bad at understanding long-term consequences, some may misjudge their weapons' or defenses' capabilities, etc. Not very likely to happen, but likely /enough/.

  In terms of AGI, do you really think people are going to let that happen? Literally everyone is going to have protections against both the ones they create and other countries
#+end_quote

The protections may turn out to not be advanced enough.

#+begin_quote
  If you you think I'm deflecting criticism by saying whatever I want than adding "but I'm probably wrong" like some sort of safety blanket...
#+end_quote

Nah. I don't see what's wrong with safety blankets.
