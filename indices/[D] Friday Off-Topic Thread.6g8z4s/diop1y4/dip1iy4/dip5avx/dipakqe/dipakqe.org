  It doesn't, but does any amount of good justifies any amount of bad? Someone was tortured for fifty years, then was shown an entertaining 5-minute video before being killed. Was it worth it? Are you sure humanity is not in such situation?

Honestly? Yeah. I mainly think that because what's the alternative? Nothing? It could just be me but I'd prefer existing over not.

Another hypothetical. Someone is deprived of any and all sensations for 100 years. Do you think they would welcome pain if it was what they first felt after years of deprivation?

  But so what? Not think about the future at all? That's exactly how many of these existential threats wipe us out, if they ever become actual. Better prepare and then be proven wrong than not prepare.

Apologies, I was more ranting at people in general I guess.

  Not very likely to happen, but likely enough.

I think its far more likely people who are that impulsive and idiotic would be removed from power. If not by the people than by other people in power who don't want the end of the world.

  The protections may turn out to not be advanced enough.
#+end_quote

Why? Why would the protections fail? Why would the AI try to destroy humanity at all? I'm fairly certain we would have a lot of safeguards, if not from the insistence of scientists, than from politicians who are trying to convince people they aren't making Skynet.
