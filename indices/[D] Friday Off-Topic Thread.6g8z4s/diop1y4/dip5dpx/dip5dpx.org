Do you buy arguments about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality][Quantum Immortality]]? If you die, no problem, then you won't have to be around to suffer and process the fact that human existence is going to fail or has failed. If you live, well the only scenario were you live indefinitely is one were FAI has come about, so you might as well not worry either way.
