Well, it appears our values directly oppose each other, then.

Though I'm not sure if your argument even works under your /own/ values, either; that's simply not how mankind works, I'm afraid. Any kind of "cleansing fire" that destabilizes the global situation would see more of the "filth" cropping up afterwards (whatever you mean by that), which would need cleansing again, etc.

Unless the eternal cycle of nuclear wars I imagined is a good end for you, in which case huh that's a peculiar mind you have here.
