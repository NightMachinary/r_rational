Yes, there's no objective meaning to existence --- not even a meaning that could be shared by all humans --- so that part is indeed subjective to me. But I think there could be a human-universal /utility/ of life/[[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition][CEV]]; we can agree that bringing children into the world only to torture them for fifty years is morally abhorrent, and we can multiply. We could in theory calculate the total net utility of humanity's existence throughout all of history, and what I claim is that it's going to be /negative/ if we all die/be enslaved within this century. Hence the "no point"/"better off never existing", since the value of not-existing is zero. I don't see how impermanence and not-universality of our values help, here.

  all-encompassing surveillance isn't by itself a bad thing, since it can serve as one of very few possible tools for averting many of *the Bed Ends*

  I recommend you reading [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Sandbox/DocFuture][the Doc Future trilogy]]. It doesn't give any answers to the problem of multitude of likely Bad Ends (not ones that would work in real world anyway), but the problem itself still plays a major part in the storyline and narrative

Hmm, interesting, I didn't know about that. Thanks for the information.
