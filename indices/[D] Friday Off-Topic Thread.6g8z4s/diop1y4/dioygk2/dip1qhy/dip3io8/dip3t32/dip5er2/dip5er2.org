I've heard it before as well (though I disagree with it). The argument is basically that non-existence is the ultimate evil and any existence is better than none at all, even if that existence is defined by permanent torture. I'm not sure that this is a stance derived from logic, since it seems like one derived from values instead. It seems to me like the logical extreme of anti-death sentiment, where death is posited as the ultimate evil which any thinking being would shun. Therefore, torture is the lesser evil. (I hope that this does not misrepresent that viewpoint, since I don't have the inside view.)

I'm a little more sympathetic if we're talking about, say, the last remaining humans, since then we're talking about the entire future of humanity (and as far as we know, intelligent life in the universe) rather than the future of a single human.
