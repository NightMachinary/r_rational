  a human-universal utility of life/CEV

Do you mean by “human-universal” that it would satisfy the preferences of all humans currently alive in the world? Because --- not to sound sardonic --- if so I think you have overly optimistic notions about humanity in general. I'm not even talking about the arguments described by alexanderwales in a parallel comment but just about people who'd want to bring children into literal 50 years of suffering just because they value\enjoy the suffering of others.

  [..] the total net utility of humanity's existence throughout all of history [is] going to be negative if we all die [..] within this century. Hence the "no point"/"better off never existing", since the value of not-existing is zero.

First of all, as a sidenote, you may find it interesting that your stance sounds rather similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism#David_Benatar][David Benatar's argument for antinatalism.]]

Secondly, this statement is still being based upon the definition of meaning of life from your previous comments (you just sidestepped using “meaning of life” and replaced it with “human-universal utility of life”). Namely, that our existence will (would, would've) be meaningful if the “net utility of humanity's existence throughout all of history” ends up being positive.

So what I'm saying is that you are the one who's choosing how to define the meaning of life for yourself. And /if/ you define your meaning of life as quoted above, /then/ will you start seeing humanity's existence as meaningless because of your argument quoted higher.

+It /would've/ been better if+

+From a human's perspective, it /would've/ been better if+

From Benatar's (& Co) perspective, it /would've/ been better if our universe in its current form never existed, sure --- but it /does/, so the point is moot. There's no magical button [[https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/595u6g/looking_for_books_in_which_the_protagonists_main/][to destroy the whole universe,]] so including the non-existing universe, in the subjunctive mood, in your worldview and life philosophy is pointless.

By this point it becomes a bit of a circular discussion because in my next sentence I'd be repeating the paragraph from my previous comment about defining a more humble meaning of life for oneself that doesn't clash with how our world works.

  I don't see how impermanence and not-universality of our values help, here.
#+end_quote

Those were side-notes to how what you-from-the-present see as a dystopia may not be a dystopia to inhabitants in the future, and how what you predict and evaluate as severe suffering may not be seen as such by actual inhabitants in the future. They weren't tied to the meaning of life discussion, just un-ordered rebuttals to some other things from your comment that I didn't want to accentuate because of their secondary nature.

The annoying thing is that I often catch myself writing one instead of another, and now it still managed to sneakily get right past me. Maybe if I correct my pronunciation for both (i.e. [bɛd] v.s. [bad]) it'll make me stop treating them as homophones, and the problem will go away on its own.
