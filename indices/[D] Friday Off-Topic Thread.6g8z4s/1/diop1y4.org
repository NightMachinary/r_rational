*[WARNING: EXISTENTIAL CRISIS]*

--------------

People here were debating politics recently, talked about how recent developments have them truly /hating/ their political opposition, as much as they hated themselves for hating.

Well, I'm pretty apathetic towards politics. Perhaps /fatalistic/, even, as much as that concept disgusts me.

I don't believe humanity is going to survive this century, or /humanity as we know it/ at the very least. Most likely, a global nuclear war will ensue, and humanity will be returned to the Stone Age. Perhaps our next civilization, built from the ashes of this one, will fare better. Probably not, though: we will be repeatedly driving themselves to near-extinction, destroying the civilzation over and over, until we finally succeed and kill ourselves.

The alternatives seem worse.

Artifical intelligences become more and more sophisticated. Unless /one/ competent and benevolent group of researches gets far ahead of the others, there will be a race to finish and activate our first and last AGI. Some, or should I say /most/, of the participants of this race would be either insufficiently competent (if there even /is/ such a thing as "sufficiently competent" in these matters), or evil/misaligned. Military AGIs, ideological AGIs, terrorist AGIs, whatever. The odds of a FAI group winning are low, the odds of it /succeeding/ in these conditions (as opposed to rushing and making a mistake in the code) are lower. As such, if humanity activates an AGI, it will most likely erase us all, or create hell on Earth if the winner is a would-be-FAI with a subtle mistake in utility function. MIRI tries to avert it, but would it really be able to influence government research and such firmly enough, when the time comes?

Of course, AGI creation may be impossible in the near future. If it's neither AGI nor mere nukes...

Humans are barely capable of handling what technology we already developed: pollution, global warming left unchecked, the ever-present nuclear threat. When we'll get to nanomachines, advanced bioengineering, cyborgization, human uploading? Most likely, we'll cause an omnicide, possibly taking all of Earth or all of the Solar System with us. If we're not so lucky, it's either a dystopia with absolute and unopposable surveillance the cyberpunk warned us about, or a complete victory of [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Moloch]], with everything we value being sacrificed to be more productive and earn the right to exist.

Interstellar travel and colonization of other planets would merely make it worse. The concept of an actual star war with billions or trillions dying is probably worse than almost anything else, so it's pretty good we're probably not going to get that far.

Recent political developments aren't particularly reassuring. If neither of these things happens, global situation will merely continue to deteriorate. Global-scale economic collapse, new Dark Ages? A non-nuclear World War Three? Even so, we won't be stagnant forever. Would the post-new-Dark-Ages humanity be better at preventing existential threats as described above? Doubt it.

In short, entropy wins here, as it does: the list of Bad Ends is much longer than the list of Happy Ends, so a Bad End is much more likely.

Being outraged at Trump or whoever seems so pointless and petty, in the face of that.

I don't even think it could be /fixed/, I'm just, as someone in the abovementioned thread had said, "ranting about gravity". Yes, there's such things as CFAR that try to make humans more reasonable on average, and some influential people are concerned about humanity's future as well, but I fear it may be far too little far too late.

(Brief digression: the most funny thing is, even /if/ we succeed in AGI or somehow prosper without it, older aliens or older uFAIs they set loose would most likely do us in /anyway/. Not to mention the Heat Death...)

And if we're not going to last, what was the point? To enjoy what happiness we've had? Nonsense. Our history wasn't exactly a happy one, not even a /net positive/, far from a net positive. If only we've succeed in creating eternal utopia, it would've all been worth it, but... If humanity isn't going to last, if everything we value, everything we've accomplished and everyone we know are going to be simply erased, there was no fucking point at all. Will humanity have lived in pain for millenia, only to have a moment's respite right before death? If so, it would've been better off never existing.

Am I wrong anywhere? I very much hope so.

Before you ask: no, I'm pretty sure I am not depressed. I'm usually pretty happy with my life, I just honestly don't see us lasting, logically, and don't see what the point is then, global-scale. I'm proud of what humanity has managed to accomplish, and I loathe the universe for setting us up to fall.
