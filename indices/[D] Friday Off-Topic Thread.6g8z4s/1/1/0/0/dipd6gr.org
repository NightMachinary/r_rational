  ...Was that deliberately worded in such a convoluted fashion?
#+end_quote

It was the end of the workday, I'm stressed out over other things, and it kinda seemed like you were intellectualizing to that degree too. I dunno.

#+begin_quote
  From the moral perspective, if we could predict how the system is going to evolve, what matters is its estimated total utility as time approaches infinity, not utility's value at any particular step.
#+end_quote

I guess our disagreement is that this seems mathematically incoherent to me. If a sum matters, the individual summands matter, because summands add up to the sum.

#+begin_quote
  The universe includes all we know, and so is to blame for all that happens.
#+end_quote

Sure, but not only is the universe not a person, it's not something we can even counterfactually change. We don't know /what/ to /have/ changed in the universe's initial conditions that would have made us come out better.

I don't feel comfortable blaming people when I can't tell them how to change for next time, and I don't feel comfortable pointing the same finger at the universe.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, it includes us, but also all the rest of our circumstances: laws of physics, our bodies, technology available, resources accessible, lack of FAIs nearby, etc.
#+end_quote

Technology available, resources accessible? We make technology, so I don't get how we're supposed to blame it for not being made by us. Resources? Ok, makes sense, if our easiest energy source for industrialization hadn't been dead dinosaurs we'd have been much better off.

Our bodies, though? How could we be the same kinds of people without the same kinds of bodies? What range of bodies would yield people we'd choose to replace ourselves with, if we were Time Lords so to speak? Lack of FAIs nearby? That's almost /spoiled/. Who are we to demand that the universe supply us with a highly complex, fine-tuned machine that we so far can't work out for ourselves. And if it had, how would we know we'd got the right one?

I seriously don't like blaming the universe for the fact that I'm ignorant as hell. Better to blame it for not making it easier for me to do the necessary work of un-ignoranting myself and unfucking my situation myself.

#+begin_quote
  we can't really blame ourselves for being designed as we are, can we?
#+end_quote

Sure we can ;-)! We're the only thing we control, after all.

#+begin_quote
  I just dislike that we're most likely going to go anyway.
#+end_quote

Conditional on doing nothing, we will. Conditional on getting our shit together and taking action, there's a fair chance we won't. Mostly. Partially.
