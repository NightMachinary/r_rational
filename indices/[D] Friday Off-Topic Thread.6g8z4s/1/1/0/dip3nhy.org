  But more seriously... I'm not sure this is the right view to take? That is, if every time T is justified by the things that come causally downstream of it, doesn't this sort of turn into an inductive (or open-ball) proof with no base-case (no point around which to form the ball)? Should the Big Bang require moral justification by the heat-death of the universe?

...Was that deliberately worded in such a convoluted fashion? Anyway, I think that yes, it should. From the moral perspective, if we could predict how the system is going to evolve, what matters is its estimated total utility as time approaches infinity, not utility's value at any particular step.

  The universe didn't set us up for anything. It set us up to be the exactly the creatures we are, which means that to wish the universe had been otherwise is to wish you had been otherwise.

The universe includes all we know, and so is to blame for all that happens. Yes, it includes /us/, but also all the rest of our circumstances: laws of physics, our bodies, technology available, resources accessible, lack of FAIs nearby, etc. It's silly to blame a nealry-definitely non-sentient thing for anything, but we can't really blame /ourselves/ for being designed as we are, can we?

  We still have to do what we can do to ensure that the world /isn't/ totally destroyed, by boring or interesting means.

Yes, I suppose so. I'm not arguing that we should go gentle into that good night, I just dislike that we're most likely going to go anyway.
