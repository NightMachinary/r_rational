  I just honestly don't see us lasting, logically, and don't see what the point is then, global-scale.

But more seriously... I'm not sure this is the right view to take? That is, if every time T is justified by the things that come causally downstream of it, doesn't this sort of turn into an inductive (or open-ball) proof with no base-case (no point around which to form the ball)? Should the Big Bang require moral justification by the heat-death of the universe?

From my point of view, you could tell me that ten years from now, the world would completely change, and everything would be perfect. I'd still tell you that my life right now kinda sucks, for all kinds of mixed-up personal reasons. It's nice to think that the integral of our entire causal trajectory adds up to something positive, but the individual points still have their own individual values.

  I loathe the universe for setting us up to fall.

The universe didn't set us up for anything. It set us up to be the exactly the creatures we are, which means that to wish the universe had been otherwise is to wish /you/ had been otherwise. Sure, you can wish that, but how do you suppose nature is supposed to cough you up precisely in some better way?

As to much of the rest, I have to reboot my computer and go see a friend for the evening. I'll write more later. Unfortunately, your prognosis is at least mostly accurate, but that doesn't really change the set of actions available to us. We still have to do what we can do to ensure that the world /isn't/ totally destroyed, by boring or interesting means.
