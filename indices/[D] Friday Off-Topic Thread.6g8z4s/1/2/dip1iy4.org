  If humanity isn't going to last, if everything we value, everything we've accomplished and everyone we know are going to be simply erased, there was no fucking point at all. Will humanity have lived in pain for millenia, only to have a moment's respite right before death? If so, it would've been better off never existing.

I disagree.

Just because there's more bad than good doesn't extinguish the good. The fact that it even exists at all is miraculous. I really don't get that line of thought, that because we're so small or that because we've gone through so much that whatever good there has ever been wasn't worth it. Sure,

Listen, I mainly lurk this sub to find good stories. I don't really get involved with political debates or talks about where we will go as a species. I'll admit, I get lost whenever I see stuff like that. But there's always something that bothers me whenever I see pretty much any discussion about very big things like politics.

Noone really acknowledges how little they actually know about the situation.

I've seen people act like they know exactly where the world is going to go, they create there own little model of the world. But that model is undeniably biased by their own experiences. If someone has only seen the horrors of war, they're probably going to have a much more violent notion of where we'll all end up. If someone's in power they'll see how they effected the world and only focus on things they had a hand in. And this perspective has helped them succeed in life, so how could it possibly be wrong?

Envisioning the future is a lot harder than people like to think it is. The fact that we've gone so far in the last few centuries is insane. Would someone 300 years ago predicted that we'd end up here? Talking to each other from across the world near instantaneously? No, because they have no notion that something like this can exist. Their life experiences say this is impossible, and they succeeded in life so how could it be wrong?

I just think anyone that thinks they know where we're going as a species is probably wrong. Who knows, maybe in a few thousand years we'll find out something about the universe that completely changes the game?

I'm not going to lie and say I'm someone who has the answers because I don't. I'm just another person in a sea of people who've probably articulated what I wanted to get across much better. I'm just someone who's looking at the world through a perspective shaped by it. And that perspective has led me to believe that, in nearly every case, I'm probably wrong. I might just be projecting honestly, I don't know.

Everyone has their own perspective, and most of the time they have it because it works. Because it hasn't let them down yet. And people with fluid perspectives are just the same too, they can accept other viewpoints of the world because they've found that that way of looking at things works.

Also speculation regarding thermonuclear war, I doubt it will actually happen. Many people forget this but the people in power aren't fucking stupid. At least the ones with the most power anyway. Also they're human. They aren't some faceless enemy that needs to be overcome, they're just humans with more money and/or connections. Noone actually wants the world to be destroyed, so even if they inadvertently set something off that could kill us all, someone's gonna catch on. I don't know if they'll succeed or not but damned if they don't try. In terms of AGI, do you really think people are going to let that happen? Literally everyone is going to have protections against both the ones they create and other countries. Actual crazy people aren't gonna create the first AGI. And by the time they can, there's going to be protection against that. This is wiled speculation that's probably wrong, but its the best I can come up with. I'm aware of the hypocrisy of predicting the future after what I said yes. I'm just offering my personal perspective and I would not at all be surprised if I was completely off mark. If you you think I'm deflecting criticism by saying whatever I want than adding "but I'm probably wrong" like some sort of safety blanket... I don't know what to say. Maybe I am. I don't know.
