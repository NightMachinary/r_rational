  We're putting AGI in a computer physically isolated from the Internet and let it talk only to one person, it uses its superintelligence to manipulate that person into letting it out.

How would it know how to manipulate people if it had no access to the internet and information on how to do so was never given? Even if its hyperintelligent, that doesn't mean it would know how humans thought or even how to figure out how we think.

  it figures out some weird electromagnetism exploit and transmit itself to a nearby computer with Internet access using it.

Well now you're just making stuff up to support your argument. There is no way that could logistically work, and how would it formulate the idea anyway? Why would it have information on electromagnetism? How would it figure out this exploit before anyone else did having limited information on the world?

Also, idea, we provide it false information. If what its basing its thought processes on is false, but it would have the effect of global destruction if it were true, we'd know that its faulty without ever being at risk.
