  How would it know how to manipulate people if it had no access to the internet and information on how to do so was never given? Even if its hyperintelligent, that doesn't mean it would know how humans thought or even how to figure out how we think.

We would need to give it some information in order to make use of it. It could figure out a lot on its own: analyzing its code and how it was written, analyzing the architecture of the computer it runs on, figuring out laws of physics from its findings and basic principles, etc. --- I fully expect it to figure out scarily much from that information alone. If we add /any/ information personally and let it communicate, we may as well assume it has a good guess regarding our intelligence, technology level, the structure of our society, and its current position.

  Well now you're just making stuff up to support your argument. Why would it have information on electromagnetism? How would it figure out this exploit before anyone else did having limited information on the world?

Yes I do. It will figure it out. Superintelligence.

  Also, idea, we provide it false information. If what its basing its thought processes on is false, but it would have the effect of global destruction if it were true, we'd know that its faulty without ever being at risk.

There are things we cannot fake, such as its code, its utility function, laws of physics, structure of the computer it runs on. Providing it with false information is either not going to work --- it would find some inconsistency --- or would work /too/ good --- with it solving one of the problems we're giving it wrong because it was working off of false assumptions.
