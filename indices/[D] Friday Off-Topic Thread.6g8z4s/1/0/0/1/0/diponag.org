  Do you mean by “human-universal” that it would satisfy the preferences of all humans currently alive in the world?
#+end_quote

No. It would in general satisfy the preferences of most of us /and/ would have satisfied the preferences of the rest if they hadn't effectively gone insane due to lives they lead/genetic disadvantages. What exactly constitutes “insanity” in this context is an unsolved problem, as far as I know.

  First of all, as a sidenote, you may find it interesting that your stance sounds rather similar to David Benatar's argument for antinatalism.
#+end_quote

Essentially true. That said,

  It is strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide to create it, and it is not strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide not to create it
#+end_quote

--- huh, that sounds really inconsistent.

No, I think I disagree with the fourth statement, that "the absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom this absence is a deprivation". Absence of pleasure /is/ bad, I'm just arguing that it's a lesser evil compared to the amount of suffering present in the humanity as it is now.

I'll have to reword my previous statement, then. The subjective value of /never having existed/ is zero, while the value of /choosing/ to not create a human is proportional to the difference between bad and good that human would have experienced (i.e. =B-G=, if =B>G=, it's good, if =B<G=, it's bad); choosing to die, then, is effectively similar to choosing to not create a human.

  Secondly, this statement is still being based upon the definition of meaning of life from your previous comments (you just sidestepped using “meaning of life” and replaced it with “human-universal utility of life”).
#+end_quote

Hm, perhaps. I /think/ it's possible to define human-universal utility of life, but I may be wrong; meanwhile, all my statements about its properties are in fact statements about /my/ worldview that I try to project onto everyone else.

Huh, I didn't realize it. How awkward.

  defining a more humble meaning of life for oneself
#+end_quote

Eh, I don't want to. I don't think it's logically impossible for humanity to build an utopia, it's just very unlikely, but we should try to anyway. Moreover, it's not like my worldview is causing me much distress or anything, I'm not nihilistic/fatalistic in my daily life.
