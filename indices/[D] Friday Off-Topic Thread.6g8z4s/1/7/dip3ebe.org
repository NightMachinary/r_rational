  the list of Bad Ends is much longer than the list of Happy Ends, so a Bad End is much more likely.

I believe that this is a logical fallacy. For instance, things I could do tonight:

1) jump off a cliff

2) take an impromptu vacation

3) go to the nearest city and start yelling about how the end is nigh

or

4) have dinner

The list of Things That Aren't Eating Dinner is longer than the list of Things That Are Eating Dinner but yet I'm much more likely to eat dinner.
