Every so often, I see a story with the message that death gives life meaning, that the limits on our time here and the fact that we can't do everything is what makes what we do meaningful and beautiful.

I heartily disagree. Life is beautiful, inherently. I will resist my own death as much as I am able, and my accomplishments are no less meaningful because I seek immortality. If I saw anything beneficial in death, I would be planning to take my own life as soon as the benefits outweighed the downside of being dead.

I see a similar perspective from you, that death strips life of meaning, that life is not beautiful unless it is immortal. It's the polar opposite of the perspective above, but shares common facets. For instance, if I held this perspective and believed I would not be immortal, then my life has no meaning and everything I do is meaningless and there's no reason to /not/ kill myself and just cut out the middleman.

I heartily disagree with this too. Life is beautiful, period. I want life to last as long as possible, and when someone dies it's a horrible tragedy that we as a society have been forced to accept for the sake of our sanity, but while they lived their life and love and joy made the world brighter. Even the saddest example of a human being who knows neither love or joy makes the world a little brighter, in my eyes.

If there is a part of this that you will disagree with, I expect it would be this, because I say these things out of a fundamental conviction, which isn't something that can one can just convince someone else of. But it stands that I see life, in general and in specific, as net-positive, that even if the world and everything on it is obliterated today it was still worth it, that there is no suffering worse than death and everyone who has ever lived has brought a little bit of light to the world, even if some are net-dim by ending other lights.

As for our future, I choose not to be fatalist because being fatalist is not useful in any way. If AI is destined to consume the world and delete human life, if we use all our nukes and all human progress evaporates, even if Moloch gets the last laugh and there is little /human/ about Earth anymore, we accomplish nothing by deciding this is inevitable. It may seem a little anti-truth, that I would not consider a fatalistic viewpoint even if there were no other reasonable conclusion, but when you weigh the outcomes, me and others like me being non-fatalistic has a slight chance of preventing the bad end where being fatalistic accomplishes nothing.

I can be convinced that the world /might/ be doomed, that Moloch has opened its ugly jaws and wishes to swallow us whole or that the first AI is most likely going to be unfriendly, but knowing that is useful, since I can dedicate my efforts towards helping the human cause.
