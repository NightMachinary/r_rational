Humanity - /life/, in fact, life as a whole - lives, and has always lived, in a delicate balance along the edge of disaster. At any point, over millions of years, people have had the ability to stand up, look proudly over the horizon, and say "What's that thing in the sky and why is it getting bigger?"

Volcanos, earthquakes, tsunamis would not kill of humanity as a /whole/ - but they would certainly kill off a village, a city, even at times an entire civilisation. And rocks from the sky - those could kill of an entire /ecology/. (And have. Look at what happened to the dinosaurs). Life is a delicate balance on the edge of utter disaster - in the face of the laws of thermodynamics, life only /exists/ because it's near to a massive great big energy source that's radiating out like anything.

And sometimes, the danger really /is/ planet-destroying. Consider the Cold War. An entire generation more or less grew up under the everpresent threat of a war of mutual nuclear annihilation.

You're right that the list of Bad Ends is much, much longer than the list of Happy Ends. But, I put it to you, this is nothing /new/. This has already been the case for multiple millenia - for the entirety of not only mere /human/ history, but for the entire span of the history of /life on Earth/ as a whole. What's changed, since early bacteria managed to avoid death in a burst of volcanic fury?

Three things, I think, have changed. The first is that some of these dangers have been mitigated. Reduced. It's now a lot harder for us to be hit by a meteor and wiped out that way - meteors can be seen, predicted, and, in extreme situations, /deflected/.

The second is that other forms of annihilation have become more likely. Ending the world in a nuclear winter is more likely now than it was ten million years ago. These two changes, to some degree, cancel each other out.

The third difference is that you (and other people, too) are now more /aware/ of these dangers. Your great-great-great-great grandfather might not have known what an AGI was, but you do. You can /see/ the danger coming; this makes it more likely that you, and others, can take steps to make it less likely. (But never impossible, no. Never, ever, ever impossible. Even as it is now, a piece of unexpected rock travelling as a sufficient fraction of the speed of light won't even be seen before it punches a hole right through the planet and out the other side.) It's not the sudden influx of danger that makes things look worse now than they used to look. No, it's the sudden influx of /awareness/.

And... then you ask what the point of humanity is. I have my theories, but that's all they are - guesses, ideas. I don't know with complete certainty.

But I do think it will be interesting to find out.
