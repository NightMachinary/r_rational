Yes, what you're referring to as a "dark age" is just the kind of cleansing fire we need to bathe in to get rid of all the filth that got us here in the first place. If omnihedonism wins before a great cleansing, that's a defeat in my book. We became who we are by wading through rivers of shit and blood, not by enjoying ourselves.
