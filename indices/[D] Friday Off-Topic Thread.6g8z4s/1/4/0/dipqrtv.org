  Humanity probably does have a long series of existential hurdles ahead. All we can do is to leap over ours, and trust in our successors to handle the next one. We haven't failed so far!

Because we have hardly /had/ a chance to fail. The Cold War of past century was the only time when the civilization's fate was serioulsy in question. I want to find hope in the fact that during it, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis][the two superpowers that hated each other, at the height of tensions and having access to WMDs, /didn't/]], I want to take that as evidence that humans could be trusted to at least some extent... but I can't help but think about it as an example of anthropic principle: I'm more likely to experience the world where the nuclear war didn't occur because there's way less viewpoints in the worlds where the nuclear war did occur.
