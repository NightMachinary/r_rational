Recently got my copy of the boardgame High frontier third edition. Its a spaceflight simulation /near future space colonisation game.

Infamous for being ridiculously complex, you have to track mass,fuel,DeltaV and orbits time while flying on [[http://i.imgur.com/Oj5XfO5.jpg][this solar system map]]. New recruits first fly base game, then you can start to add two different equally hard modules - and if that doesnt satisfy your spaceflight thirst you can end a game with all modules by changing to an interstellar map and trying your hand at colonizing other planets with your ingame built starship.

Really something for space nerds, and unfortunaltely /already/ sold out again, only a couple weeks after the kickstarter. But comes highly recommended from this space nerd.

Can be played online with the boardgame engine VASSAL, altough it takes away much of the experience.
