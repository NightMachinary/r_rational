Bonus random fanboy/girl features from the game, for example far future features that the second half of the modules gives access to:

- Using vatican transhuman eugenic pilgrims to destroy the heretics on earth via asteroid, ending the game

- crashing an asteroid into venus, terraforming it

- creating AI, with the risk of immediately killing all humans

- emancipating the robots

- building space elevators on pluto and its moon charon

- building a colony ship out of the gas giants via fusion candle

- first expansion module allows flying around with legendary Orion nuclear explosion engine [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)]]

- The game cards consist of lovely blueprints of actual existing patents/studies, like [[https://sites.google.com/site/calvinuslab/_/rsrc/1342086994710/high-frontier/high-frontier-play-by-email-game-two/HF-Game-2Bas-1-Markets.jpg?width=100%25][so]]. Game rules are 46 pages long; there are an additional 45(!) pages with technical background, design notes, and references to all the studies/patents.
