I did, and have now read the first 11 chapters--and wow, this is really very good. I'm not sure I would call it rational, but the author has got characterization /down/. There doesn't seem to be any kind of coherent plot yet, and I'm not sure if one will develop, but it works very well as a series of set pieces. Particular highlights are the outstanding monologue by Lily Potter, nailing a Dumbledore who is neither crazy nor evil, and, especially, the Sorting. Actually going through every single student is a ballsy move, but the author managed to pull it off, and that's pretty cool.
