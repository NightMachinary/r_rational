The way I see it:

  How do you force teams to advance?
#+end_quote

Like eaglejarl pointed out, armies were eager to defeat their opponents and gain points on the ranking board. In the case where an army was losing and wished to stall, I'm guessing that the winning team would just group up and methodically sweep out the entire Battle Room, launching assaults on stars that the losing team was taking cover behind.

#+begin_quote
  How are the stars distributed?
#+end_quote

One of the teachers mentioned that it the arrangement of stars was either symmetrical or random, which seems fair to me, especially given that in real combat, terrain is much more complex and less balanced.

#+begin_quote
  What's up with formations, anyway?
#+end_quote

Before Ender and his bright ideas came along, formations were considered crucial to maintain disciplined fire. Because it's actually pretty hard to aim a laser beam in zero gravity while your enemy ducks and weaves behind stars, armies tended to clump together and focus-fire on targets they wanted to assault.

Pre-arranged patterns also meant that the armies could adjust their strategies(ie. the commander makes a hand signal for switching into "attack formation", then later on signals to switch to "flanking formation") on the fly, and it also allowed the toons to coordinate and maneuver more effectively.

Finally, brute force was basically the only way they knew how to storm a star. Since orientation switching to assault enemy stars from unexpected angles didn't come around until Ender's era, the main tactic used was to get a bunch of kids together and swarm all over the target star, firing lasers in focused bursts at defenders.

  hunting down the last couple of stragglers could be an ordeal
#+end_quote

Re-read the scene where Ender receives his gun for the first time. It's mentioned that it has a flashlight, presumably to allow kids to sweep the room and clean up stragglers. Also note that stragglers that try to specialize in hunting would run into some difficulties, mainly that they would be firing laser beams leading in a straight line back to them. They'd knock out one guy and then receive a barrage of lasers in their own direction.

Although Ender DID manage to use this unexpected strategy to win a key game when he was attached to Salamander, and it's mentioned that this was a completely novel tactic to the other armies.

  What stops disabled soldiers from being total jerks and flying around blocking shots with their arms and legs kept up in front of their body
#+end_quote

Since arms and legs are used for pushing off walls for maneuvers and movement, they would essentially becoming floating stars that occasionally fired off lasers in random directions. Ender used a modified version of this(freezing their knees tucked in front of their chests as a shield) to some success.

#+begin_quote
  why not just grab a frozen soldier and use him as a shield?
#+end_quote

This was a legitimate tactic and pushing off or shielding behind frozen soldiers from either team was done quite often, even before Ender's days.

#+begin_quote
  What kind of strategies would need to be dealt with
#+end_quote

Frankly, I think that "the enemy's gate is down" is actually a shit way of explaining zero-g orientation. A better line would be "the enemy's gate is wherever you want it to be". Once the kids get used to the idea that there is no such thing as down and that they are basically free floating, ideas like pincer tactics(enemies from two/three sides falling down on you with frozen knee-shields and firing madly between their legs) and angle-switching on stars("slingshotting" around stars to come at the enemy from a different angle, which is what Bean tried using although he resorted to a trick with string) to attack from unexpected angles would become quite common.

I also thought of a cool trick with kids who could wrap their arms and legs around a star, curl up to minimize their target size then freeze their arms and legs so that the star/frozen limbs block the enemy's line of fire. This basically allows them to peep out behind their shield, slip their gun barrels through a crack in their knees and act as sentry turrets or stationary gattling-guns. Ender's idea with the frozen knee-shields was good but they could be attacked from behind by wall-sliders, this way the star blocks their back so they're covered in all directions. The only way to take them out would be to score a miraculous hit on their eyes while they leisurely targeted you and took you out.
