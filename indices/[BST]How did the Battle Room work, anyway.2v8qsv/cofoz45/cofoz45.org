  How do you force teams to advance?
#+end_quote

Winning battles got you points on the Battle School ('School') leader board. Highest ranked people on the leader board got the command positions that everyone wanted. At the game level it might not make sense to attack but at the metagame level it was essential.

  How are the stars distributed? Symmetric sounds like it would lead to more stalling, but asymmetric has fairness issues.
#+end_quote

It's training for real warfare, so School doesn't care if it's unfair. In the game they sometimes appeared to allocate things randomly and other times they allocated them very precisely to screw with Ender.

  What's up with formations, anyway? [...T]hat should be very dependent on the distribution of stars, so [...] their practices will have to be about learning to quickly recognize the salient features of different kinds of star distributions and how to react optimally, not just set formations. [...] Or why not just grab a frozen soldier and use him as a shield?
#+end_quote

Training to recognize situations and adapt to them quickly is exactly what School wants.

As to how formations were used in the book: at least once, Ender had his people grab on and freeze parts of themselves so they were locked together into a big tortoise; the people on the outside had their guns pointed out if anyone got in front of them, the people on the inside were protected by the bodies on the outside.

Grabbing a frozen soldier and using him as a shield was something that Ender did -- he froze one of his soldiers bent over, had an unfrozen soldier get inside the resulting 'spaceship' and threw both of them into the room where they could shoot the enemies gathered around Ender's gate.

#+begin_quote
  If the entire enemy team has to be frozen or disabled [...s]ome kids might specialize in become hunters who slowly pick away at the enemy after the battle is essentially over, saving their team from defeat. Is that a problem? How would armies or the rules adjust to deal with that?
#+end_quote

Not a problem, no. It's training for real combat. The rules wouldn't be changed; the armies would have to adapt and use scouting / patrol methods to locate and destroy the +insurgents+ surviving snipers.

#+begin_quote
  What stops disabled soldiers from being total jerks and flying around blocking shots with their arms and legs kept up in front of their body so as not to be frozen completely?
#+end_quote

Nothing. That was a standard tactic; it was what "the enemy's gate is down" was all about -- you go feet- or knees-first to present minimal profile and to block shots from hitting your torso.

#+begin_quote
  Why did the movie have to suck so bad?
#+end_quote

They crammed in all the most awesome, most seminal bits so the pacing was too fast. They should either have made it be two movies, or they should have chopped off everything after Ender won the big battle and used the gained time to fix the pacing in the first half.
