Except that many people seem to use it with no intention of starting an actual conversation. And you can't even say that that is due to intentional deception because often not only do both parties know that the one saying "how are you?" doesn't want to start a conversation, they also /know/ that they both know and then exchange 1+ more lines (sometimes not even that) before continuing on their way.

Or at least where I'm from it often goes:

#+begin_example
  1:"Hi"
  2:"Hi. How are you?"
  1:"Fine, you?"
  2:*Nods and smiles*
  ~The End
#+end_example
