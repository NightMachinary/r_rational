I don't think they'd consider that odd for expecting "fine", I think they'd consider that odd because they can't do anything with it, it's probably irrelevant to them, and your intentions are opaque. If you can find an example of a situation where it would be weird if you divulged something real to someone who could actually do something for you with it(who recognized that you knew they could, where the cost of doing it would not be prohibitive), I'd be kind of suprised.
