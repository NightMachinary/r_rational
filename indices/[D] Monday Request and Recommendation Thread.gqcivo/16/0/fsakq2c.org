De-rec for this one. The MC is a straight up Mary Sue, with all the problems that brings: unfounded superiority in cultivation, friendly immortals around who are extremely impressed with her wisdom, inconsistent characterisation and behaviour of surrounding characters, hypocrisy, idiot balls for the whole world except the MC and so on and so forth.

The worst part is that from a language perspective it is actually pretty decent and has a relatively slow start plot-wise, so you don't notice these issues immediately. And by the time it gets worse and worse, you have already invested some time into it and the sunk cost fallacy strikes.
