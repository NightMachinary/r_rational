I'm now following it. Horror's not really my thing, but it's well-written enough that I'm enjoying it, mostly in spite of the genre. I don't suppose you've written anything else in a different genre?

Also, your signature on SB has the following:

#+begin_quote
  Nowhere Land (Jumpchain/Multicross Horror)

  Jumps made: The Old Kingdom, Shadows of the Limelight, El Goonish Shive, Universal Paperclips, City of Angles, You Have To Burn The Rope, Achron.

Is this referring to another story, or a hint?
