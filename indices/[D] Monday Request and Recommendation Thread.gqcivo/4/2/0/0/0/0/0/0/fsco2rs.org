I'm really loving Nowhere Land, but the Johnny Bravo Mirror doesn't seem particularly memetic. I mean, it's mind-affecting, but not all mind-affecting things are memetic, and it's specifically holding the handle, not seeing the mirror or hearing about it that triggers the effect. The effect's "delivery method" seems to have little to do with information transfer, perception, or understanding.
