I could have elaborated on that a little more, looking back. The effect is haptic, that is to say, it's based on the sensory feeling of hand-on-handle, and the information conveyed through that avenue about what exactly was in your hand. (For example, running your hand across a plank of wood while blindfolded would tell you that you're touching wood, whether it had been sanded down or not, and possibly the direction of the grain as well.) If you had nerve damage and couldn't feel the handle at all, you would be fine. Hopefully that parses better.

(edit: there's an argument to be made about why it /stops/ working when you let go of the handle, since you'd still remember, and to that in turn I'd say that knowledge of the handle's feel is only dangerous in tandem with the actual sensation of holding the handle, which raises the question of why they didn't go to their Sensory Hazards department for help, the answer to which is that there isn't one, because most sensory hazards are already memetic or cognitohazardous anyway, and so any such hazards fall on those departments.)
