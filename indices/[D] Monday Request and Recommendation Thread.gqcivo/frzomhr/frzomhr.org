I recently found a 4-panel webcomic called 1/0, a brilliant little piece of metafiction. In short, it's an exploration of religion, philosophy and science through the lens of self-aware characters in a universe lacking a fourth wall.

It's 1000 strips long, and I read it over a couple of days. Well worth the read.

Pinging [[/u/BoxSparrow][u/BoxSparrow]], who asked for stories that explore meta concepts, rather than writing a separate reply.
