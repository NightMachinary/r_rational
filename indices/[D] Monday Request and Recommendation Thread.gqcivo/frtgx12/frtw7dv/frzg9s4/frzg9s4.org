Thanks for the detailed breakdown!

I think some of the summary issues are due to the limitations of fanfiction.net (where I use the same summary), which incentivises using phrasing that is familiar to the fandom-specific community there. That said, the summary for this story is something I've struggled with a fair bit in the past.

I'm trying to hit three key notes - firstly, I want to indicate that a focus of the story will be the characterisation and development of the four members of Team Seven, who have somewhat different personalities to canon. Secondly, there's an overarching plot that doesn't necessarily match the canon plot directly, rather than this being a slice-of-life ramble. And thirdly, the story spends a lot of time on combat/combat-preparation aspects of ninja life.

With regards to the hook, I think some (definitely not all) people find the first line intriguing enough to get them to start reading. However, this clearly didn't do that for you. Do you have any suggestions for a stronger hook?

I'm happy to hear that the first scene had a strong hook - I've rewritten that chapter a few times and I struggled a lot with making the opening engaging.
