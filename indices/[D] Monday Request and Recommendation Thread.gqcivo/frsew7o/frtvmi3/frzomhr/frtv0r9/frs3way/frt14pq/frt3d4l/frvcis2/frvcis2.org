I've been a bit disillusioned about reading 1-2 month old fictions on RR, got tired of following things that turn bad after a while and make it hard for me to drop it because of sunk cost.

​

But I've been loving Villainess, it's really fun in a turn off my brain while I eat dinner show. Although the joke is starting to get old, which seems to be a plus for the anime with only 12 episodes and a negative for the novel.

​

The format is quite good and has potential, but the author decided to make it a harem, with an oblivious MC, when it would have been more interesting and fun without that trope. Somebody could become really popular by making several good short 80k word stories following a similar format, without competing with all these 1kk word epics we see in webfiction.
