HxH's magic system is basically whatever the author wants. The powers that people have stays somewhat constant, but there is little consistency in the overarching magic system. You can hardly predict how the fights will unroll. The world also seems not in equilibrium with the existence of the magic. It's a great anime, but not really rational or rational-adjacent. It's not as shitty as SAO, but that's a low bar.
