[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28062/empire-of-salt][Empire of Salt]] was good enough for me to binge-read, although admittedly kind of fluffy (antagonists tend to carry the idiot ball whereas MC rarely makes any mistakes). Cultivation Isekai more about crafting and trade. MC follows no-killing code and generally helps people. Does not actually revolve around salt (the fic took a different direction than the author intended when they picked the title).
