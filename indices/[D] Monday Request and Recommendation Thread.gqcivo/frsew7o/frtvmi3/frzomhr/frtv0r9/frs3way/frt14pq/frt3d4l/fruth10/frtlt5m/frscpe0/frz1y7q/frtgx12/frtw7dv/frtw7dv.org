What is the "a strong Team Seven AU" in the summary supposed to tell a prospective reader? Team 7 was pretty strong in canon already. Kakashi was not an alcoholic in canon, so that makes is AU, I guess. OK.

This summary makes it sound like this is a generic edgier Naruto rewrite with more OP protagonists.

You need a hook here. "Sasuke is confused" is not one; definitely not, if you mention it in the middle of other changes.

The first scene /does/ provide one, but it really should be in the summary, if you want to catch prospective readers' attention.
