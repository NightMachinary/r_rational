Royal Road's trending fictions has some pretty good ones this week:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31919/muds-mission][Mud's Mission]]: Super good LitRPG with a non-human protagonist, who's characterized as a partially-bounded optimizer. Probably deserves a top level post.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31468/the-cosmic-interloper][Cosmic Interloper]]: A little bit like a crossover between Altered Carbon and a Sanderson novel; for the older fantasy aficionados here, it's kind of like an updated version of [[http://www.watt-evans.com/thecyborgandthesorcerers.shtml][The Cyborg and the Sorcerors]]. The basic premise is that an augmented human gets isekai'd into a magical world, and shenanigans ensue.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31129/fantasy-world-epsilon-30-10][Fantasy World Epsilon 30-10]]: The main character is very similar to Jason Asano from He Who Fights With Monsters, except instead of getting isekai'd on accident he's doing it on purpose. It's mostly about a semi-modern society as represented by a single MC gently storming through a classic medieval fantasy environment. Does contain a couple of explicit parts.

And something that's fun and totally not rational (though it hits a lot of the tropes and themes people here seem to like):

- [[https://www.crunchyroll.com/my-next-life-as-a-villainess-all-routes-lead-to-doom][My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!]]: the title is very descriptive. It's like if Kaleidoscope was set in a light dating game. The main character uses her knowledge of the game's plot to try and save herself from inevitable doom, like your average rational isekaier - without ever reassessing the current state of things, namely that she's already changed the lives of every character to the point where they're unlikely to want to, you know, kill her. She's also incredibly dense and kinda dumb, but in a lovable golden retriever way.
