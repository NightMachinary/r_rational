Nothing with that word count, sadly.

Hero Class Civil Warfare is up there, but it's more of a heist movie than a rational narrative. Midoriya is assigned the role of Kingpin in a hero class joint exercise and puts everyone through an ordeal that makes canon feel like a giant missed opportunity.

You could try One Yen Hero, but it's not super long just yet. Midoriya has a power from Mistborn that forces him to manage resources. Sidesteps canon somewhat by sticking him in class 1-B.
