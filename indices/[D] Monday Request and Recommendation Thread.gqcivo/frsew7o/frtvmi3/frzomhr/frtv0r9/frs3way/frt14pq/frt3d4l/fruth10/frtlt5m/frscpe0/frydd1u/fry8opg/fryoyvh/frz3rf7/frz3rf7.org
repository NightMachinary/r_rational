Multiple stings can kind of cause an allergy by exacerbating a previously unnoticed allergy. Allergic responses get worse with repeated immune system activation through a process called sensitization. If you ask people with severe allergies they will often tell you that the first time wasn't too bad but they got worse. 1st time hives and rashes, 2nd added difficulty swallowing, 3rd hard to breath for example.

I don't recall Hunter x Hunters usage of bee allergies though.
