In that case, you might like

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16037609/chapters/37435250][Subject, a Comprehensive Report]]: Izuku pursues a career as an analyst early and ends up interning with Night Eye, unfortunately being drawn into the mystery of All for One. Unfinished and not updated since Nov, but I remember it being fairly solid.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14666679/chapters/33883275][Pro Hero Metal Bat]]: I have a soft spot for this one. It avoids most of the problems that crossover or pseudo-crossovers with One Punch Man tend to get into, even if it seems to hit several of the common “Quirkless Hero” ones head-on. Updates verrrrrry slowly. Most shonen-typical of this list.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11808918/chapters/26640231][Conversations With A Cryptid]]: I remember this being interesting. Has an unfinished sequel, but I didn't really like it as much & I think the first is okay on its own.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16340741/chapters/38231207][A Study In Firsts]]: I...uh...lost track of this one a while ago and remembered it for this rec, so who knows what the most recent chapters are like. But I remember the first bit being a good and cute exploration of the implications of “quirks are biological abilities” on teen awkwardness. Thankfully not a sex thing.

Most of the rest I've read are low-tier knockoffs of canon, boring assemblages of harems/excessive feel-good tropes/the same stale fanon or ideas, well written but explicitly shippy, disgusting sex garbage, or dross. Though I'm sure I've forgotten or missed at least twice this number of genuinely good things, especially since I've made no move to go check my SB/SV history.

You can get a bit more mileage if you lower your standards for shipping, cleverness, originality, or excessive self-pleasuring via overwrought superpower harems or grimdark genre-shift revenge edgelords. There are some redeemable fics with just a little bit too much of some of those. But it's not worth it unless you really like MHA.
