That makes sense. It stated that all people can develop allergies after being stung multiple times (which is untrue).

Though funnily enough, allergies are often treated by exposure to very small amounts of the allergen over time, so the same tolerance building can work in people with allergies, it's just exposure over a certain amount causes the opposite effect.
