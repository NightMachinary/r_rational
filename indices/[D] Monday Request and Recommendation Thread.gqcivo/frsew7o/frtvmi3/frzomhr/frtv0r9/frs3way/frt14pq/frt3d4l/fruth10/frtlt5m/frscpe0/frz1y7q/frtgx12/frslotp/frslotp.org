Two things: I've been reading all the stories on [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/][*Ascent Universe*]] and throughly enjoying them. There's a main story arc which I could describe as a rationalist reimagining on Battlefield Earth by L Ron Hubbard (evil occupying aliens, resistance to fight them but all is now what it seems!) and a bunch of out-there stories set in the same world.

  All the worlds that were will always have been,

  All the worlds within call to be made real,

  All the worlds without await us,

  The fires of the soul are great and burn with the same light as the stars.

The other, the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][*foundation antimemetics series*]], a Cosmic horror which really seems to fit with our [[https://www.reddit.com/r/qntm/comments/gp7nca/we_were_all_adam_wheeler/][current crisis.]]

It's really a story about a melding of both horrifyingly outside-context X-risk and horrifyingly incomprehensible human evil - two things that don't go together in real life.

The reason 3125 is worse than real life viruses or real life evil antihuman ideologies is because it combines the relentless, undying inhuman aspect of viruses and other threats with the active evil and malice and desire to inflict suffering as an end goal, valuable in itself, of Fasicsm. So really it is a bit of both.

  Moreno staggers, vertigo swelling up and briefly getting the better of her. "Hundreds of millions of people died and we just forgot? Is that what you wanted to show me? You want me to write that down?"

  "Yes," Wheeler says. "Yes. Write this down. It's the first thing you're learning today. Humans can forget anything. It's okay to forget some things, because we are mortal and finite. But some things we have to remember. It's important that we remember. Write to yourself something which will make you remember."
