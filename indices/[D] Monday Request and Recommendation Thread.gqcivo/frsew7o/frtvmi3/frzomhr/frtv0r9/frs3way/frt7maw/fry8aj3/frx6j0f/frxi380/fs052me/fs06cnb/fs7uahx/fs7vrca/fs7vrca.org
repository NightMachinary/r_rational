That is...a mistake, actually! Jumpchain docs all use a d8 for legacy reasons, but it should be one d8 used to simulate a coin flip for the first seven options vs the last seven options, and the other d8 used to pick the exact domain, with a roll of 8 on that die being free choice. That must have slipped my mind. It's a couple years too late to edit the post, but when I'm off work I can make a new pdf to that effect.
