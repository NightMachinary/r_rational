If self-promotions are allowed in this thread, then I'd like to offer a Naruto fanfiction I'm currently actively updating - I've just hit 40k words and I have another update queued to go. It's intended to be rational but I'm not sure how accurately I'm hitting the mark. Regardless, I feel that this sub might enjoy it anyway.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7722541/chapters/17600416][Spire]] is a story that originally started as a subversion of time travel fanfiction, where I wanted to put the focus on the characters that didn't have future knowledge, so the reader would simply see changes rippling out and not know who was causing them. It's in a somewhat similar vein to /Team 7's Ascension/ or /Shinobi: Team 7/ in terms of its approach to canon, and the general 'feel' of the world, although it's less violent and dark.

  Naruto's hopeful, Sasuke's confused, Kakashi's an alcoholic, and Sakura really doesn't want to die. This wasn't what they'd expected from Ninja life, but as Konoha's enemies gather, there's no time for regrets. A strong Team Seven AU.

I'd love any feedback, especially constructive criticism or what people felt didn't work well/was a turnoff.
