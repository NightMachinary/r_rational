I haven't written anything else in another genre, as of yet. I've got a couple in mind, but they wouldn't be until after this one's done.

That part of my signature is in reference to the broader Jumpchain community. A while back (a couple years, by now), I made a few jump-docs, which are what you use to pick what powers you get and so on. Those are just the stories/universes I made them for. I've stopped making them at this point, but I leave that info there in case someone has a question for me.
