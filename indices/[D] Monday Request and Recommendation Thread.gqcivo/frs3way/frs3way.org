[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/][Nowhere Land]] is a "horror" jumpchain where a junior member of an anti memetic threat organization finds himself at the mercy of an alien system that shunts him from world to world, it's unguessable goals further obscured by it's clearly broken state.

While the protagonist travels through worlds of preexisting works (first pokemon then madoka magica) the story is for the most part about the mysteries that the author is setting up about what exactly is happening to the protagonist. While it's too early to know for sure whether there are satisfying answers to those mysteries, I really like what has been set up.

If you enjoy strong mysteries, the protagonist/POV character having his mental state screwed with, and a dollop of lovecraftian horror, check this out! Just be aware that the first jump is a bit slower, to set up the characters, still very good, but once the second jump hits things pick up.
