(I have not read the LN)

FWIW we really enjoyed the anime. The same way that March Comes In Like a Lion is a really well done character study, Durarara felt to me like a really well made study of a city precinct, by someone who really loves the place.

It starts pretty much as it means to go on; each episode answers a bunch of questions the previous one left open, while leaving new hooks unclear; if you're not enjoying it by end of ep2 you probably wouldn't want to carry on.
