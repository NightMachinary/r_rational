This is not related to the rational content in the slightest, but I tend to /really/ enjoy recommendations on this sub, so our opinions must more or less align.

I kinda want to watch /Durarara!!/, but I don't know if it's any good (the reviews tend to be mixed), and with my enormous backlog of other stuff, I'm too afraid to commit to something I might strongly dislike. Those who have seen this anime, what is your opinion on it? (Bonus question: if you've also read the LN, is it a faithful adaptation?)
