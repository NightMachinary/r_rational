It's been a while since I watched it, but I'd enjoyed it in its entirety, and had considered it one of the best anime I've seen. Long but well-paced and lacking in filler, with interesting characters and a plot that is neither clich√©d nor stupid. It's possible that if I rewatched it now, my opinion would change, but I wouldn't expect the change to be major.

Haven't read the LN.
