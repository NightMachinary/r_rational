Sure, I can post them afterwards. I'll post a few here, since you asked:

Smelling a thunderstorm. This is true. The build-up of energy in the formation of a thunderstorm causes the production of nitric oxide. This in turn, breaks down Oxygen (O2) into singular Oxygen (O) atoms. The O atoms combine with O2 molecules to become Ozone (O3). Some of the Ozone is pushed down to Earth level by downdrafts.

Multiple bee stings causing an allergy. False. Bee allergies are largely genetic. If you get stung multiple times, you'd build a resistance rather than develop an allergy (beekeepers will usually get stung on purpose in order to develop this). It is possible to develop an allergy to something, though the science behind it is unknown (theories are either down to increased hygiene causing immune system issues or nutritional deficiencies).

Chopping the back of someone's neck to knock them out. Ineffective. You knock someone out either by choking them out (accomplished in martial arts by hitting or grappling the front of their neck, or striking inbetween their shoulderblades) or by scrambling their brain (by punching their head hard). Even then, knock outs tend to only last seconds, up to a couple of minutes. Longer, and you've done some possibly permanent damage.
