I've been having fun with Hunter X Hunter rewatch. Whenever something science-related comes up, I've been researching to ascertain accuracy. So far... spotty! But hardly a problem given its good character writing, consistent magic system, subversive genre trends and general emphasis on brain vs brawn.
