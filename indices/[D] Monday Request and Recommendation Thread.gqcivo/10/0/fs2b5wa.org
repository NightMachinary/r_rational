I've been actively picking out the best bits of MHA writing on AO3 for over a year, and I have to say that MHA does not lend itself well to any sort of rational deconstruction, even when people make it more realistic and complicated in clever ways.

I think this is mostly because the premise that “everyone has superpowers” is incompatible with a setting where “society strongly resembles modernity”. Also because powers that are strong enough to be truly threatening and interesting are too dangerous for the integrity of the setting when used in a clever way.

Shigaraki and Kurogiri alone are a combo that could do untold damage to infrastructure. Guys like Overhaul just...do exist. Think about the absurd terrorism potential of Yaoyorozu's ability for like, one second. This is barely taking into account the incredibly dangerous Quirk combos that definitely do statistically exist amongst the population. But even if dangerous, immoral, motivated people could wreak havoc with their quirks, they won't, because the implications of their abilities mean that either society would not exist in its canon form or that there needs to be a special in-universe justification. And eventually those justifications would start stacking up into something that is clearly ludicrous and would deprive a ratfic of its spooky rational power.
