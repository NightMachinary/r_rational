This has pretty much been my experience. Even my opinion of From Muddy Waters has been lowered after realizing "traumatized Midoriya with a secret quirk retreads canon" is as common as "Dark but not evil Harry" used to be for Harry Potter.

There's very little originality and the character/reader fics have somehow managed to get a serious foothold, eating into the surrounding discussion of fanworks.

I feel like some of the problems will go away on their own as the story reaches some kind of end point, the way Naruto did when it hit the timeskip, but maybe that's wishful thinking.
