The real question is, where do /HPMoR///Friendship is Magic/ crossovers go on the chart? Level 2 by one parent, level 1 by the other.

It's an /HP/ fanfanfic, so it's a fanfanfic. Yet it's not a /FiM/ fanfanfic. Interesting that something can be /FiM/ and fan^{2}fic, but not fan^{2}fic /of/ FiM. That seems like an important distinction for any classification scheme to make.

Hm. Talking about this - fanfics from the database engineering perspective - has made me picture a hierarchy of stories sorted by their mutual canon status. On top of fanfics and crossovers, some books appear /as books/ in the background of films, other times characters from other stories will get walk-on parts that imply a shared universe. The potential has been noted for transfictional loops where the book of a story should appear in that story's universe, and several such loops have been found. Perhaps I'll automate that one day when I'm looking for a project.
