There's a character in Homestuck who writes self-insert Homestuck fanfic, not to mention how Homestuck includes the author himself as a character. And most if not all major plot threads are part of one or more closed causal time loops.

Regular every-day recursion doesn't even compare to that kind of direct self-reference.
