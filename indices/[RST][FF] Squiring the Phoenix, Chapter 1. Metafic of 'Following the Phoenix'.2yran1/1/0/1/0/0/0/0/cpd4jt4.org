Precisely. Fiction is the base case, fanfiction is the first layer of recursion, fanfanfic is the second, etc.

If you count fiction as the first layer, then meta^{3}fanfic is the fifth, which is worse.

The point is that "fan^{n}fiction of fan^{m}fiction is fan^{n+m}fiction" holds for all positive integers n and m. This is a simple and obvious rule, and clearly it is the way things should be.
