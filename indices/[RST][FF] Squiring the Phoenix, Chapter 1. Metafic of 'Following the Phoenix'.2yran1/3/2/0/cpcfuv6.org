Every option related to subscriptions is set to 'yes' and my normal user (an admin) has the 'subscribe' link, so I hadn't realized it wasn't normally there.

Like I said, everything that I can find is set to 'allow subscriptions' but it's obviously not working. I've got a trouble ticket in to Forumatic to find out what's going on. Once I get it straightened out there will be a small link at bottom right that says "subscribe forum" It is annoyingly non-obvious; I found it using Cmd+F "subscribe"
