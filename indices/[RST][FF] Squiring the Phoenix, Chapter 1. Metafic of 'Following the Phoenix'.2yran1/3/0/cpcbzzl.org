Here's my original [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2s69a3/following_the_phoenix_final_chapter_the_man_who/cnnn432][challenge]] and my response message acknowledging my pay-up:

Wow! Thanks for that story, but if you look more carefully at my comment, you would see that I set the delivery date at 4/13/2015, or a month from now in April. I'm not complaining about you being early though and I'll pay you the two months of Reddit Gold on the 14th or 15th.

Thanks!

PS I also posted a link to 'Squiring the Phoenix' on [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]].
