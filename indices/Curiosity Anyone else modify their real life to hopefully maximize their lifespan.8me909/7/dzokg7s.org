I think I need to make it to 2060 to have a better-than-break-even shot at immortality being developed, so I've cut down on eating, exercised more, and tried to reduce the unnecessary risks I take. (I still need to work on wearing my helmet while bicycling though.) With the life expectancy in my country, I have quite a bit of leeway regardless, but since immortality is extremely unlikely to be cheap, especially at first, I'm going to need to as much leeway as possible.
