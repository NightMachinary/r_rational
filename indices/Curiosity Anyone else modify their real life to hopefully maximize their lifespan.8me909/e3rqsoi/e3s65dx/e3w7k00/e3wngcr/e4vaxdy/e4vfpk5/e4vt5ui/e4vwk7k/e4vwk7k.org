On Reddit - you have to look past the popular communities to the things that interest you, or will improve your life. And to the communities you feel you can provide something useful in. The subreddit for keto taught me an enormous amount about how to learn about nutrition, even though I had to leave keto after a bit. The running subreddit taught me how to run and pointed me at resources that let me complete a marathon; when I started I hadn't run in two decades and couldn't finish more than a couple miles without walking. The ask historians subreddit has taught me tons both about history and about how historians look at the past; the subreddit for my local areas has been fun and informative on local events, and the subreddits for places I go on vacation help give you a feel for what's good and bad, what the locals are interested in.

There's a lot to learn. :) You just have to get past the default subs!
