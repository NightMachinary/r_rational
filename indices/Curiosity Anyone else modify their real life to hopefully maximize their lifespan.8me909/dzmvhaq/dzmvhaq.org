Running 2-3 miles 3-4 times a week, eating red meat very rarely, focus on cooking meals at home rather than eating out, drinking fat-free milk, avoid overly processed food (sweet pastry rather than candy or whole wheat bread over white bread), and regularly sleeping 8 hours each night at the same time. Basically eat well and fresh, regular exercise that involve cardio, and stable sleeping habits.
