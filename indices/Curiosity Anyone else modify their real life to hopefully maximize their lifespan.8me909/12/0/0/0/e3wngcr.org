Oddly enough, I disagree. I've learned a /lot/ from Reddit. How else do people ever learn, than from communicating with other folks? And reddit can put you in a receptive frame of mind, sneak up and smack you with an empathy hammer.

There's a lot of clever, witty, well-spoken folks on here hidden in with the lols. It's easy to underestimate, when you see endless resposts and arguments and stupidity, but depending on the sub, there's a lot of real humanity here too.
