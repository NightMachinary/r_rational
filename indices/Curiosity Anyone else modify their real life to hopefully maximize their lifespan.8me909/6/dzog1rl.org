Instead of shooting for longevity, I shoot for quality. Satisfaction with my life, enjoying what I do, etcetera. Life does not have meaning unless you give it meaning, thus I seek to live a meaningful life. I seek to maximize both near and long term happiness, as well as satisfaction and contentment. Having a healthy body is useful in that regard, but a long life is just a byproduct of that.
