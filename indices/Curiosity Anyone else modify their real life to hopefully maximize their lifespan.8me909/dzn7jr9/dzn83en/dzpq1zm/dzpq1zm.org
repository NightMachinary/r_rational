Yup. And if I'm capable of killing myself now, then I'm capable of killing myself later. It isn't as though not committing suicide is a choice that I can't later undo, so if I can wait, why not wait?

(Though, if I had access to some painless, sure-fire suicide method that would only be accessible to me once, I might kill myself even if I wasn't in a suicidal mood. I'd be tempted, at least.)
