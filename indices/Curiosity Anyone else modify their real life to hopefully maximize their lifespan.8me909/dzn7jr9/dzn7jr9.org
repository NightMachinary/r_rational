I...sort of try to not think about that. I'm mostly just killing time till time kills me, and to the extent that I'm trying to live healthily, it's so that my body functions and feels well /now/.

I guess I'm still a little suicidal. I'm not at the point anymore where I'm actively wanting to die /immediately/, but, like, I got rather sick recently, and it was possible that what I had was going to be very bad, and my main concern was just that I not die in a way that inconvenienced other people, rather than that I, you know, not die at all.

Part of me wants to live long enough to accomplish everything on my to-do list, but another part of me wonders why I should care that much about leaving anything unfinished on that list, because when I'm dead I won't be around to feel bad about it, so...
