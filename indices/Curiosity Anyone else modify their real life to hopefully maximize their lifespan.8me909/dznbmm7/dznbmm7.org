Already eat fairly healthy and exercise regularly so when I made life changes I didn't have much low hanging fruit. I vowed to never skydive again and to never get a motorcycle, no texting and driving, and to generally be more careful in all things. Obviously that could easily go off the deep end with me ending up in a padded room afraid of my own shadow lol... So I try to find a good balance of living life while also treating it like I'm only 30 years into 1,000 or more.
