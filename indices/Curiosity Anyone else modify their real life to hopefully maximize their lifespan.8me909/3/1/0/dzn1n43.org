Both. Cooking at home tends to be cheaper, and if you are willing to put the time into cooking, it can be better nutrition-wise. But if you are just buying frozen meals or similar low effort meals, then it would be worse nutrition-wise. I minimize the amount of time spent on cooking by making a huge pot of food on the weekends and eat the leftovers for dinner throughout the week. [[https://Delish.com][Delish.com]] has a lot of great easy recipes, and I would advise buying a slow-cooker. Most slow-cooker recipes take less then 15 minutes to chop the ingredients, throw them in the pot, and then all you need to do is wait a few hours for everything to cook.

My parents rarely gave me and my siblings red meat to eat growing up (mostly chicken instead), so we ended up continuing the trend since red meat now tastes a little too rich for our tastes.
