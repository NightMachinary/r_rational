More like sleeping at least 8 hours a night with consistent bedtimes results in simply having more energy for the day. It won't ruin your health, but your quality of life improves if you are well-rested and it's easier to be healthy if you have the energy to exercise. Don't exercise when you are tired by the way. It sucks.
