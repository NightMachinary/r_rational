Also, limit or eliminate consumption of alcohol (one serving a day /might/ be healthy, but more than that definitively negates any positive effects), keep away from inhaling anything superheated (especially tobacco smoke), eat lots of vegetables, and prioritize calories from proteins/fats over those from starches. For sleep hygiene, try to avoid blue or white light in the evenings, and use your bed for only one thing: sleeping (two things if you have a significant other). I would underline sleep as quite possibly the most important thing on the list. If you're not sleeping well, you won't have the energy to do any of the rest of it.
