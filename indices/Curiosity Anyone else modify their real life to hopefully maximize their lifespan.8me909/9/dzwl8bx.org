I don't go to the extreme of being too paranoid about it also because I tend to be hypochondriac, so if I start focusing too much on my health I'll actually /lose/ quality of life to panic attacks and the like. But Mediterranean diet comes pretty natural to me (due to being Italian and stuff), I'm a vegetarian both for health, environmental and ethical reasons, I don't smoke, I drink very little alcohol, I don't drive (again, multiple reasons: environmental but also I'm such a shitty driver I feared it would shorten my lifespan and those of people around me) so I walk quite a lot.

You will never actually get me to do regular boring old exercise, that's too much. If I had easy access to a competitive activity I can be at least decent at and to friends who are fun and easygoing about playing it I'd probably do much more of that. I did a bit of fencing, I did bouldering once and liked it a lot, I used to like volleyball when I was in school. But most of the time the surrounding stuff (reach some far off field, change, shower, deal with people taking the thing too fucking seriously) just turns me off from what otherwise would be a fun activity.
