Yes!!

- I stay away from most isolated supplements, but I take collagen and krill oil daily + herbs in tablet form.

- I filter my water with activated charcoal when it's practical.

- For exercise I stretch and dance, it's super lovely. I just make sure to sweat regularly, it's one of the best detoxing methods. The best is healthy digestion.

- I'm aiming for a Mediterranean diet but it's not going its best in this area at the moment.

- I research every product I use and avoid most unhealthy chemicals when a better option is available. (I'm not a fanatic)

- I take well care of my environment. I air my home out often, and clean every week. I also make it pretty and take the psychological effects of my surroundings seriously. That we're capable of having our bodies altered for instance by experiencing emotions during social or private experiences is a giant clue for me that atmosphere affects health.

- I walk barefeet outdoors or go to the beach for grounding.
