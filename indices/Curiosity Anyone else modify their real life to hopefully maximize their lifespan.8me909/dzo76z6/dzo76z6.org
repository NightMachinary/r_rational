I don't really see much point in consciously maximising my lifespan.I will just take what I get and do what's on my to do list,doesn't matter if I complete it or not and wait for time to kill me.Even than my diet is already quite healthy with only having 1 or 2 meat dishes a day and don't see much point in changing it.
