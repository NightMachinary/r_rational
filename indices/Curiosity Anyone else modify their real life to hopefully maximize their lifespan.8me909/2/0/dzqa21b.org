But if you could arrange yourself to be born later in history, then why would you be born /now/? Shouldn't you have made yourself be born into a post-Singularity, utopian society?

Choosing to be born now when we are in the middle of accelerating scientific discovery seems to imply to me that we are about to encounter an apocalyptic disaster that ends civilization or severely damages it.
