When I heard that /Mother of Learning/ had finished, I used audiobook to catch up (and then switched to the regular eyeball reading to finish), and now I can't un-hear the dialects you provided the various characters with.

Given that that tropical continent with Damien's fianc√© appears to be heavily modelled after India, I can't shake the idea that you will give the characters there a similarly coloured accent, but then I thought how funny it would be if instead they sounded more Australian (because everything on that continent looked as if it was trying to kill them)...

Anyway, I enjoy your work. Gotta listen to that Dragon book at some point.
