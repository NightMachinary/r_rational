I remember listening to the first four chapters a while back. What ultimately turned me off, in addition to a few other things, was how not understandable Xvim's voice was. I remember it being a almost like a really bad Chinese stereotype, meanwhile he wasn't anything like that all in the actual novel. Just a really intelligent and firm man.

...was that ever fixed?
