I understand that most people don't really notice these things, and that's fine. But after it's brought to your attention you still honestly think it's realistic for peasants to incessantly interrupt a member of the /high-nobility/ whom they just met, as in my reply? And that was not an isolated example. Everyone interrupts the protagonist at all times, whether in battle or in a normal, relaxed conversation. Despite the guy looking like a bad-ass, dangerous warrior with a high, high ranking.

I probably haven't been interrupted 100 times in the past 5 years and this book that takes place during less than a week has 200 interruptions! I just can't reconcile that with realism, sorry, or anything but trash-tier dialogue writing.
