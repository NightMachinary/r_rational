  The Good Guys series by Eric Ugland

As a rebuttal I'll refer to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/litrpg/comments/c9v9po/review_home_seige_home_good_guys_book_6/et55vwl/?context=3][this comment chain]], where I note the author's gross overuse of dialogue interruptions. He starts at 78 in book one and gets up to 202 in book 4! Disgusting.
