If you want fanfiction and there is no fandom to generate it, the obvious solution is to orchestrate this fandom's creation.

Find other talented people who enjoyed /Lightbringer/ and would like to see fanfictions of it (and/or find talented people who would enjoy /Lightbringer/, make them read it, then stoke the flames of their desire). Get them on-board. Write a few high-quality fanfictions, publish them strategically to increase public interest. Simultaneously, raise the book series' popularity on social media via novel memes centred around it. Infer the properties which make ideas viral, and exploit them. Become good at social engineering, or recruit those who are already good at it. Create a bunch of sockpuppets, use them to softly or bluntly pressure people into writing more. Is there a good wikia about the series? Write it to make it easier for your newly-created fan+atic+s to check the facts --- having a good reference base would lower the barrier to entry immensely.

Study other fandoms' creation. I heard an obscure Edgar Poe's work went viral a few months back --- what caused it? It seems /Worm/'s fandom grew so big partly because the story had a good mechanic for introducing new characters/powers --- does /Lightbringer/ have something like this, and if no, can you /invent/ it via creative interpretation?

It's fine if most of the first works in your baby fandom will be unreadable tone-deaf garbage --- as long as they /exist/, the hard part is over. Steering your creation's development will be easier.

If at all possible, get the author on-board too --- there's no-one who would be more invested in what you're doing. Except for you, of course.

It won't be easy. The task may even seem impossible, insurmountable, insane, ridiculous. But /is/ it? You've never tried, and as far as I know, no-one else has ever attempted something like this before.

Never shy from playing god. Even if you fail, at least it'll be fun.
