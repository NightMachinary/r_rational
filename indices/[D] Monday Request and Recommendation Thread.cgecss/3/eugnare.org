So, I've started reading the Brent Weeks Lightbringer series off a recommendation given out a while ago. After finishing book 1 I was reminded of one of my favorite childhood series, The Seventh Tower by Garth Nix. I could only find a partially done fan-made audiobook on youtube.

This made me think, are there any good fanfictions of either series out there? Either with their powers or set in their world?

I havent gotten far in book 2 of Lightbringer but Ive reread Seventh Tower dozens of times. I feel like it has a big enough world to explore making some high quality fiction in, especially with how inventive you can get with lightweaving and spirit binding.

So if anyone has fanfiction of either I'd be very greatful.

I'll also be doing a narrative of the Seventh Tower as a warm up for doing Pokemon: The Origin of Species.
