I'm going to have to counter your counter.

Dr. Stone itself may not be too rational - as others have pointed out it's patently absurd - however it along with several other recent Shounen (e.g. The Promised Neverland) are reactions to previous popular manga (e.g. Dragon Ball), where the main characters attempt to solve their problems via intelligence/rational decision making, as opposed to the greater application of a fist to a face.

Under this view I don't see Dr. Stone as being rational, but it is a very large step in the right direction when compared to many of it's peers.

Also aside from the question of rationality Dr. Stone is very enjoyable, definitely recommend people give it a go if they're into Shounen.
