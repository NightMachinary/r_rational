Yeah. I have it on my to watch list. The characters are somewhat entertaining but the contrivances are ridiculous.

I stopped around chapter 90 or so, when they started making some more modern technology, just because their methods were not physically possible. The characters had some decent growth and there are some scenes I want to see animated.
