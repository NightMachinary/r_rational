  In five days she could have been a tinker 15 in programing, social engineering, memes, combat tactics and strategy, all of which are speliziations that require nothing more suspicious than an internet conection to use.

It's not stated in fiction but I kinda think that goes in to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-ghost-of-a-chance-worm-v1-cyoa-alt-taylor.766498/page-18#post-59224858][the author's idea of how Inspired Inventor works]] - since she doesn't have the shard-based processing power to offload on to, the only time she can achieve actually superhuman results is when she's actively Tinkering.

I kinda think it should have been explored more (it kinda is when she gets Math 3), but I get the feeling that if she put more than 3 charges into anything she'd have a depth of information that she just /can't use/, due to it being more than her purely human mind can work with.

Sure, with a bunch of points in programming / social engineering / etc she'd be a world-class expert in those fields, but still just at the top end of human ability - which means that any actual Thinkers could wipe the floor with her.
