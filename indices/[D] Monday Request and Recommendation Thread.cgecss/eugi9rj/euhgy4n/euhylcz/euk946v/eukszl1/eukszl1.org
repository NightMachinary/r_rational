Taylor's main problem in the fic is that she basically /doesn't Tinker/ in the first arc. The thing you quoted comes right after some introspection in which she realizes that, due to a mental block, she's been restricting herself to her power's secondary abilities.

Like seriously forget computers, Taylor should be able to sit down and Tinker with her own metabolic pathways until she can burp out a nanofabricator swarm. She doesn't because she's afraid of all the power she's been given.
