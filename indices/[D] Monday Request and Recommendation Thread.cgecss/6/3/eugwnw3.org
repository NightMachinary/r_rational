It starts promisingly, but quality drops off a cliff after the 2nd arc.

Throughout, the author has real problems with "show, don't tell" when it comes to what characters are thinking; entire chapters are spent inside Taylor's head and entire interludes are meant to explain character actions (and sometimes seem to be a direct response to the fic's readership). It gets particularly bad after the 2nd arc, where chapters alternate between characters jerking off about Taylor in reaction-interludes for a thousand words and dense, pointless techno-babble of Taylor musing on her future plans, sometimes without any actual dialogue.

Lastly, the fic grossly - in every sense - misses the mark on several characters, such as Coil, Armsmaster, and Cauldron. It turns them into pretty brutal caricatures. At one point several paragraphs are spent in a Coil interlude in his own head with him ranting about his own greatness.
