My only gripe about this fic is that there is way too much exposition. Reminds me of hunter x hunter in the chimera ant arc. However, I read a lot if CYOA and there is a really big plus of the story since no one picks the CYOA power of reincarnating as taylor herbert. It is probably the most well written one given the circumstances but not a revolutionary must-read.
