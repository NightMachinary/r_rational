  Jailbreaking the phone was the work of a moment, triaging and then disposing of all the data on the drive useless to my purposes less than a minute more.

The competence boosts the other specializations give you, while very useful, are nothing next to the abilty to write progams with them. Imagine how powerful combat prediction software writen by someone with a tinker 15 rateing in three relevant speliziations would be. Or an rudimentary AI designed to influence public opinion by releasing memetic ideas. Or a virus that spreads around the globe to anonymously sifon off computing power for your own use.
