I found of grand total of five fanfics on both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Lightbringer-series-Brent-Weeks/][FanFiction.net]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Lightbringer%20Series%20-%20Brent%20Weeks/works][Archive of Our Own]] for the Lightbringer series, non of which were over the 3k word mark, so I am going to guess that a decent fic for it doesn't exist.

Lightbringer is very good with the first few books though it kind of feels like he was just making stuff up in the later books and hadn't really planed the whole thing out.
