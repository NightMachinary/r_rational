I recommended it in the Open Thread but I'll also recommend it here.

I watched the dub of episode 1 of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Stone][Dr. Stone anime]]. It was really good. I don't know if it will keep up, but the first episode had lots of rationalist adjacent competence!porn, with slowly working through real world science to build tech from the ground up. For example, they made Nital and walked through the process of making and distilling alcohol.
