The protagonist rarely uses his rank to control a conversation. He is also a poor leader, and he knows it. He is also very rarely in a formal setting which might help him remember his role.

The author was very clear and strict about the protagonist's adoptive father's very strong dislike for being interrupted, and I do not believe that person was interrupted without clear indication of irritation or anger. I am confident that if the author wrote that character's unwillingness to be interrupted so clearly, they are more than capable of writing the same trait into others, if he chose to do so.

That said, the protagonist, once he becomes a noble, definitely allows people to walk all over him in conversation. I will even say that it likely happens too much, but I still do not have a problem with it. It seems clear to me that the author intended exactly that.
