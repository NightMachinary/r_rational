I have noticed the dialogue interruptions while reading. I simply considered it to be the author's style. The author's response to that thread seems to support my take.

Honestly, having the protagonist manage a dissertation-level conversation in the middle of combat is less rational. When something distracting happens, most people don't just keep talking like nothing happened.
