I'm going to have to counter that recommendation.

I dont know if you were here but when the manga first came out we were updating the sub with every chapter release. While it starts out quite rational, for such an irrational premise, it soon turns (around chapter 40 or so) into a fantasy version of science. Then they have this big reveal which completely ruins any SoD you could have about the setting and destroys whatever vestiges of rationality it had remaining.

It is an entertaining story, but it becomes absurdly anti-rational. I would recommend it if people like the genre of isekai but not if youre looking for a rationalist anime.
