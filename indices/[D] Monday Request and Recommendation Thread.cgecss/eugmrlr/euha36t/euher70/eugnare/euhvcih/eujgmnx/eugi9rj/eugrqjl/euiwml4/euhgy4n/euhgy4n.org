  Mistakes are made, but to me it didn't seem like anyone was holding the idiot ball.

The plot only happens because of the idiot ball. In five days she could have been a /tinker 15/ in programing, social engineering, memes, combat tactics and strategy, all of which are speliziations that require nothing more suspicious than an internet conection to use. That is a combo that could take over the world if you were lucky, let alone deal with coil, and the fact she didn't think of it, or something similar, right after she became a Tinker 5 strategist is just ridiculous.

That's what annoyed me the most actually. Don't give your characters superintelligent decision making ability if you are going to have them make unintelligent decisions.
