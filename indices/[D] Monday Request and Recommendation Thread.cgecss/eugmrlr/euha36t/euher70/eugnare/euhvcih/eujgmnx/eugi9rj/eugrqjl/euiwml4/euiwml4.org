Yet another Worm CYOA fic where the author has the character firmly grasp the idiot ball because otherwise there wouldn't be any conflict. It's not worse at it than the others like it, but I really don't understand why they don't just give the protagonist a weaker power or less information to start. He had to give her incredibly OP power, and excellent metaknowledge, and literally supernatural strategic ability. It's not impossible to write around that, but it mainly require giving the enemies an edge (eg simurgh is really good at recognizing blindspots and obliterating them), which tends to put the story into a super escalation loop. I'm not even sure whether I like that he has a chapter attempting to justify the idiot ball (which I obviously felt failed). On the one hand he recognizes the issue and is making an effort to ameliorate it, on the other hand it seems a bit meta, and the story might be better not dwelling on it for that long.
