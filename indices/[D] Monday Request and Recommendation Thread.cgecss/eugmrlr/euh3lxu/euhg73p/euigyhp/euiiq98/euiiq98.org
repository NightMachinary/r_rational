Ted Chiang's short story 'Seventy-Two Letters' centers on spermism, the idea that a russian nesting doll of tiny souls live inside of sperm, and in the story they're approaching the final generation.

In the same anthology there's also 'Tower of Babylon' which is not quite what you asked for, but is essentially bronze-age science fiction.
