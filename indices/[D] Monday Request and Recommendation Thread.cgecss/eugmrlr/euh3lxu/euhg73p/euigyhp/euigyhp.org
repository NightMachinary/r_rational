I forget the title, but there was a story where the "homunculus" theory of sperm was correct, where sperm contained a "little man" that grew to size in the nurturing fluids of the womb. Part of the mad science of this story was growing the "little man" outside of the womb, to giant size. Another detail had to deal with impressing things with stamps spelling Hebrew words that described the purpose of the item, creating golems. This was against a background of an apparent maximum number of generations for the human race which was due in a few generations, and a project to use Kabbalist science to prolong the human species by replacing biological humans with a race of kabbalistically-reproducing golems that were still human.
