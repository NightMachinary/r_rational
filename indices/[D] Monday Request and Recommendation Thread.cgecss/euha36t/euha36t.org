I just finished Max Gladstone's [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GVCXWR5][Empress of Forever]], and I definitely recommend it. It's very much in the "technology so advanced it wraps around and becomes magic again" side of things, but what I particularly liked was that it all still fits in to the framework of high tech sci-fi.

It's also, imo, a fairly interesting examination of what might actually happen if a hyper rational character who's too willing to sacrifice others bootstraps themselves into omniscience.
