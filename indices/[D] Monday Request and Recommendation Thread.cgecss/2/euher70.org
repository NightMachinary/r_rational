I am a sucker for stories where the main character is a tank, or at least fills the roles of a tank. This usually means that the main character can take lots of damage without going down. Sometimes this is expanded to extreme regeneration, lack of need of sleep or food, immovable object body, etc. Some examples of this would be The New World on Royalroad, A Bad Name (Worm fanfic), Greg Veder vs the World (Kind of I guess? he can shrug off bullets). I just want the main character surpassing the natural limits of their body. Any recommendations on this topic?

Edit: As for recommendations, I recently read Empire of Silence by Christopher Ruocchio. It's a science fiction written from first person about humanity in the 1602th century. It gives off a very Name of the Wind vibe, in that the main character is recapping his life as an old person who is a veritable legend, and there's a very 'coming of age' feeling throughout the story. You get to see Hadrian's (mc) development as he goes through hardships of both the financial and personal kind. I see people comparing it to Dune as well, since you have a space empire which works like a mix between medieval feudalism and Chinese monarchy. There's a church that bans technology. There's the future analogues of democratic nations, pirates, arabs, the people who turned into cyborgs, etc. It can be very theme-park-y as a science fiction, but I still enjoyed it a lot. I thought the main character's voice and characterization was done well, plus there's the whole mystery into his development from this naive optimistic boy into someone who has billions of deaths in his conscience. 8.5/10
