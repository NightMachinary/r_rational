Yeah I vaguely remember that, but I couldn't remember if it was actually him or some other author with a similar name like Walter John Williams so I didn't mention it.

It's kind of sad because his other series (The Golden Oecumene) is /also/ really good in a supertech sci-fi sort of way.

It's got neat ideas like the way the government only has a single soldier. He's the optimal combatant; when they need an army, they just create an army of him, and he coordinates perfectly with himself.
