Since it was just recently completed, I'm going to recommend the webcomic [[http://nn4b.com/][No Need for Bushido]] fun, tropey, and occasionally likes to pull at your heartstrings. The art is above average for webcomics in general, and far above average for a completed long-running webcomic. Also, it's not rational whatsoever, but I don't feel that detracts from the experience.

And while I have you here, I might as well recommend my all-time-favorite completed webcomic, [[https://www.nuklearpower.com/8-bit-theater/][8-bit theater]]. It's absolutely gut-bustingly hilarious, despite the sprite art.
