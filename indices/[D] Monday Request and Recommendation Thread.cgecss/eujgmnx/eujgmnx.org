I'd like to recommend [[https://www.amazon.com/Rowenas-Rescue-Rise-Book-ebook/dp/B00KGLR81M][Rowena's Rescue]] which is a story with an old fashioned beginning about a princess who has been kidnapped by a wizard and her father, the king, has promised her hand in marriage to anyone who can rescue her. However, the princess in this story is very independent and has decided to rescue herself and therefore gain the right to her own hand and be able to decide her own destiny in life.

Her attempts at escape reads very much like a character who is attempting a dungeon crawl and while I wouldn't call it a rational story, there's a fair bit of munchkinry and puzzle solving.
