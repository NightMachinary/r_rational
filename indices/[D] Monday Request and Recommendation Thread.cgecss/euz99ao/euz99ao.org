I've been listening to quite a bit of litRPG recently as I drive.

Three reasonably-well written series follow.

1. Ascend Online series by Luke Chmilenko. Decent. Author has issues with repeating adjectives and adverbs too often in short scenes. The author also heavily over-uses the word 'countless.' By the end of the third book, I was groaning out loud every time the word 'countless' was used. Nothing Grammarly couldn't fix.

2. Way of the Shaman series by Vasily Mahanenko. Also decent. I have read three of the books so far. This fellow doesn't have a problem with repetitiveness of adjectives and adverbs. However he does have one rather irritating quirk. He strongly overused the phrases "The girl" and "The girl's." Again, Grammarly, please.

3. The Good Guys series by Eric Ugland. Better than decent writing. No word-overuse issues. The Protagonist has moments of brilliance and times when he clearly was holding onto an idiot ball with both hands and his teeth. However, the author does a good job of making the protagonist suffer for most obvious bad mistakes, and I have to say that if you gave me a bag of holding, there's a strong chance that I would do a lot of what the protagonist did.
