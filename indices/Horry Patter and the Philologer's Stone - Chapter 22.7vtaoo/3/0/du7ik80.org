The first Harry Potter book is set in 1991-1992, and Horry Patter seems to be about that point. The Vietnam War is described as being "barely twenty years ago" in Chapter 18. The Vietnam War ended in 1975, so Horry Patter is plausibly anywhere between 1991 (with the assumption that Hermany is rounding a little poorly) to 1999 (after which Hermany would be rounding /very/ poorly).
