There are four time periods so far:

(A) Before the Searching. (B) After the Searching. (C) 30-minutes before the wand experiments. (D) After the wand experiments.

Horry starts at (D), and an "older student" sends him back to (B) using the twistor with a note. There, F&G (after a conversation with Horry that we haven't seen yet) steal the twistor from him. He learns a lie detecting spell from Horbid, sees F&G on the roof (meeting him for the first time) and they throw their own un-noted twistor at him sending him to (A) where they steal their twistor back so that they now have two. This may be before or after that conversation we haven't seen yet. It is definitely after the meeting on the roof.

Horry watches the Searching and then meets with Alvin who gives him a twistor and note paper, possibly the origin of those items, and sends him to (C) where he presumably meets with F&G again to explain the plot they seemed to know about in the first conversation in (B) but didn't get much information about in the second conversation.

F&G are such wildcards in this mess that I don't think it's worth drawing a timeline yet. They may very well have arranged to have looped copies of the same time twistor in order to both run around doing whatever they're doing on the roof together. The rules of time twistor use (as we've had them explained thus far) do not seem to allow two people to time travel without two twistors.
