Yeah, "don't take unilateral action" works well.

You don't see Cassie's arc as being something like "paralyzed by moral uncertainty and unwilling to choose among bad options" to "at least do something, and save whoever you can"?

Also you don't think Tobias is learning to trust people? It seems like a change in one of his fundamental character traits at the start of the story.

As for Marco, it isn't really a weakness, but I think he's wrong about Jake. Since Jake can't explain how he's making his predictions, and since it seems impossible to Marco to correctly draw the conclusions Jake is drawing with the evidence Jake has, he's kind of writing off Jake's incredible predictive power. It seems like he hasn't quite updated on the fact that Jake is so consistently correct.

Anyway, if everyone doesn't have some sort of arc by the end of the story, I'll finally have a decent criticism. And I do hope there's a theme. It doesn't make a book bad to lack a clear theme or characters who learn and change, but it does make a book worse as art. I really do see "theme" as like the point of a book / why the book needs to exist. It's fine if the reasons for a book's existence are "it'll be fun" and "the Animorphs books could have been so much better," but would be a bit unambitious on the part of [[/u/TK17Studios]], and he hasn't let me down so far.
