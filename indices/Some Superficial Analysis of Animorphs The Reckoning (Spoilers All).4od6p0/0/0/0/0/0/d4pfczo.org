Marco's weakness: under-rates others. He acts like he's Ender Wiggins or Yudkosky in a book written by Yudkowsky: always right, always being held back or led astray by the weaker minds around him, always being reminded that he should only trust his own judgement, not the flawed assessments of those around him.

Never mind that in this story he happens to mostly be right....
