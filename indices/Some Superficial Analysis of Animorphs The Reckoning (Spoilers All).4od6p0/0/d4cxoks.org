I'm not sure Marco actually has any strong weaknesses, actually. Well, none that are relevant to the story so far. Which kind of makes sense to me: when the introductory line of your character is "I try to get things right as often as possible", you can afford to have him not to have any major flaws that are relevant to planning a high-scales guerilla war. Marco is sort of the right character for the right job.

Actually, Rachel aside, I don't really think any of the main characters have a strong theme or a strong arc. They each have a strong personality and a strong, I don't know, decision tree? And their individual stories flow from their approach to the problems they're confronted with.

If I had to name one theme for the story, it would be "Don't try to do everything yourself, and don't take unilateral action". Visser's main weakness is that his only advisor is a voluntarily biased hostile. Cassie gets killed when she's manipulated into not listening to the rest of the group. Jake almost gets killed by not listening to Marco. Rachel screws up everything the first time she strikes on her own. Tobias wastes weeks trying to do his intelligence-gathering op alone.

Also, "Don't engage in wishful thinking" seems like a recurring sub-theme.
