Yeah, I guess I don't think a character's arc has to be something they explicitly recognize, just how they are changed by participating in the narrative.

Also, I didn't say this earlier, but I definitely think Marco needs to have flaws/weaknesses. He doesn't need to have clearly defined negative traits, but at the very least he has to be less than perfectly rational/intelligent/quick-witted. Probably you agree with me about that.
