  You don't see Cassie's arc as being something like "paralyzed by moral uncertainty and unwilling to choose among bad options" to "at least do something, and save whoever you can"?

  Also you don't think Tobias is learning to trust people? It seems like a change in one of his fundamental character traits at the start of the story.

I don't know. I guess it depends on how you define "arc" or "theme", but I think I see Rachel's arc as more of thing because she's actually trying to consider and work on her issues, and her chapters reflect on her progress in working through them, while Tobias and Cassie's issues are more incidental to their chapters. They're there because it's their personality, but, I don't know, it's not actually a plot point?
