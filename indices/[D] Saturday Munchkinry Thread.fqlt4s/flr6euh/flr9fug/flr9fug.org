  How would you use this power?
#+end_quote

I wouldn't, it's too restricted to cause meaningful change in the world, and clashes to much with my morals to use for my personal gain, like there are very few ways to get somebody to do anything without having them hear somebody elses voice, like sure I can get people to do stuff online or sign documents, but I cant think of ways to do this without either catching peoples attention or it being very immoral. Overall the power would be extremly annoying since it would affect everybody I talk to once until they either hear somebody else or I tell them to say something, I would honestly be afraid that people will think I am drugging them. It would also be hard to explain if I accidentally affect somebody in front of people who are immune.

  Or how would you fight against someone with this power?
#+end_quote

Immidiatly say something to everybody I meet to free them should they be hypnotized, and always listen to music on a very low volume to free me immidiatly but not hinder my ability to hear other, I would only need to do this until I am affected once.
