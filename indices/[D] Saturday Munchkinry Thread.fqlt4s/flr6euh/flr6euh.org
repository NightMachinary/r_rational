You have a voice-based hypnosis power. Anyone who hears your voice is instantly hypnotized to obey whatever verbal orders you give to the best of their ability and understanding. People do not remember anything that happened while they were hypnotized, but will know that the last thing they remember was hearing your voice (though they may not know who you are if you spoke to them without them seeing you). This power even works through recordings, so you can hypnotize people via television, radio, online videos, etc.

However, there is a catch: if a hypnotized target hears any voice that isn't yours, even their own voice, they instantly break free of the hypnosis and thereafter become immune to your power.

How would you use this power? Or how would you fight against someone with this power?

EDIT: Your power isn't blessed with suck. You can turn it on or off at will, so you don't have to worry about not being able to talk without hypnotizing someone. Think of it like Lelouch's power in Code Geass. (This also means it becomes harder for people to immunize themselves, since that can only happen if you voluntarily hypnotize them first.)
