If you don't care about morality: permanently deafen the target right after you hypnotize them. Now they can never break free. With sufficiently broad orders (e.g. "obey me forever"), you can create an army of deafened mind-slaves this way.

To fight against this power, play a recording of the hypnotist's voice to someone, then immediately talk to them to immunize them.
