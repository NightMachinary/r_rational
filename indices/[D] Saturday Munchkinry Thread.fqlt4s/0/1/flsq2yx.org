Wait wait wait. So what you are asking is "How would you idiot-proof life?" Can't be done. New me is gonna try the various things that current me does and fail in horrible unpredictable ways. It would honestly have been better if new me had lost his memories, because memories of a smart person are poison for idiots. Small amounts of overconfidence is a slow insidious killer. But new me is going to have a lifetime amount of confidence that has suddenly become overconfidence due to a drastic (heh) instantaneous drop in intellect. That much overconfidence will likely have immediate and disastrous effects. It would not surprise me if he wins a Darwin award.
