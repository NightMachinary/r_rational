In exactly 24 hours (or, in a week) your IQ/"intelligence" will be reduced (or increased?) to 90.

The new you will be of that below average intelligence, but they will remember being you and they will remember anything you did to prepare and follow any instructions to the best of their ability (so if you write a recipe for a really good chocolate cake with the note to bake it every day and give it to strangers in the street, then you will trust smart!you had a reason for this and will follow the instructions: but 90IQ!you is below average intelligence and not completely stupid so if there's a huge storm they'll skip it that day). But in general, 90!you is blindly trusting of your advice (and there's no Eve trying to set you astray). Everything else in the world is normal, and you are your normal self with no special resources or powers (if you have special resources or powers, please assume you don't for the purposes of this exercise).

How do you prepare with your 24 hours / one week lead time?
