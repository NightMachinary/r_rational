One of my partners, without hesitation, said, "I'd kill myself", because apparently he couldn't bare to live as a person of fairly average but slightly stupid intelligence, so please don't be that grim friends!

My thoughts are as follows:

- To get my job at my age I had to be smart, but to hold it I don't, so my priority is maintaining my job

- So I'd write down everything I could about doing my job. I'd probably tell myself to just blindly do the next step my boss says to do (normally I advocate for what I think is right and then I learn why my boss is right / my boss does something more innovative), and to write everything down and then just do the steps one by one.

- Fortunately it's very difficult for me to be fired in a government job so I think that'll be fine in that my income is secured. If 90!me is particularly crafty, ambitious, hard-working or talented she can move up the ranks same as anyone else.

- In my personal life, I have reasonable confidence that as long as my personality doesn't change majorly, my partners won't leave me, and I'd probably include instructions along the lines of transforming myself a bit more into an obedient 50s housewife archetype because a) they'll both be much smarter than me and probably be right and b) it will help abate my anger issues somewhat assuming new!me is really as cooperative with old!me's advice as stated
