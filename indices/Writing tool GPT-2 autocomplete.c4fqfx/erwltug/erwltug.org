Tried this on a few upcoming scenes from /Worth the Candle/. Most of it isn't all that useful, as a writer. I think in the current configuration, it would probably mostly help as an unblocker, or maybe a push in some different direction. I didn't find anything that I would keep as an actual next sentence (or sentence fragment), even when testing on descriptive paragraphs, where I would naively think it would be the most useful (e.g. describing the salient features of a room, or helping to set a scene).
