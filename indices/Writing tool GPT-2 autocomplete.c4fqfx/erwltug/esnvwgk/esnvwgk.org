I tried training GPT2 directly on WtC to see how the generated text would look, here's a sample. I used [[https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple][gpt-2-simple in colab]], and the 345Mb model. Let me know if you would like to see more samples or have a play (I can set up a notebook). I'm just a fan of your writing, and curious how writers might use this (if it's useful at all).

  “Alright,” said Amaryllis, nodding. “I'll see if I can find the portal in the game, at which point I will know that it's not us.”

  “If you see the portal,” I said, “You know we'll take those precautions, that's more or less what this is.”

  “Oh,” said Amaryllis. “You'll kill our host, and then the hells? That's not really what the game was supposed to show me, because it wasn't the thing that the game was supposed to show me: the game was supposed to show me that there were only ten people who could get through the portal. That's what it shows, but it's a stupid, stupid thing that we'll have to fix.”

  “The hells,” said Fenn. “I think that's a good start. It's going to take two to tango, right?”

  “Yeah,” said Amaryllis. I hadn't seen any of the game text, or a whole lot that Fenn and Amaryllis were talking about, which meant that I couldn't really know whether they were talking about the fact that they were the same person or the fact that they came from separate species. I had my doubts, but my gut was telling me that they were talking about the same person, with different quirks.

  “Yeah, it's not that hard, not even much harder than going up the stairs together,” said Amaryllis. “It doesn't always make the world interesting, but you always look different when you're holding people. And if you can't hang it together, it's hard not to want to take off at some point, or at least the moment of unresponsiveness, even if the reason that's happening is actually the person. The rest of it is up to us, and we should make the most of it if it's not working out, which it is not at all.”

  “You did some weird stuff,” said Fenn. “You are all right.”

  “Wasn't it?” asked Amaryllis, looking back down at the floor.

  “It was my fault,” said Fenn. “You guys did not get me for my talents like I might have,” she wiped her brow. “You're the same people to me, you didn't.” She looked slightly less concerned. “You have some talents in common with the person.”

  “I have some things,” said Amaryllis. “I don't pretend otherwise.”

  “Hey,” said Fenn. “The way she looks down at the floor makes sense, given that you are holding her together, the way she gets a bit mottled. It was a different version of Fenn, but with you, of course.”

  “You're doing a great job,” said Amaryllis. We would have been done with our story, unless we had another five pages, or had a lot of secrets in there, but she had one more chapter to go, which was fine.

  “I'll meet you in the main room,” said Fenn.

  “That is not really what the game was supposed to show,” said Amaryllis, frowning. “If we can get down from here, then it's possible that we can get to the middle of it, but if we don't, it can only go to the very end.”

  “The last step,” said Amaryllis, frowning. This was a conversation that I'd liked to be having. “It might be that I could help you with it, but I'd think that people who'd like that kind of interaction should first know about Fenn's talents first, and then I'd think back to the game, because I still don't really understand it.”

  Fenn gave me an exasperated look. “It makes sense!”

  “Oh,” said Amaryllis. “You're really not helping yourself to

Yup that looks like WtC nonsense to me :p

  *Alexander Wales*] had been the consummate gentleman. I forgot that he was a wizard, and I had to do some extra work on him to get him to say yes to something, but the thing that I liked most about him was that he had a good heart. I had no idea what his status was in the Order of the Phoenix. Maybe it was because I had to keep a close eye on him, but I knew enough of his story to know that it was preposterous.

  “He's in great shape,” said Fenn. “I've never seen him in pain, not even when I was in the process of casting.”

  “It's not that,” said Amaryllis. “It's the fact that he's a wizard.”

  “It's a problem,” said Fenn. “It's complicated, and the solution is to get rid of the problem.”

  “I'll be very happy to help,” said Amaryllis.

  and that was that. I didn't want
