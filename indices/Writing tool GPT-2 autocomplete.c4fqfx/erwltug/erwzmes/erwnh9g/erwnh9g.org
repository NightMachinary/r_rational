Interesting! I wonder if it would be better if it was trained on your style, or modifying a seed text (which may make it stay closer to your style). Perhaps not though.

Maybe you could up the noise and use it to represent an antimeme (or whatever the correct term is) or a locus in the book .

However, I think this applications easier since they were exploring a much less constrained space. In the end, though, it's easy to generate nonsense, and there are many ways to do it.

Overall it's likely just a fun toy.
