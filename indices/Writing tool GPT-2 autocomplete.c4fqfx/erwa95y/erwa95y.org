This is a writing tool made by hugging face, it autocompletes your writing. Behind the scenes is the OpenAI GPT-2 model that's been in the news recently (the public medium size version).

It's a glimpse of some of the writing tools that will be produced by the latest wave of machine learning + text advances, which are quickly exceeding human performance (see the [[https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard][GLUE/SUPERGLUE leaderboard]]).

Some more features we are likely to see in future are

- completions trained on a certain style, e.g. "complete this as JK Rowling". Similar to Gwerns poetry generation.
- rewriting/editing (see [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11006][Levenstein transformers paper]]),
- better grammar checkers (Grammarly have published quite a bit),
- and eventually style tansfer is likely (this is a more challanging application thant text generaiton, and it's early days yet but see [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06535][grammerly's paper with informal=>formal translation]]).

If you're interested in this kind of thing keep an eye on huggingface, they are making some really great NLP tools using the latest techniques (I'm not affiliated in any way).

Be aware that the site may not be up forever since it takes them [[https://twitter.com/julien_c/status/1139208397579051009][$24/hour to run on a AWS p3.16xlarge instance]]. It may also suffer from the hug of death since it's not auto-scaling.

Personally, I do machine learning freelancing for companies, and also look at my own startup ideas (currently comment moderation applications). So I'm interested in people's thoughts on this as a writing tool, especially from those amazing people who actually write (unlike me who just consumes other peoples' writing).

Hopefully writing tools are on-topic for this subreddit, otherwise, I'll move this to a weekly thread.
