Commonplace gave Paragon false intel that they were going to invade the Agricultural Islands, a strategic region. As a result, most of the military and high-level Guardians have left the city.

Commonplace used the opportunity to assault Paragon Academy (plus a few military bases).

They used their infiltrator (the one who got swapped with miss "beat up with baseball bats" a few interludes ago) to break in the school's chassis vault, and act as a kind of telephone line to transfer souls through, to give them an army on the inside.

Commonplace is currently in the middle of slaughtering Paragon students. Also, the members of parliament who were supposed to be here are mysteriously missing, and the Pyre Witch is trying to bait out the remaining Guardians, who are hanging back for some reason (probably defending something?).
