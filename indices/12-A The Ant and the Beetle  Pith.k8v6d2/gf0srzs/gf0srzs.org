That arc title is super promising.

I really like that we're seeing all of this brutality by Commonplace (especially the nudged and maimed servants being sent on suicide missions) right after the Maxine Clive interlude. It's a wonderful juxtaposition, considering how much it evokes Maxine's own experiences at Buttercup Lodge. It serves to highlight the brutality of both sides, the fact that no one's hands are clean and that regardless of who's right or wrong, revolution is /ugly/. I especially like how Tunnel Vision's general emotionlessness reads here. While it's long been one of the most striking aspects of her character, it comes across a little differently when she's dispassionately torturing people and the sheer apathy of the "staff" at Buttercup Lodge is fresh in my mind.

None of this is an attempt to "both sides" Commonplace and Paragon, by the way, since I'm still firmly of the belief that Paragon is the worse of the two and that Commonplace winning would be a good thing in the grand scheme of things. While the juxtaposition of this chapter and Buttercup Lodge highlight the similarities in the /level/ of brutality between the two sides, the /nature/ of the atrocities has some key differences. Most notably, Commonplace is committing war crimes with reckless abandon, whereas Paragon built and operated Buttercup Lodge in a time of peace.
