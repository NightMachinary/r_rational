Great chapter! The pace of the fight scenes was relentless, yet they were easy to follow, and it was always clear where the protagonists were going and why.

A little odd that after her "should have nabbed a green hand's body while I had a chance" moment Ana isn't even considering it now, but I guess even if she did she wouldn't stomach it.

Also, holy crap, Ana is /still/ completely willing to work for Paragon, even though she's seeing proof after proof of their corruption? What's it going to take, giant flaming letters?

Though with a title like that, I guess we'll find out before the end of this arc.
