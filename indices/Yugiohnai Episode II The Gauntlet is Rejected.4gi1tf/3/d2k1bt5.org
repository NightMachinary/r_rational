Curious as to where this goes. One thing though, Yami would never just give up like that. IF you think about it logically, mind-reading isn't totally unbeatable in Duel Monsters. It's still possible to outplay your opponent even if they know everything you'll do. A trash deck won't win against a top tier one, even if you play with your entire hand revealed.

It is kind of neat that Yugi already realizes that he's as strong as Yami.
