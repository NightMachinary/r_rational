And what are the chances that Pegasus is playing a trash deck? He's the CEO of Industrial Illusions, the company that /makes/ the game.

I've been thinking that in this story, while money would have an unfortunate impact on the balance of the game, I've decided that the amount of skill level required would be more similar to that of Magic: the Gathering than of the real life Yugioh trading card game. In other words, while skill is not as important as card access to game outcomes in the competitive scene, skill is still fairly important. Someone using a cheap deck in this story is almost always going to lose when they're facing against an expensive deck, unless the expensive deck was poorly built, or unless the cheap deck is some weird rogue deck that will only work in the competitive metagame once.

This is how I see MtG and Yugioh.

In real life MtG: Quality of deck design>card access($)>skill and luck

In real life Yugioh: Card access($)>quality of deck design>luck>skill.

I would argue that if your opponent knows everything that you will do in advance, and you still win, it probably wasn't because you played better than them, but because you had a better deck or better card access.

The therapy helps with that.
