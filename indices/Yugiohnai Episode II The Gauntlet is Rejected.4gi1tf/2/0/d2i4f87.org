I was thinking of making the explanation for that involve Yugi's conspicuously absent parents...

I have an unfortunate history of failing to finish novels that I've started. I get too serious about them and try too hard to make them perfect and then they become work and no longer fun any more.

For this story, I've decided that the most important thing is the rule of fun, and everything else is second to that.

I'm thinking if I get stuck, or start going in circles with something, or things start to become less fun or no fun, I'll ask you for help and you can help me work through it. Sound good?
