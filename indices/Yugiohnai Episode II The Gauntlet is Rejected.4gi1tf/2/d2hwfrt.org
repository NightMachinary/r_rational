HAH! Fantastic. The show callout battle start was awesome. The online help part was a neat idea and other victims stepping up was in character for story antagonist. But if Sogekoge(whatever his complex name is) was an ex duelist, shouldn't he have some money and or social pull to make the whole situation go away? Either way please write more. I am not sure how to incetivise you to keep writing this, so name some things/wants you think I could help with.

To specify, I am offering you a certain amount of favor/help, if said help will make you write more of this specific storyline. I may not have much, but I can try.
