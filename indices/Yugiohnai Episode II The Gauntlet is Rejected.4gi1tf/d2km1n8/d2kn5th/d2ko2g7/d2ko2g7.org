It's certainly threatening, but I would not interpret it as "Beat me or else!" In fact, I would be modelling Pegasus as a fairy at this point, powerful and capricious - He might be more likely to hurt my friends and family if I embarrass him! He claims that he just wants to play a game, so I would try to be on my best behavior and give him exactly what he wants and definitely not antagonize him.

Pegasus has demonstrated the ability to freeze people. He could have frozen Yugi in the middle of the turn, walked over, looked at his hand, walked back, and unfrozen him. He could have frozen Yugi at the same time he froze everyone else, rifled through the deck and put subtle marks on the backs of all of the cards, then unfroze Yugi. Hell, he probably froze Yugi anyway to give himself time to come over from wherever he was when Yugi watched the video, without Yugi noticing him come in the door. (Or thus it may be reasonable to conclude.)

And clearly there's some sort of magic going on, and he has a magic artifact for an eye. Who knows what that thing does? Can he see through the backs of the cards? Can he look /around/ the backs of the cards, without moving? Is there a big jumbotron hidden in all that darkness that the eye lets him see, showing everyone's cards? What would a magic /eye/ have to do with /mindreading/?
