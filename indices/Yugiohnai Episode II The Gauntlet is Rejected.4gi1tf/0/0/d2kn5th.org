Um...wouldn't you take it as a threat if someone did that to you?

If it weren't for the Millenium Eye, Pegasus wouldn't even know what deck Yugi was using. He didn't see Sugoroku toss it to him at the last moment before they entered the Shadow Realm.

There are a LOT of different cards in the game. The chances of Pegasus guessing that one correctly if he hadn't known what deck Yugi was playing or seen any of the cards yet, are very very low.

And how would Pegasus look at the cards? Beyond Pegasus, Yugi, the dueling table, and Yugi's friends and grandpa frozen in place, There's nothing around them but shadow magic and darkness as far as the eye can see. No video cameras or anything like that.

What is Yugi supposed to think? Plus, a lot of people would panic in that situation.

As for the last point, you're absolutely right. That was exactly what he said in the american dub of the anime, no joke. I probably should change that line. Thanks for pointing it out.
