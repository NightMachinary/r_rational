Glad my feedback is helpful to you!

You wouldn't necessarily have to rework it entirely. You're establishing that "big Yugi" is aggressive and stupid. You could just slightly rework the conversation where he takes over, then leave the rest basically unchanged. And maybe be explicit that he is more confident about his conclusions than the evidence suggests he should be, because of cryptic mostly-sealed background knowledge.

I mean, there's a fine line between "He just knew it" and "He reached the conclusion the plot required". But you do have options, if you're careful.
