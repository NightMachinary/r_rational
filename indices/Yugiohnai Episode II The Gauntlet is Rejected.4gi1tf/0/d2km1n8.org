Yugi's making some weird assumptions here.

When things go dark and cold and still, what makes him think he's been "taken" anywhere?

So Pegasus is all, "I want to duel you right now and I'm willing to pause reality with crazy voodoo magic to make it happen! I'll undo it /when we're done!/" Okay, sure, that's an alarming and frightening show of power... but it's not exactly a direct threat. Why is Yugi taking it as one? Did I miss some reason I shouldn't take Pegasus at his word?

Why does Yugi think Pegasus can read his mind? What, just because he guessed one card and bluffed? Maybe he just /looked/. Which, I'm relatively sure, is cheating and grounds for disqualification - Yugi wins again without even playing.

Okay, whatever, Yugi has to play with his cards showing because reasons, and he has to seriously try to win because more reasons. Isn't a stall-for-Exodia deck almost ideal for that? He just has to not lose /too/ badly with the handicap until the heart of the cards comes through, and that's exactly what the deck was built for. Is the game /that/ reliant on hidden information, that no possible strategy can even draw out a loss otherwise? Honest qustion. I don't know. But that's not what I would naively suspect.

On a more literary level, what kind of person cries out in a panic, "Everything's grown dark and cold and the others aren't moving!" Pegasus knows, dude, he's there with you. Who are you narrating for? The actual narrator should be handling that.
