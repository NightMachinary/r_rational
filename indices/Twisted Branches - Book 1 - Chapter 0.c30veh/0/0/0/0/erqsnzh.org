Creation of spells requires knowledge and mastery of the runic text. Creating a spell or enchantment(the latter is more complex) involves arranging the runes into a formulaic programming language. Not everyone has a head for it.\\
Kat is driven to it out of desperation and starts with the most basic of spells but learns she has a talent for it.\\
For most, it's much easier to buy spells as opposed to crafting them. Also, Kat gets pretty lucky with her first spell. It's an old spell in the public domain that's featured in lots of stories/myths/legends, Blinding Flash. Otherwise, if she were modifying a spell someone owns the rights to, she'd have to pay for the rights to it. Then selling the spell would involve royalties going to the base script's owner.
