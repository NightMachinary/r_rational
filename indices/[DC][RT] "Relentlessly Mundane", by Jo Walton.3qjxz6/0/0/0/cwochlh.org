TV Tropes used to have an entry for "Reverse Portal Fantasy", which is that trope, but it looks like it got deleted or merged in some stupid way. Examples:

- /Enchanted/
- /Fables/
- /The Devil is Part-Timer/
- Arguably the first /Thor/ movie
- /Redshirts/
- /Howard the Duck/ (kind of, in that he ends up in Cleveland, but it's the Cleveland of the Marvel universe)
