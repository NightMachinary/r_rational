Hm, Fables seems more like a conventional urban fantasy with a mass exodus to Earth in the backstory. In TWAU, everyone seems pretty accustomed to Earth, and the story itself is entirely about the hidden world. Is the comic about the exodus?

And in the first place, I'm talking about the world being mundane, as in, magic not working. Time travel to the past works too, as long as the traveler's technology is unavailable in some way. What I want is more like, characters accustomed to having much greater ability, through technology or magic, who are thrown into a situation in which they can't access those abilities.

Like survivalism, but not just naturalist. Survivalism from the perspective of a more powerful society/individual. Even an average American teenager or a business executive or politician having to survive in rural Africa would do it for me, I think. Post-apocalypse, too. I just want more of a perspective where /this/ society is the less powerful one.
