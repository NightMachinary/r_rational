Ah, I get what you're saying. Genre characters finding themselves in mundane worlds /and becoming mundane there/. That's a much more narrow filter, probably a subtrope of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal][Brought Down to Normal]], but longer term than that usually ends up being. I can't really help you there.
