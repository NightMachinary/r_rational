Three clicks, found [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMagicsNoGoodHere][Your Magic's No Good Here]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues][Humanity Ensues,]] though the former is neglected, and the latter is not nearly as related). Thanks for the link.

I also just remembered a great book, Dogsbody, where a star is tried in, um, star court, and is sentenced to find an important item in the lifetime of a dog on Earth.
