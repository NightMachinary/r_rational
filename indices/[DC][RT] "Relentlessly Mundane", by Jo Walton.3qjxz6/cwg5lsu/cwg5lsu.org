Meanwhile, a very confused group of children find themselves in a strange place. It takes a little while but they manage to confirm what they all suspected: they are in another world.

It's simpler, with none of the sophisticated magitech that the worldsmiths use to shape the cosmos. There is great beauty in the marvels that the people here created without the aid of thought-tools, manipulating the world to fit the shape of their ideas with sweat and blood, but there is also great danger. The unspoken fear is that some unstable government will get its hands on nuclear weapons and initiate a world war or an apocalypse or both.

Though there are no AI oracles to predict their roles in the coming events, they are filled with certainty of purpose. It is hard to imagine how a group of four children scarcely old enough to receive a neural implant can save an entire world, but they have one thing on their side, one crucial thing. A thing that overpowers all opposition, that burns in the hearts of the righteous and will always triumph: they have a desire for knowledge.
