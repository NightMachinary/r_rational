Yeah, the wall design was absolutely not made with the goal of protecting the common people.

OP, I think this is a case of thinking the wall is irrational only because you don't know what it's utility function is. There may be a very good reason indeed for it to be that way (well, at least, good for a few people in power) but it has not been explained yet. And probably won't for a few years.
