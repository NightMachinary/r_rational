  Titans (巨人 Kyojin?) are the primary antagonists in the series. They are a mysterious race of humanoid giants that appeared roughly 100 years ago (107 years is the most specific number given during Eren's training) and rapidly exterminated humanity to the point of near extinction. Their origins, overall numbers, and how their physiology works remains a mystery at this point in the story.

From the Wiki, I can't remember what episode it was but I did remember the specific number.

It was really surprising when they said that, it was only 7 years between titans appearing and humanity building huge giant walls.

Yeah but if titans were constantly banging on the outside of the walls you'd figure you would know.
