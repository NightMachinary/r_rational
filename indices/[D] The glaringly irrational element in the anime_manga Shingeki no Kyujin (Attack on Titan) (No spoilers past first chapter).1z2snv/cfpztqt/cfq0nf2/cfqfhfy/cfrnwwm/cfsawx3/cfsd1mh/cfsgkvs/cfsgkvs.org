I think there have been titans outside the walls, there just never had ben an incident within the walls, i.e. No colossal titan basically. The survey corps were still getting fucked up everytime they would go out.

Just curious, where did you get the number 107 from? I think the titans have been around for much longer than that. They call it year 850 so its prob been at least that long since humanity was almost destroyed.
