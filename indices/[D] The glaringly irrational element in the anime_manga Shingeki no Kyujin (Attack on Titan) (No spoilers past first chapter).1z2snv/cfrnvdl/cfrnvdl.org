Just started watching it, on episode 2 now after the titan just charged through the gate like nobodies business.

The titans can't climb sheer walls right, otherwise they would have done so, so seems to me the smart thing is to build a ditch.

All the titans would be stuck at the bottom of the ditch you could try and drop rocks on them or something, since nothing damages them tying them down seems like they only option. People need to use ropes more.

How could they have a food shortage when they have so much green land available for farming on? And if only 500 people escaped from the town (which seemed pretty damn big for a town for me) that's practically nothing for a town and shouldn't be a big deal. The boats would have fit way more than 500 people anyway.

Also surprised people didn't just go all nomad since the only time we saw a titan run was trying to get through the gate.
