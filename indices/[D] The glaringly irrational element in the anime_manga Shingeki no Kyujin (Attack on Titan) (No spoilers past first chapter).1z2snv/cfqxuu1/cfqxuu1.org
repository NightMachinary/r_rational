The most irrational thing noticeable from the very beginning is the lack of suspension springs on the soles of feet of 3DMG users. The ability to soften falls, extend normal jumps and create a jump+grapple combo over flat planes for easier and maneuverable travel is priceless. And springs date from at least the 15th century so this isn't something outside of time reference.

EDIT: Another point from early on Recognized in story that using 3DMG is very stressful on the body, so we can safely assume users get sweaty. Sweat + cold wind from all the flying around = common cold. All the user could really go for some thicker pants, full body jackets and scarfs.
