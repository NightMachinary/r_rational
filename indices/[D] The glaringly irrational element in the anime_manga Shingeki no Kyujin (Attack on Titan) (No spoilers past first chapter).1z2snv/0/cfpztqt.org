YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET'S HAVE THIS TALK, GUYS! /Attack on Titan/ was trying so damn hard and still is only-kinda-actually smart.

Now, first remark on the walls, [[#s][Attack on Titan]] My approach would be to keep the outer wall roughly the same (how much /can/ you minimize surface perimeter in 2D while enclosing a fixed amount of area?), but build the inner walls to criss-cross and thus provide a "cross" structure. I would also want to build in more "criss-crosses", because /plainly/ if a Titan can break through the outer wall I should expect the inner walls to merely /slow it down/ rather than actually stop it.

The /other/ issue with the Wall structure in AoT is that it's hierarchical, intended for a hierarchical social structure consisting of the richest elites from the Old World (ie: the exact kind of people you find on [[/r/rational]], [[/r/hpmor]], and LW: professionals, entrepreneurs, executives, technologists, and other high-income brats). Their design is extremely stupid for defending against Titans, but very smart for projecting the social structure onto the map.
