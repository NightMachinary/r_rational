Sure, it's fairly obvious that the design of the walls is part of the mystery, but the setup has the potential for a very interesting mathematical puzzle if you prune the setting down to platonic ideals.

The titans could behave with simple laws. At fixed intervals, titans can break the wall in one place, essentially deleting one line segment from a simple graph. They attack whichever outer wall protects the most land, or a random one from all the options with equal results. They don't plan multiple attacks out, they won't attack a spot to open up a wall for the next attack which would be decisive. Corners where three or more walls touch would be considered as unbreachable.

If you idealize the situation to Territory = population, the "score" of the map would be the total territory-years it promises, adding together the total remaining area each iteration, divided by the total length of all the walls.

The number of distinct territories has to be finite, so no fractals.

a circle results in a score of ( pi * r^{2} )/(2 pi r), or simply pi/2pi if r is 1. which is obviously 0.5.

A circle with a single wall across the center would have an area-time of (1.5 pi r^{2)} and a wall length of (2 pi r)+2r. (1.5 pi r^{2)/[(2} pi r)+2r] is about [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281.5+pi+%29%2F%5B%282+pi%29%2B2%5D][]]

Does adding more radial walls converge the score or diverge it?
