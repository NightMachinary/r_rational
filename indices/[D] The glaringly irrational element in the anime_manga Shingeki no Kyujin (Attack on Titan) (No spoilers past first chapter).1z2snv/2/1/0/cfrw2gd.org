Mongols were nomads with horses, and it's only abnormals who run as fast as galloping horse I'm pretty sure since the horses were barely outrunning the titans in the field. 4m etc would never be able to match the speed if the 15m ones that are abnormal can barely do it.

Now on episode 21 btw.

Still of the opinion that cannons are pointless and next to useless (got to hit the back of their neck so let us use something that takes forever to manuever).

Where are the regular armies, the legions etc because equip them with climbing axes and you'd take losses but you'd still kill some. If you lose 20 ordinary people for one titan I'm saying you still come out ahead since they don't breed.

Where the hell are the bows and crossbows for killing the vitals from distance?

I would have cavalry as a primary fighting force, armed with spears and bows for long range, nets, lances, tripwires to slow them and get them on the ground for your rare 3d guys.

Having long hair as a titan is still dumb as having it as a fighter, limiting your field of view.
