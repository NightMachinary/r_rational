  I agree with Carl's assumption that the leaders of the cult probably don't understand the signal. Claiming to do so gives them leverage over the members of their cult, which explains why they want to keep its true contents under wraps.

Or maybe they do understand the signal, enough to know that recording it onto a machine is a Really Bad Idea. Maybe they tried to scare away the viewpoint character for her own good, and her uploading the program has guaranteed that something horrific will soon happen. You ever read the SCP Foundation? Our hero could be about to unleash a doomsday-level memetic monster onto the world, yet she's so smugly assured of her own intelligence that she will never stop to consider that she might be in the wrong (until it's too late).

  I smile to myself. There's an even bigger hole in their plan: what will they do if I let that information go public? At that point, there's no incentive to kill me anymore. They will already have failed to keep the status quo, and killing me is unlikely to help them in facing the new situation.

Why is the viewpoint character assuming that the cultists she's dealing with are as rational as she is? Maybe they'll kill her out of spite. How does she know that killing her is unlikely to help their goals? Maybe they'll kill her because she's been linked to their weird Earth-signal monster. She has no idea what's going on - she doesn't even have definite proof that the person(s?) who broke into her home and drugged her really are connected to the cult. They could be someone else entirely: her evidence is purely circumstantial. She doesn't even know if they really were malicious! They might have been trying to initiate her into their cult, by finishing her journey to signal-comprehension via chemical aids. /She doesn't know./

For a character who is supposed to be rational, she seems pretty irrationally confident in her own judgement, especially when it comes to judging the character of people she's never met. She also seems irrationally ignorant of the scope of her own ignorance. She's just discovered that meditation enables one's brain to pick up an encoded signal produced by the Earth's electromagnetic field, and now there's potentially a weird meditation cult trying to stop her research, and at no point does she consider that she might be out of her depth. She could be a monkey dancing on the Elephant's Foot and not even know it.
