I would suggest posting snippets to the Friday Thread since off-topic postings are meant to go in there. Once you get to the point of sharing actual chapters or the entire story, then the Monday Thread would work just as well.

I don't think anyone will be bugged by you posting this as a top-level post this one time, just remember the Friday Thread for the next time. So there's no need to delete this for now.
