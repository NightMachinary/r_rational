The end of the story shows two different rational choices I've rarely see elsewhere. In one, [[#s][first spoiler]], and in the other, [[#s][second spoiler]] For the time it was written, the story was even a decent deconstruction of the whole 'Master PC' micro-genre, whose protagonists tended to resemble 'Steam Engine Time''s antagonist.

I will admit that, from the perspective of an LW reader, there's a lack of any interest in exploring Friendly/Unfriendly AI; which can probably be explained by being written before those concepts were much more than "Don't build SkyNet".
