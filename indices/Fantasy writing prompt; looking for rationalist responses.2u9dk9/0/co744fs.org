Methods of immortality or near-immortality have been known for a long time...there's the "cryohoppers" who wake up for a month or three every century to watch the world changing in freeze-frame; there's the Virts, who create copies of themselves in silicon and trade in a world of atoms for one of electrons; there's the Planters, who periodically buy a new body into which they can transplant their brain. (It's a method that is hard on the teenager who is purchased, but grants an excellent standard of living for their family.)

All of those methods have one thing in common: the law has a clear understanding of under what circumstances the person is alive or dead. The definition of life matters on every level of society: inheritance, voting rights, eligibility for office, competence hearings, and on and on.

Last week, Dr. Huron came forward to announce that he had perfected the process of nano-replacing a body in vivo -- the nanomachines replace one cell at a time until, after a few hours, your brain and body are composed entirely of self-repairing, infinitely regenerating nanotech instead of mortal flesh. There's no continuity flaw, no point at which the person ceases and the copy begins. Suddenly, all the legal structures have collapsed; are the new Nanos alive or dead? As one urgent example, the Chief Justices of the American State serve for life with no provision for removal, and one of them wants to be Nano'd; afterwards, would she still be eligible for office?

Huron has been summoned before the World Court to provide expert testimony on the life and death states of the Nano-folk. Given his long and respected career in both practical technology and medical ethics, Huron's views will have a great deal of influence in shaping the law going forward...the law that affects two trillion sophonts throughout the System.

Angry at what they expect his answer will be, a group of Conserves captured Huron and Virted him into an isolated system running an emulation of Hell. Every thousand subjective years, a warden will come to the Huron-Virt and say: "Explain your crime." If Huron can give an answer that satisfies them, and if he truly believes that answer, then they will put him back in his body and send him to his appointment before the World Court.

Such is the punishment of Dr. Huron, the man who gave us eternity.
