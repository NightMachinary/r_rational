First thing that came to mind was an advanced society who had suspended the dead in some sort of plastic equivalent of cryo.

Society collapses, immortality goes out of reach, humanity forgets the spark of enlightenment, and gradually from scraps of truth a mythology builds around the catacomb containing thousands men and women staring blankly from their plastiglass tombs...

(If we're getting technical though, we would probably avoid letting photons in, but you can hand wave around that for the cool factor)
