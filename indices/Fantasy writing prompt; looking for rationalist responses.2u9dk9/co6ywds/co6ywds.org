Separate responses:

- It's a simple tragedy; just because the authorities are wrong doesn't mean they can't do it.
- The elite take immortality for granted, but the serfs are banned from it. This is supposedly due to resource constraints, but it's just people being assholes like usual.
- A transhumanist figured out how to achieve immortality, but since she knows there's a punishment, she abstains from becoming immortal herself and is going around making other people immortal until the system breaks down.
- Heaven is real, it's actually wonderful, and becoming immortal prevents your future self from ever going there, so it's actually worse than murder.
