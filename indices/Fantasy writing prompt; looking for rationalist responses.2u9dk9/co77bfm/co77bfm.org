A futuristic retelling/version of /The Count of Monte Cristo/ in which the protagonist has plenty of time for self-improvement and planning. Either a hopeful one were the protagonist attempts to show his captors/guards (or maybe their descendants?) the error of their ways, or a more old-fashioned revenge tale in which the immortal hunts down his narrow-minded enemies.
