The sin isn't the immortality itself.

The price born of his arrogance led to the sin of sacrificing an untold number of lives to extend his lifespan unto the final end of all as the stolen life force exponentially multiplied in his body.

The ritual cannot be done without sacrificing what makes us human, for it twists the caster into a monster. Only a mind born without empathy would be left unchanged by the ritual. Even with willing sacrifices, the ritual is useless to us and is forbidden for this reason.

To fit the punishment to the crime, we entombed him in glass in a desolate location where he still lies to this very day. It is a pitiful existence as he suffers the same unchanging Oblivion he sentenced his victims to as well as the light of the outside showing him what his victims lost.

Listen child and understand that while immortality for all is a noble goal, to hoard it to oneself at the cost of others, already pitifully short, lifespan, is the greatest sin one can commit.
