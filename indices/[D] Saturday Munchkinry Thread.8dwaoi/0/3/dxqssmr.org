Remember me has a take on it.

I think the more likely scenario than what dontnod (dev of above game) came up with is that everyone would torrent around/upvote memories until the biggest, best orgasm anyone's ever head floats up to the top and then most people would just wirehead all day long and society would collapse. That doesn't make for a very fun game though.

Alternatively, this would become a new type of drug and all the other memory experiences would become a new form of media where companies compete to provide the most thrilling memories while staying below the legal limit of an orgasm.

Alternatively, someone comes up with a latent virus and sends it around along with a memory of an orgasm. Then you either have the book snow crash or collapse of society.
