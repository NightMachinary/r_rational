It would be more like a memory of an orgasm. You would just know how it felt to the original. So there would be less risk of addiction.

I like the idea of it anyhow. It would be much easier to understand drugs and how they feel. And how other people feel in their bodies. I would like to know how it feels to smoke a cigarette or use heroin and what is harder to come clean. But I don't like to smoke for months to find out. ;-)

I read the plot of remember me, and it doesn't sound like it. (And I probably spoiled the movie for me.)
