Nice

I don't think (most) government could stop the technology. Of course they will regulate it (safety protocols, and forbidden/restricted skills like howtokill-martial arts or lockpicking)

But think of it more like Gutenbergs mechanicle printing. Your company would just be the only one selling books.

And democratic government shouldn't force inprint people. But still offer it as education, without propaganda/biases if possible. The single mind in billions is something I want to avoid, so no direct mind control.

I think "complete skill packages" like you are describing, wouldn't be efficient. More data/skills means more needs to be trained at once. (Remember in Matrix Neo still has to train.) But schools were you could buy into courses that goes through one skill at a time would be nice. I like your idea of a company that sells the 'best' skills. With the right marketing they could have a good markup. And people could buy skills and say they are from Company. Like a iPhone or more like a prestige college.

It would be very hard to inforce copyright. Since people could just copy their Company skills and resell them Government regulation would be needed for that.
