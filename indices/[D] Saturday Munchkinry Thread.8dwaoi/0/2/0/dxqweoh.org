Oh, sorry. I didn't mean you would think they are your memories. It is more like reading a book/watching a movie/playing a game of someone else's memory. Most know those aren't their own memories.

But nice idea anyway. Lot's of potential. (Still not many would behave like in GTA, if they could feel the collisions and the pain or exhaustion.;-) ) But a memory of a person threatening your loved ones could do the trick. Or getting orders to spy on someone and then getting the orders to kill them.
