Hey thanks for the reply, I hope, I can answer what I was thinking about that scenario.

#+begin_quote
  There's a lot hinging on the requirements; for instance is the hardware expensive or otherwise resource constrained,
#+end_quote

Not too expansive, I think, maybe the hardware is as expansive as cars. 600€ cars exist (they will break soon, and many other drawbacks), middle prize (gets an upload in maybe 10min-1h) and expensive ones too (to be 10% faster, price doubles).

  or can you grab a random baby off the street and stuff their brains full of kung fu. Is there a diminishing returns to the skills, or acclimatisation period? In Matrix Neo knew kung fu, but he still needed time to actualise the knowledge, so while the transfer was pretty much instantaneous, there was still an adaptation period to fully utilise the skill.
#+end_quote

I would say, it works like in the Matrix. You upload it and then have to train it/your body, depending on the skill/knowledge. And let's just say babies wouldn't remember it/their brain would get fried.

  Where do skills come from? As in, do I pour a dozen ‘X for Dummies', ‘Advanced X for Dummies', and so on books into a magical skill renderer, or do I need to grab a master in X and (perhaps destructively) extract the skill from their skull mush? Are skills completely replicable, are there a limited amount of copies/transfers per source, or does the upload of a skill use up the skill source? All these will impact the resulting society, but in drastically different ways.
#+end_quote

Creating a skill can be done in two ways. You could create it from nothing, with describing how all the kung fu moves work. (Problems like maybe impossible moves, and more time is needed to train and adapt it to your body. It is preferred to do this for knowledge.) Or you scan people using that skill. (Which is easier to do for skills, but the skills may be incomplete or mixed with other stuff or so much adapted, that the kung fu move only works for that body with that weight. So they may use more than one source.) And near unlimited copies/transfers.

For example, you copy swimming from one athlete who can also hold his breath for ~5min. You judge now a flooded hallway, if you can dive through it with his downloaded expertise and can't make it through, cause you are not in his body and being slower and not able to hold your breath for that long.

Oh, and a defective skill/knowledge maybe only gives a headache. And you couldn't access it, cause it is defective.

So maybe 'X for Dummies' might be more like 'X for untrained'.

I'm not sure what you mean with talent. If you mean, that some people have better bodies for running, than I agree. Or maybe better fine control of their hands, so they can draw better. What society calls talent, is some form of an inherent trait, that isn't biological (Like heigth, or bigger lungs or being not right handed, thinner blood vessels... ). I think outside of advantages, like height, talent is mostly training (which can be done for fun). I had a classmate that could draw dinos better with 10 than most I know can draw anything. But he draw since he was very little for fun. The time I watched TV, he would draw. I was good with numbers. I liked to add numbers mentioned in ads for fun.

Also, I think at some point of skill level, it is hard to distinguish who is better (or more talented). For example you don't need to be a super genius to play tic-tac-toe to never lose.

But I like your idea of talent searching phase for school. Maybe with the difference, that they would look for skills, that would get them paid the most. (Being the only trash collector, can get you more money, than being a doctor like 50% of the population. Or the master skill to draw is less paid, than the average skill to work excel.) Or just for skills for a job they would like, that pays enough.

Since the creation of skills is not destructive, nor is it to harsh restricted the last scenarios don't work. Still I think there would be a blackmarket (more like dark web) for restricted skills like lockpicking or how to kill. And skill loans has also potential.

  Again, a whole lot of potential to explore here. The whole concept of skill uploads is a bit like Asimov's Robot Laws; ostensibly simple, yet surprisingly facetted.
#+end_quote

I know, I can't believe nobody found that technology in the matrix as awesome as I. The reality bending power is clearly impossible, but we could make memory editing a real thing. (Of course dark city does raise some questions about how ethical that is. But the movie goes more into identity.)

#+begin_quote
  Damn. The more I think on this, the more I want to write it.
#+end_quote

Just write about it, I would like to see more stuff about it. In LitRPG you see people getting knowledge of magical abilities or other skill by just leveling up (or rarely investing skill points) and there is no one thinking of using that. Or in DND you can put false memories into someone, but no teacher uses it for good. (Well, I recently read Aeromancer, and one who could do that, says it was stupid, all are afraid of mind control.)
