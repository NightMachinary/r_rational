I think the rich would even pay people with the same body type to train in the skill they need/want.

Some of my ideas:

- Engineers could just become experts i other fields if they need it for work.

- Workers may be required to upload relevant skills, when they leave the company.

- There would be less dogmatic religions. And those would try to give you their edited holy texts as a download. (There are probably some crazy cults too, cause there are always crazy cults.)

- there would be many self-help stuff. That probably doesn't help more than books from today.

- there would be many prank skills, like How to punch through a wall, (like the scale apps for your phone)

- I would like to think, humanity as a whole would be nicer, cause they can download memories of people in war zones, but not even I am that optimistic.

- Not sure how much entertainment memories are. I rarely remember a good meal, when I could just eat one. But I think some form would be made.

- debates could be fundamentally altered, and the debaters give you their arguments as a download.

- And politics too. The voter can be an expert on everything and check polices too. There would be probably more than one scandal of politicians giving away highly biased (or even lying) downloads.
