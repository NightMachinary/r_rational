There's a lot hinging on the requirements; for instance is the hardware expensive or otherwise resource constrained, or can you grab a random baby off the street and stuff their brains full of kung fu. Is there a diminishing returns to the skills, or acclimatisation period? In /Matrix/ Neo knew kung fu, but he still needed time to actualise the knowledge, so while the transfer was pretty much instantaneous, there was still an adaptation period to fully utilise the skill. Where do skills come from? As in, do I pour a dozen ‘X for Dummies', ‘Advanced X for Dummies', and so on books into a magical skill renderer, or do I need to grab a master in X and (perhaps destructively) extract the skill from their skull mush? Are skills completely replicable, are there a limited amount of copies/transfers per source, or does the upload of a skill use up the skill source? All these will impact the resulting society, but in drastically different ways.

That being said, a couple scenarios:

The vast majority of work force will switch to day labourers, if for any given position anyone can do the job. If anyone can have the skill to do anything, the skill of anyone doing anything will take a backseat to their willingness to work.

Alternatively, there may be synergy advantages that aren't immediately apparent. If anyone can do anything, the teamwork cohesion may be a much bigger factor than anyone's ability (or inability) to do a job. Expect any entrance test to be much more about the interviewees personality, and how well they will fit and comply to the expected position on a team or company.

*Skill =/= Talent*. The majority of work will be done by peons for minimum wage, since everyone is replaceable, but the real moneymaker will be those with certain talents. Anyone can manage people / program apps / bake cake decently well, but if you're a natural born talent, you will be that much better at it. View it as a multiplier of some kind, normal people all have 1, but talented people will have 1.1 or 5 or something in the skillset they're talented in. Depending on the skillset, this will reflect in their wage. A talented manager being 1.1 times as good as any other run-of-the-mill manager will make the more money, the more they can make use of their advantage. A similarly talented manager in a small company versus large company would safe the bigger one more money, and could therefore expect a that much higher wage, even though they're not actually better than the similarly talented manager in the smaller company. The more you can leverage your talent, the more you'll be worth and above the peons.

Kind of like cutie marks, except not.

Interestingly enough this would incentivise talent search massively, especially early on in one's life. People would change skills as quickly as often until they found something they would be better at than average, maybe merely marginally so.

On the other hand, if the *upload of skills is limited*, be that resources, capability, or time, spending the limiting factor to find one's talent will be a sign of status. Particularly since I don't expect people to only have one talent, but to be mostly on a spectrum for everything skillable. Imagine a rich person (that is, someone with a significant talent, or child/relative/protégée of such a person) idly jacking up skills to find a hobby and discarding things they have ‘only' minor talents in, while a peon with a minor talent in cleaning or some such is cleaning up the neighbouring room. The latter could be the next Mozart, but never had the resources to try for the less numerous (but still well-paying) skill and just stuck with the first skill they had /some/ talent in, regardless of the magnitude of the talent.

Damn. The more I think on this, the more I want to write it.

*Another scenario*: Assume harsh restriction on the skill. Either it takes a lot of money, or time (but still less than actual training), or the brain can deal with uploading skills only for very few times (reminded of /Rainbows End/ here...). Past a certain point school may very well be a tasting ground for a big variety of skills, all to be trained to some small level, and then rigorously tested to ascertain if they have a talent for it, or simply enjoy it, and only then will the skill be uploaded. Instead of paying off student loans everyone will pay off skilling loans, and there will be quite a few people who are good at something, but don't particularly enjoy it; false positive, for whom the skill selected was wrong, and they'll be stuck with a skill they're not good in and a big dept to pay off.

Or *destructive scanning*: Master Miyagi is dead, but hey, at least you know kung fu, right? If the thusly acquired skill can be copied there'll be a flourishing black market in skills less than legally acquired, but there'll also be a big market for mastering useful skills and bequeathing the earnings.

Again, a whole lot of potential to explore here. The whole concept of skill uploads is a bit like Asimov's Robot Laws; ostensibly simple, yet surprisingly facetted.
