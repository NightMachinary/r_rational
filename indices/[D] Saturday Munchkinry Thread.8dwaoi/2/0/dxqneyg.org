Explain my power to NASA.

An implication: while in orbit, negating gravity is equivalent to imparting a 1G upwards acceleration to an object (as it tries to fly away from the Earth on a tangent line).

I would convince them to make me an astronaut so I can use my power to boost the ISS to a higher orbit--a necessary part of station keeping--for free. By negating gravity at different parts of the ship I can affect its rotation as well, essentially tipping the station by accelerating one side away from the Earth. That would also be useful for station keeping.

It would be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISS_Propulsion_Module][cost effective.]]
