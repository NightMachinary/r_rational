Whenever you hold your breath, you have the ability to negate/nullify gravity for a total mass equal to twice your own body mass. You must be touching an object to affect it. You do not have to nullify your own mass. What do you do?

Example usage: negate gravity for yourself and a battery powered fan you're holding. Fly ludicrously while taking quick gulps of air.
