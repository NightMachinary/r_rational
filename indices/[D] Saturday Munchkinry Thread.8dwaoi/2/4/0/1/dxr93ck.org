Make a flywheel with two weights that weigh twice as much as you on either end. They have small extensions toward the center that allow you to touch them easily. Attach the axle to a generator. Spin it.

Energy output is the potential energy lost by the weight falling (the one that currently isn't weightless). That means you can get more power with a bigger flywheel or--crucially--a faster flywheel. Spin it a few thousand RPMs by rapidly flashing your power and your power output could be considerable.
