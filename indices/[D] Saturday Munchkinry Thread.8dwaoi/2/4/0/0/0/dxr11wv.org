That doesn't really work. A standard electric generator converts kinetic energy into electrical energy. Your ability doesn't create kinetic energy, it just prevents the kinetic energy that is already there from being converted into gravitational potential energy. As a result, your ability doesn't actually create more kinetic energy for the generator to convert. You would get about the same amount of energy output just by plugging the battery of your fan directly into the generator output.

Now, if you negate gravity while going upwards, and then use normal gravity to accelerate downwards, that could be used to generate energy. But considering the limitations of earth gravity and twice your body mass, I doubt you would get a lot of energy this way (at least, relative to a power plant).
