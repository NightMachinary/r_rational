Realistically you probably just use this power to become absurdly rich and famous for having superpowers and use your wealth to invest heavily into anti-aging tech (and try to stay really healthy).

If you live long enough to see a technological singularity then your ability could be used to generate arbitrary amounts of energy (by having your body changed into a galaxy spanning megastructure) thus allowing post-human civilization to not only avoid the heat death of the universe but continue expanding indefinitely.
