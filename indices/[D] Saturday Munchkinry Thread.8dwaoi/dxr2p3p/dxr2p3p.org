You gain the ability to use a save state in real life. At any point you can choose to save or load, where loading reverts reality to the last point you saved while maintaining your current memories and consciousness. The ability also has a fail-safe of automatically loading when your brain activity stops (i.e. you died) but you can choose to disable this at any point to avoid being perpetually trapped in your final moments. It's worth noting that you have no way of moving your save point /backwards/ in time from it's current position and that butterfly effects from your actions and quantum randomness will cause events to unfold increasingly differently with time. What would you do with this ability?
