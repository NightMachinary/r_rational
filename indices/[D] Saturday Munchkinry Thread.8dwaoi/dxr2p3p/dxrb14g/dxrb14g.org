1. Worry about my power basically killing everyone and replacing them with younger versions of themselves.

2. Ultimately fall to temptation and use the power anyway.

3. +Kill myself from guilt.+ Realize that in a world with something as absurd as time travel, there are almost certainly also afterlives, and thus there is no escape.

4. Attempt to reduce guilt by rationalizing that other people, given this power, would also abuse the hell out of it.

5. Desperately hope that this is some form of time travel that doesn't kill the old timeline, such as having infinitely many parallel worlds.

6. Worry that I'm now singlehandedly responsible for creating an entirely new timeline, and thus all the sentient beings within it, every time I load a save state.

7. +Wish that I had never been granted such a power.+ Realize that such a wish would effectively cause more time travel to occur and thus result in more sentient beings created and/or destroyed.

8. Give up on not hurting anyone and just keep abusing the power, desperately hoping to pull a karma Houdini and never be punished.
