it pretty much depends on the willingness of the government to let a company commercialize the technology, of if the government tries to regulate it.

In the first case, and if I was the company accomplished this feat, I would probably start by collecting complementary "samples" from highly skilled people in order to build a "complete skill package". Once an "up-to-date" package is constituted, I would maintain different versions for increasing prices. And perhaps develop a "premium membership" where each subscriber can get updated regularly.

Of course I would try to maintain my monopoly for a time, and I would /obviously/ not include this technology in the package I sell, but with that much super-intelligent people around, the secret would not be long hidden.

But at that point, I would have ensured an exclusive agreement with the greatest minds of the time in order to offer the best "data package" any company can offer.

I am not sure about the second case. Uploading a full-package to everyone would definitely upset the balance of power, and even then we would probably have to wait for each citizen to reach majority for their personalities to "set in", or we would basically have a single mind in billions of bodies.
