Now that I think about it, skill download is the in-universe mechanic for levelling up in Eve Online. Well, â€˜levelling' is more appropriate; all players are basically limited to skill uploads, and the process can range in duration from a couple minutes to months, depending on how far along the 5-step ladder you are and what the difficulty of the skill is.

/Talent/ was just a name to call what skill people would be good at regardless. To take your dino dude; he may or may not have talent, but he has joy in what he does and therefore put in the work to get good at it. But regardless of that, people are different, and I feel this would need to be reflected in some quality. The saying is, one needs to do something for 10,000 hours to be good at it. But I surmise that's an average; there'll be people who'll be good at it in 5,000 hours, while others will take 30,000. That's one way to view talent, a predisposition to get good at something. Even if everyone had access to downloadable skills, the moment they start using it, they'll get experience in it. Some will have an easier time to make use of the skill, others will have more trouble because they're innately not predisposed to it.

You mentioned body, and in your example people with the means to get many downloads would have a big incentive to keep fit and limber, to make the most of general skills. If you have the means you could look exclusively for skills that fit your dimensions; instead of downloading /Karate (General)/ you'd look for (and also pay more for) /Karate ([Insert body type], [Insert height], [Insert fitness level])/. In this example there'd be a decent market for people who downloaded general karate to physically train the skill until they're of sufficient proficiency, and then to offer the same skill, but individualised to /Karate (lean body, 160 cm, low fitness)/ or something.
