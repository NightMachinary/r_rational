Uploading memories is extremely abusable. Sure it doesn't let you mind control someone directly, but the only limit to your mind control is your creativity (and your ability to create the appropriate memory uploads). For example, I could upload the following memories to some victim X:

- Memories of another person's life, in a world similar to our own but with better technology.
- Memories of playing a virtual reality game where the virtual reality is indistinguishable from our reality, and the player gains memories of their character whenever they log in.
- Memories of gaining the memories of the actual life of X.

This could lead X to believe that he is in a virtual reality game, and that his real memories are simply the memories of his character. I can then manipulate his actions by changing the game objectives. For instance, I could make him think that this world is a virtual reality Grand Theft Auto game, and thus prompt him to go on missions like killing people I choose and robbing banks.
