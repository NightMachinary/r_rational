Evidently, you could make your population completely educated at a masters level in every subject at an extremely young age.

Depending on the speed of upload (same rate as the Matrix?), unpleasantness and other limitations, but if memories can be uploaded why not upload entire lives of experience, especially the lives of extremely intelligent people?

You'd on one hand gain a form of mind-copying-immortality for very intelligent people (or anyone who knows or pays someone to accept their memories), but all in all everyone could potentially have hundreds of lives of experience to draw from, and make choices with the benefit of the very best experts in any subject, much like how we today can watch youtube series by the very best educators on a particular subject whereas before we'd be limited to whoever taught it at our school.

Hard to imagine how this would affect society, but I imagine whoever got the tech first would become an economic powerhouse of extremely valued hypercompetent citizens, though it's also possible some stagnation may happen as people are trained with the memories of older people that are set in their ways.

A profession would likely open up where one would be manually educated in subjects so that they may sell their memories of the new lessons that humanity has learned (in addition to the memories of the people that made the new discoveries, including the step-by-step process and their own feelings on what happened).

Altogether, I imagine it would be a /lot/ harder to control these people against their will and in many ways you'd get a singularity effect that would leave society unrecognizable to anyone who was not brought up in it.
