It doesn't need to invert it! Canceling it is sufficient. That's the beauty. Of course, canceling it is an inversion of sorts.

The ISS has a large velocity in some direction. Earth's gravity accelerates the mass toward the earth, bending that vector. It's in free fall, though, so nothing inside the ISS notices. Anything suddenly unaffected by Earth's gravity that's in orbit would fly off--which from inside the ISS would look like an acceleration away from the Earth. The object would hit the side of the ISS and start trying to pull it up with it because it still has inertia, even if gravity is ignoring it.

To think of it another way: suppose I use my power on myself, and I'm floating. Then a friend drops a rock out of a window. If I catch it and don't use my power on it, does it pull me down? Do I slow its fall, because it has to accelerate me? Then the rock is experiencing a force from interacting with me, even though I was only floating, and that force is opposite the direction of gravity.
