Yes. It's the First Law of Thermodynamics: Energy can neither be created nor destroyed.

There are ways to get around it, like changing mass into energy, but that doesn't happen in a normal electrical generator. You can also create gravitational potential energy out of nothing using your ability by sending something upwards while negating its gravity, but unless you also do strange things like going to a black hole or increasing your body mass to a ridiculous extent, the energy created by your power will be limited to a relatively small amount of energy compared to what is produced in power plants.
