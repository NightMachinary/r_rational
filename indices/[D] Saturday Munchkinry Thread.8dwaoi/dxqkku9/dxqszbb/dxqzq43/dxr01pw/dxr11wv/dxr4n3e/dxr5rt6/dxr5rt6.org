No, because KE is still being converted into electrical energy.

When an electrical generator creates electricity, that electrical energy doesn't spawn out of nothing, an equal amount of kinetic energy has to be removed from whatever magnet is looping around inside it.

So if you tried to continuously accelerate in a closed loop without a magnet: that will work. But if you try that with the magnet and the generator, you will notice that the magnet is pulling you backwards, slowing you down.
