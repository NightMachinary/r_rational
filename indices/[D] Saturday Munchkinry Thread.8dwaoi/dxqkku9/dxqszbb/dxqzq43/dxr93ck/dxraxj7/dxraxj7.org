  Spin it a few thousand RPMs by rapidly flashing your power and your power output could be considerable.

A few thousand (3000) RPMs = 50 Rotations per second = 100 applications of your power per second. And you can't mess up any one of them, otherwise you would apply your power on the wrong weight and thus lose energy instead of gaining it. That's...

That's...

...actually doable if the power is automatic. Huh. You just need to touch the center, and make it such that the weights disconnect from the center before falling and reconnect before rising.

Worth researching what your power accepts as the definition of an object and its detection speed. Wonder what the power output would be.
