How would you become an infinite energy source though? Nullifying the gravity of two times your body mass doesn't immediately strike me as a method of generating large amounts of energy. The energy would be "free", but the production would be too low to make a significant impact on your life or the world.

Unless... you fatten yourself up to a ridiculous amount. Heck more than that, grow body parts in vitro and then surgically insert them into yourself ad infinitum, rapidly increasing your own body mass far beyond human limits and thus increasing the amount of mass you can nullify gravity on.
