Quick question: Negate gravity means Earth's gravity doesn't affect me? Because there's a bit of leeway, like, I'm now actively repelled by Earth, or actively repelled by everything in the solar system, or actively repelled by everything in the universe, and there a lot of scenarios where I go /splat/.

So assuming local gravity is annulled, not inverted, meaning I can make double my mass weightless. Hm...

Okay, another question, does that mean I have to be part of the gravity annulment, or can I annul a crate double my mass and move that while merrily walking on the ground? If this is the case, follow up: what's the distance limitation? Touch?
