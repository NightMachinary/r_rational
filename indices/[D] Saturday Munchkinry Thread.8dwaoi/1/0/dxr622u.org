Sure reminds me of /that timeline splitter from worm/ in a few ways -- you're most vulnerable when you make a save state. This imposes a few ground rules, such as

- Don't get drunk/high in fear of accidentally setting your point
- Don't move your point forwards unless you've reached the state you're assigning yourself to a few times, and are confident that it's safe
- In timelines for which you intend to advance your save point, avoid alerting anyone about the nature of your ability until after your save.

In general, if you play your cards right, you can become president / immortal / damm near anything. Just set a save point when you turn 5 years old or so, and live a hundred lives. It would be worth it to investigate if there are others with this (or any) supernatural powers, and if so, understand their powers well. I would be most concerned about people who can disable or steal your power, as well as those who could force you to move your save point. Otherwise, in most cases, a problem can be disappeared by a simple rollback of time (this is inconvenient if this runthrough is 50 years in the making)

Save scum the stock market, halt natural disasters, fund promising research, give advance knowledge to researchers to accelerate their work. I could convince my parents that I'm competent at 5, if I had todays mind! Depending on how the mind interacts with the younger body, it might be worth going farther back even. If you do everything right, you'll have functionally unlimited money. Use this money to hire huge teams of individuals to compose the absolute optimal encoding of the information you want to send back to your "past" self. Hire specalist tutors whose lifes work is teaching you this message. Each time, when you arrive back in your 5yo body, write down as much of that information as you can remember.

Just a little bit of bootstrapping, and you can accumulate a tremendous amount money using stock market and lottery future information. Now we're cooking with gas.

Each time you pass through life, doing this optimal encoding, provided that you are satisfied with this pass, you write down all of that information and advance your save point by a day or two (however long it takes for you to write everything down), afterwards going on to live the next life. Essentially, you have become a future information pump, devoting an entire lifetime into sending back a few hundred pages worth of written content.

Concerns would mostly revolve around other people with powers, and shadowy governmental agencies getting on your case. For this reason, it might be important to try and hide the nature of your powers. Part of this would surely involve doing as many iterations as possible without alerting your 5yo parents that you have this power, or without them alerting the rest of the world that you do. That would be somewhat tricky, but winning the lottery for them or making impossible stock predictions, might help.
