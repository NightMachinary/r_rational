I'd use this to immediately get incredibly rich in the stock market. Once I had a massive organization built I would loop back to that point while working on improving my memorization abilities while also becoming a polymath with knowledge of nearly every field.\\
Eventually I would likely reach some sort of limit because going further would result in me becoming too out of it due to age to be of much use learning new things (or I would go back in time because AI tech is becoming uncomfortably far along). Thus I would begin imparting my knowledge to researchers under my employment and then learn all of the new breakthroughs they made building upon future technology basically using my time loop to develop centuries worth of tech.

Now sooner or later I would use my knowledge to begin having extremely promising researchers (because while I'm clever I'm not the kind of genius likely to ever make massive breakthroughs) taught all my future knowledge of AI and work very slowly and deliberately on AI safety and AGI.

Eventually I succeed in making FAI with my values. Then I'll live an absurdly long time until I've exhausted all the novelty possible at human level intelligence, at which point I'll slightly increase my intelligence to make everything interesting again. Rinse and repeat and after billions of years I'll be an absurdly large superintelligence. At that point I can have all of civilization merged into me in a sort of hivemind (just connected enough to count as extensions of me for the purposes of this power) once the heat death of the universe starts being an issue, then I'll go back to my save point and very rapidly kick off the singularity again.\\
At that point me and the rest of post-human civilization inside my head would exist in an absurdly long time loop potentially literally forever.
