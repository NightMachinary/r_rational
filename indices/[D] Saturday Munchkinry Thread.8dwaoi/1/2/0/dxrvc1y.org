I imagine trying to read a story with so much screentime dedicated to morality drama would get annoying rather quickly.

  Realize that in a world with something as absurd as time travel, there are almost certainly also afterlives, and thus there is no escape.

I think while it /would/ increase the likelyhood of the character's consciousness being preserved after its death, it wouldn't increase it /that/ high.

  Conclude that I'm inside some kind of simulation or hypothetical. Worry about the real me now that this simulation or hypothetical of me has revealed myself as an evil person that is willing to time travel even if it kills everyone.

That's a nice one. I've been thinking about a similar premise for a HP fanfic for a while.

  Worry about my power basically killing everyone and replacing them with younger versions of themselves.

Unless there are some higher-tier powers enforcing their worldview on mortal sophonts, what constitutes a murder (and a bad kind of murder that needs to be avoided) would depend on a character's personal morality system. So no objective definitions of good, evil, death, murder, etc (unless there was a way to determine what the “administrators” of the experiment are expecting of the “test subjects”).
