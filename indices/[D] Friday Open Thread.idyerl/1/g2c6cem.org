A question about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings][Christchurch mosque shootings]] in New Zealand. My understanding of their justice system is limited.

 

Having just shot around 100 people in front of countless more witnesses, this guy was arrested on his way to a third mosque, driving a car full of guns covered in holy war scribbles, after posting a terrorist manifesto to twitter and various politicians and media outlets, and /livestreaming the first shooting on facebook/.

He's declared mentally fit to stand trial, and charged with 51 murders, 40 attempted murders, and engaging in a terrorist act. And /he pleads not guilty/.

 

Now, I understand the strategy in a normal case. You have much to gain and little to lose, might as well give it a try. Maybe there isn't in fact quite enough evidence to convict beyond reasonable doubt (or whatever the local standard is), maybe there was a legal fuckup during evidence collection that makes it ineligible, maybe the prosecutor is throwing everything at the wall and you expect some things not to stick.

But. This is like /the/ open-and-shut case that prosecutors dream about. There is no room for reasonable doubt, unreasonable doubt, or drunk shit-stirring troll doubt. At best maybe some of the 40 attempted murder charges might get thrown out, I don't know how they were picked - but this guy is getting life in prison whether or not he intended to spare the Christian janitor or whatever. AFAICT the only thing that a not-guilty plea gets him is a long, exhausting, often boring, emotionally charged trial with a foregone conclusion.

 

So why did he plead not guilty?

I couldn't find any explanation in media reporting. A few months ago, the killer actually changed his plea to guilty on all charges (including all the attempted murders), but the reaction of the press and involved people was surprise and puzzlement rather than "well, duh."
