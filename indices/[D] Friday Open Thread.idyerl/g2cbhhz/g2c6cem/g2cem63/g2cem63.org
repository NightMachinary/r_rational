  So why did he plead not guilty?
#+end_quote

If you can't understand someone's actions, you are using the wrong frame.

#+begin_quote
  Now, I understand the strategy in a normal case.
#+end_quote

I'm making an assumption here, but it really seems like you are thinking about with a "criminal who is trying to get away with crime" sort of frame.

#+begin_quote
  AFAICT the only thing that a not-guilty plea gets him is a long, exhausting, often boring, emotionally charged trial with a foregone conclusion.
#+end_quote

What if that's the goal? This is someone who has been very clear on his motivations. He knows the media coverage someone like him would get. There are plenty of possibilities/reasons for a terrorist to put a not-guilty plea.

- Lack of guilt. He believes his victims deserve it/his actions were just.
- Call for action/Call for awareness. Similar to above, seeking to affirm similar beliefs or to make others aware of his "righteous" cause.
- Deny authority. He doesn't believe the government has the authority to judge him, or he denies the justness of their laws.
- Anger the victim's families. As you said, this is an open and shut case. It is basically guaranteed he will be going to prison for the rest of his life. Why not drag out the period before prison and cause as much suffering to those he hates?
- Waste everyone's time. Same thing as above.

  but the reaction of the press and involved people was surprise and puzzlement
#+end_quote

This is because they were surprised by his not guilty plea initially. They realized he must have had some angle he was working.

Then suddenly, he changes his plea without a reason. It could be a sudden change of heart, but it is more likely he found a better angle. After he fired his lawyers and chose to represent himself, it seems they suspected he was trying for a call for action/awareness and are taking steps to mitigate it.
