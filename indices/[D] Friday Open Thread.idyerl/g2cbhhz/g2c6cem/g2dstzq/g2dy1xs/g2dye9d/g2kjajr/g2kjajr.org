Really? I find "figuring out the rules" sections to be pretty fun to read. It's kind of the ideal of this subreddit, honestly.

The other side of the coin here is Jumpchain fiction, which does have all the rules and perks already decided from the start, and I'm not sure it makes for a more engaging story.
