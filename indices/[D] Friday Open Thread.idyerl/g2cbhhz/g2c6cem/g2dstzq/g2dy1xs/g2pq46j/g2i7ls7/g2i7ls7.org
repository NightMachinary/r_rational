You're right, opening a story with a block of pure rules would be an unwelcome slog. But I think that makes doing so anyway a bit of an interesting writing challenge

Off the top of my head, it might work if there's an existing party and this isn't their first time being isekai'd into a new litRPG. So they already have a systematic approach to learning the rules of their new world, which gives them an excuse to know how to prioritize important info. And it gives the author a wider variety of stuff to introduce - characters, their existing relationships, anecdotes about their previous adventures, their system for understanding RPG systems, and the system itself.
