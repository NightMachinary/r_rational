Problems:

1. Most readers only have so much patience for pure unadulterated rules-talk.

2. Most readers want a bit of interesting system stuff every few chapters at least. If you reveal all the mechanics from the start, you've kind of blown your load.

/Worth the Candle/ is my go-to example of litRPG done right (damn near perfectly), and I do not think it would have been improved by front-loading full documentation of all the skills & bonuses.
