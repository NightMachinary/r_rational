On how to edit: It helps to put some days between the writing and a second pass, to get emotional distance from your words and get your brain into a different task loop. Awkward sentences and poorly portrayed thoughts can be improved, and if systematic refactoring looks necessary, it can be done.

On how to write: This is one of those things that should have universally been taught in school but wasn't: the foundation of all widely appealing writing is the tribe. The human brain is designed for social interactions. If your heroine doesn't have opinions and feelings about her minions and they to her, that'd be a lot of gravy left on the table. (There's a reason characters are introduced slowly, and why there only ever seems to be ~12 people that ever exist in the world in fiction.)

A terminally clichÃ©d line of the events you describe for example: Girl gets isekai'd -> discovers she can summon monsters, cool! -> discovers her first monster is a giant rat -> she doesn't like rats and is grossed out by it, tells it to stay far away -> meets some people, asks them for help -> they're silent, but she doesn't run away due to ignorance, and doesn't go on a killing spree because she's not a murder hobo -> one of them stabs her -> rat bites her attacker -> they run away, the scavengers are too weak to keep up -> she still doesn't like rats ---> the rat is now the protagonist!

But anyway, this isn't for profit so you don't have to conform to template. Don't do things because you think other people will like them (even if that person is me), do it because you like them.
