You make a great point.

The summoner (separate from the main character controlling her summons) is also very weak and vulnerable at the moment, yet other than her hiding in a ditch and not yet being noticed, hasn't suffered any on screen risk. Some kind of scene where the main character had to control her summons to protect her from death as she summoned more as fast as she could would add a lot more action, and would prevent the hostile cannibals from feeling so dumb or blind as to be incapable of finding someone who has no actual stealth skills.

Also, going after the summoner instead of the infinite summons is a tactic I think I learned from my dad in grade school playing Bard's Tale 2: It's not so advanced at least some of the cannibals shouldn't make the connection and at least try it.

Summed up, I think my problem is that foes on screen haven't been intelligent enough yet, so in retrospect it is no wonder it seemed slow paced. Thank you very much for helping me realize that.
