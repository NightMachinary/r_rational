Under the category: "Tropes I'd like to see go away" I'm going to add:

Poor / No documentation for the LitRPG system you suddenly find yourself thrust into.

Is there a single LitRPG out there that does come with documentation? A starter manual? Online help?

The only exceptions to this are the LitRPGs that are based on D&D or another popular system, and even then it relies on the player MC to already have considerable experience with the system.
