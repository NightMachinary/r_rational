It's a bit old so the answer is probably yes, but have you played A Dark Room? That game changes its underlying system a couple times, which might keep things fresh.

Other games in that genre that do the same are Candy Box (I don't think this has a mobile version though) and Kittens Game (massive timesink warning though).
