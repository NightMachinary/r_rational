  The Count cackles insanely as he prepares to send a fireball your way. You're helpless to do anything about it. "Now you shall taste TRUE torture, whelp!"

    Roxane Kezaar says "Wait, pause the game! PAUSE!"

  Suddenly, you find yourself in a large room with a massive CRT monitor in front of you. A man stands next to you, holding a giant stopwatch on a chain.

    Roxane Kezaar says "Oh hey, I was expecting just a text menu or something. This is some fancy UI work."

  The man nods. "Thank you. We spent a lot of time and money on this project, we wanted to make sure the graphics were just right.

  You nod.

    Roxane Kezaar says "Well the graphics are fine, it's the plot that needs work. Anyway, since we're on pause, I'd like to edit my character sheet and give myself fire immunity."
