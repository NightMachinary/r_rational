What is the a good way to self edit a story before reaching out for more public constructive criticism? I'd want to ask for review of my story, where the vague idea behind the story is 'What if Isekai LitRPG, but the main character is controlling multiple summons instead of being an individual.' But after starting at chapter 0, I'm in the middle of chapter 3 and the pacing seems much too off. It's all much too slow. But one of the reasons the pacing is off is because I'm trying to add more details, because I see a lot of complaints about how people do LitRPG and don't actually have any of the details mean anything.

But on the other hand, if you actually have someone start at the very bottom in a stat sense, you have a lot of 'learning how to not die instantly' except since the characters dying are summons, you CAN have them die instantly and continue the main characters meta-learning and the story. So there is some 'And that one was hit by a sneak attack and died, and that one was hit by a sneak attack and died, and that one ate food without leveling up their sense of taste and died, and those 4 DID manage to kill a cannibal who was going for an attack, but 3 of them died.'

Another problem is describing people so low on the stat scale seriously makes a lot of the early conflict being described as between people with stunted growth who are terribly thin and have no armor/barely any weapons of any kind, which feels realistic to their given stats, but off in terms of actual reading.

It also seems similar to another story I wrote years ago, which also had a slow start with a weak character and got a 1 positive to 10 negative review reaction that at the time made me decide to unpublish it. I probably have a somewhat thicker skin now, but I don't want to get a bunch of negative reactions if I can fix some of the problems myself in editing.
