The main thing that jumps out at me is that there needs to be stakes. If the main character has infinite summons, then there's the risk that he can just chuck summons at the problem until it goes away.

It depends on what vibe you're going for. It could be a desperate scramble to survive and find out the information ASAP. If it's light hearted, you could lean into how pathetic the fights are, and get some comedy out of it.

You need to pace the details out. We don't need to know all of them immediately. Maybe the MC can look at his stats and wonder about things. He can come up with ideas about what's good and what's bad. He experiments and sometimes he's very wrong. Whilst this is happening, plot should happen as well.

The character should be interesting, we should enjoy being in his head whilst all this goes on.
