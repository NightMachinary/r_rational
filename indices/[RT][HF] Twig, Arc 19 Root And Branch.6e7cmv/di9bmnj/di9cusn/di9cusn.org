I'd say so. Characters are actively thinking and creative with their situations and the world, and every character (even the minor and temporary ones) have their own unique histories (however brief) and happenstances.

But, I also felt that way about Worm, more or less. Characters weren't /as/ rational - many of them acted like normal people, rather than rational people.

Still, I'd say Twig is more rational than Worm, if only because the main character is specifically "devastatingly intelligent".
