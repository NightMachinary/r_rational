I just started watching /Fate/Stay Night: Infinite Blade Works/, mostly because my wife is away for the week at a dance competition and I needed something to watch that she wouldn't have enjoyed. The fight scenes are well-animated and interesting, which by itself probably would have been enough for me.

It always surprises me how much exposition anime/manga have, and I don't really know what accounts for why it's so different from Western media, or if this is just some sort of selection bias of the sorts of anime/manga I've been exposed to.
