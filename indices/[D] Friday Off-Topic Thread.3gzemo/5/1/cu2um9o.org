I haven't watched any of the Fate stuff because I was under the impression they have a large backlog of episodes and series.

What anime have you seen? That you would think there would be only plot/exposition is a surprise to me.

Have you seen Plastic Memories? It's about androids with a controlled life span, kind of concludes with an antithesis to this subreddit though.

Also now I feel like [[/r/anime]] is going to be yet another subreddit where I randomly see your posts along with [[/r/Hearthstone]] mainly.
