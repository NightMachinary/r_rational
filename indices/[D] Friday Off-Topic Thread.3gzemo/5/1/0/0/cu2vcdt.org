I recently watched Fate Zero and found it was really well done. I've heard most people liked fate/zero a lot more than any of the stay night series.

Also, for some reason, Sakura's situation, despite her being a fictional character, really did a number on my psyche for some reason. I felt kinda scared for weeks.
