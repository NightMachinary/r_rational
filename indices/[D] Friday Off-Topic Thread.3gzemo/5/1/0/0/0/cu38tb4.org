That's because Fate/Zero was made after the original Fate/Stay Night and thus had much higher quality art, animation and fight scenes, among other things that more money and experience gets you. I tried to watch the original Fate/Stay Night after watching Fate/Zero and it was like rubbing sand in my eyes by comparison.

The /new/ version of Fate/Stay Night is Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works and I am finding it much nicer. Very enjoyable.
