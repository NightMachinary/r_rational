Basically yes, if by 'Fate/Zero comes after it' you mean 'Fate/Zero was made after the original'. Damn prequels make talking about it complicated.

Then there are a bunch of games, each with different 'routes' through the plot and it all gets rather complicated from there. Long story short, you're watching a remake of the original. And it seems pretty good so far.
