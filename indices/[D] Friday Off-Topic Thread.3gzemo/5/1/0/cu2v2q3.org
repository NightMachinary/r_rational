I've seen a fair amount of the mainstream stuff; my college roommate was president of our college anime club. So, let me see ... /Attack on Titan/, /Fullmetal Alchemist/, /Welcome to the N.H.K./, /Princess Jellyfish/, everything by Studio Ghibli, /Psycho-Pass/, /Sword Art Online/, /Death Note/, /Samurai Champloo/, ... basically, the well-known stuff that gets recommended to me enough times, stuff that's on Netflix, or stuff that was on Toonami back in the day. Usually dubbed instead of subbed, so that I don't have to pay the full amount of attention.

/Fate/Stay Night/ does seem to have a huge amount of background materials, but /Infinite Blade Works/ introduces/follows new characters (unless I'm missing something). I /think/ it's a standalone sequel.

It's not that I think anime doesn't have a plot, just that a lot of the exposition/setup is so */blunt/*, with people explaining the rules to each other over the course of a long stretch of conversation. I might be totally wrong about this being less common in Western media.
