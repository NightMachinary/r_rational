  It's not that I think anime doesn't have a plot, just that a lot of the exposition/setup is so blunt, with people explaining the rules to each other over the course of a long stretch of conversation.

I suppose that depends on what type of anime you watch. Most of the stuff you've listed is shonen, and you really have to compare to stuff aimed at that demographic in Western media to compare it. While I agree that exposition is certainly very blunt compared to something like Game of Thrones it's not so different when compared to Transformers (the Michael Bay movies) though even that has far less still. There's also the comparison that almost all the shows you've listed there are set in a whole new universe or world with new rules which happens far less often in Western media (which is interesting in itself) and so need more exposition.

I can't really think of the top of my head excluding Game of Thrones (which even then doesn't have flashy combat) of a current TV series set on a different universe with different rules. Superhero stuff is probably closest in character and they do tend to have large dumps of exposition.
