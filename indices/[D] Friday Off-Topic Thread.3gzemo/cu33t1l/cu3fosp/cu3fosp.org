It's good, depending on your tastes. Developed by the Eon group (a legendary set of designers most famous for Cosmic Encounter) Dune has a seamless blending of theme and rules. I enjoyed it the (few) times I played it.

That being said: 1) It's long 2) It really requires six players.

There is a remake published by FFG recently. But they didn't have the rights to the theme, so they put the game in their universe.
