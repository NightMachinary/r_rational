Why do self-insert characters act like telling someone that they're part of a fictional work would be mind-breaking?

It seems like the writers and characters are skipping over steps in the world's credulity. The levels of belief that I see are "This person is lying", "This person is crazy/deluded", "This person is honest and of sound mind, but wrong", and "This person is right". The stories all seem to completely skip over the third possibility.

What's more likely, that someone gets some weird form of one-shot precog along with their powers/appearance, or else that everything that you know about the universe you live in is a lie?
