I think it's pretty cool, but I totally feel for the creepy crowd. As another commenter said, it became much creepier when all those crisp lines disappeared with the black background, and all the remaining borders were those weird, rough edges. I'd like to know how those were calculated.

With a less cheerful color scheme (eg, black vs blood red and grey etc), I think it would be 10x creepier.

Also, shapes besides diamonds?
