  I'd like to know how those were calculated.

It's pretty simple: On each tick, a random blob is chosen, and that blob attempts to expand into every tile that borders it. If a tile is already occupied, the chance of a blob's winning the battle over that tile is directly proportional to that blob's size--if a 100-tile blob fights a 200-tile blob in a tile, the 100-tile blob's chance of winning the tile is 1 in 3.

  Also, shapes besides diamonds?
