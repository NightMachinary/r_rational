That's actually the exact opposite of my point. I'm fine with how the SI reacts to being in a new universe. Whatever brought them there can easily make sure that they're at least somewhat mentally stable, otherwise the story is just boring.

My problem is with the rest of the world's reaction to the SI, or else the SI's guess at the rest of the world's reaction.
