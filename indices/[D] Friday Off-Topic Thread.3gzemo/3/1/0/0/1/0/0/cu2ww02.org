  Could you not explain the same thing that makes them mentally stable as the same rationale that makes the SI not want to tell ...
#+end_quote

They could both happen at the same time from the same source, but I don't think that "it makes a better story" is a strong enough justification for how specific the fears/actions I've seen are. Motivations like keeping a personal source of information/power, limiting misinformation, maintaining a low profile, keeping a good story, and many others make sense, but worrying about the mental health of a person you tell shouldn't be that big of a concern (for someone who's already healthy when you tell them.)

  ...their new parents that their daughter has been mind wiped by a stranger from another universe or whatever?
#+end_quote

Most SI characters that I've seen appear in their own body, for example by waking up in an alley. Having a pre-existing family in the new universe is a reason for not telling in general, not a reason for considering mind-breaking to be a credible consequence of telling them.
