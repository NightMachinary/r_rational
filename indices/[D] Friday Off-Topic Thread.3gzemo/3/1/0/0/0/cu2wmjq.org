That's the tack I took in the "you're inserted into HPMoR" thread someone did a whiel back... telling anyone what happened would seem to lead to the assumption that I was under some kind of powerful memory charm, and the obvious cure would be to Obliviate my "me" memories and try and recover the original person. And also that I couldn't really argue that this /wasn't/ the most logical situation.

I got a bunch of responses that I was really being way too paranoid.
