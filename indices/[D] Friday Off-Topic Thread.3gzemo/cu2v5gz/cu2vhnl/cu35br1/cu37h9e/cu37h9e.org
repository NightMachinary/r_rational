theres a specific brand of visual boy advance that registers as linked just by having the windows open on the same screen. You can even trade between the same carriage, that way, if you utilize save states.

Also, I think the emulator no$gba has some link cable capability built into it. It's been a while though, and I was never big on linking up. I just ignored Pokemon that needed trading to evolve. Or used a code to hack them in.
