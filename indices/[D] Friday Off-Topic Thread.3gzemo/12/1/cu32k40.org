Getting out of virs is something that I haven't seen much of. It's present in the Jean Le Flambeur series I mentioned in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3gzemo/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cu325hk][this]] comment, but it does not have a lot of details on how this actually happens.

But I like the idea of taking the [[http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html][Law of Leaky Abstractions]] so far as to hack the universe using it. You probably want to focus on phenomena which may easily be explained by the finiteness of the machine's capabilities, like quanta and the speed of light. You could also probably somehow blend in the Universal Scalability Law here to explain some observed physical phenomena.
