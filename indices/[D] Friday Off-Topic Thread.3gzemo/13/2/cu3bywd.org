A few /SAO/ crossover stories:

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552390][Magic Online]]/: An interesting crossover between /SAO/ and /Harry Potter/ in which Harry spent his pre-Hogwarts life trapped in /SAO/ and is firmly convinced that Hogwarts is just another virtual reality--and his magic, having absorbed the /SAO/ game mechanics over the years of his imprisonment, forces the world around him to act accordingly.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11411017][Souls Art Online]]/: /SAO/ and /Dark Souls/ crossover. Begun only a few weeks ago, but the author has written several epic-length stories, so I'm pretty hopeful.
