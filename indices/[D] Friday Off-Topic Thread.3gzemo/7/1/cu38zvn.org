Rock climbing, specifically bouldering. Upside: It's highly addictive so motivation isn't an issue and my handshake feels like it could crush rocks. You end up picking things up at awkward angles or with one finger just because you can. Aggressive business guy isn't crushing my fingers. Downside: I popped my A2 band (finger ligament) last year and it would be fairly easy to do it again if I'm not careful.
