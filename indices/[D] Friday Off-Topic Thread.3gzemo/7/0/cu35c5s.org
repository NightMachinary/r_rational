My brother's been getting on my case about exercise, so currently I'm giving the Insanity program a go. It's based on maximum interval training where you work really hard for 3 minute intervals, with 30-second periods of rest in between. I haven't been able to stick it through the routine though..

The Armstrong pull-up program and Couch to 5k are worth a look too.
