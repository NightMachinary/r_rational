I agree, although I think this season has been stellar and Auto-Erotic Assimilation is hilarious and brutal, but the season premier may be my favorite. I'll have to rewatch it, it probably has a ton of jokes that are literally impossible to see in real time.

All of my favorite comedies are now animated, and several of them deal with depression (Bojack and R&M).
