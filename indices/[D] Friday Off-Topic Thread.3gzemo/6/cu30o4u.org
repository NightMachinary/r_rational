I haven't really gotten any responses on this, but are there any thoughts on variant Weekly Challenge like the one that's running this week? Right now I'm thinking that in the future we'll have some distribution "canon challenge", "trope challenge", image prompts, genre prompts, and things of that nature. Any canon (preferably a broad one that most people would have some familiarity with) which you think would make a good future prompt?
