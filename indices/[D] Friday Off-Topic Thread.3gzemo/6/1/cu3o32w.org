I find it fairly enjoyable. It mixes things up to go beyond just genres with our writing challenges. I really enjoyed this week's prompt, partially due to your take on rational Frozen opening me up to the idea at all.

As far as what might work good for future prompts, there's a wide array to choose from. I'd like to see a few more videogame focused prompts, personally. Maybe a few prompts based on popular movie franchises. Those that have enough depth to be rationalized, that is, such as Lord of the Rings, or the Percy Jackson series.
