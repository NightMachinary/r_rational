Here's a few suggestions:

- [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/29803/Overlord][Overlord]] - currently airing
- [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon][Log Horizon]]
- [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/48/.hack__Sign][.hack//Sign]] - this is the start of the franchise

There's also [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/14345/Btooom!][Btooom!]] which I haven't seen.
