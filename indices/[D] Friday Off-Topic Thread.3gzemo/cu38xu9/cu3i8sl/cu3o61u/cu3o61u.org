^{^} This is an AMAZING fic. You need little to no prior knowledge about the Gamer or RWBY to enjoy it. Although, it'd be helpful if you had at least a basic understanding of RPG type stuff, to really understand/enjoy the experience. Also, it's worth looking up the characters as you meet them, just so you have some idea what they look like.
