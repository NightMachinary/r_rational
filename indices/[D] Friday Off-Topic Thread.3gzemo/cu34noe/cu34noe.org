How do you guys deal with really big to-read lists?

There's been so many interesting things I'd love to get around to reading, non fiction specifically.

I never seem to be able to make time nowadays though. And it just keeps getting more and more obese as newly discovered books start to pile up. This has been the case ever since I started my classes.

And now when I do find the time, I don't even know where to begin.. Prospect of finishing them all seem so daunting, I end up reading something else - ongoing webserials, or shorts.

I've tried making reading tracking notes, choice picked a few from the lot - got audiobooks. Nothing seems to help.
