I found it more "cool" until the black space was filled up, at which point it became, I wouldn't say "creepy," but a bit disconcerting. At first it was easy to admire the interesting aspect of the animation, these diamonds competing with each other.

One the black space was gone, however, it began to feel claustrophobic. There was no space left to gain except by taking it from another color.
