Fate/Zero was originally a light novel that was written to set up the backstory for the Fate/Stay Night game. The game itself has three "routes" that represent three different ways the story could go based on the protagonist's choices. Following the popularity of the game an anime on the first of the three routes was released in 2006. Then Fate/Zero itself got an anime adaptation in 2011, and more recently the second route 'Unlimited Blade Works' got an animation too in 2014.
