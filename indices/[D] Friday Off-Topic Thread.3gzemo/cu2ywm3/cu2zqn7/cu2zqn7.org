Assuming that this is a real phenomenon, not something caused by selection bias, variance, etc.?

Summer months mean school's out for most of Europe and North America. I have to imagine that students make up a large portion of the fanfic reading community (which I don't think you can deny skews young). So why would they be participating less?

At a guess, it has to do with how people are satisfying their social impulses. Reading is mostly for entertainment, while reviews and PMs are mostly social. So there's some difference between how social impulses are satisfied during "school time" and "not school time". (I would naively assume the opposite effect, but I don't know.) Or it might be a matter of available energy; reviews take more effort than reading does.

But we'd need raw data in order to tell that the phenomenon is real and to gather data on where the differences are coming from (whether it's /actually/ students as I predict).
