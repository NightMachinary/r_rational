I read 9 of the current top 10. If you use the site for recommendations it just eventually ends up like that.

All the stories on there are pretty similar (superhero/superhuman) because the system is set up to keep the strongest clique engaged and everyone else with something better to do.

My recommendation is to try the top 2. If you like them, you're pretty likely to like the others as well, if you don't, you probably won't.
