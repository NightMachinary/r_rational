The first arc of wandering inn is objectively the worst of the entire series. The writer consistently gets better though, and eventually cuts one of those two main characters completely out of the story for 2 full arcs. The other character becomes much more well developed and likable as the series continues.

I'd honestly recommend giving arc 2 a chance if you have nothing else to read atm, it's noticeably better.
