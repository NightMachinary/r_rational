Yeah I don't think it's a secret that the list isn't gonna be perfect - some authors are going to be linking the website to social medias and asking for votes at the end of the chapter, while others may not even know of the website, so votes are going to be skewed. Plus anytime you can only vote for one option radical choices will be inflated (rip US Presidential Elections)... That's why I am looking for opinions from reddit. :)
