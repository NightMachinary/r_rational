Speaking of rational Xianxia, I recently read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44327636-the-first-step][A Thousand Li by Tao Wong]] and was pleasantly surprised since I hated all his other books. A pretty good take on the genre, with the application of western storytelling conventions and a decent, relatable protagonist.
