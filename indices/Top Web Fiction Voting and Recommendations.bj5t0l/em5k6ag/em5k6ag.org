IMO and your mileage may vary, but most of the list is garbage. It's a popularity contest based on binary decisions, its usefulness is telling you which serials are popular right now and/or update often (hint, these two factors are related).

If you want new stuff to read I recommend hanging out in the Monthly Recommendation threads instead of that website.

As for what you asked, I really like Unsong in that list, if you haven't read it yet, and The Good Student and Large Chests were pretty addictive. Worm is great too, obviously, not so much everything above it.
