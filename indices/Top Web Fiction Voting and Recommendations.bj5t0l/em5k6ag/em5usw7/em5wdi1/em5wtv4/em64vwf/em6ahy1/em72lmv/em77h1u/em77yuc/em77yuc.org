I am currently finishing reading one light novel, so I might just give it a try - while isekaish, the world building was rather pleasant and you could definitely enjoy it to some extent, for whatever it is worth. Then again, I also happened to drop WoTC, so maybe I'm just picky. Thanks for letting me know!
