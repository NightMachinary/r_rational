Nah that's completely fair, I've hated a lot of web fiction other people seem to love, a lot of it is definitely a matter of taste. I only mentioned anything because I personally also hated the first arc of Wandering Inn and only came back to it when I was stuck in a dry spell of finding anything interesting to read and am really happy I did.
