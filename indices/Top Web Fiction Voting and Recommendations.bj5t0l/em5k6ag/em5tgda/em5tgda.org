  Worm is great too, obviously, not so much everything above it.

The four entries above Worm are A Practical Guide to Evil, Ward, Metaworld Chronicles, and The Wandering Inn. Of those, one is the sequel to Worm, two more are truly excellent, and the last is fine reading if a little lightweight. Yes, the ratings are suspect and subjective, but unreadable work doesn't make it to the top of the list.
