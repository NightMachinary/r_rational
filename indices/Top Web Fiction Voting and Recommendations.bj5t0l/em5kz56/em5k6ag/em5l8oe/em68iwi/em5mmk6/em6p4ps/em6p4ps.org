If you like Wuxia, Forge of Destiny, listed there, is probably the closest any will get to Rational Wuxia. It was originally Written as a quest on Sufficient Velocity, but was finished (or at least the first /volume/ was) and is now being edited and posted to Royal Road, and it is /very/ good, especially 8f you like Xianxia/Wuxia.
