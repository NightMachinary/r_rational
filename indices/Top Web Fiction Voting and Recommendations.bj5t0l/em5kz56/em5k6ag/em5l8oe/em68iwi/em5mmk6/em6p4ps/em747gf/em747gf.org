  probably the closest any will get to Rational Wuxia

Is this based on the forum version? I'm caught up on the RR release, and while fun, I don't remember much rational about it.

Offhand, Forty Millennia of Cultivation is the closest to one that I've read (aside from an early deus ex that kicks off the plot), even if it isn't perfect. /Savage Divinity/ sometimes nudges in that direction, but never to the point where I could call it rational fiction.
