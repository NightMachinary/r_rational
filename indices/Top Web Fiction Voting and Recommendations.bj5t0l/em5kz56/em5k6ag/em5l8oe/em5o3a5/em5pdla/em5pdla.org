I'd recommend the [[https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-worm/][We've Got Worm]] podcast to refresh your memory (corresponding Reddit threads [[https://old.reddit.com/user/Kyakan/comments/a1dhfu/weve_got_wormweve_got_ward_episode_discussion/][here]]).\\
Two authors who're very good at close reading discuss the story arc by arc, talking about what makes it so great, and /really/ getting into characters' motivations and their development.

I guarantee they picked up a lot of stuff you missed on your first readthrough.
