Perhaps Rationalist is a better description, and it /is/ the forum version, just edited to not include the Quest bit. The reason I call it rational is mainly due to the characters and their development, and the world and its development, everything makes sense in context with the rest, and the characters each have goals of their own that they are in pursuit of. Last I checked that is the Definition of Rational.
