As of the latest Patreon chapter, Rain is gathering up a handful of awakened and a ton of non-awakened with the intent to go traveling through a dangerous ranked area in the middle of winter with a minor goal of awakening the civilians. Those people venerate him, are all friends, and are much more group-oriented than most adventurers. Rain would almost certainly be able to push them into parties and party-oriented builds, exactly as you suggest.
