As to your first point, I've seen similar comments on RoyalRoad. It's clear that awakened who try to pass the walls need to optimize their builds, and even one stray misused skill point out of the 10-20 they typically have can screw them permanently. The people of this world have the belief that solo builds are the only working solutions, given all the dps and tank builds we see everyone running. Hell, the only supports are some low level slaves that the Empire uses, and maybe a stray healer here or there. I don't think that world uses what we would consider optimal party comps with supports in our games. Rain as a support, especially when he gets some of the other really nice support auras, can definitely boost the other 7 in a party of 8 much more than if he was another dps.

That's probably why monsters seem exponentially stronger, if the system and world is based on party-oriented combat, which when optimized would put monsters and humans on an even playing field. These concepts of supports and such are probably too foreign for the world's awakened due to the general distrust and secrecy they have towards their builds and power and of course the result of living in a medieval society, the trust, openness, and vulnerability of relying so heavily on a crucial support or being the physically weak and trusting support would be impossible. It'd take a modern weirdo that'd understand optimal team comps and the strength of supports, a completely foreign element like Rain to really fully embrace this kind of build, as I doubt any other newly awakened people would try such a risky and untested build when a single mistake can permanently screw them over and when there are so many tried and true archetypical builds.

Now it makes me curious about the truth of the world and how this system and it's workings were created. It better not be another mischievous Evil God.
