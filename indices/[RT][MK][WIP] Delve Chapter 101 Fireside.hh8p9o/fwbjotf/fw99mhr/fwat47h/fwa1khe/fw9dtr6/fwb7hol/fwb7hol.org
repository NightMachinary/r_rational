I would mostly agree about the party comps if it weren't for the fact that you NEED to deal damage to monsters to get kill credit. The walls at the higher levels have been stated to be resistance break points where people would no longer be able to even deal damage by themselves due to their subpar skill selection, thus ceasing their ability to grow. Only the damage dealers in a party would be able to benefit from party comps.
