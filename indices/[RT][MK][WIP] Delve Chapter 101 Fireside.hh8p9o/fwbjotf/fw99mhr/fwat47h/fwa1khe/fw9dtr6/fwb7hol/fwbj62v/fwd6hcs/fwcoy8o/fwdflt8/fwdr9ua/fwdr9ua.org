That's not quite true though, is it?

I think our difference in opinion comes down to deductive vs. Inductive reasoning.

Inductive reasoning often doesn't come with the same ironclad certainty, that one might be used to with deductive reasoning.

Weather or not one entertains that looser reasoning, is a matter of personal judgement.

That said:\\
We have been given quite a bit of information on the system, and we have not been given any information to indicate, that there has been any drift in the system.\\
Everything we know points to a static structure.

The contention on Lairs, is that we haven't been given the information to extrapolate.\\
If they are doing anything important magically, then it might be subtle enough that it's not general knowledge.

My own guess is that they are Tel and Cyst farms, with the added bonus that they can get people stated on their awakening.
