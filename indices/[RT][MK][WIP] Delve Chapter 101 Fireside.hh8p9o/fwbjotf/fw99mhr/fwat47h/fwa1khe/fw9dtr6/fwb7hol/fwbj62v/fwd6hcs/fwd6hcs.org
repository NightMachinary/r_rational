I don't remember if this is Patreon or not, so I'll spoiler it:

The limit of people in a party is 8 and there can only be one party in a lair at a time. Outside a lair, multiple parties can gang up on an essence monster, but only the party that actually deals the finishing blow gets the credit.

If it's a spoiler then it's not much of one and I think some of it was actually in this chapter.
