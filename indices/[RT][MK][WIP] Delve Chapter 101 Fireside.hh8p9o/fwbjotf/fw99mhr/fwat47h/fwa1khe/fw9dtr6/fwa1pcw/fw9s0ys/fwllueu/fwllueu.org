I mean, Purify is basically a light aura. A piece of Majistraal tech that sustains and amplifies an aura over a wide radius would neatly solve that problem--if Rain hacks the obelisk, he might be able to use it to broadcast a citywide Purify. Which would have a zillion benefits, and actually makes a lot of sense as something the Majistraal would have done in their day.
