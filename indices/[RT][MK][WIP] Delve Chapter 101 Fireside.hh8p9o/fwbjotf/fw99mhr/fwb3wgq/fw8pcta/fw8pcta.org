Edit: Actually, I guess I shouldn't be spoiling Patreon chapters ahead of time, so instead here's a shill for [[https://www.patreon.com/user/membership?u=21589642][SenescentSoul's Patreon]], where you can read eight chapters ahead. If you'd buy yourself a $2.50 snack once a month, I feel like it's worth it to get the chapters early and support the author. (Before you call me a sucker, I support Wildbow on Patreon too and I don't even get early access to /those/ chapters.)
