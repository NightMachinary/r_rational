Val seems to have that effect on people.

I don't really agree with your assessment, the doge reference is already very outdated. Still, Rain's meme evolution effectively stopped like 2 years ago for obvious reasons, so it's understandable for me.

If the upcoming fight doesn't do it for you then I highly suggest taking a break from the story for a couple months. For the last long while it's been political machinations galore, and it doesn't seem like itll be ending in the foreseeable future.
