There have been like 30 chapters with no progression within the system.

That would normally be fine, but the character dialog and story writing is, frankly, juvenile with so many pop culture jokes and meme references. The story is cringey to read right now, when the jokes are relevant. It definitely won't age well.

Every character has the exact same personality and voice and teenager sense of snark. Even characters from different empires, different cultures, different species, all sound the exact same.

I love the system in this story, and I can't wait until the writer returns to it. It's such an interesting story mechanic
