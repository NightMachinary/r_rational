I still hold to the theory that the system is balanced around party builds, but as seem with the sentiment towards supports, everyone is building as solo builds..

So, combining Rain's optimisation of the builds, as well as having people spec for filling party roles, the "wall" of 25 ought to be much easier to clear.

Actually, thoughts are colliding! I shall make a prediction!

Some of the workers who have aligned themselves with the "Lord Rain", will awaken, after which they will come to Rain seeking his guidance.\\
Rain will share the various builds he has come up with, then after some back and forth, will group them after party rolls, and the revolution will have begun.

Electricity will be used to deal with the problem of darkness, as it has already been introduced without a payoff. There ought to be a lot of ways to run a turbine when you have access to magic, so they wont need to go digging for coal.

The monsters solve the need for food, and the barrier allows for the revolution to develop without outside interference.
