This nighttime campfire respite in the middle of a monster infested zone is giving me such hard Dark Souls vibes (if it was unintentional I'll eat my hat) and I'm all over that. This may be one of my favorite chapters thematically so far--right up there with the Everdeep Fortress delve.

Wolf is such a cool chick, I sure do hope we get to see more of her in the near future! She wouldn't happen to be a Bloodborne reference, would she? Frickin monster hunters transforming into beasts in a long night of hardship and horor. I'll be disappointed if she isnt carrying a saw or cane of some sort.

As somebody who does a lot of camping and card playing, I feel like an expert on the subject of playing cards by campfire. In my expert opinion, it is not easy to play cards by campfire at night. For one, the slightest breeze risks losing a card to the fire (or worse, getting the cards dirty). For two, smoke to the eyes does not a happy card player make. Still, I had the dumbest grin when the chapter started with a group of "friends" just passing the time playing cards and being asshats to eachother.

I really hope Rain's monster compendium becomes a regular thing. It gives us context on how to measure a person's strength. Up to now, we only really had Rain's previous numbers to compare his new numbers to, and it made his progression seem very impressive (going from 8ish dps to like 1k dps or something). But after seeing some of those HP numbers, I can now more easily see why people aren't as impressed as I was (freaking 20k ballpark for a normal enemy 3 levels below Rain's? Goddamn his dps looks pretty pathetic in this light) Makes me wonder what kind of numbers Velika can pull to just walk all over these things. The growth rate in this world looks to be comparable to the Disgaea series from the looks of things. Maybe a Laharl cameo sometime? He and Val would just be the best of friends.
