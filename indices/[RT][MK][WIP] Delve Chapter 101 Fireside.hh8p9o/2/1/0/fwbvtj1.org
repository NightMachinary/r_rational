I have no problem with character heavy arcs, or political machinations, as long as they are well written. The vast majority of Practical Guide To Evil lately is dialogue and politics, and they are very well written, and enjoyable.

The problem in this story is that every single character, has exactly the same voice. From Rain, to Amelia, to Tallheart, who is an entirely different species, to Valencia, they all sound like the same 15 year old boy.

I enjoy the fights, I enjoy the characters using their skills in inventive ways, and I really enjoy the magic system and progression. But the writing is just so cringey, and juvenile.

You're probably right, and I should break for a while and binge the story later. Good recommendation
