We got some hints that makes that almost certainly the case.

There's a lot of arbitrary elements that haven't been justified, they haven't even been handwaved!

It also matches up with the rumor that the forerunners didn't consider someone a mage until they reached level 100. (Or 75? I can't remember)

With the forerunners building the system to empower people, with the full intention that it will be left behind.

It only has the 122 trees because it wasn't meant to have everything, it was just supposed to get you started.

Mind, I don't actually have a textual basis for this. It just fits my intuition.
