Would a Light Aura cause the widescale environmental emission of light necessary to prevent monster spawns though? Immolate only creates fire around targets, which have been monsters in every case I can remember.

There must be a Light Aura, because there's a Dark Aura iirc, so I imagine there must also be a reason it's not more prevalent in Xiugaara where light generation is a major issue.

The need for a target with HP would be a logical limitation.
