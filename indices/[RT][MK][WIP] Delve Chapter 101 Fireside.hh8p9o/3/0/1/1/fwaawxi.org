Yes. I'm also a patreon and I don't think adding the current patreon chapter's discussion, tagged or not, in the public release's thread is appropriate.

There's a discord and the chapter's comments section. Or you could make a spoiler-only thread. There's no reason to do this here, where people who are not up to date are to have a discussion.
