I see. But you'd think that editing a pokemon's programming with TMs or biologically cloning Mew to create Mewtwo would be a lot harder than simply transferring code to another pokeball. Aside from the potentially massive amounts of energy required, it should be technically a lot easier. You don't need to worry about telomeres, epigenetics, wombs, etc.
