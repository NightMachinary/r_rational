In reference to memories, you mean? As far as I'm aware, we're still not sure exactly how memories work, certainly not enough to manipulate them reliably. We know they're not sourced at any one part of the brain, but that some parts of the brain are more important for retention/recall than others. We know that even amnesiacs make use of the striatum to form subconscious memories by rote and habit, so that they could drive to work but not remember any of the directions or the route there. But we can't create new memories, or even copy existing ones, artificially.

My point is there's a lot we don't know, and more specifically, a lot /I/ don't know about how brains work. To say that an instantaneously generated consciousness "should" retain all the memories seems to me a bit unfounded: we don't even retain all our memories of the past 24 hours on a day to day basis when we go to sleep at night. We have no experience with anything even remotely close to an instantaneously generated consciousness on which to base such a confidence assertion of how it "should" work.

And since from the perspective of the pokemon world, pokeball technology is still relatively new, I think it's reasonable to make the principles at work not fully understood, or have unexpected results. Which isn't to say they can't figure it out and make it work: just that they haven't yet.
