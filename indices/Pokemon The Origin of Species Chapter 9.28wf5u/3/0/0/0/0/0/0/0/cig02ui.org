What I meant had more to do with memory and sense of self. When a pokemon is transformed to energy, their "mind" is converted into a purely digital form, wherein they can still experience things and learn. When their bodies are reformed, the body doesn't emerge exactly as it did because new neural pathways and memories are present, but it's a more or less continuous chain. However, I don't see the process being perfect, which may be why humans that experience it come out brain damaged.

So how would an instantaneously generated consciousness function? Would it have all the "false" memories it's been programmed to have? What about things like muscle memory?

This isn't to say that flash-cloning through the digitization process isn't possible, just that I see it being more complex than we might think, and am using that potential complexity to hold it off as something that isn't perfected yet. Maybe I'm wrong to do so, and it would actually be that easy :) But it would kind of break the pokemon world if cloning pokemon was that easy, and it's clearly not part of the game other than as a "glitch" (which is an interesting thing to explore later in the story).

As for genetic cloning, their biological technology is definitely more advanced than ours too, as evidenced by their medical abilities alone :)
