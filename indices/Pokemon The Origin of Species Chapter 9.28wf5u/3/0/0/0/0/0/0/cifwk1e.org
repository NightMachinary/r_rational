But the same technology is already used to recreate the physical bodies of pokemon every time they're summoned from the ball. The exact functioning of the neurology doesn't even need to be understood if the entire physical state of the pokemon, which includes the pattern of neural connections, is already being perfectly stored as data in the pokeballs. Even if there are imperfections in the neural data storage for whatever reason (which I doubt since the rest of the body seems to be stored perfectly and there isn't anything particularly mysterious about neurons aside from the ridiculous number of possible neural connection patterns and how exactly they actually give rise to thought), it should be no different than the imperfections of normal pokemon recreated from pokeballs. We're capable of cloning things biologically, but the clones aren't very good. They have potentially reduced lifespans and all sorts of genetic problems because the epigenetics of the somatic cell you got the DNA from and tried to return to an zygote-like state are not the same as the epigenetics of a natural zygote. Also, biological cloning wouldn't be enough to clone Mewtwo. You'd need to create an artificial womb somehow like the researchers used in the movie and that is far beyond our current knowledge since recreating the exact conditions of a womb, down to extremely small, precise concentrations of hormones that change in response to the development of the embryo, the conditions of the host, etc. would be ridiculously complex. Plans for cloning woolly mammoths involved implanting the embryo into an elephant womb, but I don't know if the same would be possible for Mewtwo or other legendaries since most of the legendaries are physically incapable of reproduction, at least in the games.
