The constant switching is just the evolution of the professional battling meta: the only regulations in the league so far are that you can't just keep pokemon in their balls (for obvious reasons) and the canon six pokemon at a time. Past that, the rules are mostly common sense (one pokemon at a time unless the format is different) or for safety (when a pokemon is considered "out"). Restricting trainers to a few moves would be hard to regulate, as trainers just use commands to give SPECIFIC attacks when they want to: pokemon are more than capable of using their own attacks if not given a specific command.

The way I see subtle distinctions like Scratch and Slash has to do with variations on the theme of "claw attack." Remember that the names of attacks are just commonly accepted verbal commands for similar moves: some people don't use verbal commands at all.

So the distinction between, say, Scratch or Slash, may have to do with the target. Scratch may be a more competitive-friendly move that targets the chest or arms, while Slash is a more lethal move that aims for more "critical" targets like the neck or eyes, the use of which would be frowned on in League sanctioned battles.
