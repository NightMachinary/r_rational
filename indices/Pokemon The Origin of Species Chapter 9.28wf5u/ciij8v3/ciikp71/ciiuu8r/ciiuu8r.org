That helps a lot. What you said actually makes a lot more sense than my thought process, as a Pokemon wouldn't have partial amnesia from learning something knew.

The thought occurred to me when reading about the Shadow Claw TM and I was thinking if as the moves got more advanced, the weaker or simpler moves would just be forgotten. But thank you, and keep up the great work.
