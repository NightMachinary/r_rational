I can imagine it being more complex than we think, but of course in our world we don't have any evidence of that. An instantaneously generated consciousness should retain all the memories. If the muscle data was included in the code (and it seems to be) then muscle memory should be retained too. If the pokemon are not being recreated perfectly, then I imagine that the flaw is in the code governing how new neural connection data is created as pokemon learn things while in data form. The solution would be to stop using the easy method of training pokemon while they're in data form, instead putting them in "suspended animation" or just not run the pokemon's code while they're in data form and only train them using mundane methods while they're in physical form.
