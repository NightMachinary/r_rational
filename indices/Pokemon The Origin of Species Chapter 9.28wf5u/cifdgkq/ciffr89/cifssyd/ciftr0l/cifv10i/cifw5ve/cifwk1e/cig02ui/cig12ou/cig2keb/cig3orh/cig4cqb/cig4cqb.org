  Unless, of course, the pokeball technology does something else when it's converting the pokemon into data?

It does: pokemon who are captured generally become less aggressive and more open to suggestion and conditioning.

I'm not asserting that there's something mystical and unknowable at the core of memories that makes the technology impossible: but the process of conversion and storage isn't a perfect stasis, and infusing matter with enough energy to recreate a pokemon's body based on the "blueprint" of the data the pokeball stores seems like it's dealing with such delicate things that it's not a perfected technology yet.
