I don't think it's unfounded. We don't know everything about the brain or about neurons and we don't know exactly how the pattern of neural connections gives rise to memories, experience, self-awareness, etc., but it is based on the physical configuration of the brain and if you're storing the configuration of every molecule in a pokemon's body as data when you convert them to data then you don't need to understand how the neurons work. You just need to somehow be able to scan the molecular arrangements and recreate them. Regarding going to sleep at night, those memories get erased because your brain edits its neural connections during sleep. If you're reproducing the exact configuration of molecules that the pokemon used to have then it should have the same memories. Unless, of course, the pokeball technology does something else when it's converting the pokemon into data?
