I honestly don't know what to do with the apricot thing. It's just so random and silly a concept, and really doesn't fit into anything else we know about the world. I don't want to go down the road of inventing my own pokemon, so basically I just see it as a tradition thing. The first pokeballs were made of hollowed out apricorns because they have hard shells and natural sealing tops, and the technology was very crude: it wasn't able to change size obviously, it couldn't scan the pokemon beforehand, it couldn't transmit data or detect anything around it. It was basically a "genie bottle" that was used to store pokemon in a somewhat safe manner.

Making pokeball technology a mystical/biological aspect of apricorns is a possibility, but one I'm going to avoid for now, as the canon indicates that apricorns are no longer needed to make pokeballs at all.
