I wonder if you have considered the implications of Apricorns in your timeline of Pokéball technology. Kurt claims that Apricorn based pokéballs were the original way pokemon were caught, and that even though now he uses modern technology to enhance his Apricorn balls, he says that they were made for generations before the advanced Pokéballs were made.

Perhaps Apricorns are a parasitic species of Pokémon, that "capture" pokemon inside themselves to digest them. When hallowed out by craftsmen like Kurt, this capturing method remains, but the dead Apricorn can't eat the pokemon anymore, perfect storage.

Maybe the "capturing" process of the modern Pokéball isn't wholly technological, and some of the mysteries derive from whatever biological feature of Apricorns creates the conversion effect. The feature that Humans added to the process was the simulated consciousness inside the Pokéball, where as before it was just a stasis like experience.
