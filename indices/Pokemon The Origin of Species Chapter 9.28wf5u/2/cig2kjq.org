Since the author asked me to, I'll post my review of the most recent (ninth) chapter of Pokemon: The Origin of Species, so they can address the issues in a more generally-feedback-friendly environment. Please keep in mind that this is my very first post on reddit. I had and still have an irrational and severe dislike of this particular social network (the irony of admitting this in [[/r/rational]] is not lost on me). Furthermore the review was intended for ff.net and thus is more in line with that particular community's style and sensibilities, or at least as I see them. And lastly, prior to this quoted review I had already reviewed twice on previous chapters, which may account for any inappropriate joviality.

  The development and coding of machines is... troublesome. It implies a lot, really, though I expect your version to give certain allowances to. For instance programmers need to have some programming language that interferes and overlaps to a sufficient degree with the digitisation issue of pokemon. Though that can simply be a case of "round shape fits round hole, regardless of tools used to get round shape". Hopefully that simile isn't too crude... Regardless, another point in that is the testing procedure. Programmers need to have a reasonable facsimile of pokemon code they can test their prototypes on, or have some back-up measure of the real pokemon code, otherwise they run the danger of seriously endangering the well-being of the physical pokemon. That of course assumes Pokémon has a more serious pokemon cruelty and testing lobby and policy than ours compared to animals.

  And now that I think of it, this brings up another thing I always wondered: Do pokemon replace animals, or do they expand the world by a totally different offshoot of biology and evolution? There are some serious implications in both, really. Take the first case, for instance. Our understanding of evolution (mark the lack of capital E) implies that humans could be a special case of pokemon, once one applies Occams razor with enough rigour. Effectively supplanting the animal kingdom with pokemons. Which still raises a lot of questions of biology, like plants, do they Evolve? How does pollination work, or are all the colourful flowers a mere side effect and not an attractor of pollinators? If pokemon are pollinators, there's the size issue, for instance...

  The second case, pokemon being a different line of creature with regular animals also inhabiting the world, on the other hand raises the question: Where do they come from? Why the parallel development to regular animals (similarities to regular animal species like dogs, bisons, birds, jellyfish, ...)? Is the whole Pokémon world a case of second civilisation after the first that created pokemon crashed apocalyptically? A point I agree on with Blue and Red is the age issue. Personally I'd wait for the children to turn thirteen, I guess, since at that stage in their (psychological) development two years can be a lot. I wonder, though, if 15 is their age of consent -- they can buy houses and enter contracts unsupervised? If so... well, you could always say the Pokémon world has years with about 400 days instead of the usual 350. That way they'd still be around the nominal age implied, but be just a tad in physical capability and mental maturity in the bell curve we have in mind, but still perfectly regular in that of the Pokémon world.

  The psychoanalysing rule made me laugh out loud :)

  I wonder if you'll apply the easy storage and/or transport technology you just demonstrated (the acquisition of the gas masks, delivered by pokeball derivative technology) to the world and economy at large. Easy transport of goods probably the world over is intriguing, especially without the whole consumption of fuel demonstrated. Though the whole process is probably powered by energy, and that might as easily be the biggest coal power plants ever built; it wouldn't fit the utopian streak of the story, though.

  In regards to the insulated shoes... those I assume to be more prevalent due to a higher chance of electrical mishaps in Pokémon, simply by the abundance of electro type pokemons, but I wouldn't be surprised if insulated over-shoes, like socks for shoes or in the style of crampons, were widely sold. It's much easier to add to your equipment, especially in warmer climates, than an extra pair of shoes.

  The bottom-up approach in planning to use his flute is very Red, while the middle-out or top-down seems very like a Blue thing to do, so congratulations on gibing your characters enough characterisation by now to allow me make such a judgement. Another thought comes to mind, though: the command versatility of songs versus the song likeness of commands. In both directions it can become very atonal, or very pretty, and everything in-between.

  Just now I've been wondering, if you will in-or have already excluded the game mechanic of spending pokeballs, regardless of success in capture. I understand the need for the game mechanic, but can also see at least one technical option that could adapt that in-universe. Like a charge for instance, which is spent by trying to capture a pokemon. If it breaks free, the charge is still spent and the ball needs to be recharged in a pokemon centre. The Containers wouldn't have the same disadvantage since pokeballs are the specialised case, with specialised requirements, whereas Containers recharge by using the temperature gradients between storage and exterior or something like that.

  The abundance and willingness of concussive stunning of pokemon is a bit worrisome, I have to admit. Sure, slowing a pokemon down by exhausting it is one thing, but Hamato swinging the weedle into a tree trunk could have easily caused a retardation or worse in a real animal. But I suspect pokemon are hardier than comparable animals (which in turn could ties into the "humans are pokemon-ish" hypothesis).

  As always, this has been a very enjoyable read, and continues being a fine case of world-building :)
