Daystar has said that the technology in this Pokemon world is very advanced. They already have the ability to convert matter to energy and back. In that situation I have a easier time believing that they have virtually infinite energy from fusion than them still needing Pokemon to generate electricity.

I was just going by the rough math you did. The implication of it was that for 1 human in the Pokemon world, you need 6 electric Pokemon generating electricity (you also gotta feed these Pokemon). That is assuming normal energy usage. But as Daystar said, their energy needs are astronomically high compared to the real world. So the way Daystar has set up the world, you also need astronomically high numbers electric Pokemon doing the bidding of humans as well if the renewable tech is underdeveloped.

Edit: Still it is Daystar's creation so he can choose the level of technological advancement in his world. These problems are nothing that won't be solved by him tweaking the world a little.
