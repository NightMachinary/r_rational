  Using pikachu may have been a bad example, since it's a mammal and thus easier to empathize with. Not to say that they wouldn't be used for energy if needed, but most electric farms in the pokemon world would use lower order pokemon like voltorb/electrode and magnemite/magneton, which are much less intelligent and easier to care for.

  the necessary number of electric pokemon per person also skyrockets. (by rp20)

The intent of my guesstimating was ball-parking the amount of pokemon needed to get some reliable power supply running. To compensate for a significantly higher energy consumption, as per matter-energy-transformator requirement, you could simply adjust for a magnitude, and ballpark it back down by using less humanly empathised pokemon like voltorb. Add to that the assumed differences in power generation capabilities of the various kinds of pokemon and it might come back down to comparable numbers once taken both changes into account.

It might even be more feasible to use higher tier evolved pokemon since they may supply or generate a more steady flow of electricity while being less active, reducing the strain or or need to actually work low-tier pokemon for comparable results. If this were true, it would decrease the net strain on pokemon as a whole; lower numbers providing equal to or more power at less discomfort. At the moment I'm thinking of the needs for the infrastructure to accommodate pokemon generated power, and the feeling I have based on my experience doesn't look good. I am assuming the world hasn't the tech to capture lightning effectively? Because that is what I always assumed most of the electro attacks to be, something akin to directed lightning. This would still require enormous voltages to bridge the insulating air. Interestingly enough a solution arises addressing both the necessary voltages as well as aiming such attacks: ionisation. A tunnel of ionised air greatly reduces the required voltage; it can be induced by various means, opening up the aiming; it is a step ahead of the actual lightning, making it possible for pokemon to seem to avoid the lightning while they actually flee the ionisation trail. Though it doesn't need to be ionisation, actually, any means that reliably reduces the voltage needed to crack the insulation between pokemon and target is game.

To address rp20, the pokemon might be the necessary step needed to accomplish the future technologies. Coal power was the easy step for us to take from which we might feasibly gain the means to an effectively unlimited power source (at least for the foreseeable future). In a sense like an exothermic chemical reaction, with coal and generally current power generation providing the initiating energy and once we have bio-power and all the other renewable energy source the reaction is self-sustaining.
