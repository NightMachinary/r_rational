  More likely than not they build up the charge as needed, the energy being supplied by their body by metabolites. As those get used up, the pokemon fatigue. If one can train the pokemon to build up a low charge, one their metabolism can keep maintaining even once we drain it, we're set. It might even be a relatively level of voltage thus produced, though it would still need to be smoothed for consumer use and such.

This makes good sense, and fits in game terms of pokemon running out of "PP" or energy for their attacks

They should also be able to safely store that charge between uses: otherwise the amount of time it would take for a pokemon to charge up a small thundershock might be prohibitive for combat purposes.

  Aaand reading on Bulbapedia on Jolteon just implied every cell taking part in the build-up, making at the very least the charger organ nothing more than intellectual navel-gazing. Oh well.

Hahaha. Don't worry, I've had those moments at least a dozen times already :P This is ridiculously tricky work, and there are still many pokemon I haven't figured out how to handle rationally (pokemon that come in bunches, for example, like exeggcute) without contradicting established rules. The creators of pokemon were notoriously thoughtless and haphazard in their handling of their world and how it works, and there aren't even any attempts at canon answers to most of these questions, let alone bad ones.

That said, your examination shouldn't be considered a waste, as I still find discussion on these issues interesting and informative :) My expertise is in psychology, and I'm simply an eager student trying to cobble together the most rational answers I can when it comes to biology, chemistry or physics, so it's much appreciated!
