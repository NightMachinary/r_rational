  Maybe their genetics shift to match the herd they're in? So they mix herds, lay a new egg, and then over time the genetics of the entire herd stabilize into a new one?

That is a good idea, but genetics don't shift on an individual level, at least not on an appreciable level. And canon says the reproduction/evolution cycle is something like this: Exeggcutes gather to a congregation of six. For fun reasons, let's call that group an orgy. Expose the orgy to a leaf stone(*) and the orgy evolves to a singular exeggutor with multiple heads. I suppose at least one head is formed at this point. More heads grow gradually and once of sufficient size they drop, forming the single exeggcutes.

By that description the heads and exeggcutes can be likened to seeds, actually. If we spin that further, it would be feasible for the exeggcutes to be haploid seeds, whereas exeggutor have a hexaploid genome. Essentially the whole stick would be akin to plant species with an alternation of generations, in this case with exeggcutors being gametophytes (/n/ chromosomes) and exeggutors being sporophytes (/6n/ chromosomes).

(The telepathy issue though... I'd personally disregard that for the most part. Have the exeggcutes talk in poke-talk with each other, like the heads of the adults do. I'm not sure if I would allow for telepathy in Pok√©mon at all, but can see why you'd go that route. In that case I'd limit it to the associated types, though.)

If we go by my proposed explanation... the herds would be the natural state of exeggcutor behaviour, I think. Looking for mates, the chances are higher in such big groups to find the five fitting to the individual requirements compared to solitary movement. There's also the safety issue, of course. The orgy (i.e. 6 exeggcutor communion) would work as a, well, sub-herd, or trial relationship. A pre-stage, to work everything out biochemically. Add a leaf stone and the conception stage takes place, forming exeggutor. It also instantaneously forms new seeds (= heads), probably with other personalities than those forming the original orgy.

(*) Leaf and other evolutionary stones might work by supplying a mineral that activates very specific enzymes (or supplies building material for these) in the pokemon body, triggering the evolving step.
