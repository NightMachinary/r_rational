  But I always tok the eggs to be a general term more than a biological one -- it oughtn't be eggs per se, but rather a catch-all name for prenatal stages of the pokemon in their development.

Yes, they're definitely not "eggs" in the sense that we use the term.

  Yes, telepathy screw with a lot, which is the exact reason I don't like that ability in pokemon, because it is obviously high-grade nonsense. Bad writing, in a sense... But for same species specimen regular individuals will work fine to tell you that, based on analysing a furrowed brow and curled lips showing teeth, the human in question is very likely angry.

What makes a telepthic link more valuable than simply super-powerful observation and empathy is that a telepathic link could work over long distances, or when not able to visually observe the other person.

As much of a headache as it might be, psychic powers are kind of a big part of pokemon. Not just telepathy, but also things like telekinesis. It's one of the major types of pokemon in the world, and removing or re-interpreting it to not be what it is would be like EY turning leglimensy and occlumensy into just reading faces for HPMOR, or for Alicorn to remove Alice Cullen's ability to see the future and soften it to just "calculating probabilities."

For me the goal of rationalfic isn't to remove fantastic elements: it's to make them as realistic as possible while staying as true to the source material as possible. Obviously there's some subjective wiggle room there, but the golden standard is that the "magic" is understandable and consistent. What goes to the chopping block are those things that are completely irreconcilable with logic or good storytelling, and I don't think telepathy quite meets that mark.

  So I'l cut back a bit and only check back once a day. Hopefully.

No worries, I know what it's like to have too-large quantities of time gobbled up by message threads too ;) Take your time!
