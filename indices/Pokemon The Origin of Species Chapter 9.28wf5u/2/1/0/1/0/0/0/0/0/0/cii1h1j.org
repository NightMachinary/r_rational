The issue as I see it is thus:

Exeggcute are distinct organisms. It's okay for them to be psychically linked, but there's mention in canon of them leaving and joining herds. So it's not like they're all biologically twins for the pokeball to be willing to count them as one. And it can't be a matter of mass, because six exeggcute weigh more than two pidgey. It makes absolutely no sense that pokeballs treat exeggcute as one being.

So far, I think I'll have to ignore the mention of them each being unique individuals for it to make any sense.
