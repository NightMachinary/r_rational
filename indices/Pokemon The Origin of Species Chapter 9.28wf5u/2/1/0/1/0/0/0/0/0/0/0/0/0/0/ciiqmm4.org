The canon lifecycles are a bit weird, since most organic pokemon basically just comes from eggs, but I'm definitely not sticking to that. I like your proposal a lot :) They're going to be telepathic in the most basic sense: very hive-mind. No pokemon are as smart as they are in the cartoon, and the psychic ones basically can share emotions or very basic impulses.
