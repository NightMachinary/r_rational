After having thought a bit on that, I can hazard a guess what /might/ work.

But first, why would you think the identical sextuplets not being reasonable? Say their biological make-up requires the offspring to be sextuplets. Only due to the herd issue? Those herds might simply be a stage in their social development leading to mating, their puberty, so to speak. Exeggcutes disbanding and joining different herds or groups would make sense from a genetical and biological standpoint.

The thought I originally had was more in line with social insects, though. In bees for instance workers are more related to other workers than compared to actual sisters and even less to drones. (That's due to a quirk in genetics) Based on that I speculated for the sextuplet group to be something akin to a swarm without a queen.

Looking at the canon (according to Bulbapedia) that doesn't seem to be the case, though. I'd have to buckle down something fierce to figure out a way to fuse canon and biology, really.
