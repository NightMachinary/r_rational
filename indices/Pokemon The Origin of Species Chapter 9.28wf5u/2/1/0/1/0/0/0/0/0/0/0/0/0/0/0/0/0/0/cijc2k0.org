  No, I (personally) would have limited psychic moves to pokemon of that type, though the move shadow claw being available to charmander certainly implies there not being any real objection.
#+end_quote

I strongly considered this actually, but in the end decided that it would be taking too easy a route for convenience, and greatly limited the strategy and tactical potential of pokemon battles. Thus did I have to explain how TMs work to rationalize how pokemon like charmander could learn Shadow Claw.

  But in the case of exeggcutes, well... I don't see a reason for the orgy to be telepathically linked when their growing forms talk to each other (while still connected to exeggutor). I occamed their telepathy, so to speak.

Well, they /are/ psychic type, so them not being linked seems odd to me. And they can't talk to eachother at all: none of the pokemon in my world are capable of talking to eachother like in the anime. It's based more off the games. So them being psychically linked allows a level of coordination that other pokemon working in a group might lack, reinforcing that the orgy of exeggcute are considered one pokemon (so one can't use bullet seed while the other uses leech side while the other uses egg bomb while the other uses confusion, etc).

  And to re-iterate from my previous comment: I really liked speculating on the biology, so of course you're free to use my speculation as you see fit. (And even if I didn't give my assent, it's all fan fiction, either way.)

Thanks, I think I am going to go with your explanation of the biology :)
