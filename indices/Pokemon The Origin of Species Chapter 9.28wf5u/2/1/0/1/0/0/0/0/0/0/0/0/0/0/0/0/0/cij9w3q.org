  For me the goal of rationalfic isn't to remove fantastic elements: it's to make them as realistic as possible while staying as true to the source material as possible. Obviously there's some subjective wiggle room there, but the golden standard is that the "magic" is understandable and consistent. What goes to the chopping block are those things that are completely irreconcilable with logic or good storytelling, and I don't think telepathy quite meets that mark.

Oh, that's not what I meant, not at all. Telepathy and other psychic phenomena being a thing are one of the building blocks of Pokémon and you don't remove stones in the foundation of your building if you don't want to risk it all coming loose and crashing down.

No, I (personally) would have limited psychic moves to pokemon of that type, though the move shadow claw being available to charmander certainly implies there not being any real objection. But in the case of exeggcutes, well... I don't see a reason for the orgy to be telepathically linked when their growing forms talk to each other (while still connected to exeggutor). I occamed their telepathy, so to speak.

Anyway, I wouldn't try to remove the mythical chakra from Naruto, for instance, since it is a much too ingrained concept to that universe and removal would screw up everything that world is about. Though playing and trying to come up with solutions or theoretical foundations to the actions shown would certainly be interesting -- the same you do with your story and Pokémon, really.

And to re-iterate from my previous comment: I really liked speculating on the biology, so of course you're free to use my speculation as you see fit. (And even if I didn't give my assent, it's all fan fiction, either way.)
