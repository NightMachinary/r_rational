I have to disagree in some capacity with you. Yes, the life cycles are pretty weird (which is me at least using a stand-in for more drastic language). Yes, telepathy screw with a lot, which is the exact reason I don't like that ability in pokemon, because it is obviously high-grade nonsense. Bad writing, in a sense (*). But I always tok the eggs to be a general term more than a biological one -- it oughtn't be eggs per se, but rather a catch-all name for prenatal stages of the pokemon in their development.

(*) For that reason I want to point out that aptly reading body language and non-verbal cues in species are essentially the same as empathy (on a same species level) in the sense it is understood in science-fiction, or at least something like Star Trek. Counsellor Troi had the magical ability to discern the emotional state of beings, or communities, of species she didn't know. Great. But for same species specimen regular individuals will work fine to tell you that, based on analysing a furrowed brow and curled lips showing teeth, the human in question is very likely angry.

Be that as it may, I don't intend to keep you from writing -- I certainly know this conversation, while interesting, for me at least cut into my schedule in a not wholly unwelcome manner. Not to say I didn't enjoy the time spent speculating on the biology of pokemon (I /really/ did), but there are other things in my head, begging to be put into reality. So I'l cut back a bit and only check back once a day. Hopefully.
