You'd still need the technology to harness that energy though. Our current problem with things like solar panels isn't that we can't get enough sunlight directed at them. Having more sunlight certainly helps, but when considering efficiency, translating electric energy is probably the easiest way to go I think. I could be wrong, as I'm not an engineer.
