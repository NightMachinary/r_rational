  Please excuse my nagging, but I base this on having some expertise in this regard: it is easy to produce voltage, since it is simply a measure of differences in electrical charge. Static electricity for instance can easily go into the hundreds of volt of charge. A more apt way to describe the power generative capabilities of Pokemon would include other units, like Joule and Watts (with the former simply describing spending/converting the power of 1 Watt for the duration of 1 Second).

Not at all, thanks for the correction :)

  For a twenty-four hour cycle we need six individuals. If we furthermore assume greatly reduced power consumption (say a magnitude) compared to the US, then each citizen still needs half a pikachu, times six (to cover the day), times two (for off days, safety margin, ...), giving us six pikachu for each person. I gather by your statement that the capability of pokemon increases more on an exponential or logarithmical curve than a geometric one? That'd still cover a lot of pokemon that'd need to be tamed and given incentive to work.

Using pikachu may have been a bad example, since it's a mammal and thus easier to empathize with. Not to say that they wouldn't be used for energy if needed, but most electric farms in the pokemon world would use lower order pokemon like voltorb/electrode and magnemite/magneton, which are much less intelligent and easier to care for.

Not to say it's necessarily always humane to round up thousands of voltorbs and treat them like living batteries, any more than the way we treat cattle in our world is, but for better or worse, they also see the "manmade" pokemon (pokemon that only started appearing after manmade objects they mimic, which would include things like trubbish) in a more proprietary way, easier to rationalize using as they see fit.
