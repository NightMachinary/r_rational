You raise a very good point, Armok.

Why /not/ use all kinds of pokemon supplied, available energy? Ignoring the matter-energy-transformation for now, the very first argument for limiting power generation to electric pokemon would be efficiency. The electricity supplied by pokemon is already easy to handle and convert, whereas indirect means need to be converted into a transferable kind of energy -- most likely electricity. If all things are being the same in pokemon matter/energy generation capabilities, electric kinds would have the simple advantage of having no or at least fewer losses to incur in the harvesting process.

That is not to say such round-about ways weren't used in the history of Pokémon. The time of steam and coal? Water and fire pokemon working in concert.

But the matter generation might be an issue, once pokemon are around long enough. For ball-parking, let's take water type pokemon of all kinds, make them roughly equivalent to dogs and do some back-of-the-envelope calculation: 80 M dogs in US mass about 22 kg water generation capability is higher than actual use, so... say their mass a day on average.

80 million * 22 kg (for density of water this equals 22 litres) = 1760Ml

1760 Megalitre, or 1,760,000 m^{3} .Huh, I'd have expected more than a field of 1 square kilometre filled up to 1.76 metres with water. Even if water types provide 100 times that as an aggressive guess, it'd still be be less than 200m deep. Over time, though... in a year the volume of the conservative guess would be 2/3 of a cubic kilometres (aggressive: 64 km^{3} ). Make that ten-thirtyfold to account for the whole world and we're in the region of 6.4 km^{3} (conservative) to 2000 km^{3} (aggressive; that's Lake Superior every sixth year, or the Black Sea every 283th) per year. And who knows when Pokémon replaced the natural wildlife. 10,000 years ago? Conservative would make that ca. 1/8th of the Black Sea. But looking at the aggressive guess would make that an amount comparable to 1.5% the volume of global sea water.

So. A lot of matter. Sorry for going off on a tangent.
