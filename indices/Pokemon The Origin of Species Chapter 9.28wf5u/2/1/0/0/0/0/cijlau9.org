I already answered mot of those questions; electric Pokemon seems to be dealing with much lower energies than many other types, so even with conversion inefficiency and the need for infrastructure the output per unit of human labor and food in the longer term is VASTLY better. Electric Pokemon are very simple and nice, but they as several people have noticed don't scale to support a civilization. Being able to guide a wave to fill up a hydroelectric dam /does/.

Or take the Machop chain. Specifically notes being willing to do hard work and never getting tired, and throwing around specific heavy objects with one hand, including a /mountain/ for the most evolved form.
