The one you describe would just have Voltorbs put in every individual device, by that reasoning. Yes, you might use something like that for big ships specifically (or more likely, a water Pokemon), much like we use local power generation like diesel for those. But for most things, you'd convert to electricity for a similar reason we do; it's easy to transport and distribute, and the generation is far more efficient at huge centralized facilities. In fact, if Pokemon powered the original trains, and are used for power plants, that might be part of why cars and such are electric and the non-Pokemon related generation is more green.
