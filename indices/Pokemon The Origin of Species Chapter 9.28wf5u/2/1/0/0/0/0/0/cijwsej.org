I assume a certain leeway in the canon descriptions. Juggling mountains is among them, or pushing them, unless you want to imply their arms wouldn't simply penetrate the part of the mountain they're pushing on?

But that reasoning doesn't address the point you raised.

May I address it with a counter-argument that goes a bit meta? Because the way you're currently describing the power generation capabilities, not just electrical but in a more general sense, would lead to a very schizotech world. Ships powered by machoks running in treadmills, that kind of thing. While interesting, such a world is not /intriguing/, but maybe even aggravating. And, based on a gut feeling, prone to stagnation.

So yeah, I agree with you that there are more efficient ways to supply electric power than electro type pokemon. This doesn't mean I'd have to like it, though.
