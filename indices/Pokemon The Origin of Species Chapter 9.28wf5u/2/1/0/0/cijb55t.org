Why does everyone assume /electric/ Pokemon would be used for power generation? Those'd be the /easiest/ and /first/ but the concept of a /power plant/ is that it uses heavy equipment to convert from one form of energy to another.

What you'd use is whatever Pokemon have the greatest power output. Fire Pokemon can boil water. Most water Pokemon can create it and might do so at the top of a tall tower. There are plenty of super-strong, telekinetic, and huge-and-doesn't-need-food Pokemon to basically turn cranks. Some plant Pokemon can cause absurdly fast growth of biomass from nothing and you could just burn that. And this is not getting into what the weirder and more abstract attacks actually are, but since the creation of mass has already been shown there's almost no upper limit.

And then there's the possibility, if containers actually DO turn matter into energy, of turning random rocks or seawater or something into energy and just discarding the information, using it directly for power instead.
