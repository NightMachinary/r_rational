Oh wow, didn't realize this would be your first post :) Welcome, and hope your Reddit experience is a good one; the key from my perspective is to just subscribe to the good subreddits, and, as usual on the internet, ignore the trolls.

On to the questions!

#+begin_quote
  Programmers need to have a reasonable facsimile of pokemon code they can test their prototypes on, or have some back-up measure of the real pokemon code, otherwise they run the danger of seriously endangering the well-being of the physical pokemon. That of course assumes Pokémon has a more serious pokemon cruelty and testing lobby and policy than ours compared to animals.
#+end_quote

There absolutely exists a regulatory body and safeguards in the pokemon world to ensure that some programmer trying to make a quick name for themself doesn't test their code out on live pokemon without meeting some quality assurance standards. The computational power in the pokemon world is immense, so their modeling systems tend to be pretty realistic: most of the catastrophic errors that might occur from editing a pokemon's biology would be caught fairly quickly when testing in simulations.

All that said, there definitely exist those who are willing to cut corners and fly under the radar to speed up the process, thinking little of the well being of the pokemon involved. These people are unlikely to be sadists, and more likely to simply view it as an extension of the usual scientific testing on pokemon to advance our understandings of biology and medicine.

  And now that I think of it, this brings up another thing I always wondered: Do pokemon replace animals, or do they expand the world by a totally different offshoot of biology and evolution?
#+end_quote

Pokemon have completely replaced all non-plant life on earth. I can't say anything more than that without giving away the plot, but evolution by natural selection did indeed occur on earth at one point in history, and still does: it's simply no longer the sole means by which new species arise.

#+begin_quote
  If so... well, you could always say the Pokémon world has years with about 400 days instead of the usual 350. That way they'd still be around the nominal age implied, but be just a tad in physical capability and mental maturity in the bell curve we have in mind, but still perfectly regular in that of the Pokémon world.
#+end_quote

Honestly, the way I see it is that a world as dangerous as pokemon, pretty much everyone is a few standard deviations more intelligent, creative, physically capable, and mature than the average person in our world. Everyone else would have died long before the technology to capture and train pokemon became widespread.

  Though the whole process is probably powered by energy, and that might as easily be the biggest coal power plants ever built; it wouldn't fit the utopian streak of the story, though.
#+end_quote

Pokemon are by far the greatest source of energy in their world: their physics are not our physics, or at the very least they're capable of bending them enough that a small rodent can create thousands of volts of electricity over its lifespan. But they're also a bit more progressive, so renewable energy is the norm pretty much everywhere. I don't know that I'd call their world "utopian," what with monsters running around leveling cities every other year, but it's definitely more technologically advanced in any number of ways.

#+begin_quote
  In regards to the insulated shoes... those I assume to be more prevalent due to a higher chance of electrical mishaps in Pokémon, simply by the abundance of electro type pokemons, but I wouldn't be surprised if insulated over-shoes, like socks for shoes or in the style of crampons, were widely sold. It's much easier to add to your equipment, especially in warmer climates, than an extra pair of shoes.
#+end_quote

I was actually thinking of this, but the idea was just to use the insulating shoes as a replacement. Anything as optional as crampons or socks would need to be worn all the time while in the wild so you'd be ready at any moment, which is far less convenient than even carrying around an extra pair of shoes.

#+begin_quote
  I understand the need for the game mechanic, but can also see at least one technical option that could adapt that in-universe. Like a charge for instance, which is spent by trying to capture a pokemon. If it breaks free, the charge is still spent and the ball needs to be recharged in a pokemon centre.
#+end_quote

Personally I've always seen it as a purely game mechanic that pokemon can escape from their balls once captured at all. When inside, they're transmuted into energy and data: either the ball should be able to hold them, or not. Stronger balls are capable of storing larger pokemon, or pokemon with more energy, but unless you try to use a pokeball on a snorlax or something, the balls won't break.

#+begin_quote
  But I suspect pokemon are hardier than comparable animals (which in turn could ties into the "humans are pokemon-ish" hypothesis).
#+end_quote

This, and the medicine of that world is far more advanced :)

As always, thanks for the questions, and glad you enjoyed the chapter!
