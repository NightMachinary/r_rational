  Pokemon are by far the greatest source of energy in their world: their physics are not our physics, or at the very least they're capable of bending them enough that a small rodent can create thousands of volts of electricity over its lifespan. But they're also a bit more progressive, so renewable energy is the norm pretty much everywhere.

Please excuse my nagging, but I base this on having some expertise in this regard: it is easy to produce voltage, since it is simply a measure of differences in electrical charge. Static electricity for instance can easily go into the hundreds of volt of charge. A more apt way to describe the power generative capabilities of Pokemon would include other units, like Joule and Watts (with the former simply describing spending/converting the power of 1 Watt for the duration of 1 Second).

If pokemon are truly the biggest source of power in the Pok√©mon world, wouldn't that require huge farms of them, with subsequently larger farms for feed? I can reason, of course, there being a more decentralised system of power distribution, which would cut on the size necessary, but the humane treatment of the pokemon would require them to be given the chance to rest, have free days or days off during mating season, and more. Let's speculate: We assume a pikachu can produce about 300 Watts steadily, for about four hours a day, without exhausting the individual. For a twenty-four hour cycle we need six individuals. If we furthermore assume greatly reduced power consumption (say a magnitude) compared to the US, then each citizen still needs half a pikachu, times six (to cover the day), times two (for off days, safety margin, ...), giving us six pikachu for each person. I gather by your statement that the capability of pokemon increases more on an exponential or logarithmical curve than a geometric one? That'd still cover a lot of pokemon that'd need to be tamed and given incentive to work.

This whole conjecture by me supports your handling of the insulated shoes, though :)
