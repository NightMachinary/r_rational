  Well, they are psychic type, so them not being linked seems odd to me. And they can't talk to eachother at all: none of the pokemon in my world are capable of talking to eachother like in the anime. It's based more off the games. So them being psychically linked allows a level of coordination that other pokemon working in a group might lack, reinforcing that the orgy of exeggcute are considered one pokemon (so one can't use bullet seed while the other uses leech side while the other uses egg bomb while the other uses confusion, etc).

Another thing I didn't know, psychically linking them is only appropriate then.

    No, I (personally) would have limited psychic moves to pokemon of that type, though the move shadow claw being available to charmander certainly implies there not being any real objection.

  I strongly considered this actually, but in the end decided that it would be taking too easy a route for convenience, and greatly limited the strategy and tactical potential of pokemon battles. Thus did I have to explain how TMs work to rationalize how pokemon like charmander could learn Shadow Claw.

Am I correct to assume the Shadow Claw limits the psychic use to the move and doesn't grant the charmander psychic communication abilities? That's how I understood it at least; non-psychic pokemon use animal analogue behaviuour and postures to "communicate" and TM-enhanced pokemon are limited to using TM-specific changes only with their TM moves, or at least very closely associated with it.

  Thanks, I think I am going to go with your explanation of the biology :)

Hopefully only when appropriate; while I like well-researched works as well as the next one, shoehorning that knowledge in is kind of bad style, I think.
