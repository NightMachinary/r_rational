Well, I didn't address this since I forgot to, but the container I thought of being, well, multi-storage to a degree. Not many, but a few. It would be evolutionary consistent with the way our muscles work, and the fuel supplied to them (there are some, all running parallel with different efficiency peaks at different times). I thought they'd have about one or two instant charges in the container, by then the charger would start up supplying enough power and they could use charges with relative abundance, but after a minute you'd note their increasing breathing and the frequency and power level would decrease, but remain at a balance.

You'd simply want to have a power you're capable of and rely on to be on your beck and call instantly. Electro is a major investment, biologically speaking, so they'd have some measure for instant access, I guess.

I have an idea on the communal individuals, as self-contradictory those seem to be (two cases: Rat-king; true individual, apparent commune), and might be able to advise you with the consistency and science issue of the biological side, if such is wanted. Keep in mind though, that I don't have my degree in biology, yet.
