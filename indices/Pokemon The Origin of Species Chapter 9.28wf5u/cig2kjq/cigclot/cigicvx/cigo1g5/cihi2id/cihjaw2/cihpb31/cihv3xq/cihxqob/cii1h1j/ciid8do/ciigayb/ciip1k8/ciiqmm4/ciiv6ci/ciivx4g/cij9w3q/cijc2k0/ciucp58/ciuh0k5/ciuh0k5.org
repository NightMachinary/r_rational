  Am I correct to assume the Shadow Claw limits the psychic use to the move and doesn't grant the charmander psychic communication abilities? That's how I understood it at least; non-psychic pokemon use animal analogue behaviuour and postures to "communicate" and TM-enhanced pokemon are limited to using TM-specific changes only with their TM moves, or at least very closely associated with it.

  Hopefully only when appropriate; while I like well-researched works as well as the next one, shoehorning that knowledge in is kind of bad style, I think.

For the biology of the exeggcute specifically I mean :)
