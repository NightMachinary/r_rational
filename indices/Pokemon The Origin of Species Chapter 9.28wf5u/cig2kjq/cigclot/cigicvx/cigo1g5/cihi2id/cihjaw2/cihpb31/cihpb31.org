That harnessing would still require tremendous technological effort. In our world one of the impossibilities to do that is the unpredictability of lightning strikes, in power range, location and other parameters; those would obviously be less / not relevant for tamed pokemon. Of the top of my head I can only think of one method to effectively utilise lightning as a power source, and that is indirectly. If it were used electrolytically with specifically chosen reactants the products of such reactions might react back to the original reactants (releasing heat, for instance). You'd have a double loss to energy transfer in this case (lightning+reactants to products, products to reactants+energy), sure, but it might work, depending on tech level. A more physical approach might be charging the biggest capacitor ever and gradually using that charge. This is more of an engineering problem than a scientific one.

Be that as it may, I actually thought in a different vein. I remember in the anime at some point they stuck suction caps to Pikachu's cheeks and it might have powered something, but I'm not sure. This illustrates my idea quite well, though; you don't need to use lightning, unless the pokemon physique is bizarrely off-charts. It ought to suffice to drain the charge off the pokemon as it builds up. Like I said in my previous comment, the pokemon attacks seem to be mostly lightning, so constituted of high voltage with decent amperage. I deem it unlikely pokemon are capable of instantaneously generating a charge of that magnitude, or always keeping one handy. (This is of course an assumption I make based on my knowledge of biology, which makes it biased in regards to pokemon biology.) More likely than not they build up the charge as needed, the energy being supplied by their body by metabolites. As those get used up, the pokemon fatigue. If one can train the pokemon to build up a low charge, one their metabolism can keep maintaining even once we drain it, we're set. It might even be a relatively level of voltage thus produced, though it would still need to be smoothed for consumer use and such.

And since I am already on the topic, let me speculate further on the electro capabilities of pokemon.

Based on my assumption before (building up a charge as needed instead of maintaining one at the ready) I assume to be two-three kinds of organs in of note in electro-pokemon: a charger and a container and a preparer. The charger would, as the name implies, supply base voltage and amperage, or in other words, power the process actually giving the electro-pokemon their unique capabilities. It is connected to the next organ by something highly conductive. The container would be the biological equivalent of a hybrid capacitor / inductor. It would hold the charge supplied by the charger. It's make-up would require an insulating tissue on the outer layer that would protect the pokemon from its own charge. The preparer might be close to the container, but has to be at least connected to it in some facility. The reason for this is the function it fulfils: It reduces the (electrical) resistance to the target, or increases the conductivity, it's really all the same. It might be some kind of string that'd ionise the air around it (high-frequent voltage changes, for instance, or some highly ionising reaction with air, ...), to name one example. There are multiple ways to accomplish either, really, and for the most part I'm talking about function, not mechanism of those organs. Furthermore it can be taken for granted electro-pokemon have either a highly conductive exterior, making electrical attacks ineffective; a highly reduced amount of electrolytes or other physiological means to deal with electrical charges (my favourite); or something different.

Based on this speculation I might actually speculate further (this is bat country, I know): The capacity of charger and container might correlate with the natural environment and behaviour of the pokemon in question. Herd electro-pokemon like magnemite would be weaker, since they could voltron their defence capabilities (highly conductive skin?). Pokemon in (predatory) packs would be intermediate (using electro attacks for hunt, to defend hunting grounds against rivalling packs, ...). Pokemon living mostly solitary lives I would place highest in capability, simply due to the danger, using electro as defence and offence for that having to gap the biggest distance by their attacks.

Aaand reading on Bulbapedia on Jolteon just implied every cell taking part in the build-up, making at the very least the charger organ nothing more than intellectual navel-gazing. Oh well.
