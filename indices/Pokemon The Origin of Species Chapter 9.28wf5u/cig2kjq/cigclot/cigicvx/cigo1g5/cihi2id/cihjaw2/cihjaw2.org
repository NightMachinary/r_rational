  Because that is what I always assumed most of the electro attacks to be, something akin to directed lightning.

This is a good point, as there are definitely pokemon capable of calling actual lightning that would be a huge boon to energy production with the right technology to harness it. Most electric attacks are not nearly as powerful as a lightning bolt, but the more evolved pokemon could definitely use that as their major contribution to energy productin.
