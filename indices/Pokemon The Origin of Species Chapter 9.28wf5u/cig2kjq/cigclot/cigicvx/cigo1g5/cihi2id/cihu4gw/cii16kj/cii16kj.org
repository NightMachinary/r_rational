I'm sorry I didn't see your comment earlier, rp20, or I would have addressed it then instead of at this later time.

I assumed the matter-energy-tech to work by somehow shortcutting the whole conversion thing, making that a special case of a more general principle the world didn't crack yet. Assume they, for some unfathomable reason, can convert matter to some kind of storable energy and back with relatively little energy cost for the conversion process. Thus they circumnavigate the full conversion problem, as well as the simply matter replicator issue. Instead of having the capability to convert a kilogram of stuff into megatons of TNT equivalent they can convert a kilogram of specific stuff to some kind of storable energy. Maybe that works by shunting the energy into small pocket universes, I don't know. I'm not a physicist, and albeit I have a curiosity in that field, the equations frankly scare me. My point being, they don't need to have the full conversion theory for a special case to be available for them. For an example look no further than newtonian dynamics being a special use case of relativity (I don't know if special or general) at very low fractions of the speed of light; at least I remember this being the case.

Personally I am loathe to hand-wave in my universes and the universes I work in, and often work out hypotheses that reduce the number of necessary hand-waves. That being the case I am aware of the inordinate amount of waving that already happened within Pok√©mon. I am not averse to seeing the games as a game mechanic adaptation of the "real" version, and the anime and manga as dramatisations of stories that happened in the same. If I can think of ways to make game mechanics and story depictions believable extrapolations of a "real" version, I do so. That's my philosophy in a nutshell.
