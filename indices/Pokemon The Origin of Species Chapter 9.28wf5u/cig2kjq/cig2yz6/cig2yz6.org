  I had and still have an irrational and severe dislike of this particular social network

I tend to think of Reddit as a microcosm of the internet at large - there are some incredibly cool people doing excellent things, there's a bulk of normal folks reading/viewing and discussing, and there's an unpleasant undercurrent of trolls with a variety of bigoted views that they have the freedom to air under cover of anonymity.

[[/r/rational]] is thankfully much more the former than the latter. So... yeah, welcome, we don't bite.

Quite the detailed review, you make some good points.
