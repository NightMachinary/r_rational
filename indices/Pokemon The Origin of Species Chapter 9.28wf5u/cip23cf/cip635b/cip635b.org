Thanks, glad you're enjoying it!

Hopefully at some point I can speed up my writing table, but right now most of my time is taken up by work, a novel I'm hoping to get published soon, and a board game that I'm trying to get on kickstarter.

So far I've only got a rough idea of a story for Gold/Silver, using that game's MCs as the main focus, but as for Hoenn, the events of Ruby/Sapphire apparently occur at the same time as Red/Blue according to a number of sources online, so there may be some overlap there :)
