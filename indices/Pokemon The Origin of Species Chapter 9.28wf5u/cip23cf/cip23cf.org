I really enjoy this fic. The discussions and worldbuilding to make the Pokemon world more rational are really nice to see, and my only complaint is having to wait a month for each chapter :) By the time you're done, a few years might have passed, and that's presuming you only do Kanto. That brings up a good point, actually. Will you do the other regions, with either the current MC's or the game MC's as protagonists?
