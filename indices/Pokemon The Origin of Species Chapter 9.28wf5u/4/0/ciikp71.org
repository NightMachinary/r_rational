The way I see it the move restriction is entirely a game conceit, for tactical reasons more than anything, so I have no intention of restricting pokemon moves to four :) Charmander isn't going to forget how to scratch an opponent just because he learned how to use flamethrower.

That said, there might be a "core" set of moves that most trainers use for their pokemon as a matter of what's reinforced the most often. How wide a pool that is depends entirely on how smart the pokemon is (so how many commands they can remember) and how dedicated the trainer is (for how much effort they put into the training).
