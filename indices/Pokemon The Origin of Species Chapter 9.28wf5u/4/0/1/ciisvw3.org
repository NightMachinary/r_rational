The way you have set up the Pokemon League, with the constant switching of pokemon, it wouldn't be unlikely that artificial limits on "number of different moves" used per battle are put in place, at least at the E4 or Gyms, as a way of driving creativity, and not allowing wealthy trainers to just load out on coverage TMs or Tutor moves (what i'm assuming you're basing the coding machines on) and basically being set for any battle.

This leads me to another question. Are there any regulatory pressures that define what a "Scratch" attack is compared to a "Slash". I bring this up because I remember earlier in the story Red was looking at his pokedex, and it mentioned specific techniques like Ember and Smokescreen for his Charmander. Say the 'typical' Slash attack, as approved for Competitive battle by the Pokemon League, has the pokemon swiping once with a single claw. If the trainer trains her pokemon to instead swipe simultaneously with both claws, is it still a Slash attack, or something else. Or is this all just similar to the type chart Meme.
