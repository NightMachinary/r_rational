I was wondering if you would restrict Pokemon to four moves like in the games, or allow them to expand their movesets like in the anime?

You seem to have many of your ideas based off the games, but part of me feels like that would make the story less flexible

Thanks and I've been waiting for this to come out for a while. You do some great work.
