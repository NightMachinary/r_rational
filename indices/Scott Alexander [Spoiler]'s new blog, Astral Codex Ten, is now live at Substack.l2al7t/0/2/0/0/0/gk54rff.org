Notable in this context is that Gwern went private recently because he's followed by Musk of SpaceX/Tesla/etc. fame (he said he's tied of getting asked to plug stuff). They are lso know for "this waifu does not exist" and more recently on hacker news "this anime does not exist" (Machine learning generation of anime faces and body/characters respectively).

Their website is one of the most exhaustive and systematic investigations of whatever strikes his fancy.

*caveat: I don't know or correspond with Gwern. I don't read their stuff half as deeply as I should, but if you plan to skim their site for five minutes make sure you have at least two hours free.
