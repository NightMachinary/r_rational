Scott has a list of his most popular articles on [[https://astralcodexten.substack.com/about][the about page]].

I recommend checking [[https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/][Slate Star Codex Abridged]] for a great collection of his essays. My favourite was [[https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Beware-Isolated-Demands-For-Rigor][Beware Isolated Demands For Rigor]].

As another commenter mentioned, he wrote [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]].

I'll add that some other (shorter) stories he has written include [[https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/And-I-Show-You-How-Deep-The-Rabbit-Hole-Goes][...And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes]], [[https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/It-Was-You-Who-Made-My-Blue-Eyes-Blue][It Was You Who Made My Blue Eyes Blue]], and [[https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Universal-Love-Said-The-Cactus-Person][Universal Love, Said The Cactus Person]].
