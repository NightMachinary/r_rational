I admit that I am not a historian, but to the best of my knowledge the socioeconomic inequality of today is absolutely dwarfed by what it was at the later parts of the 19th century, and the creation thereof was driven by the political elite rather than grassroots. (The extension of the regulatory state to include labor law was grassroot-driven, on the other hand, and wildly more violent than modern historiography does credit to.)

There certainly wasn't a /more educated/ public then than there is today; perhaps a less mal-educated one, but even then, I'm dubious.
