I read a lot of articles that show all of the similarities between Trump and Adolf Hitler. It has me so scared. I have many friends who are Hispanic, Muslim, and LGBTP and I am literally shaking knowing that on January 21st there is a good chance that they will all be rounded up in concentration camps and sent to the gas chambers. He was endorsed by the KKK and alt-right extremism is on the rise. I am most concerned about how this affects the younger generations. During thanksgiving dinner I had to yell at my young niece who mentioned that Pepe was her favorite "meme." I firmly explained to her that Pepe was a symbol of racism and made her delete all of the Pepes from her phone. Her parents actually defended her when she started crying, which was a horrifying revelation about how you can never tell who is a deeply closeted racist/Trump supporter until it is too late. Our youth are being radicalized. I have contacted CPS for my niece, and am thinking of moving to Sweden to be somewhere more tolerant. At least when the nuclear bombs fall, I will die standing up for what is right.
