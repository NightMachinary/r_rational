This is a misleading exaggeration of Scott's argument ([[https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/][here]] and [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/29/dogs-and-wolves-in-defense-of-some-past-posts/][here]]), which was that during the campaign and the early part of his presidency, Trump's statements and actions did not fit a relatively specific definition of racism (basically, that he didn't hate non-white people or consider them inferior *just* based on their race). Scott did not deny that Trump's actions were partly based on racial bias:

#+begin_quote
  [Trump]'s at least anti-undocumented immigrant, which is close to being anti-immigrant. And while one can argue that “anti-immigrant” is different than “racist”, I would agree that probably nobody cares that much about British or German immigrants, suggesting that some racial element is involved. ... You can argue that he and his supporters are biased for caring more about terrorism ... . But do you see how there's a difference between “cognitive bias that makes you unreasonably afraid” versus “white supremacy”? ... Let me say this for the millionth time. I'm not saying Trump doesn't have some racist attitudes and policies.

Scott's main point was that people criticizing him as 'white supremacist' or 'openly racist' were exaggerating to the point of blatant falsehood, and that racial bias and outright white supremacy should not be conflated:

#+begin_quote
  /Aren't there a lot of voters who, although not willing to vote for David Duke or even willing to express negative feelings about black people on a poll, still have implicit racist feelings, the kind where they're nervous when they see a black guy on a deserted street at night?/ Probably. And this is why I am talking about crying wolf. If you wanted to worry about the voter with subconscious racist attitudes carefully hidden even from themselves, you shouldn't have used the words “openly white supremacist KKK supporter” like a verbal tic.

Obviously the way Trump has acted since those posts were published has changed, meaning that parts of Scott's argument no longer apply (e.g. on January 6 Trump clearly did ally with actual white supremacists) and his prioritization of criticizing hyperbolic criticism of Trump seems more questionable, but with the information available at the beginning of Trump's administration, Scott's argument generally made sense, and considering how critical Scott has been of Trump there and elsewhere, it does not make sense to interpret Scott as trying to "defend" Trump in any sense broader than saying he wasn't a literal white supremacist.
