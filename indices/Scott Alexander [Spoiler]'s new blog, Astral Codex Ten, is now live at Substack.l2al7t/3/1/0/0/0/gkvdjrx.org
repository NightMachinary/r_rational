Did I say anything about whether or not he publicly supported other politicians? No. What I said is that he defended noted racist and white supremacist Donald Trump as being not that racist - which is not the case. This is clearly the case - he was specifically racist against Mexicans during his campaigning, he has historically been incredibly racist against black folks (y'know, the whole central park five thing, where he spent thousands of dollars taking out an ad to sway public opinion to reinstate the death penalty for them), I mean you can literally go on. Donald Trump was a specifically very racist President - and his alliance with white supremacist groups culminated in the whole storming the Capitol thing and led to a massive increase of white supremacist acts.
