Creating that regulatory system and enforcing it's dictates requires getting other people to /want/ to let that happen or punishing those who don't until they change their minds.

Legal penalties do have their place for punishing bad choices, but that is only sustainable if we can offer alternative good choices we can reward them for. Punishment cannot be our only response when others commit a wrong, or it just becomes an endless feedback loop of punishments.

You end up needing a regulatory system already to ensure that you can enforce the building of the new regulatory system that replaces it. That's what happens when you rely too much on disincentivizing the behaviors you don't want and not incentivizing the behaviors you do want.
