It doesn't misrepresent what he said, it just doesn't give him the most charitable interpretation possible - a thing I'm not convinced he really deserves, given the degree to which he had no problem letting people use his platform as a way to propagate beliefs regarding HBD and other pseudoscientific alt-right beliefs. I mean, to be honest, at this point Scott (and Gwern and really most of these people who ran in these circles) have had their audience move more and more towards being composed mostly of alt-right folks so it's probably pointless but there are still some people out there who either didn't read SSC or otherwise aren't aware of Scott's history and relationship with the alt-right which has of course always been exactly at arm's reach and no nearer or further.
