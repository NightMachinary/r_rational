It's funny, because I'm definitely not alt right, and I follow both Gwern and SSC. Poly, healthcare, gay, government spending all cool with me. I've read your source material and despite my best attempts at Steel manning your criticisms all I have got is that we should deplatform gwern and ssc because they haven't met your standards of discussion moderation.

Maybe you have unrealistic expectations of people with platforms. Or maybe you don't like your thought leaders to challenge you. I'd do more introspection instead of tilting at windmills, there are no giants here.
