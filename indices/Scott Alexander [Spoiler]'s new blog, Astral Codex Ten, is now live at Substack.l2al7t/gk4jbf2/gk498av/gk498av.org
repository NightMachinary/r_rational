In submitting this as a post, instead of an Open Thread comment, I'm knowingly skirting the scope of the subreddit - nominally, works and discussion of rational fiction - which this is strictly speaking outside of. Still, it's new (and good) content pertaining to the continued activity of a notable ratfic author, so I hope the post is allowed to stand.
