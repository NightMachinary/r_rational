Meditations on Moloch's explanation isn't all that complicated. If you strip away the poetry, here it is:

1. If a market optimizes for Thing X, it will anti-optimize for all other things.
2. Some of those things have value to humans. It would be bad if all of those things were optimized away.
3. There definitionally isn't a market-based solution for this.
4. Conveniently, governments exist and can legislate & regulate to shape outcomes.
