I'm really not sure what, in a practical sense, any of what you said means. Perhaps it's nice to understand the values and concerns of the resource extraction industries, but as an example, society benefits from not having ash ponds leaking heavy metals into the groundwater. To stop that, you need to either enact and enforce government regulation or start shooting executives, and I don't really see how "create the regulatory state, enforce its dictates" fits into the prisoner's dilemma model.
