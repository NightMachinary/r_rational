Yes. But that regulatory state was probably created when there was less socioeconomic inequality than there is now. Back then the public had enough power to get the government to form those agencies to hold corporations accountable even if only a little bit. And the public also had sufficient education to understand why those agencies were necessary to make.

That isn't the situation we're living in today. Regulatory states which benefit the public don't just happen on their own automatically. There are mechanisms behind their formation and maintenance.
