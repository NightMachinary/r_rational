Conveniently, we built a regulatory state because people /do/ in fact want OSHA and the EPA and the FAA to exist, and businesses which don't violate those regulations get the reward of extracting value out of their workers and/or their comparative advantage.

Ideally, the reward for not violating the law, when you're a CEO, is that you get to keep being a CEO. It's a pretty sweet gig, even before the exorbitant pay. This only works when the government and the regulatory agencies enforce the law, because otherwise the /punishment/ for not violating the law (or for not extracting maximum value out of the commons to the detriment of society) is that you are replaced with someone who will. Which is what Mammon is about.
