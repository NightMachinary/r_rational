The accumulation of power and status usually is also just a means. Not all of them want power purely for power's sake. Power that doesn't have a purpose to use it for is useless.

Perhaps they want it to make them feel safer? What other ways are there to make them safer or to assure them of their safety?

Is it to advance the mental and material wealth and freedom of society via new technological innovations? Are there any other ways they can increase society's mental and material wealth and freedom without needing to rely on techniques with such large negative long-term side effects?

Are they indirectly destroying people, property and infrastructure in order to roll back liberal-type social progress so that conservatives are no longer so behind, so that we can return to an environment that they are better adapted to? Then how can you enable conservatives to build infrastructure which allows them to make independent social progress of their own, so that they no longer feel like they need to tear down liberal-type social progress to keep up?
