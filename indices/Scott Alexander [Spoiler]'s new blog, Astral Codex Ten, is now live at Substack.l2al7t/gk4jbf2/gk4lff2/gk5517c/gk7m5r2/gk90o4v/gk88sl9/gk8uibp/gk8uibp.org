It's easy! As long as the person you're explaining to has read the Sequences and has some familiarity with the rest of the rationalsphere canon. If they haven't, I dunno what to tell you, man.

I was able to explain Moloch to my wife, but she made out with Aubrey de Grey at a party, a few years before we met; and she's smarter than I am; the exception that proves the “haven't read the sequences” rule.
