Convergent evolution. Humans and dogs both fit into the same niche, so they could travel and hunt together and keep up with each other. Cats had to wait until humans created a niche they could fit into.

If we hadn't domesticated dogs would we have domesticated cats or horses?

There's a sorta-webfic out there about how human's relationship with other species is seen as really weird by other galactic civilizations. I might have caught it on HFY or something.
