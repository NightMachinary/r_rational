Assuming that you understand both chimps and dogs...

Fearing chimps is definitely appropriate because we recognize that chimps are a lot like us mentally. They are frequently unpredictable because they are both intelligent and occasionally irrational, no matter how much time you spend training them.

Dogs, on the other hand are nothing like us mentally. Unless they are in pain, diseased, or have a history of being abused, a trained dog is absurdly rational, a lot less smart than us, and predictable.
