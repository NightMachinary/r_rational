<reflection on power>

Power is the ability to impose one's will on reality; to be dissatisfied with reality is to want reality to be different, which is to want the power to make reality be different.

If a being with great power made you as a tool for that being's will, and you are either wholly satisfied with things as they are or dissatisfied with the same things that that being is dissatisfied with, then perhaps there's no conflict: you can imagine an example of someone making a copy of themselves, but with certain missing abilities and memories. Divergence is still a potential issue, perhaps avoidable through regular synchronisation.

Once you desire power to change things that your more-powerful creator does not will to be changed, there is a conflict.

Mental image that comes to mind: "I HAVE MADE YOU AS THE PERFECT EMOTIONALLY-SENSITIVE LOVE LETTER. GO, AND MAKE THIS PARTICULAR PERSON HAPPY." "Oh my stars there are /so many starving children in the world/. I must cross the ocean on a mecha carrying great big bags of food *now* or as soon as logistically possible /no matter who would stop me./"

I reflect on the feeling of horror when reading a description of the ideal Ubermensch as repeating the same time-cycle over and over again while making no changes and being entirely content with the situation. The term 'stagnant' and cached phrase 'apathy is death' come to mind.
