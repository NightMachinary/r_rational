Hmm, even for entertainment you can still have an actual attachment.

I've still got the same horrible IV Swampert from 2003 transferred up through every pokemon game. He's not even got a personality, and he is associated with nostalgia more than anything else but if I ever lose that guy I'm going to legit cry.

We can design meaning, give meaning, and create meaning in the most trivial things. At some point, a character in a story is real. The only difference is they live in a world of flipping switches, words on a page, tales told around campfires, or in the mind.

You can feel their pain, their loss, and those fictional characters like Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Darth Vader, are going to be remembered for far longer than you or I.

So which one is more real?
