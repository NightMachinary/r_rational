One of the thing I read that stuck (I think it's from Bernard Werber) is the list of the Great Vexations. Something like this:

- When humanity learned that Earth wasn't the center of the universe.
- When humanity learned it evolved from monkeys instead of being made after the image of a God.
- When humanity realized it could never travel faster than light.
- When humanity realized there is no greater purpose to life; only to reproduce indefinitely.
- When humanity began to suspect there was nothing beyond death, and especially not justice.
- When humanity began to suspect there was nothing more to consciousness than the illusion of it.

The more we learn about reality, the more it lets us down. Reality is boring on a fundamental level.

I'm citing it (rather poorly) from memory but I'm sure you get the idea. We tend to see ourselves as brains piloting meat mechas. The biological reality is more crude: we are a simple pair of gonades. They evolved some complicated organ we take great pride in, but the end-goal of a brain is to get genes mixed as much and as long as possible.

We are slaves to ourself. We are slave to any and all biochemical imbalance in our blood. We are slave to hard-coded primal urges buried deep in the core of our brain.

This is why art and storytelling are so important: they allow us to forge our own meaning. At first making art was probably the same as a bird song: yet another way of getting laid. But I feel like somewhere along the way we tricked our own reproductive instinct into making something greater. Or something we /believe/ to be greater. Not that it makes any difference: since there is no God, we are the guy in charge so /we/ get to decide what's important and what's not.

In the end, I don't feel it's important wether we're simulated or created for unrequited love or non-existent. I don't think our creativity could be artificial and I don't think any existential crisis will invalidate my experience of what I believe to be reality; my inner world of sensations and experiences. Well that's about as legitimate as it could get, coming from a virgin shut-in nerd but my philosophy is to take solace anywhere I can.
