I think this year will be my fifth or sixth time participating, and I've only succeeded once (last year). I wrote Naruto fanfiction that time, and I think it really helped to have a large body of background characters and plot to draw from. (Basically it's about an ambiguously-good!Sasuke Peggy Sue)

I have several other ideas for Naruto fanfiction, one of them rational, and I'm considering picking that one up to try this year. Would love to get involved with some kind of group thing here, if it happens.
