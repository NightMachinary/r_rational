Brilliant thread. [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][This]] is pretty inspiring, and I'm gonna try my hand at RaNaNoWriMo this year. Thanks for the discussion, [[/u/ciderk]]!

Also, I recommend a followup brainstorming post sometime next month, and frequent-ish update threads in November. I'm really interested in seeing what this community writes, and will probably need a reminder for myself. :)
