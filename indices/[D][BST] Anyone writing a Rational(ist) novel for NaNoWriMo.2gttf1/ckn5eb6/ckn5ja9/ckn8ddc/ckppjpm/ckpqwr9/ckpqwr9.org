I sent this to [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] a few days ago via PM but I like what you wrote much better:

--------------

*RaNaNoWriMo discussion, {Start Date} to {End Date} - Brainstorming and Planning* (we could then think about changing up the title every week to give the thread some added panache, if you wanted)

This is a weekly thread designed to discuss Rational/Rationalist works of fiction being created for [[http://nanowrimo.org][National Novel Writing Month]] (NaNoWriMo for short), an annual event challenging people to write a 50,000 word novel during the month of november. All related discussion is welcome here, including brainstorming, progress updates, moral support, requests for feedback, etc.

(link to prior thread)

--------------

I like your idea of something like once every 3-5 days to encourage people to continue to post updates and such. Of course I guess a lot of this depends on how many people are definitely planning on participating in discussions here regarding their progress.

I also sort of thought we might want to start before Nov 1st (maybe one stick for all of October?), in case people wanted to start the discussions regarding brainstorming, outlining, etc. But perhaps we should just keep using this thread until the volume make such a need apparent.
