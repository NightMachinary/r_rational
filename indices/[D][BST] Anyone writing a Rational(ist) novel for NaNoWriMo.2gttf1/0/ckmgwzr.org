I'm doing prewriting for NaNo right now, actually. It's going to be a fairly stripped down fantasy story (following Dan Harmon's [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][story circle]] method). So far, I've got:

- "Dark" wizards who are only really "dark" in the sense that they give answers to ethical problems in ways that are utilitarian but go against social norms.

- Battle nuns that get their powers from following an overly rigorous moral code (which has exploitable loopholes).

- The ability to enter the mental realm and interact with memories, ideas, etc. in physical form (basically, the concept of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci][method of loci]] taken to the extreme, with magic tossed in).

And some other stuff. What time I'm not spending on other projects, I'm spending filling up a doc with notes for when NaNo starts, as I've had difficulty in the past with inventing characters out of thin air or changing my mind about how something works at the last moment when I'm writing for speed instead of quality. The opening/prologue chapter was written long ago, and I think I've only just gotten to the point where I know the story that goes with it - you can read that short opening bit [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdueoKCpOwienqc7qEa6n9XCsoiY7_1MgU589r6Hlq0/edit?usp=sharing][here]].

Edit: With that said, I think that NaNo is probably not the best time to write rational, since /ideally/ that takes research and planning. I'm specifically going with fantasy so that I don't have to look up travel times, dates, names, laws, etc. Historical research is basically right out, unless you're already very familiar with the period, or you're willing to get a lot of things wrong.
