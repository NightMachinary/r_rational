Well, ideally the writing is of a high enough quality that nothing happens explicitly because the plot demands it - everything is so organic that you would never pattern-match it to a story, and even if you did know that you were in a story, it wouldn't change your actions.

There's also the serious risk that you will end up "[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WronggenreSavvy][Wrong Genre Savvy]]".
