If this is one of the first things you're writing, I'd highly suggest using Harmon's story circle method above. It's sort of an adaptation of Joseph Campbell's monomyth, but where Campbell was saying "this is the recurrent structure that I see in human myths", Harmon is saying "this is the recurrent structure in myths because it's what works". He's quite explicit about the fact that he's taking advantage of flaws/features of the human brain in order to make pleasing stories. So when you're planning your plot (which I highly suggest that you do), you would go:

1. A character is in a zone of comfort,
2. But they want something.
3. They enter an unfamiliar situation,
4. Adapt to it,
5. Get what they wanted,
6. Pay a heavy price for it,
7. Then return to their familiar situation,
8. Having changed.

And then in your outline, you just make a single line for each of those.

1. The characters are raiding dungeons for loot,
2. But they lack for a purpose.
3. They find out that the Other they've been raiding aren't so different,
4. Offer to help the Other clear up the misunderstanding,
5. Get loot/skills from the Other,
6. Find out that their kingdom is Evil (one of them dies),
7. They return to the dungeon as it's being raided by the kingdom,
8. And act in defense of the Other.

You could flesh that out to 50K words fairly easily, especially as you add in twists and turns (one of the characters betrays the others in exchange for loot, they have long conversations about the differing values systems of the Other, they have long conversations about how the kingdom should act, etc.). This is essentially storytelling on easy mode.
