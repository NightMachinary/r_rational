My computer decided to stop working right before RaNoWriMo began, so I was forced to drop that plan. I ended up going with something that didn't require vast quantities of research and a computer with which to view/organize it, as I had to do the typing on my phone. A pain, to be sure.

I have the first chapter, though, if you want to see it. It's possible I'll get back to it, but at the moment it's on the back burner as i work on my original fiction.
