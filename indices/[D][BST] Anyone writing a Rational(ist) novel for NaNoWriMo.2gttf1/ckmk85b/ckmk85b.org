Yeah, I'm doing a full rewrite (all original words) of my first ever NaNoWriMo novel-chunk. It was a mess and I know I can do much, much better now. My goal is to hit 50k by the 15th and actually double-NaNo this year, ending with a complete modern fantasy novel rough draft.

--------------

A horrible single-sentence mashup pitch is:

#+begin_quote
  Dead Poets Society meets Revolutionary Girl Utena at rational-Hogwarts (as run by Shadowrun Megacorps), set in a modern day, slow-takeoff magical singularity world, with a ('79 novel) The Dead Zone-like-powers Severus Snape-style teacher as the outsider protagonist.
#+end_quote

Wow. That...was both awesome and really stupid written out like that.

Soooo, I'd be down for a [[/r/rational]] NaNo brainstorming group.
