I want to. I've never actually managed to do NaNoWriMo (November is consistently the month where my projects go to die), and I don't have access to my most convenient writing device (Note to self: never order anything through disability services less than a month in advance).

Anyway, I want to rewrite [[http://planetseva.com/][my terrible self-published Marysuetopia Science Fiction novel from 9th grade]] to make some sense, wipe out the idiot balls, and clean up whatever atrocious tech exploits I left open (EX: spacecraft propulsion systems must have mandatory safeguards against being converted into kinetic bombs, space compression is not a perfect solution to everything, and something something transhumanism). I did a rewrite a couple years ago, but it kinda unraveled toward the end (especially when I decided the villain was too smart to monologue, and thus the ending didn't make any sense). The RATIONAL!version I expect to look considerably different, since I want to play with an explicitly rationalist character without removing the flaws from the wannabe rationalist from the original.

(Though I'd still like feedback on the 2012 version. The RATIONAL!version is effectively a completely different story with some characters/locations in common, but I expect I could gain something from an Aspiring Rationalist's criticism just the same.)
