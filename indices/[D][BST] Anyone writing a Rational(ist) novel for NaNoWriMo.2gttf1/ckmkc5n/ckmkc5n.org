I'm probably going to be writing novel-stuff during NaNoWriMo... It's just going to be part of the book I started well before November started, so it doesn't actually qualify for being part of the event. :)

Good luck to all of you who join in the thing - I look forward to whatever's created by anyone who's a member of this subreddit. :)
