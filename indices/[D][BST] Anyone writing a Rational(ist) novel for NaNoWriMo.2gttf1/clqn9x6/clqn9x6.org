I plan on getting back to writing [[http://mirrorverse.wordpress.com/about/][Watchmirror]], which is a rationalist fiction set in a universe with technology that's about to the level of the 1890s and has magic.

The magic in the universe is thoroughly fleshed out, as is the driving mystery. It is a solvable mystery, and I encourage people to take stabs at it.

It centers around several characters living in the city of Port Drebon.

/Amalia di Danti/ is the daughter of a high-ranking government official, and is trying to both earn the respect of her parents and improve quality of life by changing their country's laws with regards to magic users. In doing so, she starts uncovering a conspiracy that started thirty years ago. She's a so called "rational" character, though it's never explicitly said that she is using rationalist techniques.

/Irene Morgan/ is a revolutionary who is attempting to reduce the likelihood the world will end. She serves as the another rationalist character. Her story follows her rise to power (or her fall from power, depending on her choices.)

/Titus di Danti/ is a high ranking government official and is attempting to quell the rebellion and prevent the loss of life that would be the final result of the rebellion, and he's trying to maintain his position in the government because he is one of the main pieces on the game board that is preventing their country from deciding to go to war, which would be catastrophic.

/Harvey Kane/ is the son of factory workers who wants revenge for the death of his foster father and wants to free the country from the yoke of their oppressive and discriminatory leaders.

The main driving conflicts relate to the nature of magics, and the proper response in reaction to the benefits and threats posed by those magics.
