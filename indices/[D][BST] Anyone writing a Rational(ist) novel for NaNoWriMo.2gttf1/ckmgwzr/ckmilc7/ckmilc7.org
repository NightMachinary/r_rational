That sounds like a pretty interesting concept!

I'm thinking about doing a fantasy story that's something like a deconstruction of fantasy dungeon crawling... A group of adventurers that make a living going into dungeons slaughtering 'monsters' and reclaiming stolen treasure until during a raid on a particular dungeon something happens that makes them question the 'Other'-ness of whomever they're killing. Or something like that.
