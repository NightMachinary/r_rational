Ah, sorry, I didn't even think to look from a post from previous years about this.

Your 'airship merchants and sky pirates' story was too complicated to /get off the ground/? That's too bad =) It sounds like a really interesting concept for a story.

Your reflections on the difficulties of writing this sort of thing are pretty much in line with my apprehensions. It may be foolish for me to attempt this, especially without much writing experience and without too much grounding in heavy rationality. Oh well, it will certainly be quite the learning experience if i can stick to it.
