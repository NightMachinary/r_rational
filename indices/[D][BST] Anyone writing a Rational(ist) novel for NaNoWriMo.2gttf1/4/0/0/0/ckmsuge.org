I appreciate the advice, I think you're right. I think i'll probably do that. Hopefully with enough pre-planning, outlining, brainstorming, and the like, I'll have enough ideas that i'll be able to achieve both goals. But if I have to go back at the end of November to tighten up the rationality in chapter 3, at least I'll have a good foundation and will have flexed my writing muscles for the first time. Either way, this is bound to be quite the adventure!
