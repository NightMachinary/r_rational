Writing rational for NaNo is basically hard-mode. If you don't have much experience writing, I would suggest that you make your primary goal to be finishing NaNo, with a secondary goal of making it rational. If you get to a point where you're getting behind on word count and need to do more research, just plug ahead with the story anyway. Most of the point of NaNo is to /write/, rather than to have a completed book at the end of the month. Writing is like a muscle, and you can build it up by working it - NaNo is basically the best workout that you can do, but it only works if you don't give up. (I would also suggest subbing to [[/r/nanowrimo]], which provides much in the way of positive feedback for your efforts.)
