My romance/urban fantasy/portal fantasy Nanowrimo wasn't intended as an explicitly rationalist novel at first, but I guess it's shaping up to become one. The characters don't make mistakes because they're stupid, but because of various kinds of emotional and motivational issues. For instance, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tgrEbICCrlCbEoyVxYaBlWTeDkWnzx05lEdpadyY_uk/edit?usp=sharing][in the opening]], the main character misses the fact that a faerie prince is inside her mind because when an unpleasant memory comes to her mind, her first automatic impulse is to push it away:

  Meri was just about to step inside when the bundle of memory and emotion forced itself into her consciousness. The passerby had reminded her of Mirva, her first girlfriend; and with that came the recollection of Mirva's snide voice when they had broken up. "Well at least /I'm/ not fat."

  The memory came sheathed in a shell of pain, causing Meri to flinch away from it and not even notice the strange sensation of cold that it was suddenly intertwined with. Instinctively, she called to mind her current boyfriend, who'd gone to lengths to assure her that mild overweight was something that he only liked. /Besides, most of it was muscle these days.../

  But then a feeling of irritation arose. Why was she letting this topic bother her in the first place? She stepped inside and closed the door behind her, pushing the entire memory firmly out of her mind.

To be fair, given that she's an ordinary girl in present-day Helsinki, even if she hadn't flinched away, she still wouldn't have generated the hypothesis that the feeling of coldness was a faerie hiding inside her mind. Still, things /would/ have gone a lot differently if she hadn't done that.

(Yeah, that opening was written a while ago. I'm slightly breaking the rules by continuing a previously started work, but I only had a bit of it written and am not including any of it in the 50K total.)

The story will also touch upon themes of [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/yj2kb/ethical_solipsism_chapter_75/][heroic responsibility]], [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/kow/moloch_optimisation_and_vs_or_information_and/b7n8][Moloch]], clear communication, and I'm playing around with some fun cognitive science ideas, like the prince's thoughts coming to his mind via [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue][priority queue]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)][scheduling]] rather than the [[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Models_of_consciousness#Global_workspace_models][global neuronal workspace]] approach that human brains use. I have no idea of whether this will be any good and whether I'll even finish Nanowrimo this year around. Still haven't gotten my today's words written, but did manage to write 2184 words yesterday. (Choice piece of dialogue: "This shouldn't be any worse than your worst nightmare." "I've heard more reassuring descriptions than that.")
