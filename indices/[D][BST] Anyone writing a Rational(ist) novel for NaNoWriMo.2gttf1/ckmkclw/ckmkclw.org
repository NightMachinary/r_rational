I've been spending the past couple months researching for a rational Super Smash Bros. fic. There's an absolutely ludicrous amount of information I need about all the respective franchises and timelines, but hopefully I'll be set by the time NaNo rolls around.

Since many things would clash if I tried to just throw it all into the same universe, I'm changing some canonical things as well as inventing a merged timeline.

I've got the plot mostly laid out, the backstories for 80% of the main cast including Captain Falcon, Samus, Fox, and the character whose POV the story is being told from (a mystery to the reader until they pick up on all the hints or just wait until he says his name).

I've also been spending time writing random scenes with each of the main cast as the POV character just to get a handle on their personalities and whatnot. Of course, because of the elaborate backstory and all that has happened that isn't canon, some characters will seem to act differently.

It's a ton of work, but between the extreme hype for Smash 4 and the amazing vastness and depth of the 'verses and characters, it's something I really want to do, and do well. I just hope I can have all of the outlining and prewriting finished before NaNo begins.
