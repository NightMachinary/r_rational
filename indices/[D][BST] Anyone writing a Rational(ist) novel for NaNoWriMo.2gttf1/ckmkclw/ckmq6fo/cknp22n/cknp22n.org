Most of this is taken care of by the existence of multiple universes - Kirby's warp stars come into play a lot as way of transport between them. Then, of course, Fox and Samus want to integrate Warp Star Drives into their ships.

Link's time travel will provide most of the focus for the second arc, uncovering more of the mystery of the merged backstory and the underlying plot.

For Pokèmon, I'm going to try to stay as close to canon as possible. The Pikachu will be under a trainer, but will fight without the trainer's help or commands. I'm thinking of making Jigglypuff the one from the anime, as they already have an established personality. Entertaining as well. Mewtwo...ooooh, Mewtwo's going to great. I'm probably going off of the anime Mewtwo from Pokèmon 2000, as it gives him a great origin story. He's going to be a very interesting character.

Man, this is going to be epic.
