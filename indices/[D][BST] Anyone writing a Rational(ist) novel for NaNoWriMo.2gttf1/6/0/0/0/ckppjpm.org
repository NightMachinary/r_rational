Alright, my proposal is to have a stickied "National Novel Writing Month" thread for brainstorming, discussion, etc. Once a day seems like overkill, once per week seems like underkill, so I think maybe once every three days make a new thread? That would be ten posts over the course of the month of November. Maybe with another stickied post the week before.

  Welcome to Rational Novel Writing Month, a rational take on [[http://nanowrimo.org/][National Novel Writing Month]]. This is your all-purpose thread for posting progress on your novel, brainstorming ideas, solving plot problems, showing excerpts of your work, or whatever else you want to discuss. While you're free to post in any genre you'd like, you'll probably get better feedback if you're following the bullet points in the sidebar, or writing a story that's close to the heart of this subreddit; hard science-fiction, hard fantasy, deconstruction, education, transhumanism, etc. Today is *day X*, and the current word count target to stay on track is *x words*.

And then plug in the values for day and words (words = day * 1,666).

I think this having this in a single, localized place would probably also cut down on some of the clutter in this sub if a decent number of people are doing national novel writing month, and especially if some fraction of them are posting as they go.
