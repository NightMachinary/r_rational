  I can't imagine wanting to write anything but a rationalist novel now.

/One of us! One of us!/

Anyway, I had to trawl my posting history to find it, but [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1ppyqx/is_anyone_doing_a_rationalist_nanowrimo_or_really/][I found the last time this topic was made, for reference]].

I'm torn between writing my [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2fksk7/qdbst_is_there_any_interest_in_a_rationalist/][Rational!Mecha]] story (title pending) or /A Most Magnificent Adventure/ (WIP), which I attempted last year:

#+begin_quote
  [...] The story is about the son of a legendary adventurer and his unlikely friends as they search for his recently vanished father in a world of power crazed (or just plain crazy) blood magicians in dystopian steampunk megacities fortified against a zombie apocalypse that grows stronger, faster and smarter the more it eats while airship merchants and sky pirates do battle overhead.

Ultimately it turned out way too complicated to get off the ground, as there were too many irregularities/irrationalities in the first act, it's a very bad thing that I haven't really resolved some of those issues. Writing well is /hard/, and it varies directly with the number of characters and the desired complexity of the world, which requires large amounts of research and planning.

In fact, I'm starting to think that rational fiction is the hardest kind of fiction, because the author must tell a very large number of lies and truths in the same work without them interfering with each other, often in domains in which the author has not earned an Associate's Degree, but you will by the end of it.
