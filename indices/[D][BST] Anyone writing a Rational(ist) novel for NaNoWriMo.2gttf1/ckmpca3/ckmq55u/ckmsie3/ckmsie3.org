I wouldn't worry about foolishness -- we're doing this for fun, anyway. I was far too ambitious in writing /A Most Magnificent Adventure/ (I had seven main characters). Such a story was beyond the scope of NaNoWriMo, but smaller works are very doable.

The best thing you can do is to pick topics which you have fun reading and writing about and use them to structure the story. I have an unfinished [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xilpd/bst_rationallegendofzelda/][/Legend of Zelda/ fanfiction]] sitting on my desktop which uses all of Link's various dungeon dives to talk about architecture and archeology juxtaposed against the the unending, unchanging Hylian Dynasty.
