Joon, despite being an immensely powerful RPG character, still is a human. His starting Luck was 0.\\
It could very well be that people /can/ train their Luck, but it's hard to do so reliably. By this logic, gamblers and veteran soldiers could have a small amount of "trained" Luck, which could be tested experimentally.\\
Dorises could recruit exceptionally lucky ones, or try to "manufacture" them, by pitting them against deadly games of chance. Other option would be finding items or potions granting permanent (or temporary, but very cheap) boost of luck.\\
We haven't yet heard of such artifacts, but even one granting only a modest boost would be enough here. Not enough for the battlefield, but just enough for precognition work.

Many things which are uneconomical for a party of adventurers could be perfectly viable to a country of millions.\\
Just got to be economical enough to make a profit.
