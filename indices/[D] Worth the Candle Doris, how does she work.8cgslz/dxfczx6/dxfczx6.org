I have only a hypothesis, based on current knowledge of Luck:

Let's assume that Luck directly, uniformly and consistently changes odds to those a person would find preferable. That it's like a constant force, nudging your actions towards a better outcome.

I'll use shells game as an example.\\
You have 2 shells, under one of which there's the winning marble. The placement of the marble is random and you want to find the marble on the first try. You have positive Luck score. You are not betting against anyone but yourself (to prevent conflict of different people's Luck).

If you played the game enough times, you'd find your win-rate is a consistent... 60%.\\
Now let's place a sheet of paper under each of the shells. Each paper has a name of a place on it. In one of those places, your target awaits.\\
If the shell game continues to behave like previously, then after enough tries you'll find the correct answer is simply chosen more often.

If said experiments could be successfully replicated in world of Aerb, a sufficient amount of people with positive Luck score could find people simply by randomly choosing possible locations, then comparing which outcome is the most often chosen.\\
Assuming that your average Doris has non-zero Luck, then enough Dorises with enough work hours put into this weighted guessing could come to a probable conclusion.

Of course, there's /a lot/ of factors that could muddle the outcome:

- Is Luck a constant force, or does it change like a muscle does- weakening from exhaustion, used to it's full potential only in dangerous situations, increasing it's strength with usage (Joon /did/ train his Luck, but he's broken anyway.)?
- How does different people's Luck interact with each other, if at all? Will a normal person's guess be less likely to be correct if it would inconvenience a lucky person? If so, then what would be the range of said influence?
- How far-reaching and /smart/ is Luck? Will it let you be late to the bus if it'll stop you from being in middle of a shootout? What about not knowing what you want in the first place?
