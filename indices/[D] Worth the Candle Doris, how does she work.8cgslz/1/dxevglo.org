It's briefly mentioned a few times in that arc that Doris has some additional method of 'reading' probability, though it's admitted that they don't know the specifics:

"“No,” I replied. “We still don't know how they found us. My guess is that they have precognition of some kind, but we need to know the details, whether it's probability based or has some kind of limits that we can work around.”

“Which means he still fails half the time,” said Amaryllis. She frowned. “Unless he sent them out after flipping torches twice in a row, and so on down that line of thinking, but that depends on how well Doris can see probability, which is unknown.”
