Imagine you roll a die, and if you get a 6, you duplicate yourself 10 times. Now, out of 15 of your possible futures, you've rolled a 6 in 10 of them. You've now increased the probability of 6 from 1/6 to 2/3. Maybe, by some weird quirk of magic/game mechanics, this effect gets extended to the rest of the world. I like this theory because it's simple and doesn't postulate any additional powers besides duplication, and it explains things like why someone would decide to duplicate themselves so many times. There's probably some weird implications about subjective experience in there too.
