The basilisk is (reportedly) playing correspondence chess: Riddle comes out of the Chamber of Secrets with a letter (in his own handwriting), which he claims to have been dictated by the basilisk. He owls this to whoever is (supposed to be) playing the basilisk, then eventually receives a letter back and (says that he) delivers it to the basilisk.

Some people think this is ludicrous and that Riddle is just fucking with everyone, because the idea of Riddle sitting idly by and taking dictation for a giant chess-playing snake with killer eyeballs is just bonkers.

I definitely have to rewrite this passage to make some aspects of it clearer, lol.
