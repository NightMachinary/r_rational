No questions answered, many more raised.

Unanswered questions:

- What is studied in Dark Arts?

- What does punishment at Hogwarts entail?

- What is happening to the vanished muggle children?

- Why was Hermione invited to the tournament?

Probably some others.

New questions:

- What are the Death Eaters actually up to now, besides enforcing the revolution?

- What value does a different admittedly terrible potions master have to Riddle?

- How does the Basilisk play chess? (My guess is it really is the Basilisk playing, with Riddle just translating and acting as a go-between)
