I'm going to take the criticism from Lucius's teenage son (and obvs bias best friend) with a grain of salt. Overbearing and unusually driven whilst trying and failing to create the same drive in his students is still more effort than too many teachers I've had.

I mean he helps the students who are struggling, he caters his approach to each student's abilities, he even (if misguidely in approach) tries to involve the parents in their kids education. That's not terrible, especially when the canon potions master is literally Neville's Boggart fear because he is so vile.

Saying he is frightfully mismatched with the younger levels and those not interested at all in potions would be reasonable though.
