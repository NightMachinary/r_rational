I wonder how notable it is that "Volume XLIX of /The Collected Correspondence and Commentaries of Nicolas Flamel/" was checked out for the summer, considering the plot of the first Harry Potter book. Is Riddle still trying to track down the stone?

Also, maybe the basilisk is using the giant chessboard to play. I know canonically it was made by McGonagall, but I wouldn't put it past a bit of canon convergence resulting in Riddle making one for it and also making it respond to Parseltongue. Alternatively if it's really good at chess (or at visualization) it could be memorizing the positions, or using its own time control and responding quickly when Riddle comes to visit to make it a fair fight with children. The world is magical, and it's an intensely magical creature, the question of how the basilisk can be playing without hands is maybe the most perplexing thing they could ask.
