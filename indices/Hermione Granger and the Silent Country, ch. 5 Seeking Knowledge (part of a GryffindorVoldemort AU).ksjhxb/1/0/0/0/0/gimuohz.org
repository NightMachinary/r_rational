Yes, absolutely, it's immediately obvious that any solution that actually accomplishes the goal of "allow a basilisk to play chess" is going to be ludicrous in some way, and a waste of some sort of resource that they really could put to better use (in this case, Riddle's time).

I just don't see how that is in any way unusual for the Wizarding world at large. Leaving aside a whole category of absurdities that constitutes the sport of Quidditch, this is a place which is able to create entire hidden neighborhoods and train platforms behind walls that Muggles can't find their way through without help, and yet chooses to have people flush themselves down a toilet to enter the Ministry of Magic. Where the proposed solution to having a werewolf attend school was to build an indestructible shack in the nearby village, run a secret passage to that shack from the school grounds, and plant a pugilist tree to guard the entrance to the secret passage. Where the appropriate response to an undelivered letter is to send increasing numbers of that letter in ways that increasingly threaten the Statute of Secrecy, rather than just sending a liaison after the first one fails to arrive. Where the school song for Hogwarts has lyrics but no melody, so everyone just sings the words to any melody they choose.

A snake playing chess just seems like an odd thing to find unbelievable; I don't get how anyone would distinguish it from the generic background absurdity of the setting.
