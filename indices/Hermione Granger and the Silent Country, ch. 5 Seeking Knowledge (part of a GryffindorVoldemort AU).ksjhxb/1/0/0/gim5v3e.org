Right. Another option could be a chessboard with a protean charm (like the Dumbledore's Army galleons) to transmit the moves. I don't think that's bidirectional, but that would just mean you'd need two of them.

Or use a mirror like the one Sirius gave to Harry; just make sure the one on the Basilisk side is pointed right at the board to prevent petrification.
