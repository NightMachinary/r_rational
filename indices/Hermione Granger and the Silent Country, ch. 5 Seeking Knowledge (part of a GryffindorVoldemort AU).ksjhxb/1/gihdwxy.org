It's interesting to see all of the different friendships from canon. Malfoy being friends with Tonks isn't something I would have called, even without the hostility between Andromeda and the rest of the Black family for being a "blood traitor." Neville, either.

Speaking of Neville, it's nice to see him thriving in Potions class when he isn't bullied into terror.

I need that as a poster for my wall.

  a voice so quiet it was almost a kind of word-shaped hollowness in the air
#+end_quote

Very nice turn of phrase.

  *Rules of the Hogwarts Library*
#+end_quote

All very sensible, although it's missing any description of punishment for violations (although the penalty for breaking the "damage" rule should, of course, be "slow and painful death")

  Ten books was a normal, reasonable amount to borrow, wasn't it?
#+end_quote

Absolutely, Hermione!

  /Unity is Strength/

...Reminds me of Lewis Prothero:

#+begin_quote
  Strength through Unity\\
  Unity through Faith\\
  Good guys win, bad guys lose\\
  And, as always, England prevails.
#+end_quote

Although perhaps "Magic" should replace "Faith."

I can totally see Lucius Malfoy as a complete by-the-book, well-organized, perfectionist potions master, contrasted with Snape's snide, "throw you into the water to see if you can swim" style.

  I'm never going to stay in those caves forever, but I'm always going to go back.

An interesting metaphor.

  neither Hermione nor Bathilda Bagshot could quite figure out the logistics that made this possible. The bloody thing didn't even have hands. How was it supposed to write letters?
#+end_quote

Quick Quotes Quill, with an additional charm to translate from Parseltongue to English? It doesn't seem as complicated as they're making it.

#+begin_quote
  We just watch the portraits talk to each other.
#+end_quote

That mostly sounds awkward, treating private conversation as a spectator sport.

#+begin_quote
  F, U, Þ, A, R, and K are the first six runes of Futhark
#+end_quote

Huh. TIL. I've heard of Futhark before, but didn't know why it was called that.
