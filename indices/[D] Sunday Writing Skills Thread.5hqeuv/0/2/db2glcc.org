Science is largely a collective process. Individual hypothesis generation and experimentation is quite a different process, and you'll have to face that unless this time travel device is going to become a worldwide phenomenon.

For instance, if you're given a study about some phenomenon, and the sample size is relatively low, it doesn't mean much to you, because of how it got to you and positive reporting bias, its almost meaningless to have something like that put in front of you. Academia is a huge machine designed to report anomalies. You don't start getting reliable information till you can do a metastudy of replication attempts.

But if you have a particular phenomenon and you want to investigate, and you do, and you get a single positive result, n=1, that's already meaningful to you, because there was far less bias in the flow of the information. The scientific network is biased towards reporting interesting results, but if you randomly select a sensible test and a sensible testing apparatus, those individually will have no bias towards interesting results at all.

So if this is a story about a single researcher working alone, for themselves, especially if they're the only person who has access to the phenomenon, its going to look very different to Science as we know it.
