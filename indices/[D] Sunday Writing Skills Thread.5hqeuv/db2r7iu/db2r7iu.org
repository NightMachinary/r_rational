How do you guys make distinctive speech patterns for characters, without just giving them an accent? Ideally, my goal would be to have the viewpoint character of a segment be immediatelly recognizable by the narration alone, even in a 3rd person work*, but it's difficult doing that.

Probably the best example of me /trying/ to do that is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11936165/19/Horizon-Breach][chapter 19 of Horizon Breach]] because I flip between a number of viewpoints, but I still have this overly academic vocabulary throught.

If I had to sum up my problem, it's that it seems like I write with the same voice as I'd use in a forum argument.

*Third person limited, that is. Third person omniscient I'd do something different.
