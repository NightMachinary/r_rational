Honestly, I think you need to practise and internalise the characters. I always joke that my characters are borderline tulpas because I have such a good sense of their voice. Try and give them stereotypes and lean into that, and hopefully you'll ultimately be able to refine them. Of course, if your characters are all Cis White Male Logical Scientists^{TM} you might have a harder time as they will have very similar origins and very similar goals.
