#+begin_quote
  PDF files

Oddly, GURPS is one of the only sources I still enjoy getting PDF files of, as opposed to non-fixed-text Epubs or the like.

  Javascript ... dynamic margins

Actually, you don't even need Javascript, or even CSS, just a bit of HTML. For example, in my page for [[http://www.datapacrat.com/weirdtopia/index.html][Weirdtopia]], I try to keep the line-lengths be roughly a certain number of characters wide, but still adapt to a wide variety of window sizes with this HTML:

#+begin_example
  <div align="center" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width: 33em;">
  <table align="center" width="100%" border="0"><tr><td>
  ... (actual text)
  </td></tr></table>
  </div>
#+end_example

(I do a couple of other formatting things there, if you want to take a look at the story's HTML source code.)
