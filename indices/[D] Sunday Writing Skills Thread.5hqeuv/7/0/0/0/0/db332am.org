  Oddly, GURPS is one of the only sources I still enjoy getting PDF files of, as opposed to non-fixed-text Epubs or the like.

I had [[http://i.imgur.com/0HwhYMA.png][some fun]] a few months ago with manually converting /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/low-tech/][Low-Tech]]/ to HTML, but it got boring pretty quickly.

  Actually, you don't even need Javascript, or even CSS, just a bit of HTML.

I was talking about the more complex methods that take into account the page's aspect ratio (i.e., /both/ width /and/ height) in calculating the size of each margin. I could be wrong, but I don't think that such complex calculations can be handled by mere HTML+CSS.
