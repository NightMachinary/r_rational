It's been a while since I thought about paper layout instead of digital's infinite canvas, and it's nice to be reminded.

For some other margin suggestions, I found Butterick's [[http://practicaltypography.com/][Practical]] [[http://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html][Typography]] pages handy, such as his thoughts on [[http://practicaltypography.com/][margins]].
