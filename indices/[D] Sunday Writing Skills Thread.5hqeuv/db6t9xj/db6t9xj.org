*Infodumps vs Storytelling*

David Weber is probably the current king of including infodumps in his books, such as detailing a warship's hordes of missiles' sizes, accelerations, ranges, and similar other numbers. Some people seem to love such detail, others hate it.

Over in this week's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ib10o/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/][Worldbuilding]] thread, I've pasted some notes I've jotted down on the setting for [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]], in the form of part of a journal entry of my protagonist. The whole story is in the form of such entries; and at the moment, I'm wondering how to avoid infodump syndrome, or whether I should even try. I honestly haven't decided how many of the described details are going to be relevant to my protagonist's forthcoming shenanigans, as he tries to leverage various aspects of the world he finds himself in to accomplish his goals. So should I just leave the whole thing in now, and be ready to trim out anything that turns out to be excessively irrelevant by the story's conclusion? Should I move pretty much the whole entry to the authour's notes that won't be part of the story proper? Should I try something completely different?

An inquiring mind wants to know your opinion. :)
