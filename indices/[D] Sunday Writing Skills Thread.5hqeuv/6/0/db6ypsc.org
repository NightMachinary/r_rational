Personally, I prefer stories to /not/ include infodumps unless it feels natural. A very good example of how an infodump can fail is when in a science-fiction story the author has a character randomly start talking all about a futuristic, commonplace technology that everyone knows about. Because the character has to explain it for the reader even though it doesn't make sense for anyone to talk about it, it falls flat. It'd be like us suddenly talking about how revolutionary computers are, whenever we use Facebook, or Google.

A well-done example of when to /not/ include infodumps is Worm. There were these horrific natural disasters/villains called Endbringers. Wildbow explicitly didn't explain who the Endbringers where at all when his characters first mentioned them in passing. Until Leviathan showed up in the story, I had no idea who the Endbringers were. When the story started talking about alarms and fear of an Endbringer showing up, it added to the unease and worry about who or what these horrific antagonists could be. It was a well-done piece of story telling which would have been ruined if the Endbringers were explained in an infodump instead of letting the reader continue only knowing them as ominous villains.

Infordumps should be used sparingly and only in contexts which make sense such as a classroom setting, training, or when people explain important rules to newbies. The part of your story where your character negotiated with the representative of the Oracle (section #52) was a very good place for an infodump and conveying world-building information to the reader.

So if your character /would/ want to make a note of the important information in the journal, then the infodump is fine. But if it's about some minutiae he wouldn't comment on, then don't include it. Let the reader try to figure it out from context before you start wondering about where to fit explanations.
