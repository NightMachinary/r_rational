In my story, a protagonist is experimenting with time-travel abilities and I want to demonstrate the scientific method by showing how real-life researchers might investigate time-travel.

What are some particularly important experimental protocols and investigation are people interested in seeing being used?

So far, I have:

- multiple hypotheses being generated ahead of time to cover varying possibilities before attempting to prove or disprove any single hypothesis

- experiments to falsify a hypothesis rather than only looking for confirming evidence

- reading and summarizing information from the background literature in the relevant fields to better plan the experiments

- detail extensive planning for a rigorous experimental protocol to avoid bias, errors, and false positives/negatives

- show the protagonist being wrong and updating their hypothesis in the face of new evidence (or completely throwing out their prior guess)

Does anyone have any other ideas? Some helpful suggestions could be styles of investigation such as cautious vs fast-paced, many possibilities vs one hypothesis, complex experiments with redundancies vs simple experiments, and so on.

PS If people want to tailor their feedback based on the power being investigated, it's a device which has a screen to only show text and a keyboard. It sends messages back in time, but the researchers have found out that whatever appears on the screen (ex. "This is a time machine!") will end up as the very next thing the researchers type into the device.
