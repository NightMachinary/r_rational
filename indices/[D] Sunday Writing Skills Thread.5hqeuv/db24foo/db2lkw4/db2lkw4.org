Just a brief thought (no clue if it actually makes sense though):

How about building a device that's only purpose is to determine whether you fucked up causality and wiped out a timeline? Design it such that it's your first foray into time travel at all. And it communicates with the version of itself you take into the past. But it's ahead of itself by a few seconds. Then, before you take a time travel trip, you check the device. If it's still pinging itself, then you know your trip won't alter things enough to prevent the device's conception. So the trip you're about to take hasn't impacted your general sphere of causality. It serves as a rudimentary, first response sort of safety measure.

Reading that back, I have almost no idea how any of what I wrote makes a shred of sense. But I'm not erasing it. So....Yea. Hope this helps? :)
