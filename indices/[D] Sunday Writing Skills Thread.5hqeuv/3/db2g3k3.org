I'm currently using 750words.com to work, very loosely, on a story about teleportation. This effectively means I have a lot of scenes from different points of view, some of which are in the present tense, which is going to be no fun to untangle. So my question is how much POV switching is acceptable, which I realise is a length of a piece of string question. I have at the moment three main POV characters - a woman C who has just 'caught' teleportation, the Aide to the Brigadier in charge of the project to control it, and the escaped 'patient zero'. This would be OK, I think as they are mostly in different places, but what do I do when they meet? And what about my scenes where, say, an unnamed hotel owner is used as a POV so I can show C from the outside? is a smattering of such scenes OK? or should I use them as my background only?
