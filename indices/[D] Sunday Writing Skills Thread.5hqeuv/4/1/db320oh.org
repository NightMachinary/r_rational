  Readers, perhaps, do not realize how disinterested they will be in stories revolving around truly alien aliens.

That may depend on how broad an audience of readers you're interested in. The only reason I remember the shared-world "Medea: Harlan's World" is because of the rather alien alien species (vaguely fox-ish centauroids, which reproduce by dropping off body/limb segments), and I've read more than one story trying to delve into various sorts of non-human psyches.

The usual advice, which seems to apply, is to write what /you/ find satisfying. :)
