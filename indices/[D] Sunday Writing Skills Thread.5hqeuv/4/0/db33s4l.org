  I can't even find a way to write "Kol walked towards..." without teaching the reader some Ser body language, because Sers are constantly expressing things with the way they move.

There's a difference between writing the equivilent of the expression "he frowned, looking at her with narrowed eyes" and expecting the reader's knowledge of body language to say "his face showed he was angry" and writing the equivilent of the expression "he looked at her angrily". Now, the former is generally considered better writing because we know what a frown /means/. But if you don't know what a frown means, why not say "he looked at her angrily"?

But what's stopping you from saying "Kol walked towards the podium, the subtlety of movement in Kol's gait showing not only was Kol nervous about giving the speech, but Kol was overflowing with sheer joy at the fact that they were finally going to make peace with their long-time enemies"? Or even "I watched Kol move to the podium, and my knowledge of Ser body language isn't great but I am pretty sure that Kol was mighty happy about something"? Or get poetic, "Kol looked at the object of eir affections, and took a step forward; that single step said all at once 'I love you, I need you, and I would do anything for you' in the sensuous ballet of the Ser's body language"?
