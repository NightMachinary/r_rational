I was a fan of a writer when I was a teenager called Brian Caswell, and he wrote in the sort of style you're going for.

What he did was he had maybe 3 or 4 main characters, who narrated, with each section headed "Anne's Story" or "Bob's Story" or whatever. Then sometimes he'd do a third person omniscient type section, which didn't have that heading, just the date/time.

So I guess my suggestion is if the hotel owner is being used as a POV only once, and then later in the story the seamstress who the characters go to is used only once, and then the kid they save in the climax is used only once, etc, you might be better off doing a third person POV for those scenes.
