Are you using third-person limited-omniscient phrasing? That is, using 'she thought X when he did Y' instead of 'I thought X when he did Y'? I've seen a number of stories which focus on one main viewpoint character or another for a while, then jump to another main one, with occasional "reaction shots" focusing in on a side-character or two. I didn't have any problems understanding those stories, so it seems a workable approach.
