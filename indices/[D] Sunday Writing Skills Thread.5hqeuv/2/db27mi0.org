*Fiddling with [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]]*

*Beta readers*. I could use more general feedback; if you're interested in helping, just pop over to the link, and you can use the built-in commenting system.

*Title*. "Extracts" was good enough for a working title during NaNoWriMo, but doesn't have anything in particular to do with what the story's turned into. The main theme seems to have become something like "I work at being [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared][Crazy Prepared]], and you the reader can do it too! And it's worth it!" (In particular, our protagonist only survives due to making backup copies of himself, which carry on when the original snuffs it.) Do any bits of phrasing come to mind?

*Cover*. At one point, my protagonist ends up with the physical form of many dozens of rats. I'm thinking of finding a Creative Commons image of a line-drawing of a reasonably nice-looking rat (as a starting point, maybe [[https://pixabay.com/en/mouse-rodent-animal-mammal-rat-311396/][this one]]), and tiling that image across the cover. (Well, maybe paying a couple of bucks for an actual graphic-focused person to do the manipulation.) Have any better ideas?

Is there anything else about this story that you want to say, but that the commenting system on GDocs might not have been the best medium for?
