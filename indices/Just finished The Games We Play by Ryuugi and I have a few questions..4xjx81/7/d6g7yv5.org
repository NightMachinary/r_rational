Ryuugi has more stories. I don't think any of them have romance in them though, and none are of the same scale as TGWP. He does a lot of crossover fiction so if you haven't read both original works a lot of stuff might be lost on you. TGWP is good in this regard, as you don't really need to have watched or read anything prior.

Also, The Iron Teeth is new favorite web fiction of mine, though the author is now actually going back and writing an arc that takes place between two other ones he's written already, so at the pace he's going I would either wait a few weeks to read it or stop when you get to the end of Written in Blood. Really do recommend it though.
