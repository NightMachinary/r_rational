Just for a dissenting voice, time braid is a fantastic piece of fiction and I reread it regularly. It isn't rational in the strict sense but isn't stupid. Protagonist is really intelligent and actually gets heavily challenged by intelligent antagonists.

I'm not sure how someone could feel like it is trash. I'm fine with someone not liking it, but it is well written, develops characters really nicely, blends two Fandoms well and manages the whole groundhog day thing way better than all you need is kill or any other story I can think of.

I feel like the person above me just didn't like shounen manga or something. Ridiculous power is the point, but in my opinion has never been handled so well.

I would rate time braid in my top three fanfiction recommendations, and it might actually be number one.
