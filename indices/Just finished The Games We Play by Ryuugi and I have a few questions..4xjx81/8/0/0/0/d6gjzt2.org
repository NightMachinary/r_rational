The reason Time Braid is terrible isn't shonen- in fact, time braid isn't even shonen at all. What's wrong with Time Braid is it's blatant and unexplained OOC-ness, Rape/Underage sex, and blatant character bashing. To make matters worse, Naruto is a blatant authorial insert. That's not to say it doesn't have its good parts; the crossover is handled well, the idea is original, and some of the lines are gold, like "What would it take for you to go out with me?" "A lobotomy.", but that's nowhere near enough to make up for it. tl;dr: If it was written a bit better (i.e. Naruto wasn't such a flagrant insert), had older characters and/or had less of the whole preteen/teenage sex, dropped the rape, and had an original setting it'd be really good. As it is, it's pretty terrible.
