Actually, I was mostly talking about the whole sexy jutsu thing- getting them to use it and then taking advantage of the consequences. It's like getting people drunk/on drugs and then pressing them, albeit without the addiction side affects. It's not just Hana, though- Naruto also does the same to Tenten, whose only 14, tops, while using what nearly amounts to mind control to get them attracted. Admittedly he can't entirely help that part, but...

The whole point was that Naruto was the hero- he was the one that the darkness couldn't touch, the chosen hero- and he was still doing it. Enlightened was the wrong word, though.
