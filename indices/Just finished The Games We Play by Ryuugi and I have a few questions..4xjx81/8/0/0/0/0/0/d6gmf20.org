I know you said you didn't want to argue about it, but rape isn't okay- and the story all but outright comes in support of it; he has the supposed enlightened hero against evil (Naruto) doing so, the main character doing so... in fact, the only problem with it even mentioned is that they shouldn't be doing it [i]because they're engaged[/i], not because it's bad.

That's why I said authorial insert rather than self, although perhaps I should have said authorial avatar? I'm not sure what exactly to call it, but it's not like DoS. He is, however, very blatantly written as the author- he talks almost exactly like ShaperV does in what I read of Fimbulwinter. Ofc Sakura is a Peggy sue- the story is literally about using time travel to solve your problems. There isn't anything wrong with that, though, just look at Branches on the Tree of Time or Mother of learning.
