I know you said you dislike reading from a womans perspective, but I think you are making a huge mistake with Worm. Her gender is largely irrelevant anyway. Of all the stories you mentioned, the protagonist of Worm is defiantly the most badass. I won't say you need to commit, but give it a fair chance.
