I usually read the first big half, then put the story in the /Follow story/ list without touching it until it's finished. For what it's worth, the author [[http://sirpoley.tumblr.com/post/136825834609/i-atent-ded][has said]] that they're not dead and the story's not abandoned+(just temporarily comatose?)+.

p.s. If I remembered any romance in /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24957878-the-waves-arisen][Waves Arisen]]/ (completed) I'd've recommended that too.
