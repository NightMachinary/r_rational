Well, you aren't the same person I was replying to, but those are certainly common criticisms. I disagree, and think all of those elements are handled sensitively and with the seriousness they deserve (this coming from a person who rails against sexualised violence and overt sexualisation in most media).

I actually think time braid represents some of the best handling of those elements in any young adult fiction.

But not going to argue with you. Each person has a different threshold about that stuff.

I will argue about the Naruto being a self insert complaint. For starters, he exists in about 5% of the story. Secondly, he is a clear subversion of the male wish fulfillment tropes, because he is all of that and yet the female protagonist still has agency. Thirdly, he is the rescuee more often than not.

If anything, Sakura is more of a Peggy Sue, and if she is then so is every rational protagonist discussed in this sub.

Obviously YMMV to anyone thinking about reading it. I would simply say I think it is one of the most tightly written action adventures I have ever read, and is fantastically plotted with a seriously well built world.
