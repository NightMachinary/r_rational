Wow, you're misreading this story dramatically. It's supposed to be about fucked up characters in a fucked up world. Naruto is not supposed to be an enlightened hero at all.

Also, I'm assuming we're talking about Hana's scene with Naruto as an example of rape? Because it's really not nearly as rape-y as you seem to want it to be.
