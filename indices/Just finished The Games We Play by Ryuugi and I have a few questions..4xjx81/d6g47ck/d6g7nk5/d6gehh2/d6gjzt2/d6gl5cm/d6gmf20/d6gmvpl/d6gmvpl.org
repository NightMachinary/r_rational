I'm ok arguing about the topic, but I don't want to assume everyone else is or wants to read about it. All I would say is that I found time braid presented every abhorrent act by antagonist /or/ protagonist as abhorrent. Loss of humanity and... not redemption, but regaining some sort of stability, are key themes in the work.

It is dark. No doubt. Groundhog Day is a fridge horror narrative.

I don't think it is even vaguely possible to call Naruto enlightened in time braid. He is explicitly na√Øve and thoughtless. He is very moral, in the same way that any real person can have strong morals and be an absolute horror show because they don't know any better or have a different version of morality. I love that he isn't portrayed as perfect, but instead is possibly the most horrifying character in the story. A good foil to sasuke /and/ Sakura.

If shaper V hates themselves and thinks they turn everything they touch to shit by passive effect, then maybe you could be right. I see Naruto more as successful subversion than anything else.
