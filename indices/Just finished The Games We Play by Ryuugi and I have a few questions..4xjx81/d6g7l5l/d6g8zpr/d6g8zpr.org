Normally I'd think this was a typo but it could also either be a Defiant pun or a description of Skitter.

Either way I agree - I normally prefer male to female protagonists (easier to relate to) but Worm is different. I don't really know how to put it. It's not that Skitter's gender never comes up, it just isn't important I guess?

I would recommend for new readers to try out [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-1-gestation/1-04/][the fight against Lung]] for a good idea of what the story is like.
