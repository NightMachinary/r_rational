Even worse: it seems thrown in to add a broader demographic appeal or as something you "should" do.

Partly, I suspect since writers need to have female characters and don't really think through how to make them work, so they give them the romantic role.

This is more for film and it's one female in the middle of a scifi/action film but it's there.
