Ryuugi hasn't yet started posting TLWT. Unknown whether he's started doing some prep work for the story in the background, but I think he's taking a break and working on other things.

If you liked The Games We Play, there's a good chance you'll like the main story he's been working on since then, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/danmachi-percy-jackson-prytaneum.352191/][Prytaneum]]. He's over 100 chapters into it so far, though recently there's been a pause as he's been disrupted by a change in jobs and schedules.

It's a crossover between DanMachi and Percy Jackson, neither of which I had any familiarity with when I started reading the story. That's fine, Ryuugi tends to do a lot of exposition of story points that come from the backgrounds of either story. The story draws more from DanMachi, so after a certain point I decided to watch DanMachi which only has a single short season so far. But he explains enough that you don't need to have seen it.

Much more recently, during the pause for Prytaneum, he's posted some pre-written chapters he had of an old story called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/percy-jackson-the-dresden-files-ceaseless-flow.407257/][Ceaseless Flow]], which also has similarities to TGWP. At this point it's doubtful that it will continue in the long term, though it's always possible he may switch which story is getting his main focus.
