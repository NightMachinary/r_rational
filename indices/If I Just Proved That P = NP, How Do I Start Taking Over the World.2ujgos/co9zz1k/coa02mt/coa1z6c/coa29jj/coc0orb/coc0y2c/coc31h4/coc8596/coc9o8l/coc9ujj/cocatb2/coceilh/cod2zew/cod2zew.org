I might be biased, but I wouldn't say I'm "wrong," exactly--a WOT is different from "unrestricted access to read and generate messages on behalf of whomever's identity you authenticate." All the tricks for generating a shared random pad not discoverable by the intermediary depend on P!=NP.

In a pragmatic sense, though, it's true that Bob and Amazon depending only on the good will and incorruptedness of Alice is a step up from no security at all, and from geometrically increasing hardware requirements.
