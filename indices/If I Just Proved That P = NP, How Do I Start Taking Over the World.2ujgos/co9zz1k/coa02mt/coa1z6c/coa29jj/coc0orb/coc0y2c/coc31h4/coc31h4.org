  Second, companies could use shared random quantum generators.

Right, which would enable a small number of B2B transactions amongst dedicated partners; the guildlike structure I suggested. Or is Amazon really going to purchase and maintain a separate pair of quantumboxes for each of its quarter-billion customers?

  factorization is not known to be NP-hard...a P=NP solution only helps for things in PSPACE=P.
#+end_quote

You know complexity classes better than I do, which I hadn't realized when I wrote my comment; and I should have used "NP complete" in place of "NP hard." However, factorization certainly does seem to be in BQP, and stuff like knapsack, traveling salesman, etc. certainly don't seem to be in BQP. So, while it's not /proven/, I believe it's overwhelmingly likely that the examples I gave are good.
