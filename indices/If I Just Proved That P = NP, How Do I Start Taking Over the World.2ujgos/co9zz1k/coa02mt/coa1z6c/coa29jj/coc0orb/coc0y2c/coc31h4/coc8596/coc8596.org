If P=NP, then factorization is like any other NP problem, and it would also be NP-complete. We're talking about a counterfactual on what most people don't think is true (P=NP).

And a quantum box could be a standard install with every computer, and have some system like WOT to make it secure in a decentralized manner. I really don't know how feasible this is, but I don't know that it's impossible. I'm just not so sure that all possible cryptos would be broken in a post=NP world.
