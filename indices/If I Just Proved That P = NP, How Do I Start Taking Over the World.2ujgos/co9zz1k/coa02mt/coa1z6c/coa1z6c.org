Most stories I read where someone successfully takes over the world /always/ involves some chaotic event occurring at the same time to give our protagonist precious opportunities.

It might not be the most rational plan, but you can release a nonconstructive version of the proof and target companies with a poor understanding of the time complexities involved who are demanding an expensive change in their cryptographic systems. They'll be the easiest to attack and steal from.

In addition, you'll be a high profile celebrity on the same level as Einstein and now have the sufficient status to talk to the richest and most powerful people in the world who you /might/ be able to convince to work for you. Be careful of wounding their pride though.
