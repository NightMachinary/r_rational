Nice try.

Well, I guess you could keep quiet and develop efficient algorithms for many problems used in cryptography, finance/trading, logistics and simulation research, if you are actually able to derive these from your proof. Then patent them all, sell on a provisional basis by their profitability and somehow use all the money to take over the world. And hire some bodyguards.
