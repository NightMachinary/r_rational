I don't think the celebrity status matters unless you're going to do it legally. You can get just as much cred by hacking Google (which is trivial after ssl is cracked).

And I think even a non-constructive version should not be released. Most companies would immediately switch to using codes that you can't break, and the knowledge that it must be possible would make finding it a lot easier. You wouldn't be able to use it for long. Even a zero-knowledge proof would be a bad idea.
