  If P=NP, then factorization is like any other NP problem, and it would also be NP-complete.

It does sense that that's part of the polynomial heirarchy that would collapse.

  And a quantum box could be a standard install with every computer, and have some system like WOT to make it secure in a decentralized manner.

Public key can't be done using quantum crypto; asymmetric crypto as we know it--whether it's based on algebraic rings, or elliptic curves, or lattices, or whatever else--isn't something that can "ride on top of" symmetric crypto. You'd need an Amazon Qbox, a Paypal Qbox, a $your_bank Qbox, etc.; and each of those institutions would need to maintain a gazillion qboxes. So there's no WOT.
