If I have an Amazon box, and Amazon has a Paypal box, then I can get Amazon to "sign" that I'm really connected to Paypal. That's what I meant by WOT. You only need a chain of people you trust, and the more chains, the stronger the trust. I'm sure people have thought about this in more depth, but I don't know too much about it.
