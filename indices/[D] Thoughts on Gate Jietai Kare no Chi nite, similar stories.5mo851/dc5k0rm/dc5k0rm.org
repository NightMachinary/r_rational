Side-note: the [[http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Gate-Jietai-Kare-no-Chi-nite-Kaku-Tatakeri][original manga]] is a much better way of accessing this story. The animation quality of the adaptation is really poor IMO. But the manga doesn't fix the flaws you mentioned.

That might have been the case in your hypothetical where they are cut off from Japan. As is though, they're a modern military, in direct contact with their leadership, and with the entire international community focused on them (many looking for an excuse to jump in). Plus they get all the comforts from home. I would not expect major war crimes or a breakdown of discipline in this situation.

(One-sided resource and land deals, sure. But the story doesn't discuss the economical aspects at all - one more of its failings.)
