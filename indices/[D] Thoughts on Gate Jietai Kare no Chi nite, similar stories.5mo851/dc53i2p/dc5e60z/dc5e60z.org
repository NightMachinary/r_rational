That link for The Salvation War requires a login to the forum. Is it available somewhere you don't need to create a login(or do you have a link on the forum that doesn't require login), or will I have to register?

(While I do enjoy HFY, is The Salvation War/other content on that forum worth the minor annoyance of registering?)
