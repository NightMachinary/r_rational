The thing that irked me the most was an eponymous Gate.

The Gate is literally the most important technology there is, yet nobody pays it any attention. There are a lot of life-or-death questions that nobody is interested in.

- How was the Gate open?
- Can it be closed forcibly?
- Will it close by itself, in time?
- Can closing of the Gate be predicted?
- Can the Gate be sustained in open state? How?
- Can another Gate be opened to another place?
- Can the Gate be opened to the bottom of the ocean? How about the center of the Sun? Black hole? If it can, it's an ultimate weapon.
- Minor nitpick: does the wind blow through the Gate? It would be an unusual coincidence if atmospheric pressure was exactly equal on both sides of the Gate, after all.

So yeah, really interesting premise, horribly butchered execution. At least the harem looks interesting, so it's not a total loss. But still, just thinking how great it could be makes me really sad.
