Huh. It sounds like the anime is very different from the manga...? I don't remember most of the issues people have raised here (with a few notable exceptions) being present in the manga. Memory is a bit fuzzy, it's been awhile since I read the start, and it doesn't come out with new scanlationss that often.

If memory serves... Making gates is not an easy thing, so they don't do it often, but they've definitely done it before. All prior occasions, the Empire was more than a match for whatever they found - there's a persistent undercurrent of arrogance in the Empire, where they basically have too much trouble believing they're not at the top of the heap. This is very obviously aggravated by the portal being rather far from the Imperial capital, and messengers being guys on horseback.

I think, also, the resulting Gate occupation force (or whatever they call it) IS international, although headed by Japan, and they take a lot of careful steps. It's like they looked over the history books of the European world take over and said "Okay, how do we NOT do that?". There's bits where the diplomat is taking insults within flinching, bending over backwards to follow customs, etc, etc... while they're signaling to the sniper to NOT fire.

The harem trope is even pretty extensively subverted; I'm having trouble summarizing. I think the main point is that he's not shy, he's just not interested. So you still have the "one man, lots of women", but they don't form even the usual not-a-harem... despite very direct and/or playfully direct attempts by some of the women.

Remaining questions... I don't remember if they address why mages aren't in the army. It could just be a rarity thing, but there may have also been a cultural reason - like the military is for glory, and magic takes away from that?

The Empire is depicted as fairly competent, just so completely out of it's depth with the Earth forces they can't even process it. There's numerous occasions where nobles in the capital scoff at the reports from the field, because they're so used to the Empire out classing anyone they literally can't understand that the tables are turned. Maybe they could if the tables weren't turned so drastically, but...
