The issues I had were all about treatment of the Gate by earthlings, not the empire, so manga is not much better than anime here. I agree that manga is better than anime in that regard, it just isn't significantly better.

  The harem trope is even pretty extensively subverted; I'm having trouble summarizing. I think the main point is that he's not shy, he's just not interested. So you still have the "one man, lots of women", but they don't form even the usual not-a-harem... despite very direct and/or playfully direct attempts by some of the women.

This is exactly the way Japanese animation handles harems since the birth of genre in Love Hina. Not much trope subversion here, unfortunately.
