  Remaining questions... I don't remember if they address why mages aren't in the army. It could just be a rarity thing, but there may have also been a cultural reason - like the military is for glory, and magic takes away from that?

Problem I have with that is it's an empire, so it's been fighting a lot of wars. Against enemies who ought to have mages too, and who would put mages to use in battle. The empire wouldn't have won without using mages too.
