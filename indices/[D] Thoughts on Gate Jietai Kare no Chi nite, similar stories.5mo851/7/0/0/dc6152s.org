Besides ammo, there is another thing captured weapons don't come with: manuals. An untrained soldier trying a gun for the first time without any guidance is more likely to hit his leg or break the gun than make any progress.

You also underestimate just how fast ammo is spent in modern weapons. It's literally seconds on full auto.
