Despite it's many flaws, I actually liked GATE more then I disliked it.

What always bothered me was that, similar to what [[/u/PlaneOfInfiniteCats]] mentioned regarding that gate itself, is that no one fucking cared about all the magic-y stuff.

Mages. Human (or, at the absolute least, Humanoid) individuals with the ability to wave a shiny stick around, say some words, and apparently violate conservation of energy. This isn't even limited to the world beyond the Gate, as we clearly see Lelei's magic and Rori's immortality and bullshit demigod powers working on the Earth side. That, right there, should have literally taken the scientific community and turned it upside down.

To say nothing of the fact that waving a stick and chanting shouldn't allow one to manipulate gravity or energy at all, but at least that's hypothetically something we could replicate with sufficiently advanced technology.

Magical creatures - Hello, Red Dragon. Have you ever heard of Square-Cube law? No? Okay, then. Aerodynamics? No? Okay, then. You go right on ahead flying around with tiny wings that cannot possibly generate enough lift, with a body dense enough to withstand your weight that nevertheless doesn't seem to require you to eat more then a couple of cows or something on a given day.

DemiHuman hybrids - Don't even get me started on Genetics Do Not Work That Way, except apparently, they do? MDs and PhDs alike should be going gaga over the demihuman hybrid races. They should be requesting tissue and fluid samples, or even extradition of volunteers for extensive study.

Metaphysical Identity and Continuity of Conciousness - Rori is a Demigod close to becoming an actual God. She supposedly channels "souls" to her patron when they die near her, which has a outward and measurable effect on her, so even if it's not a "soul" as Abrahamic tradition would have it, she's certainly being exposed to something. There is a treasure trove of philosophical and theological knowledge in her very existence, and we see at least one other Demigod and we hear references to at least three full Gods, one of which apparently keeps trying to get into Rori's pants.

I mean, Japan Stronk and Attack Helicopters crushing evil roman legions are cool and all, but come on.

So much wasted story potential.
