A fanfic worth reading if you can handle that it's a quest is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-no-gate-we-did-not-fight-there-ck2-gate.357477/][There was no GATE; we did not fight there]], it uses CKII stats for characters so is technically a crossover and takes place pre-gate, but really addresses some of your issues.

1-Plot-I guess? It's a quest, but the DM puts a lot of effort into making really in-depth story and characterisation.

2-Gates-Explained as an act of god, it's still 10 years out or so, and implied to be hard.

3-Mages-So much yes. It reinvented the magic system, gave my headcanon of what the difference between magic and spirit magic is, and answered all your questions beyond invaders, obviously, in that there are Imperial Mages. They are rare but are often drafted as auxiliaries or battlefield support.

4-Tech-No gate yet, but the DM mentioned characters would reverse engineer technology. On a similar note, one of the gods has a space station visible from the surface.

5-Abuse-The empire vs the Bunny Tribes and in reverse too, lots of raiding, and since it's SB there is brutal retaliation, but the bunnies are able to flee in the face of annihilation when their superweapon fails.

The best gate fiction I have read by a long shot and is still updating.
