See, I also didn't like Gate:JDSF, but mainly because the Japanese didn't let the Americans in on the fun.

We have very different priorities ;P

But seriously, I thought I was going to love it because I love these kinds of portal fantasies (See: [[http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=118771][The Salvation War]] and [[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Humanity_Fuck_Yeah][Humanity Fuck Yeah]] in general), but it crossed the boundrary from "acceptable wish fulfillment" to "every Japanese character is a Mary Sue" pretty quickly.
