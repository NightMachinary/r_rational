Gate is indeed not very rational and consistent, but it's not terrible.

Mages are very rare, and not actually that powerful.

They can't capture invader's tech because it needs ammo, which they don't have.

The whole Earth's eyes are on invaders, so they need to appear as model as possible - and they can, since they don't actually feel any threat from their adversaries.

The gate, iirc, wasn't created by empire mages, but priests, appealing to some god. This power is very unreliable, and can't be consistently used for warfare.
