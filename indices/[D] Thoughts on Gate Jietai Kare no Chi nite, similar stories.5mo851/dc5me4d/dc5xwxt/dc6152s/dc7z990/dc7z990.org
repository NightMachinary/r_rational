After the first few mishaps their forces will start to learn. Really, it's not that hard to figure out how to shoot, if you have a company of men toying with a couple dozen captured guns that already have cartridges in them, for weeks on end, they're bound to figure it out. Capture a few prisoners and at least one can be made to teach the troops how to reload it. There are people who build do-it-yourself furniture without looking at the manual. They can figure it out. Training and aiming's a different story, of course, they won't have enough ammo for that, but even with bad training and bad aim a submachine gun is still way better than a crossbow.

Doesn't matter that the ammo that can be held in a weapon at one time gets used up in seconds - the people wielding those weapons carry enough additional ammo on themselves to last through a typical skirmish, no? All of which can be captured when the guy's killed.
