Invaders carry some ammo with them though. If you capture a tank it'll still have some shells left, if you capture a submachine gun it will still have bullets left, if you win a battle you'll probably also get your hands on some undetonated grenades and unused bullet clips for whatever gun the soldiers were using, etc.
