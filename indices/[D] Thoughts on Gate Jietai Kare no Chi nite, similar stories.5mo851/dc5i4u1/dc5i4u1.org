The "why doesn't the emperor do X" parts is probably what annoys the most about this series, and what made me quit it. A story can get away with a stupid but overwhelming main villain, or a weak but resourceful villain, but Gate is about beating villains battle after battle without them ever changing their tactics.

Plus all the pro-Japanese propaganda, "there never was any ethnic cleansing in China", the American/Russian/Chinese are evil, the Empire is blatantly evil and never shows any redeeming quality, etc.

As for how to make a rational fic out of this... well, it's the same as making hard SF out of Star Wars, you mostly have to make your own thing from the ground up. One interesting change would be to have the Empire military (or at least some part of it) be extremely experienced and competent. So they have undeveloped technology, but they adapt fast, they know guerilla tactics, they have extremely competent spies and saboteurs and super-trained commandos (having invisibility and memory erasing spells is also a great advantage), and suddenly the Japanese military is in danger.

It could also lead into interesting arms races (invisibility spells -> heat-seeking drones -> cold blood spells -> magic detecting -> magic scrambling -> etc), where each side needs to keep sending spies to learn about the other's technologies to develop counter-measures.
