Damn, you beat me to it.

Meta-moral of the story: if your understanding of a situation is that everyone involved is stupid, your understanding of the situation is probably lacking.

Also, some of these tactics (especially rolling artillery barrage) worked. The problem was that none of those tactics were fast enough to completely breach the front lines, which had redundant levels of fortifications, and were reinforced as soon as one side attacked.

So the French would breach a trench, capture a hill, then be stalled at the next trench, while the Germans would send troops to re-take the hill and prepare additional defenses behind the new front lines, the French would be driven back after intense fighting, then start another offensive, etc.

Although I never understood why they would use tunnels to plant bombs in enemy lines, as opposed as sending troops that way.
