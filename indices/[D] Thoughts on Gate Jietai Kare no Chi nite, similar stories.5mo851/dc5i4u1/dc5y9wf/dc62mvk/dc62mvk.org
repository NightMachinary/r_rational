[[https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1qs5hz/in_rcombatfootage_we_learn_that_wwi_generals_were][Contrary to popular belief, WWI commanders weren't complete morons]]

/The final piece of badhistory is the idea that the commanders didn't try anything else. They tried many things. They tried digging tunnels under the opposing lines and then blowing the lines up (this would prove somewhat successful in limited trials). They tried poison gas. They tried tanks and other armored vehicles. They perfected the art of a rolling artillery barrage. This consisted of the artillery firing just ahead of the advancing soldiers in the hopes that it would keep the opposing forces pinned deep inside their trenches. They tried massing a large force at one point in the line while leaving a skeleton crew to guard the rest. They tried having the soldiers infiltrate no-man's-land at night time and launch the attacks in the morning from their positions. They tried small scale raids./

/They tried all sorts of different ideas, but all people seem to think about is going up over the trench./

/This belies the main point though, which is this--what else were they supposed to do? In the early days of WWI the battle fields were fluid. By the time trench warfare developed you basically had two fortified positions staring at each other. What does this poster think could have been done to take the forts? You have to attack them directly and any attack on a fortified position is going to have serious losses./

/They couldn't dig encircling trenches and move them closer to the objective (as was done at Petersburg in the American Civil War), because the trench system stretched across France. The only way to attack them was by direct assault./
