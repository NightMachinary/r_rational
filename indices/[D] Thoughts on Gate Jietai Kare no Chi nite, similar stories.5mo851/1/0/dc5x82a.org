It's close to impossible to recommend it here becaus of language barrier, but few years ago Marcin Ciszewski published a short serie of novels (sadly in Polish only) - /[[http://www.1939.com.pl][www.1939.com.pl]]/ and /[[http://www.1944.waw.pl][www.1944.waw.pl]]/ (these are not links!) that realistically dealt with modern batallion tossed into September '39 during German Blitzkrieg in Poland and Warsaw uprising in 1944. Short story - they lost. Long story: He explored political, cultural, military aspects of such transfer. That's closest to rational fiction I know about. There is nothing in 'modern world in fantasy setting' that I know about.

If you're into WW2 themes and you ever spot English translations of these novels I encourage to read them.
