I'm completely aware of all these points, it's not like I hadn't studied a little bit of WWI. Both sides continuously thought that:

1. The enemy nation /must/ be close to breaking /now/ after the enormous casualties they've suffered thus far, one more push'll do it
2. We'll just make a quick attack, if it grinds to a halt we'll abandon the attack -> attack makes progress for 1 day, they keep going even though it goes nowhere on all subsequent days
3. Let's attack this place, they'll never see it coming (they always see it coming, moving 500,000 men is kind of easy to spot)
4. Do a rolling barrage, fire 10 million shells and they'll be too battered to stop our charge! Hint: a trench with 3/4 of its people turned into casualties is almost as effective as a trench with no casualties.
5. Let's concentrate our manpower! Yes, machine guns tend to be more effective when used in crowded places.
