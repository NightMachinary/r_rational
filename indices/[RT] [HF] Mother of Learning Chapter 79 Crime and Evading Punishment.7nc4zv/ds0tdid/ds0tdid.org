I didn't think the justification for ship-shaped airships made much sense. If it's really so hard to build an airship, you'd think they'd consider it vital to keep it light and not use an already-built boat just to save a little time and money.

A better reason would be so that they can sail when they're on the ocean and between ley lines.
