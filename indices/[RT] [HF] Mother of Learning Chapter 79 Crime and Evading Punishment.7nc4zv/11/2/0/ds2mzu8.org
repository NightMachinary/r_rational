it is possible. I still lean towards it being an inborn ability rather than one granted later. we haven't seen (or had Zorian go through) an actual ritual like that yet, so we don't know what they entail. I also am in the camp that suspects that red robe may be a copy of a real person in a crafted or animated body of some sort, instead of something straightforward. mostly just headcanon though, I am not trying to convince anyone. it's just an interesting possibility.
