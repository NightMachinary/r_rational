I don't think that would work to give someone soul sight. It's stated in chapter 75 that it "isn't really sight as such, so much as a whole new sense" so it wouldn't be bound to the eye at all. Also it would've been brought up at some point if soul sight could be gained by such a simple method, and it hasn't.
