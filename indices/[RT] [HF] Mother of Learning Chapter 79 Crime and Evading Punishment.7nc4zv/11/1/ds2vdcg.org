Given that in chapter 31, Zorian noted that one of Alanic's eyes are brown while the other is blue with a scar over it that made it seem like it should have destroyed the eye, I think it's implied even if it's not confirmed that Alanic's soul sight came from taking someone else's eye and putting it into his own eye socket.

Now that I think about it, seems like a reference to Kakashi from Naruto.
