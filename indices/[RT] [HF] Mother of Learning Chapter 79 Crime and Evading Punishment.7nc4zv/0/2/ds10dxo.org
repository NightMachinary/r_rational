To be fair, Alanic's problem seemed to only really be about breaking into the royal treasury. Well, that and working with Silverlake, but he could probably stand doing the latter if her presence is minimal. So Z&Z could probably still have Alanic's cooperation in facing Quatach, once they're done with the other business he considers unpleasant.
