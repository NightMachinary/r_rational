Agreed. Alternatively, fire into a dimensional gate that, for example, opens up on some important part of the ship.

My guess, though, is that these airships are magically protected to be able to take artillery magic to a degree, so teleporting aboard and wrecking shit from the inside is more feasible.

"Well, simulacrum two opened a hole in the hull."

The shielding could defend against massive attacks but not weak ones---essentially like a /non-Newtonian fluid/.
