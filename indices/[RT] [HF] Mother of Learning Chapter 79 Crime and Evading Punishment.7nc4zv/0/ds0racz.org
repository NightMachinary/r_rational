So it seems like it would be better not to include Silverlake in future attempts at getting all the artifacts, because Alanic was surprisingly effective at fighting QI, who will be a huge challenge to get past. I'm not totally clear on what benefit Silverlake gives for getting the pieces of the key. Traps for QI maybe, but Zorian is better at wards than her so she won't be much help for the dagger. If the sun Temple is a straightforward combat challenge, losing the use of Alanic would be rather harmful.

For defending the Pearl, I think Zach is much better than Zorian for taking down opposing ships. Artillery spells arent always optimal because of how slow they are. For Zach, he can now make simulacra that can teleport. Simply have a simulacrum teleport on top of the airship, and fire piercing artillery spells down on it. Losing one of Zach's simulacra doesn't matter too much because they are the ectoplasm kind, and thus don't represent as large an investment of resources as Zorian's.

This could be a rather good tactic for a couple different situations. Have a simulacra start casting a huge artillery spell, and then teleport it to wherever you want a crater to be instead of an opponent just before it finishes. Or just load it down with alchemical bombs for a similar effect. Might not work if they're not willing to suicide themselves though.
