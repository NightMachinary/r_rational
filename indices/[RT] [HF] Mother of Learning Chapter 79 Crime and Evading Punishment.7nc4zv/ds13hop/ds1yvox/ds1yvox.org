Maybe I'm misunderstanding your comment. Unless I missed something in the chapter, there are no plans to use the airship to rob of the royal treasury. The airship is to get them through the Xlotic Desert and, in another restart, to Blantyre (sp).

You're right though: The airship would be totally useless in robbing the royal treasury. A legion or highly skilled mages riding eagles could very easily out-maneuver the airship.
