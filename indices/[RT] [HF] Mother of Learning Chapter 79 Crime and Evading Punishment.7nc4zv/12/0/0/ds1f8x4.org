Oh yeah I forgot about them. Although, didn't Zorian have rather more moral deliberation about doing that? (and it was noted that Zorian instinctively didn't have the same aversion to it, due to them not appearing human - killing a human represents a deeper blunting of instinctual prohibitions against killing people for Zorian, even though the Aranea are people so it's morally equivalent)

So correction - this is the first time Zorian is killing people who aren't either evil, hired by someone evil, or non-human persons.

The only instinctive-moral barrier left for him is attacking non-combatants (and barely even that - because both the Arana and the airship defenders were primarily acting in defense of territory and material resources. So they arguably only became "combatants" because Zorian sort of forced them to be combatants, which is an awful lot like attacking non-combatants. It's not the /same/ thing because attacking someone's resources and then lethally defending yourself against their retaliation is very different from directly lethally attacking an otherwise peaceful person's body, but it's definitely getting closer and closer to the edge.)
