Maybe your right, and nobody103 kind of made a point of Zorian#2 pausing for a moment after killing the skater mage, perhaps calling our attention to the moral significance of the event.

However, I don't think he'd kill dozens of aranea for practice outside of the loop though. Or hunt dozens of wolves just to skin them and sell the pelts without concern for wasting food. And those things occurred a very long time ago. So, he's definitely been willing to do /some/ morally questionable things that he wouldn't do outside of the loop.
