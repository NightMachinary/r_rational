That skating big mustachio, I'm guessing he's a noble with military tradition, just like the Novedas were. Small fireball that doesn't just engulf but explode greatly, there must be bloodline involved! My wild imagination is suggesting he's not just any noble, but a prince! He is an interesting character. In other fiction, I'd love to read more of him. But in MoL, gathering keys plot must be the focus for quite some while. I'm torn.
