So conflict between Silverlake and Alanic huh they certainly are the sort of characters where I thought there might be tension/distrust between but I didn't expect outright conflict to be their reaction there is definitely a colorful history there. Both are useful allies and probably essential to pull off the escape(Silverlake especially if the keys don't work) But Alanic is probably right that Silverlake isn't really trustworthy(even if I suspect his views are somewhat tinted by past dealings with her) she is definitely looking for anything she can use as extra leverage and her secret coded notes definitely contain secrets. I suspect like the Spider queen from the early on(I can't remember their title/name been too long:P )She will want to do something beyond what she says such as looking to escape the loop as well or perhaps to sneakily get something she hasn't been able to get before abusing the loop. After all she is a very crafty one... I still remember the Grey Hunter. >_>

That said Alanic may be out regarding the treasury heist but he still seems to be amiable to the rest but that part will definitely need some extra care during the heist if they go that route. That said I'm not convinced the royals can't be reasoned with, assuming they could convince them in a reasonable time table that is, which would be a gamble so I can see why it might be a problem here

As for the airship that was an interesting jacking with lots of room for improvement though I am skeptical that it will be as useful in raiding the royal treasury as they seem to think right now. I would certainly prefer to deal with QI than that place as you at least have some idea what your dealing with there where as the royal treasury carries a very high unknown risk given the extreme degree of paranoia proofed defenses they seem to have yeah I'd only go for that after the others. Well thanks for the Chapter nobody103! :)
