It's not stated directly, but it seems fairly obvious given the evidence we've seen.

- Current top candidate for RR is Veyers. And if not Veyers, it's both narratively and statistically unlikely to be some 2nd tier Ibasan lich.
- RR was feeding QI future information.\\
- QI didn't know that RR was timelooping, which means that RR knew him well enough (likely via timetravel) to convince him without playing that card.
- RR had good relationship with QI, enough that he got him to come personally and QI was quipping with him. He was not /just/ an asset.\\
- RR had been helping the invasion for a great many loops, meaning he'd been in QI's confidences for a ton loops as well.
- RR knows obscure magics including mind magic and soul magic.
- RR also knows the very hard to get simulacrum spell (which all liches know, and it's a plot point on how hard it is to find) and the portal spell (which at a long distance is an Ibasan only spell).

The most straightforward answer is that RR was using his future knowledge to get QI to tutor him (or tutor him by proxy, like Matriarch/Novelty did with Zorian).
