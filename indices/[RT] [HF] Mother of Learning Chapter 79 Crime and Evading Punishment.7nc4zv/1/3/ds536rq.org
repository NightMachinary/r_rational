Why would QI have any interest in helping ZZ? Their objectives are opposed.

RR could just drop off a packet of names, dates, secret passages, passwords, etc, and let them confirm that it's correct and useful for the invasion, since that's what the Ibasans were already doing. But if ZZ want them to do anything other than invade gud, then QI will want much more explanation. And when he gets it, why would he cooperate?
