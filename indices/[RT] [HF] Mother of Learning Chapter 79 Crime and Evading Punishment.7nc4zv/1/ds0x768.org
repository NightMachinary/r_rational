  He kind of has to [break into the Royal Vaults], doesn't he?

Does he?

It seems like breaking and entering is the path of most resistance. Why not diplomatically groundhog attack the royal family instead of breaking into the vaults?

I don't see why the royal family would be an order of magnitude more difficult to convince than Silverlake or Xvim or the Aranea (who cost multiple entire cycles each), and nothing is saying that they have to stop trying to break in while they convince the royal family. The royal family is the most likely of anyone to have time-traveler-contingency-codes and is also far more useful for getting things done once they're convinced. It seems like something that that Zach Noveda, Last of House Noveda, Prodigy Archmage, Slayer of the Dragon Oganj could be able to pull off with enough tries.

Their current 8+ man party is good, but an entire nation is a hell of a lot better.

Similarly, it seems odd that they haven't tried to use diplomancy on QI at all. They know it can be done since RR did it, and it would open up huge capabilities for backstabbing QI. Yes, he is very very very scary, but talking to him is not much more risky than the Aranea mindbreaking Zorian before he learned mind magic or how they're trusting Silverlake right now.

As the Ghost Serpent and Silverlake and the Aranea and literally everyone else they've ever opened up to has mentioned, it is a literally unbeatable tactic. And unlike the Ghost Serpent who wants nothing they have to offer, QI is making a very desperate and expensive gambit right now and could use all the help he can get.
