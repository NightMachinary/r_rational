Theoretically, someone who's in on the time loop might be willing to do it on the grounds that this version of themselves is ultimately doomed anyway.

QI stealing information is a concern, but Zorian is probably creative enough to set up a way to know that it happened in time for him and Zach to kill themselves before QI got to them. With adequate precautions, it wouldn't be the worst idea to spend a restart or two trying it out, since it could easily take multiple restarts to defeat him and take the crown anyway.

Unless soul damage persists across time loops even for people other than ZZ, in which case they'd risk "permanently" sacrificing a useful ally. I forget how that works.
