The aranea are not known to be openly aggressive without provocation and Zorian didn't fully understand the nature of the risk back then.

Silverlake is also not openly malicious. I don't think she'd mangle the soul of a kid for telling her a tall tale.

On the other hand, QI could utterly twist their soul on a whim and he just might. He is utterly terrifying. Who knows what he'd see if he had time to causally look at the soul of a controller? What if he looked at Zorian's soul? Would he notice scarring that makes him think he caused the scarring?

No, I think befriending QI is a huge risk.
