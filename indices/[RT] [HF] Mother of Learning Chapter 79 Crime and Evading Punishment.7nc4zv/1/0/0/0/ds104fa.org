  Silverlake literally tried to kill Zorian for the lulz after he finisher her first apprenticeship task, and she can soul damage them all the same.

Nah, there's no way a normal teenager would attempt to kill a grey hunter after reading up on it. And there's no way a normal teenager would intentionally find a grey hunter without learning about it first. If the teenager is dumb, then yeah, Silverlake made a dick move. However, like me, she probably doubted a dumb teenager would have been able to find her in the first place.

And if Zorian was a looper as he claimed, then fighting a grey hunter isn't actually that dangerous.

And yes, she could soul damage them, but so could Alanic. They put a /lot/ of trust in him because he seems okay. Kael had recommended Silverlake to Zorian, so they probably view her as annoying but not life- or soul-threatening.

As for using simulacra to talk to QI, I don't think that's any safer. Simulacra are still attached to the owner's soul.

I don't know; I just feel parlay with QI is incredibly dangerous, even more dangerous than facing him in battle where QI is more likely to be too busy to examine their souls up close.

However, you make a good point that Red Robe did it without fear. But maybe they knew each other from before the loop and so RR was comfortable enough with it.
