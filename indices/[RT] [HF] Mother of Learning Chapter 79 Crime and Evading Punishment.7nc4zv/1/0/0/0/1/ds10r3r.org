  Nah, there's no way a normal teenager would attempt to kill a grey hunter after reading up on it. And there's no way a normal teenager would intentionally find a grey hunter without learning about it first. If the teenager is dumb, then yeah, Silverlake made a dick move. However, like me, she probably doubted a dumb teenager would have been able to find her in the first place.

A dumb teenager can get a letter telling where she is and instinctively blow the head off a giant monster about to eat him. There's nothing inherently intelligent about that. Silverlake = Ultimate Dick
