This is actually a good possibility I didn't consider and would explain why he said things the way he did regarding not being around while they talk about such things even if he understands their desperation. That said earlier he heard that magical oaths have become more or less useless in the modern era of magic as modern magic's versatility makes it far to easy to override them. But considering the nature of the power base the royals and church no doubt have, oaths might still be of value to them for select individuals they wish to keep on a leash as with their resources they may be able to check that those people are still under an oath. Thus it may be that if this is the case the royals are a group he literally can not oppose. I'm not sure this is the case but the idea itself is quite interesting.

Edit sorry about the typos :|
