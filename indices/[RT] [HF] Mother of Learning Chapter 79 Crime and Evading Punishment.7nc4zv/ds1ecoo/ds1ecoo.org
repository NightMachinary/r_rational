  still remember how you came to me back then, a budding little necromancer full of ambition and anger... A necromancer and a thief became a fervent priest and a patriot

I suspect Alanic's reform included submitting to some kind of magically enforced oath of service to the church/good/law. They (the church or the state or whoever) allowed this because they could see how useful Alanic (including all necromancy knowledge) would be on the side of the law.

This would explain why Alanic is trusted to command such resources; because he is highly competent and the magical oath gives strong assurance he is acting for the common good. Alanic is like a Lensman of the MoL universe.
