  I assume Zorian used a mental restructuring on simulacra 2? That sort of dispassionate killing of relative innocents doesn't seem like his usual self.

Why would he have had to do that? He's killed people before, and dragon cult or not killing people is generally necessary when stealing the most valuable artifacts on the planet. I don't think he even /can/ do that with the simulcrums, certainly we've never seen any evidence of him doing it.
