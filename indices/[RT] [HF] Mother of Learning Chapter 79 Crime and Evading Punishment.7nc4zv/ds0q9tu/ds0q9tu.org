That was one of my main guesses for Alanic's past. Silverlake likes to actively antagonize people, I'm surprised she can get away with making so many enemies while being so long lived, but I suppose she can deal with any aggression that comes her way.

I assume Zorian used a mental restructuring on simulacra 2? That sort of dispassionate killing of relative innocents doesn't seem like his usual self.
