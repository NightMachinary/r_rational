Silverlake is your highly capable yet highly annoying member of the conspiracy. The default attitude toward her is to not involve her at group ops. But this theft, and its subsequent operations, is big deal. It's discourteous to left anybody out, so Zorian and Zach willing to give her a chance. This is the first, is it not? So yeah, without immense contribution later on, Z&Z might won't bother to involve her again.

  Have a simulacra start casting a huge artillery spell, and then teleport it to wherever you want a crater to be instead of an opponent just before it finishes. Or just load it down with alchemical bombs for a similar effect.

I don't believe I understand this sentence. Artillery spell is devastating (no point for additional alchemical bomb there), but require static target. Do you suggest using dimensional gate so that it can hit moving large objects like airplane? Zorian's simulacrum stated that even 'just' teleporting between moving platform is challenging. I imagine the difficulty of operating dimensional passage would be insurmountable.
