Quatach-Ichl is /also/ a highly respected, rational, heavily competent leader of a country who has already been shown to treat his subordinates fairly, work with timetravelers, and balance diplomatic concerns.

Silverlake literally tried to kill Zorian for the lulz after he finisher her first apprenticeship task, and she can soul damage them all the same.

QI is a big risk, but since they can now reset the time loop instantly or even negotiate via simulacra, he's not much more of a risk. It's probably less of a risk in absolute terms to try to talk to him than to face him in battle.
