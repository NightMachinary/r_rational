We'll just have to agree to disagree.

Depression is unlikely make a teenager trapeze through the woods hunting stuff and looking for a witch so he can beg her for help with soul magic, spend time as the witch's apprentice, then go kill himself attacking a spider he wouldn't be able to find in the first place to do research.

Case in point, pre-loop why wasn't Zach going around adventuring like a daredevil? Because he was barely even a mage who was struggled to even keep up and was probably suffering from depression.

But there's something I keep forgetting to mention: Silverlake spent time with Zorian and could observe his temperament. I'd wager this influenced her decision.

She may be self-interested, but I don't think she'd send an innocent person to their death for absolutely no reason. I think she honestly thought he'd abandon the project as soon as he learned what a grey hunter was.
