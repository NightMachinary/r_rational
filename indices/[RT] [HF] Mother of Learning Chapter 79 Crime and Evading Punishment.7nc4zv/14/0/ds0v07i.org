I feel developing alternative way to escape the time loop by mastering dimensional magic is an important sub-plot. I think several chapters dedicated to developing that plot is well worth it. I am very satisfied with idea of butchered primordial turned toy revealed to Zorian. But I get that sometimes people want one plot to be stubbornly pursued.

The thing about gathering keys tho, if author want it to be a failure, Zorian would left without plan B. Then we will spend quite sometimes to develop another way out. If author want it to be a complete success, it would be cheap. You see, all your plan working out is not a great way to build a story. I really like what author has done so far, a mostly successful operations with some inevitable complications.

See emperor orb ops as example. It's laden with baggages: killed expedition members creating a tense situation, Daimen get grounded, highly involvement of Taramatula estate, revelation of Kazinski family history and motive, and revelation of Fortov's issue. I missed some there, but the point is, while they build a complete picture, they add to the previously developed sub-plots. I think it's worthy of praise.
