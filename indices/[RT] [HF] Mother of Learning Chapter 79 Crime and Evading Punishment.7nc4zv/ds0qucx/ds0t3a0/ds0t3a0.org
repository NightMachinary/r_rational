I noticed nobody103 used brackets for subordinate thought and em/en dash if it's in speech form. the dash worked better in this chapter, but I'm more partial to ye olde comma and period. Not merely a discourse in taste, but since the very start, Mother of Learning style of narration seems to favor simple sentences one line of thought at a time. In fact, only lately I feel there were a number of side remarks. I think simple-sentence is a very good style; readers digested them easily and author would be quite challenged to translate multiple line of thought into simple straightforward passage.
