Meh! Undertale is already pretty "rational" in a way: it's a game about how everyone around you is actually a real person with their own lives, and you don't /need/ to powergame your way through a heap of corpses, and in fact you're kind of a bad person if you do.

It's a very Reality Ensues sort of game, that way.
