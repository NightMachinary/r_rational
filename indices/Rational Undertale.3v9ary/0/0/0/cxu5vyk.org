If the box is all you know and you don't know that there's anything reachable outside of it you don't really try to escape it. People thought for eons (and still think) that our world was created by a superior being. Yet breaking out and going to His world only exists as the typical "path to paradise//heaven/nirvana" thing. I haven't heard any stories of vikings trying to break through Ymir's skull.
