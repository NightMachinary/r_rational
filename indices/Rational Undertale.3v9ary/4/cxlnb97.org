I'd like to see this too; I don't think it would be a good thing within the confines of the story itself, but within the meta-story (the fact that several characters know you can save/reset and thus are more than just the sprite within the game) would be amazing. Yes, they escape the Underground... but they also spread the knowledge that some force out there is controlling their fates and who can just... delete everything.

Basically it would become an A.I.-gaining-sentience type of deal, in my mind.

If you find anything, please post it!
