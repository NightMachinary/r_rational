Not as far as I've seen. I've been checking AO3 and and FFNet pretty obsessively for fics. :p

Edit: The closest thing I've found is this, dealing with the political aftermath of exitting -- it's only got two chapters, though they're long: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5148158/chapters/11851688]]

Also, fair warning to anyone remotely interested in playing the game Undertale (really solid one, by the way, though this isn't exactly the place to proselytize), don't read this. Spoilers abound, and it's a game that pretty much anything about it is a spoiler.
