No. Now, if you wanted to write it... Rational!sans would be an optimal choice. (What run it is is up to the author.) Take either Flowey or chara for the antagonist.

Rational!Frisk breaks the laws of balance, since canon has them completely OP with the save and all- if victory is possible, they will win in the end.

Rational!Flowey is arguably worse, but may make a good dubious character.
