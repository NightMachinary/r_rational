Okay then, I'll get to it around 8 tonight. Quick question, should I include stories that aren't posted anywhere online, but can be bought through Amazon?

For example, I have a link to Ted Chiang's stories, but he also has all of the stories in a published book on Amazon, so should I include the website link or only direct people to his Amazon page? The other three works would be Blindsight, Echopraxia, and Accelerando.

Do you want only fiction for the website, or should I include some good nonfiction books on rationality such as /Thinking, Fast and Slow/?
