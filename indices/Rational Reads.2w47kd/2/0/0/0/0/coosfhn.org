I'm posting a few stories to the site and I noticed that there are no opportunities to edit the summaries or comments if I make a mistake. In addition, I'm trying to leave a blank line in between parts of the summaries, and instead the site combines it all as one paragraph. I can't separate the typed-in tags from the rest of the summary.

Suggestions:

- To be able to edit summaries, comments, or titles.

- To be able to search by author, titles, tags, phrases in the summary, rating, and to check what someone has in their bookshelf or recommendations.

- To be able to see who submitted which stories. I'm not too sure how useful this would be, but it's a suggestion.

- To be able to mark stories Complete, Updating Quickly, Updating Slowly, Dead, or just Incomplete.

- To be able to include more links than just one and to allow other people to add new links (the story might get moved to a new site).

- To allow future editing by other people other than the one who first posted the story. (If you are worried about someone ruining the summaries, just look to Wikipedia for how well that turned out.)

- Don't have the default length be set to Short. Have it be a blank field which is required to be filled before submission, or set to Unknown. I already accidentally submitted a few stories labeled as Short.

- Allow people to see the URL address they are clicking on. Some people might submit a link to a bad website to be funny and I sometimes prefer to Google search the address if it looks suspicious.

- Recommended tags: Rational, Hints of Rationality, Comic, Web Novel, Blog, Offline Book, E-book, Fiction, Non-Fiction, Original Work, Fan Fiction.

- Have genre tags like Horror, Mature, Sci-Fi, Slice-of-Life, Action, Adventure, Drama, Family/Friendship, Science, Math, History, Textbook (?), etc...

- An option for a darker background. Some people don't like having to spend time looking at a white background.

- The search bar seems a little wonky. It's fine when there are multiple potential matches to what I type in, but when I get more specific by typing the full title, it will repeat the one or two valid results multiple times.

- Include formatting options such as italics, bolding, underlining, strikeout, and all of the nifty stuff reddit provides for us in our comments.

- A way for readers to request the removal of a certain story. Maybe the story doesn't fit the theme of the website, someone is being a jerk by adding bad stories, the story has changed into something people don't like, or just have a filter such as stories posted on the site for at least a month, have 2 stars or less, and have 20 voters should be removed.
