So what this subreddit needs is a designated place to put all of the links for the works, and that place would have be easy to find, easy to use and have the option of on the fly editing and user commenting/discussion. Like some sort of dedicated thread, color coded for convenience. And we could call it something like Tricky Thread or maybe even Lickey Thread, or something equally phonetic.

Ok sarcasm mode off.

But in all seriousness why bother with maintaining a site when a pm to the mod for a sticky thread could do the same.

Im gonna ask eaturbrainz just for that brb.
