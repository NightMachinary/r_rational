looks great. one thing i'm noticing is the large number of singly-rated works in the "highest rated" block, which seems a little sub-optimal; [[http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html][this guy]] suggests using the lower bound of a 95% confidence interval. other than that, everything's working smoothly -- even on my phone, which is apparently an issue for 90% of websites. kudos.
