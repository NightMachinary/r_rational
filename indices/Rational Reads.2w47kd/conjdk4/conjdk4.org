  Rational Reads To be clear, this site is not meant only for rational fiction, otherwise it would just be a glorified list of 15 works, but for works which those who like rational fiction might enjoy.

Then whats the point? We already have that on this sub, minus the listing function.

Why not just make a site to contain works that are strictly rational in nature? There is definitely more than 15 of those btw, and I mean more than 15 stories that were written by the rational community to be rational stories.

With a name like rational reads you would think it would be all about stories that are rational. Yet here were are.
