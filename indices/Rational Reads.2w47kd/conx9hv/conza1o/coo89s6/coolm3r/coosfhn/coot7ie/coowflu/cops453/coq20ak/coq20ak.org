Sure, I'm willing to join up as a moderator. If you're giving me an e-mail account, I'd prefer it to be something like [[mailto:matt@rationalreads.com][matt@rationalreads.com]].

Just to be clear abut my expected duties upfront, I'm only expecting to be doing things like editing summaries, answering questions, mediating arguments in the comments, approving or disapproving certain stories (suggesting what should stay or go; final authority lies with you), sorting and tagging stories, and/or beta-testing. I'm not expecting to be able to help out with the coding or web maintenance.

I recommend moving the Contacts page to the About page, so it's a little more obvious for people to see. I wouldn't have ever noticed it if you hadn't pointed it out to me.

Make it look like:

*About*

blah, blah, blah

*Contacts*
