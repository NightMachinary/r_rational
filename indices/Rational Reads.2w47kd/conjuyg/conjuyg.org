A very nifty feature! Reddit is sadly very bad at being a "depository of stories" due to the way threads work, so its great to have a condensed into one place. Not sure if the community is large enough to sustain such a project (i think others have tried before?) but having a well developed glossary of stories would be very useful.

Only thing i can say is to maybe have a tagging system? That people can sort between say fanfic and original fic, or rationalist vs. "has rationalist elements", and such.
