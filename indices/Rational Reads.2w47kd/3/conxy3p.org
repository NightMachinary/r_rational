A good initiative! I see several favourites on there.

I'm flattered In Fire Forged made the list, even though I must appear soo dead to people around here by now. I'm sorry about that. It's on a temporary hiatus, which will last at the very most until summer begins, and /hopefully/ there will be an update or two before that time.

If I'd known the future when I started publishing, I might have gone with a much more conservative publishing schedule until everything had been weathered through. Alas, I've proven to be very bad at telling the future.
