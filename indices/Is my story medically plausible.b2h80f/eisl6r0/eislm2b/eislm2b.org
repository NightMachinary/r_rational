If you did not have H2O in your system, you would be a rather small pile of dust. Unfortunately your premise is impossible.

There does exist a condition where the skin itself has an allergic reaction to water (but not the rest of the body). So with some modifications and mumbo-jumbo about a more severe case occurring for your character, you could work with the concept.
