Fair enough. The book was more comedic early on but ended up shifting later. I'm not sure why, maybe it was the circumstances in his life or maybe he just had long breaks between working on his novels, but it's not the only book of Mark Twain that changes near the end. Huckleberry Finn is probably my favorite book by him, but the last section was pretty inconsistent in tone.
