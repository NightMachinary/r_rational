According to [[http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Timeline][this]], it's seven/eight months. From September to May. For comparison, right now, in the fanfiction, it should be something around February-March of the same year.

(this makes me realise I should pay more attention to this stuff, like keeping track of the season and weather!)
