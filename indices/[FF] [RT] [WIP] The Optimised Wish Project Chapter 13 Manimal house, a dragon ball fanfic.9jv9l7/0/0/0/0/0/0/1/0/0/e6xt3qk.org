I think you are doing fine. You definitely don't have to consider all the crazy exploits the subredit's combined mental power could think of , only the obvious ones plus some non obvious ones that Puar might think of. Energy limits tends to prevent a lot of exploits(mostly because its crazy to ignore conservation of energy on the first place, even if most magic systems do).

Though just one thing , can puar loose small bits of himself when transformed and be fine? I mean dong it repeatedly might kill him , y and the parts might revert whith him when he untransforms.

But maybe he can make self replicating nanotech(well I mean technically turning into a plant whith seeds and then planting them is creating self replicating nanotech, or even turning into something plus a few bioengeniered bacteria)
