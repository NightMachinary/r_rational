I'm going into this more in detail in chapter 15, but as a general rule he has to keep his own integrity. It's not dissimilar from animagus or other transmutations in HPMOR, though with a bit more tolerance re: changes undergone while transmuted. Liquids, gases, explosives are pretty much a no-go. He could go nuclear if he thought of it but it'd be a last-ditch suicidal attack. Also he retains sentience, but his abilities are otherwise connected to the item he transformed into. If it doesn't have locomotion means, it can't move. If it doesn't have any way to produce sound, it can't speak.
