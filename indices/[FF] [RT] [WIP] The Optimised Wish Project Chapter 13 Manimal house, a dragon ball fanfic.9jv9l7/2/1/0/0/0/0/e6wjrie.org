Additional note after some googling, it looks Luna park was a common term used in the early 20th century. Apparently Coney Island had one too, and Australia had 3, however the Sydney one appears to be the only one still in operation.

Also, I didn't mind the language slip at all, I'd have never guessed you weren't a non native speaker or Italian from what you've written so far!
