He didn't spend one year looking for the Dragon Balls, that was just a few days. Then a few months before the Tournament. Actually going to retcon that because in canon Toriyama didn't properly account for a whole year before the time Pilaf summons the dragon and when Goku goes chasing after the balls and butts head with Red Ribbon.
