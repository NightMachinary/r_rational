I like Yamcha.\\
He's awkward but sociable- well visible from his talk with Goku and recognition of the fight that was about to start.\\
Also well aware and concerned with (social) situation around him- like the sleeping quarters and other questions.

Puar worries me. Power and knowledge will only fuel one another. Possibly one of main villains of this arc?
