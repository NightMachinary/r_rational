I'd say there's a rough mapping from transformed to normal body, so if he loses a small bit, he might find himself without a finger. Self replicating nanotech wouldn't be a "single" part in any sense of the word so it's a no go. He could become a single nanomachine able to replicate itself from surrounding matter, but without a design to take inspiration from that probably still exceeds his mental abilities.
