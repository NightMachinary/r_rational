Interesting. Not sure if you want to reveal all of the details, but if you don't mind I'm curious.

What if the device can perform computation(I asume he doesn't know enough of the computer to do other things)can he do stuff like having an integrated calculator and doing complex math on his head? Or at least have a working computer.

Can he turn into things that don't exist yet if bulma gives him schematics ?

Can he turn into things that use external power , like for example could he turn into a railgun and shoot if he was connected ?

Can he turn into things that need electricity plus a generator?
