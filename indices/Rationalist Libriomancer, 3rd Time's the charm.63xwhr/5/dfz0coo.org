FTL engine for sure, from one of the softer sci-fi series. [[#s][Anathem spoiler]]

The body-transfer creche from Old Man's War.

The "no being magic" rule seems to imply that once you make a permanent transformation, you lose your libriomancy. So my last item would be a bead of Lerasium from Mistborn. If that doesn't work, i.e. libriomancers simply can't give themselves inherent powers at all, then a Firebolt so I can at least fly.

Then go gallivanting around the multiverse having a shitload of fun forever.
