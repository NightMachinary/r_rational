It sounds like it's easy to generate money.

I'd do that. Then I'd see if I could buy bespoke scenes in best sellers / popular fanfiction.

For instance, a sufficient kickstarter or patreon donation would probably let me design a "ring of homeostasis" for some RPG sourcebook.

Then, ask the authors to describe a scene where those items are just sitting on an unattended table in a keep as part of the books explanation on climb / lockpicking checks.

That seems like enough to be immortal and rich.
