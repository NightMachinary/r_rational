From the other thread, it seems like the major limit is that the porters have locked everything interesting.

So, assume this is the case; you need a best seller to have interesting power. All best sellers are locked on principle.

The big loophole that jumps out at me is that the items are powered by global belief. So, it seems like belief continues to matter, even after you've pulled the thing out of the book.

And, if this is true, you could create some interesting feedback loops.

Like, write a text on, "Items of Power", then use it to get a weeping statue of healing, and a copy of the grail.

At first, no one has read the book. So the items would be all but inert. Your own magic could do the cosmetic effects.

But, use the weeping statue to win a Randy Prize (or time on a talk show, or whatever) and I bet people would get really interested.

Belief improves the quality of the items. And it sells books. Which drives belief.

So, pretty soon, you might find that the items pulled from the book are becoming fully powered.

And since we've already manifested them, it wouldn't matter if the porters lock the book as it starts becoming popular.
