Heat death is not necessarily busted. Unless, unbeknownst to us, there are other people with TK in any of the scenarios, then you're the only with it. No guarantee your children will have TK, or that it will otherwise survive beyond you. If you live a very safe life for a while, I suppose you could potentially survive until uploading, but still assumes that the TK sticks with your upload rather than your meatmind, which is not specified. And, to me at least, I get the feeling that people with TK might have a shorter life expectancy than the average, purely out of risk of sudden death.
