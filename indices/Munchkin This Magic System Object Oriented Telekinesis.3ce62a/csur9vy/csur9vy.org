I'm inside, before someone's tries to munchkin what they perceive as objects.

Only having to be able to uniquely identify the target out of all possible targets in range is useful. I won't take that to mean that the power is an oracle for things like "move the piece of paper within 100 meters of me with the first letter of a plan to create a FAI written on it" or any of that, since there's been plenty of thought on the uses of oracles. Certainly still useful, though.

Flight is possible, if you've got handy targets within 100 meters that you don't mind driving into the ground.

A perpetual 100 watts for as long as you're alive. That's a solid 230 MJ, assuming a roughly 75 year lifespan with TK. What can you do with at most 230 GJ, seems like a decent over-estimate on the amount damage that can be done in the primary scenario. If (somehow, despite the fact that you're accelerating yourself in the opposite direction the whole time) you're accelerating the same 1 kg object for the whole time, it'll be just shy of 680 km/s by the end. Pretty fast

1000 Watts. 2.3 TJ at ten times the speed. Seems like quite a lot. If you're accelerating that same 1 kj object, it'll be just past half a percent of c. Very fast.

Infinite range. Mm. This could get tricky, and may or may not involve FTL communication? How long does it take for the thought "I want this object to be given 100 joules of kinetic energy in this particular direction for 1 second" to reach the object? For now I'll assume it's light speed at most, since FTL is too big. Infinite range is still pretty interesting. It definitely unlocks and locks some of the power of 'unique, not line-of-sight.' If I consider a person a single object (which I personally usually do, unless I'm in a particularly clinical mood), I can physically influence anyone that I can ID. Useful for mucking about with politics and such. And I can definitely pull off the 'accelerate 1 kj of stuff that's currently in a vacuum and not resting on a surface with friction to 680 km/s' trick if I'm willing to blow myself away in the opposite direction. Could be useful for manipulating small asteroids, if I can access a database with truly uniquely identifying information. I might not even have to accelerate them for 75 years, if I can find a way to fiddle with the orbital mechancis and just have the little asteroid show up when and where it's convenient on its own.
