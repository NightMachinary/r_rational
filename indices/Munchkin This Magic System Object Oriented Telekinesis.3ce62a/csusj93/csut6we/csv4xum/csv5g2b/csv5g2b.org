You misunderstand: His plan is to, each millisecond, cancel out the minuscule amount of kinetic energy gravity imparts upon a giant rock. (E = m/2*v^{2,} v after a millisecond is small, v^{2} is very small) The flaw in his plan is that by conservation of momentum, he gets an equal and opposite /momentum/ imparted, and since momentum is m*v, the ratio of velocity imparted upon the caster and cancelled velocity are equal to the ratio of masses, which is large. In effect, the velocity the caster accrues is proportional to the velocity cancelled (the factor of proportion being the mass ratio) and since what is cancelled out is a velocity each millisecond, also called gravitational acceleration, he gets a proportional amount of that gravitational acceleration on himself.

A way around that would be to grow a gigantic tumor or get a humongous piercing if that counts as part of your body, so the returned momentum (acceleration) is distributed through all of your mass. A few Gs should be handleable.
