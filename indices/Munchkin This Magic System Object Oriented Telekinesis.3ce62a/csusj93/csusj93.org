Did you know that holding something aloft uses no energy? It seems counterintuitive - the human body can't hold a heavy object forever - but that's specifically a weakness of the human body. Tables don't drop things when their batteries run out.

If the only things limiting you are range and power, then you should be able to effortlessly hold thousands of tons of rock up in the air. Lifting the rock off the ground requires energy, but holding it in place does not. That being said, you could lift a thousand-ton weight over your head, just very slowly - with 100W at your disposal, you could raise it by 1 metre every 24 hours.
