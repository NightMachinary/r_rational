Those would make sense, but that's not what OP said. The telekinesis affects the entire object uniformly, and I get to define the object. The distance limit is just related to how hard I can push, and it is explicitly said to be based on the object's center of mass. Having a hard cutoff makes some sense, but it is an explicit change to the stated mechanics.

As for pushing me against the wall, again, that makes sense, but doesn't follow from the stated mechanics. That's what ought to happen if you sensibly think of telekinesis as imparting /force/, but OP specifies /power/. Pushing me into a wall without me moving is zero work, and it takes zero power to do it, and zero energy is used. Maybe I'm given some kind of instantaneous virtual momentum that is discharged into the wall immediately, without me actually moving... But that's being pretty loose with the definition of velocity. Obviously I "should" be squished, but I can't see how to get that result when starting with power instead of force.
