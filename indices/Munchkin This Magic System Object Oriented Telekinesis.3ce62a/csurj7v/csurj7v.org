Say I have an enormously long cable. I wind most of it into a ball, enough to get its center of mass right next to me, and I leave a long tail stretched out away from me, one lightsecond long. I move the cable.

If my telekinetic force is uniform in my any reference frame, I can push the far end instantly, so I have FTL communication and a time machine. Even if the telekinetic push propagates at the speed of light (not uniform), if my recoil is simultaneous with the push on any atom (conserving momentum), then I still have FTL in my own reference frame, and every other reference frame sees energy and momentum come from nowhere. If my recoil is instant and there's a light-speed lag before the object moves, I've violated conservation, but at least I don't have FTL.

My limit is measured in energy per unit time. Can I apply infinite energy for an infinitesimal time? I certainly wouldn't survive, but I could do lots of fun things with that.

I assume that the energy I'm applying is kinetic energy, yes? Otherwise I could do anything, not just telekinesis. But different reference frames measure kinetic energy differently; in what reference frame is my limit defined? I'd guess mine. So if I and a 1 kg object are going at 0.6c, I see the object at rest with 0 joules kinetic energy, and you see it at 0.6c with 22.5 petajoules. If I give it what I think is 100 joules, I now see the object moving at 14 m/s (and myself moving at some speed the other way). You see the object going 0.6c + 9 m/s. That's an extra 3 gigajoules! My seconds are longer, so it takes 1.25 you-seconds for me to do that, but that's still well above the nominal limit. Is this an intented effect?

I put my back against a wall and push an object away lightly. I can't gain any momentum without going through the wall. What happens?
