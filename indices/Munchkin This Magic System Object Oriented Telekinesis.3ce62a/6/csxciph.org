If I'm reading this right 1 Watt is a joule per second which is a newton through one meter and since a newton is one kilogram through an acceleration of one, then I should be perfectly capable of flying unaided so long as I weigh less than 100 kg by just pushing sufficiently large objects into the ground in such a vector that I move in the intended direction. My maximum steady height should be equal to 100-my weight. More if I use a glider or wingsuit. Glider seems least likely to go horribly wrong.

Furthermore, superpowered kung-fu. Four possible styles of combat: the deadly, the deadly and messy, the non-leathal and the awesome but less practical. In order, we have [[http://media.midwayusa.com/productimages/880x660/Primary/968/968025.jpg][razor sharp darts]] being fired, then very small, very hard projectiles being fired at extreme velocities, then using ropes and zip ties to tie people up and finally the superpowered kung-fu. There are few martial styles that would not benefit from the ability to add 100 joules of extra force to a kick, or the ability to suddenly move your whole body in a given direction (by pressing on a section of the floor in the opposite direction).
