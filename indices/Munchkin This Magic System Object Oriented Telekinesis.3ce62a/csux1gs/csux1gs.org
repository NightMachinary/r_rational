Apply 100W of power to an object? That gives it a velocity (assuming we're both initially at rest) of sqrt(2 x 100W/m1), with a momentum change of sqrt(2 x 100W x m1), which also applies to me, giving me a kinetic energy of 100W x m1/m2. I can apply enormous accelerations to myself by pushing nearby large objects. Fly over forests, cities, anything with discrete large objects.

This should be devastating in combat; apply force to the left eyeball of that person...

If we're considering the unlimited range variant, I am the space programme. Give me something to carry, I'll push against the earth, get it in orbit. Rinse. Repeat.
