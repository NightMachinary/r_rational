If the object's center of mass is more than 100m away, you don't have any power with with to push.

And the system doesn't consider "work" per se. IF you speed something up and slow it down, both are considered applications of imparting kinetic energy over time, just in different directions. Pushing on yourself doesn't work, as at an instantaneous timescale you'll posses equal momentum in two opposite directions simultaneously, so you won't accelerate.
