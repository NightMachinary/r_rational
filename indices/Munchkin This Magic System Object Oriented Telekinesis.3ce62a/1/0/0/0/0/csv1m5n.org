Imagine that I'm a 1 kg perfectly rigid body, braced against a second 1 kg perfectly rigid body, and I'm telekinetically giving a third 1 kg object 1 J of kinetic energy, starting from rest. The object goes flying off at 1.4 m/s, and I go flying off in the opposite direction at that same speed. Except that I don't. I instantly have a perfectly inelastic collision with the wall, and now both me and the wall are going at -0.7 m/s. My personal kinetic energy is just 0.5 J, and the wall also has a kinetic energy of 0.5 J.

My problem is, I was already colliding with the wall when I started. Me and the wall were functionally a single object. My personal kinetic energy was never 1 J, not for an instant, and it never could have been. Without going through the wall, my speed will always be lower than the pushed object at every instant in time, so my own body can't ever be equal and opposite. The system as a whole may be balanced, but the me-object system never is, and that's what is stated in the prompt.

The real world has enough quantum fuzziness that it might work anyway, but I just can't see it in the simple little Newtonian toy model, and that's usually a bad sign.
