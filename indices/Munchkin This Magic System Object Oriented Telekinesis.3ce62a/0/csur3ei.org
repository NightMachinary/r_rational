- Obviously, heat death is busted.
- Divination: Attempt to move an object - measure force on yourself to determine the distance of that object to yourself if it's within 100 metres.
- Spaceflight: Propel microscopic grains of sand to relativistic speeds to provide a constant 100 watts of kinetic energy to your rocket with minimal fuel requirements.
- Combat: I haven't done the math, but dancing a grain of sand or a piece of string through someone's body should be pretty devastating.
- Science: Tell those guys at CERN to pack up, you're a better particle accelerator than the rest of them combined. I think.
