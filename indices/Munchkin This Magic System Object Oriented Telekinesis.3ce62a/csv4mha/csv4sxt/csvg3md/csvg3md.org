I listened to the audiobook on Audible. The narrator does a really stellar job with the character's voices, so you can always tell who's speaking. And the story itself is brilliant, I'm not surprised it's always checked out. It's something I recommend to people who are fans of epic fantasy with well-thought-out magic systems.
