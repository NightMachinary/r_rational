This really reminds me of the Mistborn novels. They had a magic system based on various metals, called Allomancy. An allomancer could use iron to push against other metals, and steel to pull against them. The pushing and pulling was defined by a force line between caster and object, with a maximum potential force that could be applied. If you tried to push something heavier than you, you would be pushed back instead of it, likewise with pulling. It was exploited in various ways in the novels, including flight, disarming opponents, using coins as bullets, and other really cool things.
