[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-cerdicings-of-england-a-crusader-kings-2-succession-game.37155/][My CK2 succession game continues]], now into the late 800s. The Cerdicing Dynasty has risen, and King Wulfgar of England reigns despite the petty Kings of Mercia and Northumbria opposing him. If you want in on the action, you can join the queue, but it's also fun to read along.
