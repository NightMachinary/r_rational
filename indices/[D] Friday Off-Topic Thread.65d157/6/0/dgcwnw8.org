  On the topic of old video games: Did you know that programs could be decompiled from their executable files back into human-readable code?
#+end_quote

I've had to do that on two separate occasions for work, mostly because I was coming in behind someone who was incompetent. "Human-readable" was not quite my experience, unless we're being really generous with the term. If you're coming into a project where nothing is named or described (and sometimes without other stuff, depending on language), the amount of work needed to get it /actually/ human-readable is so immense that unless you're only making very minor changes to a morass of code, it's usually not worth it. (Though I'm coming at this as someone who worked on kind of the ass end of software programming - might be different if you're programming microcontrollers or something.)
