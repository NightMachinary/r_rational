From the infamous [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ecwl3FTG66jIKA9JRDtmg/videos][SiivaGunner]] (usually stylized as SiIvaGunner, for intentional confusion): An amusing (though somewhat loud) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSLtdYOb5Vw][rendition]] of a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8cLqd47jig][sequence]] in /[[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG][Super Mario RPG]]/.

As can be gleaned from their comments, SiivaGunner's videos derive a not-insignificant proportion of their allure from obscure in-jokes (e.g., "Surprise! This is 'Mislabeled Remix of the /The Flintstones/ Theme Song #211'! This time, it's remixed with a tune from /Megaman 9/!")--though the music usually /also/ is impressively remixed in its own right--but this video stands on its own particularly well, as long as you get the reference to /Super Mario RPG/.

Recent disappointments include /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22816087][Seveneves]]/ (three stars--and I didn't even bother to read the last third of the book, so that's probably being generous) and /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34497][The Color of Magic]]/ (two stars).

/Seveneves/ in particular served to remind me of something that I've mentioned previously (but I don't feel like digging up a link, so I'll just repeat myself): /No author/ can be trusted to churn out consistently-interesting works.\\
- Stephenson: /Anathem/ (five stars), /Reamde/ (four stars, IIRC), /Seveneves/ (three stars), /Cryptonomicon/ (two stars, IIRC)\\
- Rand: /Atlas Shrugged/ (five stars), /The Fountainhead/ (four stars), /Anthem/ (two stars)\\
- Card: /Ender's Shadow/ (five stars), /Ender's Game/ (four stars), /Xenocide/ (three stars)

A book's summary is /far/ more important than the name of its author.

On the topic of writers: Mr. Yudkowsky recently [[http://i.imgur.com/mladshn.png][mentioned]] that his preferred /Harry Potter/ pairing was Tomione.

/[[https://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecube/548415-burnout][Burnout]]/, /[[https://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecube/561501-burnout-2-point-of-impact][Burnout 2: Point of Impact]]/, and /[[https://www.gamefaqs.com/ps3/935291-burnout-paradise][Burnout: Paradise]]/ are games for which I have quite a lot of nostalgia. I have to wonder, though: Which civil-engineering design manuals and textbooks did the developers of [[https://www.gamefaqs.com/company/10706-criterion-games][Criterion Games]] consult in designing their games' roadways? And how did they bend the rules presented in those manuals? (Is every lane in Paradise City sixteen feet wide, rather than the usual twelve? Are the tapers on the exit lanes three times as long as they normally would be, so that players can see where they're going at 200 miles per hour? What are the radii of the curves on Downhill Drive?)

Cursory glances at the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f26fCA_te8Y][/Burnout/]] and [[http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/credits][/Burnout: Paradise/]] credits reveal no shout-outs to any Department of Transportation or Federal Highway Administration.

On the topic of video-game development: I wonder how much effort I would have to expend if I wanted to make a walker-free version of /[[https://www.gog.com/game/pharaoh_cleopatra][Pharaoh]]/ in Java or Unity (with graphics approximately on the level of /[[http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/393/simcity+classic.html][SimCity]]/)...

On the topic of old video games: Did you know that programs could be [[http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/DeCompilation][decompiled]] from their executable files back into human-readable code?

I finally got around to discovering [[https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/releases][youtube-dl]]. What a load off my mind it is, to know that I can archive [[http://i.imgur.com/Rcz8Yc5.png][my favorite videos]] just as easily as I can archive [[http://i.imgur.com/4ct5GXd.png][my favorite stories]]! /ToaKraka/, not [[https://www.youtube.com/user/ShadowMarioXLI/playlists?shelf_id=0&view=1&sort=dd][ShadowMarioXLI]], now is the [[https://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/][owner]] of these videos, and can edit or delete them as /he/ pleases. (laughs evilly)

On the topic of not really owning anything that you can't edit: Unfortunately, I still haven't gotten around to making an edited version of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/.* The HTML files have been [[http://i.imgur.com/jHvEEag.png][sitting]]** on my computer for /literally/ years...

IIRC, I've taken the time to impose major personal-preference edits on long stories only in two very simple instances: Replacing =dice= (confusingly used as a singular noun) with =die= in /[[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/about/][The Waves Arisen]]/, and replacing 'single quotation marks' (confusingly used to denote internal monologues) with /italicization/ in (Part 1 of) /[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893][Mother of Learning]]/. I unfortunately don't care /quite/ enough to spend hours scrolling through a story to fix /every single instance/ of singular =they=.

*IIRC, I once got halfway through Chapter 5, but I then became indecisive over which /exact/ changes I wanted to make--and then Notepad++ crashed, losing all my work on that chapter, so I decided to start over entirely, but I didn't really feel up to actually /doing/ it.\\
**Whoops! Do I really have /over a hundred and fifty megabytes/ of stories waiting to be converted to EPUB format?? I guess all those itty-bitty text files add up when you've got /thousands/ of them...
