Oh. For a moment I legitimately thought you were talking about a [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences][Sequence]] and I was both confused and intrigued.

  singular they

This is something I've historically avoided, but recently while posting on a subreddit with a gender ratio probably close to 50/50, I decided to just roll with it. When referring to a specific person of unknown gender, using "he/she" or "(s)he" seems like an invitation to reply with clarification, even if I have no specific interest in knowing, while "they" will usually pass unnoticed. Many years ago I thought that gender-neutral singulars (such as "e" for "he/she" or "em" for "her/him") were cool, but that was before Tumblr existed, so now I find such pronouns somewhat distasteful due to negative associations.
