I dealt with this in college/grad school by either a) doing all the work myself, and tossing their names on it, or b) largely the same as a, but sitting down with them for some private tutoring to bring them up to speed. It depended on how generous I was feeling (the latter was a lot more helpful than the former). Most of the time I got solid partners, though, in that I got to pick them myself.

In a "real world" context, just tell your supervisor your co-worker is slacking (if it is a case of them lazy, and not something more understandable, like a family emergency) and avoid working with them again.
