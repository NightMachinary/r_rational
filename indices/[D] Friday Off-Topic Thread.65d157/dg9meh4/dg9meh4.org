I know I've said this before, but one of the most frustrating, exhausting, awful things in group projects is being the asshole who tells his enthusiastic teammates that no, what they're doing isn't good enough, and no, passing the tests imposed by the university doesn't matter, and stop making excuses for each other and saying you "don't want to show me your work because it's not finished yet" and stop being vague and telling me you "did an analysis" when what you did was write three paragraphs in two weeks.

Seriously. If there's one thing my coding school taught me to hate, it's people congratulating themselves (or me) for shitty, rushed, unprofessional work.
