Recently I've read Ender's Game for the first time and I really liked the mechanics of combat in space and other themes like orientation in zero-gravity, 3D space and all.

I was wondering if there were out there some realistic simulators for this kind of stuff, but upon searching I've only found regular flight sims, which, well, still operate within gravity so it's not exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for. So, can anyone recommend a realistic spacebattles simulator like that? Or at least a game with elements of one.

Barring that, some related book recommendations also are appreciated.
