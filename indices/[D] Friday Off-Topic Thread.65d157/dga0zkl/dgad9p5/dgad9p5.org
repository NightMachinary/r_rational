/Elite: Dangerous/ fits the bill, and it's also a pretty fun sandbox game. Dogfights are 3D, orientation is mostly a matter of out-turning or confusing your opponent, and while the flight model defaults to atmospheric-style you /can/ fight with full 6-degree-of-freedom controls... but it's hard, obviously.
