My depression came back full force this week for no reason.

It's...pretty bad. I kind of don't feel real right now. But it's all going to be ok. This time, I know exactly what is happening to me and why, I know how to deal with it, and I have already taken the steps to start that process.

HPMOR gave me the tools to do that. I recognize now, that anything I say to myself is being directly affected by an artificial mental bias I can't trust, and therefore I can safely disregard the darkness and not spiral into hopeless paralysis. I might not feel real, but I know that feeling is an illusion caused by my brain being stupid.

I've got an appointment to get drugs on Monday morning. Everything is going to be fine.
