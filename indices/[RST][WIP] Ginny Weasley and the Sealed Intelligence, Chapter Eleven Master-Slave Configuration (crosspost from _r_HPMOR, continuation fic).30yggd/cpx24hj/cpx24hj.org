I posted [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/30ygc2/ginny_weasley_and_the_sealed_intelligence_chapter/cpwzrg4?context=3][a comment]] on the HPMOR subreddit regarding how absurd the 'possession contract' is, and posted a far better version. Which I had up there for about 3/4 of an hour before noticing a fatal flaw. [[/r/rational]], give me a hand in making as watertight a contract as possible?

  'I hereby state that direct physical contact with the object I am writing on is consent to possession lasting no longer than 5 minutes by the spirit currently inhabiting that object, and then must give written consent once more for the spirit to possess me again.'
