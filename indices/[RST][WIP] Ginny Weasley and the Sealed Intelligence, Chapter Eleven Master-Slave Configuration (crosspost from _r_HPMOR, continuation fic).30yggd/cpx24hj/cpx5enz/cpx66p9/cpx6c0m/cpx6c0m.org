It is you. You and your hand are consenting. If you meant otherwise you should have specified such in the contract as to who you were, assuming that the contract the spirit agreed to was binding- it may be that any conditions the spirit agrees to aren't binding, once they possess you then you are theirs forever.

The spirit may need you to consent initially, but not after.
