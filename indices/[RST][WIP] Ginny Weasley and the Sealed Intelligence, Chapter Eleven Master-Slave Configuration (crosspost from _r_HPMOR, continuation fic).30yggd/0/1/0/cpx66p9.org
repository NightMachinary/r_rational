Hm. I'd feel that violates the contract, as it's not you consenting, but the spirit.

If the spirit doesn't actually need /you/ to consent, then the whole contract is moot anyway. Therefore, I was working on the assumption that the consent had to be given by yourself, and that the spirit can't give it for you...
