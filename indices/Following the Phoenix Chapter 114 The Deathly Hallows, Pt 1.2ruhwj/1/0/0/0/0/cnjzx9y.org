Possibly because it's been well written and promising so far, well written enough to keep you entertained while the promise of something /interesting/ has you hooked.

Or possibly because it's human nature to complain that's something /just/ got interesting when you realise you're about to lose it.

EDIT: I can attest at least to the fact that I was actually shocked last week when I checked the current chapter/word count and saw it at 32 chapters and ~650 worth of paperback pages. My intuition would have been closer to maybe 20 chapters if I'd thought about it, and maybe a couple of hundred pages.
