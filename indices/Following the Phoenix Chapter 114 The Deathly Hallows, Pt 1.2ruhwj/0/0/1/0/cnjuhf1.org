If the dementor ate his soul and it didn't go to ether, he shouldn't be found by the stone. IF destroying the dementor freed him to go to ether, the horcruxes should also work already so he is out of the box anyway. If he is summoned as a soul, it shouldn't in itself do anything with the horcruxes.
