I tend to like those, since I often learn something new; it's reflected in my writing a bit that I love etymology, which is probably my favorite part of language, and sometimes a typo correction will lead me down a rabbit hole of looking through [[https://books.google.com/ngrams][Google's n-gram viewer]], across [[https://www.etymonline.com/][etymoloine]], or into some corner of the internet to try to debug why my brain would pick out a particular phrase or word as correct when it's really not. It helps me think about language, how it's used, and, I think, helps me become a bit of a better writer because it's one of the relatively few times I'm getting down into the nitty-gritty of specific words.

And I do appreciate the more simple "you missed a word here" typo corrections, but they don't represent as much of a chance for something interesting to happen.
