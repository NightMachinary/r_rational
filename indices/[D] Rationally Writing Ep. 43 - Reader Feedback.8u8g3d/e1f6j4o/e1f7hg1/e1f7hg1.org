  Some people post comments mainly to communicate/discuss things with other readers, rather than the author, and the more commentors there are, the more likely it is that this will be the case.
#+end_quote

Very true! There's a lot of added value that goes into indirect comments on stories, and I personally enjoy reading people's fan theories and discussions about my own quite a bit, and often indirectly get good feedback from it even if it's not intended as such.

  It's also worth noting that not all "negative" comments will necessarily discourage other readers,
#+end_quote

True, but most of the negative comments authors tend to take issue with are not of the "I don't like X" variety so much as the "This story sucks, there's almost no action" when there might actually be quite a bit of action in it, just not enough for that reader :) Comments that misrepresents an opinion as a fact, or just miss things, can be frustrating.
