I guess the world of Worth The Candle is /pretty/ damn cohesive, there are no or few easily exploited "weird" systems that aren't already being exploited by the people inhabiting that world.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter and the DnD ruleset allow for a lot of "munchkining" when brought into contact with real world physics.
