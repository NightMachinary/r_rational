Are you interested in space, complex simulations and 5+ hour boardgames? Meet [[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172737/high-frontier-third-edition][High Frontier]].

Assemble a working rocket with [[https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2580360/high-frontier-third-edition][components based on real patents]], paying mind to mass, thrust, fuel efficiency, thermal cooling, market availability, and future space manufacturing. Fly around the [[https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2580365/high-frontier-third-edition][solar system]]with its many available routes while tracking your delta V.

Stake a claim with your robonaut; build a factory, and start upgrading your rocket via awesome space manufactured components. Then its time to get /real/ science going: fly out to the gas giant moons or kuiper belt, get a proper Lab and promote your human colonists to their transhumanist counterparts. Maybe you want to shape the future by producing a mini black hole? Or you'd like to emancipe the robots? Or colonize other stars and send out a beehive ark? Send out a gas giant with a fusion candle?

So obviously this is very much rocket science and not for the faint of heart or time; BGG complexity weigth is 4.75/5. You learn it by playing in order: introductory game ->base game->advanced game->full game. If you are the type to get hooked by it it will get you completely.

Once you have mastered space flight, the competitiveness comes from intense bidding on cards and even space combat. It is a physics/solar system simulation after all and the map isn't really balanced since it tracks what we know of the solar system.

There is a Tabletop Simulator module which works surprisingly well; and if you'd like to I can teach it to you there.

In case you'd want to get a physical copy, there will be a kickstarter for 4th edition coming up on 24th of october, during Spiel 2019 in Essen - the biggest boardgame convention in the world (which I will attend).

So in conclusion: I really recommended this game, but you have to be a heavy boardgamer AND spacenerd to enjoy it.
