The Kingkiller Chronicle (first book is The Name of the Wind) isn't strictly a magical school only story, but a magical school (that the protagonist attends) does feature heavily. Protagonist is a bit of a Mary Sue sometimes, but it wasn't overbearing to me.

Super Powereds is about a superhero school (it was mentioned and linked to in another comment), and is quite good.
