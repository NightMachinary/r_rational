  portals that don't have a fixed orientation relative to each other completely break physics, and there isn't any real way to solve this issue in a story.

Yes, this becomes a big problem when applied creatively haha. For another fun application to think of, imagine a long steel rod affixed to some base. Drop a gate down the end so that all but the base of the gate is coming out of the other gate. Since all forces acting on the bar transfer to its base, you can move the entire thing as if it had only the inertia of the gate attached to it. Handle an arbitrary heavy rod like a whiffle bat! Anime sword physics! Reduce the effective weight of any simple body to zero without reduction to strength! Lots of wonkiness abounds.

I agree, the entire hyperspace part felt extremely forced in order to fit in future plot developments you will likely find to be even more forced lol.
