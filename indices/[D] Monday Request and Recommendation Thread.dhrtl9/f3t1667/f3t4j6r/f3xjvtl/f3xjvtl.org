I just read the first part of Micro Gates, and I feel that the engine design is way overcomplicated if I understand the gates correctly (I don't understand the described engine at all, I just accepted it as mostly meaningless technobabble). Another thing that wasn't answered, was how does the other side of a gate look like while there is a solid (or partially solid) opaque (or even transparent) thing inside the other side of the portal. Is it just black? White? A perfect mirror?

Simpler reactionless engine design: You can insert a heavy spring through each side of the portal, rotate the gate so each spring has both ends pointed in the same direction. When you put the spring against a wall, the spring exerts a force on the wall, but the gates don't feel that force, therefore reactionless drives. You can put this spring-contraption into a box. Now you can control the strength and direction of the thrust by moving the gates from the centre of the box to one side via any mechanism. This doesn't break the spacecraft's rotation in any way, no elements act like a gyroscope.

Another issue that was skipped over in the story was that as described, the gates should transfer sound, as that is just pressure waves in a medium. This would lead to some interesting design problems/secrecy issues. I also feel that the second side exploding once the ring is destroyed is downplayed too much, how can you provide a service using those rings if your entire "data center" explodes in a chain reaction once some guy accidentally breaks your device?
