I don't think you can actually accelerate an object with two gates oriented in that way. The object would feel an equally strong attraction from the top gate that it just fell through, making gravity between two portals very weak because it has to respect continuous boundary conditions. The resulting overall field strength might fuck up their planet's orbit though. Also a gravity vacuum cleaner is like the coolest thing ever.

Edit: There might be a workaround using 4 portals, but it would lower efficiency considerably.

Edit2: Also, even assuming 100 % efficiency with 1g acceleration at all times, you'll probably take around 2 years to reach 0.9 c
