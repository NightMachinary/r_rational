You're essentially trapping a particle in an increasingly small box with periodic boundary conditions. Assuming there's no resistance against bringing the things closer together, the thing goes boom due to infinite momentum. Possibly even forming a black hole if you're unlucky and have more than one particle or something to dump the excess momentum to allow for invariant mass.

I think my answer would probably have to be that you'd find it harder and harder to press the two together, until you overcome a certain point then it'd just collapse into a black hole and you never actually get to reach the point where they touch.
