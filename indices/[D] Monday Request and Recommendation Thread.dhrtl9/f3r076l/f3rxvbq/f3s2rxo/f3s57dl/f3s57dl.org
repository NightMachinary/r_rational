oh cool! another fellow asian webnovel reader! I've read Everyone else is a returnee, definitely enjoyed it a lot. Have you read the other works by the same author, Infinite competitive dungeon society, I reincarnated for nothing, and stop friendly fire? They have a very similar tone/humor/style of becoming super op. I listed them in order of my personal enjoyability.

Similarly, for dungeon crawling path to op novels, there's the tutorial is too hard, and master hunter k, which are both great dungeon ascending novels. (master hunter k is complete with a meh rushed ending, tutorial is too hard shifted to crappy translation around chapter 180 which is sad)
