Need help narrowing down the list of recommended 'rationalist' fiction that is listed on the wiki. I'm primarily looking for books with a heavy emphasis on what I'll call "protagonist vs absurd environment/culture/society". I don't actually care if the book is truly rational, I just like the satisfaction/munchkinry that seems to come along with this style of book. Webnovels/unfinished works are fine to suggest as well.

Examples I've read:

- HPMOR

- Two year emperor

- Harry Potter and the Natural 20

I also find I get some sense of this from isekai/reincarnation novels but it's usually pretty muted.

Books I've read that don't fit the category:

- Mother of Learning

- Friendship is Optimal

- A hero's war

- Worth the candle

- Sufficiently advanced magic
