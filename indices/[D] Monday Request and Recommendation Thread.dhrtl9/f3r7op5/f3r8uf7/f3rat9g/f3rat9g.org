I think I remember not entirely hating it but it's definitely a bit sillier and less committed to realism. It's more Akagi but with baseball than it is Oofuri or Moneyball. Fun in a different, bombastic way rather than rather than particularly ratficcy. It might scratch similar itches though for sure, depending on what things people are actually trying to get out of ratfic. Thanks for offering the rec.
