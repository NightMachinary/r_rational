I recommend Moneyball (the movie) and Ookiku Furikabutte (the anime) as very munchkinny rationalist fiction although much of the effort of the characters of each goes into the narrow context of trying to win baseball games. I think they work less well the more you know about baseball, but if you're not a huge baseball fan then they should work well to scratch the ratfic/munchkin/optimisation itch. Both heavily feature trying to think their way through how to leverage lesser tools to compete with much more well-resourced competition, with Oofuri having much more time to go into a lot more depth on the actual thinking.

If you know of other sports fiction that functions in a similar way I'd be very interested, they're probably a bit underrated by ratfic fans despite them often being a good fit. Because the goals and rules are often reliably clearly defined and consistent (win and whatever the rules of the sport are + mundane physics, respectively), there's a lot of room leftover to focus on reasoning and problem solving to get to those goals within those rules. Not all sportsfic are interested in that but it can be great, pure ratfic when it is.
