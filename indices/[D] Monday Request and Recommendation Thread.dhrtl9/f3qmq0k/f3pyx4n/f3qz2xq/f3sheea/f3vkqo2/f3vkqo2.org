[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/recoil.299321/][Recoil]] sends Taylor from the Behemoth fight back in time to the early 90ies, before the PRT is formed. Instead of her bug control power, she now has a connection to Tattletale who may or may not be dead and living on in Taylor's brain. Taylor joins the JROTC so she'll eventually be able to join the PRT as soon as it forms and attain a leading position sooner.

Word of caution, it's written by an author who also writes really awful NSFW fanfic. While this one is "clean" enough for Spacebattles, which is quite restrictive, he still makes people uncomfortable with the topics he touches on, like Taylor's father as a teenager being interested in her, the excessive lesbian shipping, or the entire raid on the Fallen "parahuman breeding" compound, which is where it got too much for me personally
