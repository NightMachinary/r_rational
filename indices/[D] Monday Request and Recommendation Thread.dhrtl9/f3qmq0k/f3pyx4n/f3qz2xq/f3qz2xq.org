I've read through and hugely enjoyed To The Stars. I really enjoyed reading about the development of institutions (like the foundation of the MSY and the military police in a spinoff series). I also enjoyed exploring the political implications of people with superpowers being placed in positions of power, and noble rulers reforming countries.

What are some good fics, rational or not, about the development of institutions and rulers/leaders with superpowers?
