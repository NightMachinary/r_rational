Ayup. we talked a loooooot about that story on the WTC discord server.

Funnily enough, there was one bit of microgate physics we brainstormed that was never explored throughout the whole story that could potentially break the entire setting. Spoilered if you want to puzzle it out by yourself: What happens when you arrange the same "end" of two gates facing each other, place an object in between, then bring the gates together? Essentially pressing an object against itself?
