I liked it to start with, but it's not content to make humans look small and cute to the other species, but actually infantilises them, which both missed the point of "our normal is their cute and weak" and also felt uncomfortable, like I was reading something from someone's subtle fetish. And then there was the actual sex stuff (though admittedly not outright explicit) that made me drop it outright, because... no thanks.

It started off strong and I liked the premise, but I just was not up for reading that.
