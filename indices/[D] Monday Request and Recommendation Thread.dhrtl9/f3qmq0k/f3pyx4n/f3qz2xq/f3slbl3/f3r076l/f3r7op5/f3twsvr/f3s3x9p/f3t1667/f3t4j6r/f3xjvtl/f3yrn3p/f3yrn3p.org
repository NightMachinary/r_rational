iirc, the gates are actually two-sided. The A and B side of one gate exit out to an A' and B' of the other. It's been a while since I read it tho so I might be wrong.

I can try to explain the original engine's design, hopefully a bit clearer. The principle is similar to your typical [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc1pfeheZ74][Lenz's Law demonstration]] running in reverse. In words: passing a magnet through a copper coil induces a current through that coil, turning mechanical energy into electrical energy. Therefore, it follows that by passing a current through a coil with a magnet in it, the induced magnetic field will exert a force on the magnet. Due to Newton's Third Law, this also exerts a force in the opposite direction acting on the coil. Because physics is breaking due to the mass of the magnet teleporting from end to end of the coil, only the force on the coil "leaves" the system. Thus, you have reactionless thrusters.

And yes, one of the problems with microgates as a story is that the mechanics of the microgates are described very deeply... but in shallow breadth. Physical interactions with objects partway through a microgate, the transfer of vibrations through a gate, the terrorism potential of accelerating an object to 0.9c within two gates oriented vertically in a vacuum, and others are all glossed over.
