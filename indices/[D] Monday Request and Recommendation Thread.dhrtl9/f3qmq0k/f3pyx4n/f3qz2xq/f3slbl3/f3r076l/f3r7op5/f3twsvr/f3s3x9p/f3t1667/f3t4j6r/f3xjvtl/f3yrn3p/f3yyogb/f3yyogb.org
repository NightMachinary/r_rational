I did assume the engine worked sort of like a railgun, using a magnetic field to accelerate a mass. I'm still not 100% sure where the momentum is coming from. That's why I came up with the springs idea, because it's clear where the momentum comes from, and it's simple (and requires zero fuel/power!).

I'm now partway through part 3, and I believe that portals that don't have a fixed orientation relative to each other completely break physics, and there isn't any real way to solve this issue in a story.

Going back to the spring-based reactionless drive idea, you can easily weaponize that by switching the spring to a big steel rod. You have two ends of the same rod facing the same wall, and when you push on the portals, you get little (if any) reaction, but the steel rod is being compressed to insane pressures, and will either punch through the wall and become a supersonic projectile, or explode due to the internal pressure.

There is also the issue of angular momentum. What happens if I insert a steel rod into the portal, and spin/rotate the other end? Can I use this to rotate a dynamo to generate net electricity?

If you tried to fix this "issue" by making the portal react to net forces pushed through the portal pair... That fixes only some issues but you need to define what a force "pushed through" a portal actually is. (this seems to fix obvious loopholes at first glance, except for things involving gravity... Or in fact any electromagnetic force that goes through the portal... or rather doesn't).

WAIT! Just had a sudden thought! You can create magnetic monopoles! We know electromagnetic forces go through the gates if given a solid medium (like a solid magnet, or an electromagnet with a core). This also completely breaks physics, and is somewhat documented in various sci-fi works.

Spoiler - FTL: I felt that the FTL travel/hyperspace was just extremely out-of-place. I feel that the author doesn't understand relativity at all. For example, there being one "true" reference frame, and that galaxy+solar system+planet spin and gravity wells add up to a meaningful time dilation factor, even if there was.

Spoiler - Flooded surface gravity: I found the claim that adding water to a planet would lower the surface gravity extremely counter-intuitive, so I did some of my own calculations... And I might have calculated the wrong derivative. I did it by hand, which took a good 15 minutes, so I didn't bother going back to correct the issue. I'd appreciate some /correct/ calculations with the GM/R^{2} formula, where M models a flooded planet of radius R
