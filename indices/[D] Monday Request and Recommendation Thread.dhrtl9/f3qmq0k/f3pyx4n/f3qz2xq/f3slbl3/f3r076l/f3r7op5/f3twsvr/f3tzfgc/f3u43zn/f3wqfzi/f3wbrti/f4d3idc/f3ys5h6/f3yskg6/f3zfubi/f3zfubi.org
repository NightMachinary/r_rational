It's a common issue. Authors tend to add too many plot points early, some things end up getting rushed or cut. It just happens that sometimes those things were what a part of the audience liked the most.

There's a saying that goes something like, "to make a book great you have to cut out the good parts".. i.e only keep the great parts. It just happens that you're one of the people that liked the parts that got cut better than the ones that were kept.
