To add a few suggestions to my own question...

Blood Song by Anthony Ryan. It chronicles the training and early life of Vaelin Al Sorn, who is a member of a religious militant order. It's a prime example of what I call "interesting competent people doing interesting things competently". The best part of this story is just reading in growing up and making his mark on the world. There are two squeals which aren't nearly as good and turn the story into a bog standard fantasy epic. While perhaps not technically a magic school, the protagonist does have a magic power he learns to use.

The Magicians by Lev Grossman. Pretty much Harry Potter as literally fiction, where the big bad isn't Voldemort but ennui. I rather liked the first book. The second and third were okay but I didn't enjoy them as much.

Red Sister by Mark Lawrence. Take thee to a nunnery! This story is a weird mix of sci-fi and fantasy. The setting is a distant planet, currently undergoing an ice age. But some rare people also have magic powers. The main character is a girl who is sold to a convent, except this convent in addition to training actual nuns, trains church assassins, warriors and holy witches. More down to earth than my description seems. Has two squeals. Again the first is the best but the second is also pretty good. Third was rather bad honestly and read like the author just wanted the series over.
