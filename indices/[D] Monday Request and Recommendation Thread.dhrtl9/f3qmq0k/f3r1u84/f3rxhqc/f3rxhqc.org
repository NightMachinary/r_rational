since you seem to like superhero fic, I'd recommend Super Powereds by Drew hayes. Now, it used to be fully available on the author's website, except he took it down to sell it on amazon. However, you can still access the entire series through the way back machine here - [[https://web.archive.org/web/20170606031105/http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/spy1/p]]

and you might need to leap forward a bit in time to catch the 'book' of it, which represents year 4. Because by the time the author was finishing the story he already put year 1 up on amazon I think....

Basically super powereds is about a superhero training academy. not particularly rational at all, but likeable characters + interesting powersets + decent ending makes it a solid superhero story imo.
