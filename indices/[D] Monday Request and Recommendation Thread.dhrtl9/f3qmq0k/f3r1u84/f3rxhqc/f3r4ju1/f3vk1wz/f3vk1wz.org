[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/setanta-worm-post-canon.351759/][Setanta]] is a completed Worm fanfic set 20 years after the end of the story, where the worlds were even more devastated than in Ward. It follows Jordan, a mercenary without powers but with a quick wit and peak-human fitness, and his sister who is a cape, as they try to find their place in the post-apocalyptic multiverse. If Taylor is a biased narrator, then Jordan is an unreliable one. He has several kinds of brain damage, and occasionally forgets people or events. Actually not entirely unlike Sylvester towards the latter parts of Twig.
