[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tabloid-worm-artfic-%E2%80%94-complete.455278/][Tabloid, a worm fanfic]] is very good.

Blurb: PRT photographer by day and cape paparazzi by night, Tabloid explores the effects of parahumans on society with the help of his quirky sense of humor. Each chapter contains original artwork. World-building, slice of life, drama, and dark humour comedy.
