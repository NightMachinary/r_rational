Monthly updates, I'm afraid. The last chapter was just released, so chapter 6 will be a month from now. Still, if the choice is between quantity or quality, I'll choose the latter.

The [[https://palussomni.com/chapters][website]] (which for some reason isn't updated as often as RR, but has some nice extras) indicates it /might/ only be 10 chapters, if so it's already half done.
