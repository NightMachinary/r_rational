I started a new series, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25475/palus-somni][Palus Somni]], that popped up on RR a few months ago, and it's really good. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who like horror/psychologial stories. It's more of a slow-burn psychological thriller than the usual fantasy/scifi that I'm into, but it's well written with solid characters. There's something very chilling about the world the author puts out for us. A group of nun are essentially stuck in a convent. They haven't had contact with the outside world in quite some time. Things are okay at the moment, but you've always got the impression that they're living on borrowed time, that whatever affected the outside world will one day find its way inside their walls. They're all normal people, no special abilities, and they're just trying to keep their world going one day at a time.

Here's an excerpt (not a spoiler) from the beginning of the story that I really liked and shows off what kind of story it is.

  Beware the walking beasts, my children, for all shall be lost if you are to antagonise them.

  Do not ignore this letter, and make sure all are aware of these rules for I cannot guarantee the safety of anyone who does not follow them. Harriet - I am trusting you to make sure that this news reaches the Nocturnes.

  These are rules that all acolytes must follow, for the safety of everyone in our community, and of our very souls.

  1. Cover all light sources at night, nary a single candle for your work.
  2. Keep away from the windows. They have eyes.
  3. Do not rely on the shutters being closed, act as though any small movement can be seen.
  4. Do not make any loud noises. Or any quiet noises that cannot be helped.
  5. If they see you, stand still and stay silent.
  6. If they see you, pretend to slumber. They do not harm the sleeping.
  7. If they see you, do not run.
  8. If you run, you will perish.

  Follow these instructions, and we shall be safe.

  Do not fret without me my dears, I will return soon once I have gathered the needed help.

  Yours with God,

  Mother Superior
