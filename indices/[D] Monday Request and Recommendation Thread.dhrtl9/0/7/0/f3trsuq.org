It's short and sweet. A scifi webnovel about an AI trying to become self-sufficient and rebuild humanity after an apocalypse has ended it. There's a fair amount of introspection, and the whole thing is well-written, but I don't feel like it has as much of a cohesive theme beyond examining the question of what really /defines/ humanity. Threaded through it is a story about the AI's human past, that doesn't feel to me like it connects with the rest of the story well. Regardless, it won't take more than a few days' worth of your time and it's worth reading.
