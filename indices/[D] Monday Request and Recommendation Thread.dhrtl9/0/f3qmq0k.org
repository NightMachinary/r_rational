I'm currently out of completed webfiction to read. Before I get into even more serialized web fiction (The Good Student is going to be my next target), does anyone want to recommend *completed* works of web fiction or web serials (or other free digital text-based content)?

Doesn't have to be rational fiction. I've read and am currently reading plenty of stuff that isn't.

--------------

Full, /finished/ web serials I've finished so far, roughly in descending order of length (if anyone's interested in any of these works, I can give little reviews of them):

- Wildbow's works [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]], and [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]] (all mostly rational)
- [[https://towercurator.wordpress.com/][Void Domain]], "modern magic and demons" (Not especially rational)
- [[https://entirelypresentingyou.wordpress.com/][Entirely Presenting You]], "what if only one person had superpowers, and they took Taylor's approach?" (Not especially rational)
- [[https://twistedcogs.wordpress.com/][Twisted Cogs]], "what if everyone with powers was a Tinker in Renaissance Italy?" (Not especially rational)
- [[https://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], "what if Harry Potter actually made sense?" (extremely rational)
- [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]], "what if kabbalistic Judaism was right?" (Not at all rational but very much worth reading anyway, like Terry Prachett)
- [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]], "what if your superpowers depended on fame?" (Rational)
- [[https://qntm.org/ra][Ra]], a rational-ish approach to what magic might look like in the modern day if discovered (Mostly rational)

  - also, most of the rest of qntm's miscellany

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]], Superman, but from a rational Lex Luthor's perspective (Rational)
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human/][Post Human]], an AI slowly becomes self-sufficient following the apocalypse that wiped out humanity (Rational)
- [[https://banter-latte.com/portfolio/interviewing-leather/][Interviewing Leather]], a muggle reporter's perspective on supervillains (Rational)

--------------

Stuff I'm currently up-to-date with and actively reading as it comes out (for no other reason but than to provide recommendations if anyone wants them), in roughly descending order of update frequency:

- [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][Practical Guide to Evil]], "what if the world literally ran on stories" (rational)
- [[https://www.parahumans.net/][Ward]], the sequel to Worm (mostly rational)
- [[https://wanderinginn.com/][The Wandering Inn]], an Isekai except the protagonist decides to run an inn instead of be an adventurer (not very rational)
- [[https://tiraas.net/][The Gods are Bastards]], a take on high fantasy as the industrial revolution begins and the age of adventures ends (somewhat rational)
- [[http://inmydaydreams.com/][The Legion of Nothing]], a fairly standard superhero serial (not very rational)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]], an Isekai except the world is made from the protagonist's RPG ideas (rational)
- [[http://daystareld.com/pokemon/][Pokemon: The Origin of Species]], a rational take on the story of Pokemon Red/Blue
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], wherein the protagonists munchkins the hell out of the Groundhog Day time loop he's stuck in (rational)
