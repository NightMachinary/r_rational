[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/][El-Ahraihrah]], a Worm fic where Taylor triggers as a Thinker with the same shard, is well-written and fairly rational. Unlike the original, which has so many enormous idiot balls that Taylor's real superpower is that she only carries one half the time. On a very long hiatus, but explicitly not abandoned.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/something-completely-different-worm-tinker-si-original-city.25042/][Something Completely Different]] is a lighthearted and nigh-rationalist Worm fic, about an author-SI Tinker with a specialty in corpses. Unfortunately abandoned due to audience backlash from how he handled the Slaughterhouse9Arc, but it has a good run which ends at the end of an arc. There are a couple updates he marked noncanon due to that same backlash; read them anyway, they're great.
