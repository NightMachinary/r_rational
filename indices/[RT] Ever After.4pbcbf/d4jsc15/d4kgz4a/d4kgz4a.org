"Viser" is a stylistic choice and lame wordplay; it's a shortening of adviser rather than derived from vizier.

Descriptions ... I used to include them more in short stories, but I was repeatedly told that it was unnecessary if the story was going to be so short. It might be that they'd each benefit from a sentence of description, but they're not /important/ to the reading of the story and the whole thing is intentionally generic anyway.

I might go back and revise it now that I've got some feedback.
