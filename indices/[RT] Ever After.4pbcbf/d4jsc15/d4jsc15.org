There seem to be some ... issues? Nothing major, but "visier" is repeatedly spelled as "viser", to the extent that I was starting to wonder if it was a stylistic choice. Also, there are no descriptions given for any of the characters, which makes me wonder if that's meant to illustrate that they're completely generic for thematic reasons, or if the author just forgot. There are a few smaller details as well, but those are the big two.
