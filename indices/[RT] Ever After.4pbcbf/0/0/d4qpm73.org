All three of the artifacts on one person would streamroll a medieval army pretty effectively, but giving each person one artifact seems silly. Your swordsman is basically useless, your armored man is vulnerable to catapults, spears, and sheer weight of numbers, and your telekinetic is just a pincushion waiting to happen.
