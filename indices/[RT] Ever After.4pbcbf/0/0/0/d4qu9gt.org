Yeah, after some more thought that's pretty much what I ended up with too - the three are all supposed to be used by one person. And they seem to represent a trinity of melee, ranged, and "magic" attacks.

I was also thinking none of the artifacts explicitly have a defense against gassing attacks if it's colourless and odourless. Maybe the telekinetic can sense it, maybe they always knew to keep their personal air bubble clean. I don't know, and they had to have thought of it to avoid it. Then there's stuff like overwhelming the telekinetic's mind by launching a carriage at her and then opening a spike pit under her at the same time - is the carriage by itself already strong enough to break a telekinetic defense, does the armor count that as an "arrow" to be defended against? Again, I don't know for sure, I don't think the protagonists would've known how to deal with those without wisdom or just being good at thinking things through.
