An interesting read. Reminds me a lot of a story someone posted to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] challenge a few months back. I'll see if I can dig up the link.

EDIT: [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/writing/ever_after.html][Found it!]] It was written by eaglejarl, who is the author that wrote 2 year Emperor and a few other popular stories.
