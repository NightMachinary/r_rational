As, I'm assuming, a parody of the usual "We beat them, and everyone lived happily ever after" ending it was interesting to read. And the "viser's" almost aggravatingly reasonable presentation was well-done, I thought. (I feel stupid now though, because it wasn't until I read the comments here that I realized "viser" wasn't the right word for what I was thinking...)

The one criticism I would make is that the powers of the artifacts you mentioned seemed a bit low-tier and inflexible. Putting aside them being the symbols of the ruler, it's hard for me to see the protagonists using them to win a significant battle of power unless they were very capable even without them, or already had a group of people supporting them. Either of which would preclude the "viser" getting them wrapped around his finger so easily.

This is probably just an issue of perspective though; if the heroes had other abilities, or if the grand dictator was much easier to take out than I thought he was, then everything would line up behind the scenes, though I just won't know. It also doesn't directly impact the story's integrity as a parody (though /indirectly/, it does make me think that I, personally, don't recall reading any overthrow-the-empire plots that doesn't involve a fairly thorough set of secondary characters).
