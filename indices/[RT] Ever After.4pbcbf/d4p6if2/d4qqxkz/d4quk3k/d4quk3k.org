Good point about that strategy, haven't thought of that myself.

Not something that befits a "grand" final battle though.

And if the dictator really was from a previous batch of heroes, my new gripe would be that I'd expect him to have /learned/ (how the last dictator fell). That's kind of how experience works, after all.
