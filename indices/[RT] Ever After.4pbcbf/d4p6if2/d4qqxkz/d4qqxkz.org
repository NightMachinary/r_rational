I think it's a pretty good combo against mundane troops.

Armor can protect all three with the radius, TK keeps melee guys away and the sword cuts a path through walls, Use that to get to the dictator, then hold him in place with TK and stick a sword in.

My head-canon says the dictator was one of the last batch of heroes who did the same, so his power was probably something silly like super-strength anyways :P
