I think I've figured out what makes a work rational-/adjacent/. More on that in friday's thread. But the tl;dr is that the story needs to be primarily driven by intentional character action. Even if the rest of the story isn't quite up to snuff (stuff happening because the plot demands it, characters acting not quite in line with their motivations) a work will still typically be in line with what [[/r/rational]] enjoys.

So given that, what's the least amount of possible change to the way the real world functions that effectively makes the life of /anyone/ (who's sufficiently motivated and intelligent to begin with) an interesting rational-adjacent fic?

To set an easily surpassed bar: giving the entire planet Log Horizon mechanics. (That is, respawning, monsters to take down, bodies with sweet new abilities, magic, etcetera.) If that were to happen, at least in the mid-term you could take pretty much anyone's life and it would be interesting to watch (eventually it would get old-hat, of course, but that would take a while). But what I'm looking for specifically is what you think the /lower/ bound of change that would result in any proactive person having the incentive to do interesting things, while IRL incentives head more towards "get comfortable and/or interesting job, enjoy life."
