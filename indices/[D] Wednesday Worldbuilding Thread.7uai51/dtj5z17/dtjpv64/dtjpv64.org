RNG until I get something I like. I don't like matching names to some narrative archetype partially because I think it's snobbery, but mostly because I'm lazy.

If I need a fantasy name, I tend to take a "real" word, then tweak phonemes until it's unrecognizable. For example, for an RP character I got started with "Genex" (a yugioh archetype), then "Grenex", then "Grenexus". That one in particular was kind of cheesy, but it conveys the general idea of the process.
