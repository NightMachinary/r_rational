Thank you for the in-depth answer. I didn't know any of those resources except Wikipedia, and Wikipedia pages on languages are often impenetrable to me because of their abundance of linguistic terms. Linguists, as might be expected, are very fond of making up words (sometimes in cases where I as the reader would have preferred a more descriptive term).

The book helped with that, though, and was a fun read regardless. I've never felt capable of constructing a language; now I know precisely /how/ incapable I am. (This will probably steer me further away from worldbuilding-intensive projects in the future... oh well.)
