- Some kind of feedback mechanism, e.g. people can see their own "karma", status/rank is factual. This gives a means for agents to see if their actions are working. IRL people can't easily/reliably assess what they're doing so it's harder to optimize their actions.
- Some kind of leveling up system. Ways for agents to improve without regressing towards the mean again. This makes training/study more useful because the results are permanent and you don't need to "work out" to keep them. IRL you can't stack skills easily, talent and other stuff makes harder for people to reliably compete and reduce the incentives to "become awesome".
- Discrete/quantifiable events. This gives agents achievable goals that have clear boundaries (e.g. did the event happen/finish, did we "win" it). IRL things are usually unclear, it's hard to keep motivation if the goal seems too far away or if the results are not clear cut.

I think any of these would work. Essentially they're ways to make the system more "gameable" by having exploitable aspects.
