You could always just steal names that are very obscure. Like find a Norwegian town with a population of 2000 and make its name the name of your capital.

Or you could combine Nordic words in a way that makes sense. If your capital is has a big fishing industry, find the word fish in Norwegian, then add the Norwegian word for city to it. Lots of real places are named like that. Tokyo for example means "eastern capital".
