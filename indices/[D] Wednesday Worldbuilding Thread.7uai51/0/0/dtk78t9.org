Personally, if I'm putting effort into it, I'd go to something like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse#Consonants][Old Norse wikipedia page]], specifically the part about consonants, and then start from there. These are the /sounds/ of Old Norse, and there are some guidelines to where those sounds exist within words.

Alternately, there's a program called [[https://www.vulgarlang.com/index.html][Vulgar]] that can make a language for you, and if you want to go the extra mile (or just get that Nordic feel) you can put in all the vowels and consonants from the nordic language of your choice (perhaps with a few other rules) and see what it spits back out for you - if you save the results, you'll have a long list of internally consistent sounding words to use as names.

Also, there's a book called The Art of Language Invention that I've found helpful in the past, though if you only use it for names, you're probably only using about 5% of it. Mostly you want to pay attention to which sounds the language uses, and in which order, plus for names, especially last names, include a lot of the same prefixes (e.g. O'Rouke, O'Leary, O'Sullivan, O'Neal) or suffixes (e.g. Walker, Baker, Carter, Parker, Butler), because that's part of how last names get/got created.
