Naming. How does it work? Previously, I've been deciding names by "gut feeling" and did fine (though not great) on most of them. Now I'm writing my first long work with appreciable amounts of worldbuilding, and I'm noticing that gut feeling doesn't cut it anymore.

How do you name? I'd love to have some hints or different approaches; maybe some of you even have an article to recommend on the topic, or personal experiences to share.

--------------

Some details: what I'm writing takes place in a different world entirely; non-IRL names are called for. The culture everything takes place in is vaguely Nordic, and I'd like the names to reflect this (preferably without carbon-copying anything). The problem is that I have almost no "generative linguistic intuition", i.e. I have no idea how to come up with things that "sound" right.
