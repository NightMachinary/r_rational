The last couple characters I named, not very creatively, by adding or subtracting letters to words that happened to be in my field of view at the time. For instance I have Canje, who was born from my printer “S*canJe*t”. Another was named Limth, because I saw “f*ilm th*eatre” when I was looking for a name.

That's overall fine enough for short stories in random worlds.

If you want names in a different world you can take typical names of the inspirational culture and mangle or rewrite them. Like, swedish for instance: Linnéa, Ebba or Tove, all female names. Limena, Abbe, Ovte. I think it's more important to have the character names thusly created to feel consistent than actually adhere too consistently to a renaming scheme. Culture is malleable, and thus are names, but at the same time they're more united by a feeling than strict rules (unless those are dictated by alphabets, see Japanese naming schemes).

I remember reading a novel set in an counterpart Japanese culture before the Meiji restoration, and all the names felt Japanese and consistent at the time. One of the side characters stood out, though, and only after finishing and ruminating on the book did I realise /why/ he did; he was named Tomasu, adhered to the syllabic naming scheme of the counterpart culture, but didn't... ‘flow' as well inside it. But when the quasi-mystic religion of that character was taken into account, it did by providing one more piece to the puzzle and Tomasu revealed itself to be a japanified version of Thomas. Like I said, that revelation came only in hindsight.

Lastly, you can go strict by rules, which is in my opinion the one with the most work behind it, because you'll need a feel for that made-up language. One can approximate this by inventing (or taking) a dozen words of appropriate choice (flower names, landscape formations, religious figures) and adding syllables or letters, maybe gendered. Many diminutive and female forms of names end on -a or -i/-y, whereas many male forms end on -o or -e. Not exclusively, though, and I didn't touch on unvoiced vocals, but that's something to keep in mind. Thus you'd have:

| Word   | Meaning | Female     | Male   |
|--------+---------+------------+--------|
| Sten   | stone   | Stena      | Steno  |
| Bäck   | stream  | Bäcka      | Bäcke  |
| Blomma | flower  | Blommi     | Blommo |
| Kust   | coast   | Kusta      | Kuste  |
| Huvud  | head    | Huvudi     | Huvdo  |
| Svärd  | sword   | Svärdlinga | Svärde |
| Älskar | love    | Älska      | Älsker |

This should be less restrictive/normative/prescriptive than more inspiration for you to get a feel for the naming scheme. Try names out, /sound/ them out, try to get a feel for them on your tongue.

But a bit of advice on names in general as a device: choose pronounceable names for main characters. Klaxtrikpug may be a good name inside the fictional culture, but it doesn't exactly roll of the tongue of the anglophone reader.
