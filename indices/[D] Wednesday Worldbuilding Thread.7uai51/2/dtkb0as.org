Does anyone here know of the issues present with teraforming Venus.

As far as I can tell the major issues present are

1: the atmosphere is filled with chemicals such as sulphuric acid

2: It's incredibly hot due to green house gas

3: It's highly volcanic 4: The wind speed is very high

I would like to know of any other issues that need to be dealt with for colonisation

This is the plan for my world. The original settlers were highly paranoid. This is why they settled Venus, because it was difficult to reach by ship. To this day, the people are highly xenophobic. They originally lived underground, but over the years they have teraformed the planet. This teraforming took the place of using tectonic activity to turn the crust into a giant ward scheme which separated the atmosphere into two layers. The ground layer is mostly habitable by humans. The layer above, however is where the fun starts. It began as the normal safe Venus atmosphere. However the Venusians decided to control it through the addition of alchemical compounds. These perform a couple of purposes.

Firstly they absorb heat and prevent it reaching the lower atmosphere. When temperature reaches a certain threshold they vent the heat into space, causing temperature to fluctuate wildly.

Secondly defence. Some substances are designed pass through and disrupt ordinary wards. More dangerous substances will begin eating the ship, possibly turning into unstable dangerous forms of matter.

A third function a kinetic energy leach which causes anything in the atmosphere to quickly slow down to falling speed while increasing wind speed. This maximises time in the atmosphere and contact with dangerous compounds. It can even significantly reduce speed of asteroids, through storms rage for weeks afterwards.

The only way down to the planet is with permission of the Venus government who can control the ward scheme enough to temporally part the clouds and make a passage that can be passed by some ships. They do this infrequently.

The land is not safe either but exact details are still up for debate. At the very least Venusians have built colonies around the volcanoes and use them to power ward schemes

So what do you think. Any other things that need to be considered when inhabiting Venus? Any obvious flaws in the defenses? Bear in mind their isn't much genetic engneering in this setting so the Venusians are still human.
