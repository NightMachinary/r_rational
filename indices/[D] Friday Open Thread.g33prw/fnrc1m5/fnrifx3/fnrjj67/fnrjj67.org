I'm not sure, but I think cognitive bias is difficult to research and prone to large amount of error in humans. Personally, I'd argue most biases are actually useful priors and life would become much more difficult if you lost them. So the difference between an useful prior and a cognitive bias would be even harder to determine for an animal.
