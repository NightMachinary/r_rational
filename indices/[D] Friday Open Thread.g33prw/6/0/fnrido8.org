I'm not sure if it's just me, but Pink Floyd always seemed to be getting less and less psychedelic as time goes by - compare Dark Side of the Moon with Wish You Were Here, and Wish You Were Here with the Wall. I'm most familiar with the Waters-era, so I'm thinking of the contrast between Piper at the Gates of Dawn and The Final Cut.
