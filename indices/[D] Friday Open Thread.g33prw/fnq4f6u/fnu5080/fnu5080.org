Hey, just a notice for those of you who read Pyrebound: I'm sorry I haven't been updating the story. I've been trying to write, but I'm busy with classes lately, I'm not in the best health (it's not COVID), and now my writing laptop is acting up. Updates will switch from "every Sunday" to "as soon as I can get them written to satisfaction." 14.1 is more than half done, probably not that far from completion, but God knows when that will get done. I'm sorry.
