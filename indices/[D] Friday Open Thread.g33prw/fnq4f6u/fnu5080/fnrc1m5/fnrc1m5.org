Chimps, and other primates, are capable of looking at the percentage of peanuts vs carrots in a bucket, then when a piece of food is hiddenly drawn from each bucket, they will choose the bucket with the higher ratio of peanuts(which are yummier). Not a very surprising study, it's not a tough statistics problem by any means, but it is nice to get more information on the cognitive ability and predictive ability of primates.
