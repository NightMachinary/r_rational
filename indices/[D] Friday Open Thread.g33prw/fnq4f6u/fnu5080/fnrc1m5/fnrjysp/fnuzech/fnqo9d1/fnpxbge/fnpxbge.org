I've been listening to the music of [[https://www.rustycage.tv/music][Rusty Cage]] on Spotify. I really enjoy his songs.

What I found fascinating is that, if you listen to his albums in chronological order, his lyrics get darker and less religious while his music gets less depressed as time goes on.

This is the first time that I've felt like I could actually follow along with an artist's evolving mentality through the medium of his art.

I thought that was neat, and wanted to share.
