None of the Magica spinoffs have been very good, tbh IMO. Not a single one.

There's actually nothing particularly rational this season, and we've tried at least a little of everything now. That said, some things are fun. Shows we haven't yet dropped:

- Appare-Ranman! - basically steampunk Cannonball Run. Least irrational thing airing, but that is not a high bar or a strong statement.

- Arte - noblewoman wants to be an artist but women can't be artists because reasons maybe they all paint with their cocks or something idk cute baby feminist anyway

- Hamefura - isekai, mc is reincarnated as a villainess in a dating sim where all possible routes end badly for the villainess. Which is a whole manga genre these days, there's dozens of the things. Opposite of rational, but great fun.

- Listeners - this is probably the strongest show this season for us. Distinct shades of Gurren Lagann, lots of references to pick up on including half an episode set in Pripyat so far. I get the same feeling from this that I got from the first few eps of Madoka - I have no clue where it's going yet, but they've put enough effort in that I'm willing to trust it is going somewhere.

- Yesterday wo Utatte - we don't usually go for straight romance, but this is surprisingly well told, with pleasing characters and decent animation.

EDIT: I should also mention Nami Yo Kiitekure. The other half and I decided it was not for us, but pretty much the entire rest of our anime club are avidly following it, so maybe YMMV. Basically slice of life, people I don't feel a particular connection with making poor life choices. I suspect it works better if you catch more of the jokes, but my Japanese isn't up to that so I'm stuck with the subtitles.
