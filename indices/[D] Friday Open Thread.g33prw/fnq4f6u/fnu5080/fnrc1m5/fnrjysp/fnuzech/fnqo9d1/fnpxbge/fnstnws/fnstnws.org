The guys who did [[https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/][Deep In Pact]], a podcast analysis of [[https://www.pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]], are currently trying to find their next project. For that purpose, they're releasing a "trailer episode" for a new show, by looking at the first few installments of a serial, or a show, or a book. So far they had [[https://www.doofmedia.com/2020/03/25/on-the-lamb-arc-1-taking-root/][On the Lamb]], which covers Arc 1 of [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]], then came [[https://www.doofmedia.com/2020/04/08/riding-the-elephant-the-broken-lands-part-1/][Riding the Elephant]] for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_East_series][The Empire of the East series]], and now they're taking on Gaiman's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)][Sandman]] in [[https://www.doofmedia.com/2020/04/15/bring-me-a-dream-volume-1-part-1/][*Bring Me A Dream*]]!
