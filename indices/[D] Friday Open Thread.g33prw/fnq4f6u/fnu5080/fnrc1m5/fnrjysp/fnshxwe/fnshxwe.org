I think the aspect you spoilered did feel unfair to me, and was one of the main reasons that I stopped playing it. Puzzle games have an inherent contract with the players. The player is presented with puzzles, and is expected to get stuck at times, needing to puzzle it out. The developers, on the other hand, are expected to make sure that it any stalled progression is always the fault of the player. That way, the frustration that a player feels resolves with a feeling of triumph, rather than a feeling that a trick had been pulled.

If a game does not make it obvious that a puzzle requires you to come back later with a new tool, then that is the fault of the game, and breaks the contract. With how many lateral thinking puzzles are in Antichamber, it is quite difficult for a player to identify these puzzles.
