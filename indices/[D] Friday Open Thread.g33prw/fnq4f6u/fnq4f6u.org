I read The Labratory the other week and I had something of an epiphany. In three column format most of the chapters fit in a single widescreen (1080p). Something I discovered by accidentally pushing a widescreen button. It really helped me visualize the length of text needed for a chapter of a punchy novel and helped motivate my writing ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g39t4o/rst_wip_litrpg_the_core_of_a_factory_chapters_15/][shameless plug]]).

It's worked really great. I've written 14 chapters already and am /still getting ahead of my stupidly aggressive release schedule/ (every weekday). What I haven't been able to entirely figure out is why?

Like sure the physical distancing stuff has made me stir crazy, and in general I focus that into work... but that has also been suffering from the physical distancing claustrophobia. I lead with this because it's a plausible alternate explanation and confounding factor. But I did try for two weeks to work on other projects to deal with the stir craziness, it wasn't until this epiphany that I made good progress. Though it might have been a tipping point thing? I find it unlikely. I worry the end of physical distancing will disrupt it somehow, it will be interesting to see.

I want to say that it's a motivation thing. That I saw this amount of text and thought "I could do this". Perhaps because I often write code and have a strong understanding of what a column of code takes to write. I definitely think its because I was able to tie a specific visual to the amount of writing I had to do. But whether that visual is because I find it aesthetic pleasing or is tied into something I had total confidence I could achieve? I'm not sure.

In practice I suspect it might actually be a constraint thing. I look at the word count^{1} as a rough guide to follow this aesthetic (though I do also export and then import it to my ebook reader to verify) and that is forcing me to rewrite, postpone, and cut things that I might not otherwise bother with. It has also put constraints on my chapter outline (vis-a-vis pacing) that I haven't had before. What is frustrating about this hypothesis is that I was aware of this strategy and have attempted it in the past. I'm not sure why it is working this time.

Hope someone finds that useful or at least interesting.

1. ~1000 < 1100 < ideal > 1375 > ~1500 > 2000. That last being a hard upper limit, the approximate numbers are sourced from the book that gave me the epiphany, and the inner numbers are my page target (5) on royal road. The amount of different numbers might be part of it. As sort of increasing "stress" milestones on my writing. In the past I have only ever tried a single upper limit.
