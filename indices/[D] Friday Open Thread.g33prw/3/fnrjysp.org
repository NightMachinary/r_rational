I've been replaying through [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/][Antichamber]], and I'm reminded each time of how it's my favorite game of all time.

It a puzzle game with no plot- Just a open world of puzzle with a series of short quotes after each puzzle. The quotes never come off as fake-deep or trite, just cleverly related to the situation at hand.

The music and design create this amazing, dreamlike atmosphere. There's a lot of non-euclidean pathing and surreal artwork, like an art museum made made by Dali. Returning to the start room involves the screen doing a subtle dissolve that invokes waking up from a dream.

None of the puzzles are unfair, though some may require tools you pick up later. And every time I figured out the 'trick', it never felt like I had lucked out.

Great game, 10/10, highly recommend.
