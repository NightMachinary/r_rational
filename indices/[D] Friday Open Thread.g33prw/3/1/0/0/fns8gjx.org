Well it's made by the creator of braid. So there is that.

The egregious puzzles are all optional. I think you can technically win - and get both achievements - having completed less than half the total puzzles. Only if you want to complete every single one would I imagine it being an issue.

The puzzles are - in my opinion - a very well done sequence for practicing the scientific method (and to an extent I would imagine rationalism, though less so because there are fewer biases involved with hard logic). A couple are more miss than hit, but I would say more than 80% of them are perfectly done given the correct mindset.
