The blizzard's immediacy made sense to me, because it was in response to Rain using Immolate. If they had entered without the aura being active, then the blizzard wouldn't have shown up.

It's reasonable for dungeons to react to adventurers altering the environment, because that would massively disadvantage the monsters.

Why not wait around? That would require patience and foresight to realize the mage will run out of mana. Instant reactions sounds like a programmed response which matches to the computer-like nature of dungeons.
