Should it not take time for a response to occur ? For a blizzard to form ? Or for it to reach his location ?

To me the fact that it doesn't seems quite convenient and unreasonable.

I've no problem with the response, only with how quickly it happened. Sure fight the immolate, push back against it with environmental mana, that looks natural, but when right away a blizzard shows up it feels artificial like the author is doing it on purpose to create a scene he wants.
