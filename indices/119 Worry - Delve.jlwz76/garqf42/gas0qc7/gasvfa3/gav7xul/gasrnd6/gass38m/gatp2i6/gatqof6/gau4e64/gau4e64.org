The two active reference frames for dungeons are 1) computer games 2) magic.

Neither of these create an expectation of a need to "appear natural" to me. In fact, it would be entirely reasonable for the snow cover to just respawn instead of falling from the sky. The frost storm the ice mage does just manifests around them IIRC. That being said, there are some hints about this dungeon being a bit strange. You could be onto something. But I would not chalk this up to author laziness.

Could something else have damaged your suspension of disbelief and this was just the closest target for the disbelief at the time? Did you enjoy the chapter up to that point? I'm not claiming to know your inner state. And it's perfectly fair for you to not care to diagnose the story's failure for you deeper. It's just that... all events in a story are artificial and done by the authors to create scenes they want. The author is supposed to make you forget that. When you feel that it is happening, something has gone wrong. But the artificialness is not really the problem. The problem is the thing that made you see it. Like, humans having bones is not the actual problem in a situation where your bones are sticking out.
