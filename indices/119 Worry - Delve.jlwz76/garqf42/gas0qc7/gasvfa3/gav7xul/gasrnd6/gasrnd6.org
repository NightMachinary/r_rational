The immediate response of the dungeon is kind of silly. Maybe give it 5-10 mins before a massive blizzard shows up to simulate that it had to create it and bring it over rather than just making it appear on top of them almost immediately.

​

It seemed like it took less than 1 minute for a blizzard to show up and try to balance itself. Either it implies the dungeon can just pop environmental effects anywhere at any time regardless of how powerful they are or that it made that storm and moved it faster than sound in their direction, idk which is sillier.

​

It seemed like the author had this idea for a scene and he just hacked it together without any care for reasonableness or realism. Just hey you made too much heat in one small area relative to the total size of the dungeon so I'll just make this instant unreasonable blizzard right on top of you as punishment, so the author can conveniently add some tension and make his scene happen.
