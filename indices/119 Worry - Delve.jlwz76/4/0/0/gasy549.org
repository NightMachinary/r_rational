My problem isn't with the reaction or its strength. It's with how fast the response is and to some extent the fact that changing the temperature in a relatively small area inside a place that's as big as that dungeon is got such a response in the first place.

Sure send a blizzard in half an hour that's fine, but putting a blizzard instantly onto it is quite silly.
