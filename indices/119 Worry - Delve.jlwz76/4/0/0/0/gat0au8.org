The story has floated the idea that a dungeon might have some cognition---though we don't know how much of that is just Rain's preconceptions---and this dungeon is young. Perhaps this young dungeon is impulsive, a bit petulant, and unskilled at narrative?

Or even if dungeons are too dumb to describe as above, we can construct an explanation at the instinct level: an order-instinct suggested that corrective weather be applied immediately, and won, since the consequences of that (in terms the dungeon cares about, like some sort of fairness / hidden-workings / narrative-instinct) had not been learned yet.
