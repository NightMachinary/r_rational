My view is that immediate responses should be impossible because everything has limitations, i.e the dungeon can make a blizzard but it takes time, or only in one specific area from which it then has to move to the appropriate location.

The problem for me is more of this making it seem like dungeons have no limitations, rather than trying to justify the response.
