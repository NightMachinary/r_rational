Make a tube between any two places, collapse its length to the size of the entrances. If you can do 1000 of these a day, which is a very modest number because the strategy is just shrink-step-repeat, and your speed sounds like it can be munchkin'd further, in three years you've given the world a million point-to-point hops of arbitrary length. The bottleneck is presumably how fast they can be built.
