"What if there are no entrances? It's simple enough to make a hollow cylinder with no openings. Or simply seal the entrance of a water bottle with clay so it can't be opened without breaking open an entrance. In that case, is there minimum size? Can you shrink everything inside into 0 volume, effectively creating a very low mass black hole? Can you use such a trick to create extremely powerful grenades? "

As was noted in the initial question, it was noted that anything inside pushes back. Given that no matter how sparse the filling of the container, attempting to compress a finite amount of matter to a zero dimensional point seems like it would generate infinite pressure, probably not, unless you had a infinitely strong material. A grenade seems like it would work.

"ANY container? What counts as a container? Is there a size limit? Does the Earth's crust count as a container that contains the Earth's core? Can you apply your power to the Earth's crust and cause earthquakes and volcano eruptions everywhere from all the internal magma trying to escape the shrinking space within the Earth? "

While I didn't state it in the initial question, what I was assuming that a container was is a solid shape enclosing a hollow cavity, filled with either vacuum, gas, liquid, or disconnected solid. A fishing net would count as long as it enclosed the volume, but given the minimum size is the total full length of all opening put together, might not be effective. For example, if you have a box with holes on each side totalling half the length of each side, the smallest you can shrink it is half each side length, or 1/8 full size. A fish net, being even sparser would have less effect.
