  can you solve entropy?
#+end_quote

Depends where the energy you use to shrink the container comes from, and how much you need versus how strong the container presses inwards.

#+begin_quote
  At anytime while touching a given container you may change size between proper size and minimum size as rapidly as you wish.
#+end_quote

As rapidly as you wish is extremely exploitable. Above lightspeed size changes are effectively time travel. Below lightspeed size changes that are still at rather high speeds can cause air to literally undergo nuclear fusion. If doing this doesn't drain you dry of energy, it would be a massive source of free energy.

  Namely you can take any container and shrink internal dimensions, to a minimum size of all entrances to the container placed side by side
#+end_quote

What if there are no entrances? It's simple enough to make a hollow cylinder with no openings. Or simply seal the entrance of a water bottle with clay so it can't be opened without breaking open an entrance. In that case, is there minimum size? Can you shrink everything inside into 0 volume, effectively creating a very low mass black hole? Can you use such a trick to create extremely powerful grenades?

ANY container? What counts as a container? Is there a size limit? Does the Earth's crust count as a container that contains the Earth's core? Can you apply your power to the Earth's crust and cause earthquakes and volcano eruptions everywhere from all the internal magma trying to escape the shrinking space within the Earth?

What's scarier is that the containers are allowed to have multiple entrances, which makes the definition even more vague. Does a fishing net count as a container for fish, even though it is full of holes (entrances)? If so, can you create a very sparse net around the solar system and shrink the space inside to reduce the distance between planets and the Sun? Would clever compression tactics let you bring the orbits of Mars and Venus into the same range as Earth, thus making them much easier to terraform and colonize?
