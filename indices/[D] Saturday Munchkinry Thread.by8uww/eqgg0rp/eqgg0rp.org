You have been granted control over the fabric of space itself. Unfortunately for technical reasons, you can't make things bigger on the inside, only smaller on the inside. Namely you can take any container and shrink internal dimensions, to a minimum size of all entrances to the container placed side by side. If another entrance is opened while it is smaller than that it will expand and not shrink again. Shrinking will compress anything inside, but it will push back against the walls, possibly breaking them. Growth will not uncompress anything inside, merely provide room to grow into. At anytime while touching a given container you may change size between proper size and minimum size as rapidly as you wish. How do you use this power? What is the biggest exploits and most useful loopholes? Can you make money, can you take over the world, can you solve entropy?
