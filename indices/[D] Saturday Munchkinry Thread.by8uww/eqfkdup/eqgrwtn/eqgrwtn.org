One of my favorite little 5e tricks: the Find Familiar spell allows you to look through your familiar's eyes as an action, and the Misty Step spell lets you teleport anywhere you can see within 30 feet of you. So if you send your familiar somewhere that it can access but you can't, like over an enormous wall, you can circumvent Misty Step's line-of-sight rule as long as it's within 30 feet. My wizard once used it to nope out of a ship's hold: left his familiar aboveboard, then blipped back up when things got dicey.

Also, if you can get Otiluke's Resilient Sphere moving fast enough, that's a damn good wrecking ball.
