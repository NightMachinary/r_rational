Congratulations, you have a full brain scan of every person on the planet, as a brain cell is much larger than a cubic nanometer.

Start with a single human brain, and use the information about how things are connected to build a brain emulator.

If you can't figure out a dozen different ways to turn a working human brain emulator and a complete scan of every living human brain in existence into world domination, I can't help you.
