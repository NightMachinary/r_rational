The material physics of this is confusing me. Imagine you had a hollow metal sphere, and collapsed the inside space to zero. What happens to the inside surface of the material? Where does it go? Correspondingly, what happens when you hit the sphere, in a way that would otherwise dent it? What if the space inside was small but finite, and you dented it from the inside?
