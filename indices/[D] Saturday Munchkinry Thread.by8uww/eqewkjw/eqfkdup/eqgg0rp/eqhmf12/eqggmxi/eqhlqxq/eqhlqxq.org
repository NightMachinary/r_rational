Any ideas how to make such a thing economical? Your time is incredibly precious, you don't want to be pumping a turbine all day, even if it's a large one.

A different approach would be to make gravity-powered perpetual motion generators. If you run fluid in a closed loop, where the trip up is shorter than the trip down, you're feeding energy into the system. Make these lake-sized and you're done. This is simple enough that handheld versions should work fine too, though I struggle to imagine in what cases such a thing would be affordable.
