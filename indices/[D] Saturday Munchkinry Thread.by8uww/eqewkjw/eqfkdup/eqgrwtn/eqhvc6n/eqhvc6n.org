Garden variety, but I play a rogue (with the arcane speciality) and I've got an aerchaopteryx familiar (OK mechanically it's an owl) and as long as it's next to an opponent, I've got advantage against that opponent, so I always get my sneak attack bonus (which is sizeable). If the opponent kills my familiar I can just summon it again after the battle, so there's really no downside.
