My first thoughts would be mining, make some sort of a simple ordering function accounting for market value of a material, density, depth etc, and ask for a sorted list of deposits in terms of this ordering. Then pretend you've got a fancy new method for finding this info without telling anyone how it works and start a small but hyper efficient mining operation.

Maybe this could be used for fossils or something, but I doubt you could make any great distinctions with this sort of resolution, and there's not much money to be found here. More generally along this line, I realise I'm thinking down the track of valuable things to be found in the crust of the earth, and other than simple valuable materials, probably the next best thing is underground ruins? I don't know much about the field, but with some research, maybe this is a valuable path to go down. Maybe air pockets of a certain unusual shape? Look for sharp corners?

I don't think this has a whole bunch of utility with regards to doing anything with the populated world, because the data you're getting is rather vague with the whole elemental breakdown thing. How could you read a piece of paper or hear a conversation using such a tool? This makes it kinda worthless for political stuff I'd think.

You could find man made objects on the floor of the ocean, but that seems like it might net you notoriety, not riches. Which is kinda my thought on the ruins and fossils thing too.

Maybe there's some value in being able to chemically analyse objects that already exist but are too valuable to actually break down? If you got isotopic data (I'm lightly massaging the prompt here) you could carbon date anything, but you can't disclose information gotten this way to the world, and it seems a little hard to leverage. Maybe isotopic data could be calculated based off the weight (if it's precise enough) and you have the elemental make up?
