Background on this thing's resolution: A nanometer is hella small. An atom is about an angstrom, which is 0.1 nm. Typical lattice parameters for crystals are like 2-3 angstroms. So a 1 nm cube is averaging over something on the order of 100 atoms, and for a good proportion of them the percentages boil down to more-or-less exact atom counts.
