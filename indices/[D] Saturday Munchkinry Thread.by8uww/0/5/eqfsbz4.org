In case of gold, I first have to wonder, what ppm of gold is considered rich enough to be worth mining? If the number is less than 10,000 ppm (=1%), then we have a problem: the artifact cannot detect which site is worth mining. The artifact would only be useful to detect place where purified gold located. This is doubly troublesome for other mine-able stuff, as they're not occurred in nature as un-compounded element. Therefore, lawful mining operation is out.

But the artifact is not useless to seek riches. Consider you want to rob a house, the artifact would be useful to locate where the inhabitant of the house hide their precious metal. Of course, if they store them inside a safe, you'd still need to break it.
