Thank you, you are close to correct, but calculating for a flat plane. I screwed up on the volume conversion between kilometers cubed and nanometers cubed. I had a brain fart and treated it as 12 orders of magnitude instead of 36 orders of magnitude. The correct answer using spherical volumes is actually ~ 1.02 × 10^{49.}

To get the volume in kilometers cubed: (4/3.0)×pi×(6371+10)^{3} - (4/3.0)×pi×(6371-10)^{3.}
