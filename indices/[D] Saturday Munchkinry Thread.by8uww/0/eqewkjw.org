You have been given an extremely detailed snapshot of Earth's surface by say, aliens. Nobody else knows you have it, nobody knows it exists.

Snapshot itself is a gigantic array of non-indexed data. It is stored in an irreplaceable and irreplicable artifact that you have managed to build an interface to. The data contains everything 10 km above and below sea level with a resolution of 1 nanometer, taken at January 1st of this year at GMT 00:00. For every nanometer cube (actually slightly skewed cube, being part of a shell), percentage of every element (down to a minimum of 1%), and its overall weight in grams are given.

[Some back of the envelope calculations suggest that amount of data exceeds the storage capabilities we have, so assume you send queries for a given volume and get back the results.]

You have the resources of a mid-size software company; 100 employees, $100 million in liquid assets, as well as a network you can tap for additional financing as needed.

How do you effectively go around making money (and/or take over the world), without getting killed by every intelligence agency ever?
