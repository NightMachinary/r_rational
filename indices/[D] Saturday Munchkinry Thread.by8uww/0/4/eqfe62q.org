A high-risk high-reward scheme is to start blackmailing the hell out of people. 1 nanometer resolution is enough to read every printed or written text on any surface within your snapshot, and most of the world still hasn't transitioned to keeping all documents on computers. You will be able to pick just about any target and read through everything in their office/house.

Even better: plenty of people are dumb enough to write down their passwords somewhere so they don't forget. There will be lists of passwords in their wallets or their homes and you can see them all and log in to all their accounts. Emails, banks, offices, social media, you'll have access to several accounts on just about every network on earth.

Now you can either stealthily log in and gain information about your targets for more blackmail, or you can loot them dry through a series of proxies that include the other accounts you stole so you can frame everyone for stealing from everyone else while you secretly make off with the profits.
