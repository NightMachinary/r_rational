I do know what you're talking about. I think having it on audiobook made it much better - I tend to not like such parts normally, but the author did a good job with everyone's accents, which helped mitigate the "ugh it's a new character that I don't care about" problem. Later on in the story, I admit I got somewhat tired of Mark's pattern of "something went wrong, I calculated that I had [x number] of [y resource], so I did [z clever hack]." the third-person sections did a good job of breaking that up, and helped the story feel less episodic. I would have probably felt the same if I was reading it, though.
