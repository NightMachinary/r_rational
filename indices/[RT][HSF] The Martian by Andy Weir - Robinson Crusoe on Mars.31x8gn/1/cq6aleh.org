Read it. Loved it. Most likely going to re-read it again in the next few months. It does a good job of making you feel like you're there with Andy, while still managing to not be too dark or depressing. Andy's actually a fun guy to follow, as he does what's usually super boring stuff, and deals with disaster after disaster. His mental fortitude is insanely high though, to be able to go through such an experience.
