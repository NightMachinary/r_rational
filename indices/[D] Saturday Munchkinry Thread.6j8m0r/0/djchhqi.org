So I've watched some let's plays of danganronpa and I found it a very interesting concept. I mean, what would you do in the situation? For those who don't know, the basic rules are as shown:

Rule #1: People may reside only within the building. Leaving this area is an unacceptable use of time.

Rule #2: "Nighttime" is from 10 pm to 7 am. Some areas are off-limits at night.

Rule #3: Sleeping anywhere other than the dormitory will be punished accordingly.

Rule #4: With minimal restrictions, you are free to explore the building at your discretion.

Rule #5: Violence against "Monokuma" (the one trapping you there) is strictly prohibited, as is destruction of surveillance cameras.

Rule #6: Anyone who kills a fellow person and becomes "blackened" will be able to leave, unless they are discovered.

Rule #7: Additional school regulations may be added if necessary.

Rule #8: Once a murder takes place, a trial will begin shortly thereafter, with time given for gathering evidence. Participation is mandatory for all surviving persons.

Rule #9: If the guilty party is exposed during the trial, they alone will be executed.

Rule #10: If the guilty party is not exposed, they alone will be able to leave, and all remaining persons will be executed.

Rule #11: Lending your "e-Handbook" (which has the list of rule, is necessary to enter certain areas, and holds evidence that is discovered) to another person is strictly prohibited.

Rule #12: The guilty party may only kill a maximum of two people.

Rule #13: Attempting to break into locked rooms is strictly prohibited.

If any of these rules are broken, the rule breaker is executed.

So my question is this: what is the rational method for surviving (or escaping)? Everything is provided for, but you have to go to the cafeteria to get food, for example. In this case, let's say you are trapped with 15 others, all around your age, with a 50/50 gender split.
