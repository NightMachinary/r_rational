  What is the absolute amount of energy needed to create and to sustain a pair of portals at a given distance? You have given the scaling, but not the absolute amounts. The economic usage depends on how difficult it would be to disrupt, and how easy it is to prevent disruption, which depend on the power requirements.
#+end_quote

Eh, how about 1 kW sustained power draw for a portal 1 km distant, and the initial cost would be 100 times that. This is totally arbitrary, of course. I mean, going with these numbers that Earth-Moon-Portal would draw about 150 terawatts (or 64 times average global power consumption) for continuous use.

  Rules 8 and 9 appear to be contradictory. If there is no travel time, how can any matter be "currently traversing"?
#+end_quote

Take a long distance, e.g. to the moon. You enter the portal, and a fraction of a second later, as seen by an outside observer, someone creates a small portal at the L1 point. Both portals blink out, but you're suddenly uniformly distributed in a sphere a light second across. Keep in mind, this requires coincidence or planning; you can't send a signal for someone to create a portal in reaction to entering one yourself, you'd move as fast as the signal.

  Can the spell be cast mechanically, or does it require a human to cast?
#+end_quote

Sure, why not. My original idea for this was actually as a tech, but fantasy cares less about rigidity in the nitty-gritty, so that's why I chose spell.

#+begin_quote
  What is the size of the portal's opening? Can the size be varied? For a very large portal with a small distance between the endpoints, what would count as the endpoint on the sphere?
#+end_quote

See, this is what I want, think I hadn't though of myself. Thank you for that :)

Now let me think. Hm... You know, this is a really good point. Now I wonder if the portals could be gigantic, yet close to each other, relatively speaking. But that way lays exploits, methinks. Hm...

How about, if the portals themselves were spherical, they couldn't touch. So the minimum distance is double their radius, and the portals on both sides themselves are by definition the same size.

#+begin_quote
  Do the portals require power/machinery on both sides, or only one? What happens if the generator powering the portal passes through the portal?
#+end_quote

No, it can be powered from one side. And if you shove the power generator sustaining the portal into the portal, the portal is disrupted and the generator dispersed.

Sorry, [[/u/Gurkenglas]] (love the name), my bad.

I already explicitly vetoed killing physics or everyone, so that's nothing to be worried about. As for gravity wells... Traversing the portal draws more/less power for when you're leaving the gravity well, or moving up, or get an increase in tangential force (as related to latitude).

This means, going from the North pole to the equator draw more power. Going from the seafloor to Mt Everest draws more power. Going from your place to space, well, congratulations, you're falling down, unless you happen to be orbiting at geostationary orbit.

Hm... this orbit thing is something worth looking into.
