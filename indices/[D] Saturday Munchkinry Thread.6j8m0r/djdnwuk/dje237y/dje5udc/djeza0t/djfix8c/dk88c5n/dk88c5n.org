This makes the /opening/ power requirement almost irrelevant for non-interplanetary connections. earth has a roughly 1.2x10^{7} meter diameter, light traverses that in .04 seconds. Opening this would draw 100KW/kilometer x 12000 kilometers x 0.04 seconds = 48 kilojoules. By comparison, keepin it open for just one minute would use 720 kilojoules.
