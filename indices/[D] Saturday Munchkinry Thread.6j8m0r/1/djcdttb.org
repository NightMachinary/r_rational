What would you do with the 4D vision from /Spaceland/ by Rudy Rucker?

Imagine a Flatlander with an eyestalk extending into the third dimension, allowing him to look down and see inside nearby objects. This power is the same, but a dimension higher. Objects get increasingly squashed by perspective as they get farther away, and need to have a significant volume to be seen (so words on a page or images on a screen could be too thin to make out clearly.
