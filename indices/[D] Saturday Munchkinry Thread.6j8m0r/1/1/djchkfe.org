The problem with 4d vision is we don't have it. Each eye gives us a 2 dimensional image of a 3 dimensional universe. An eyestalk in the 4th dimension would have to have a 3d retina. Now try imagining having a 3d retina, where you could look at an image of a human being inside and out, seeing all cross-sections at the same time. How to do this? Maybe you could send to the optic nerve all the cross sections in a grid, and eventually the brain will figure it out, in a similar way to how if you put on [[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/12/improbable-research-seeing-upside-down][goggles]] that turn everything upside down, you get used to it, and then everything looks upside down when the goggles are removed.

I can envision a pair of goggles with a 4 dimensional component, that show cross-sections when you put them on. How long it would take to get used to that, I don't know.
