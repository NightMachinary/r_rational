IIRC that's exactly how the webserial [[https://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure]] explained the powers of the local Superman expy, he was a higher-dimensional being that was trapped in our universe and only kept the ability to just move a tiny distance away from our 3-plane. Just enough to see and ignore 3D physical effects if he wanted to.
