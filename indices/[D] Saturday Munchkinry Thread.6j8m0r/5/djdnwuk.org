You /somehow/ stumble across a magic spell, one you can teach to others, one that allows for portals. Portals that you can power from the electrical power grid, but there are caveats:

1.  Portals are always created in pairs. They don't need to be attached to anything.
2.  The creation of a portal costs significantly more energy than keeping it open.
3.  More distance being covered increases energy demands exponentially ( E ≈ 4/3 x π x distance^{3} ). Yes, that formula is intentional, because
4.  Portals act like two opposite points on the surface of a sphere, and traversing matter/information takes a random path between those points.
5.  The space between portals can be filled with anything you want, the portals don't care, they remain open, unless
6.  Another portal is opened up between the two existing ones.
7.  These sphere's are forcefully terminated when overlapping with another portal pair's sphere.
8.  Disruption of a sphere leads to currently traversing information/matter being semi-uniformly distributed on a molecular level across the sphere's real world coordinates.
9.  Traversal of portals takes no subjective time.
10. Assume energy cannot be generated ex nihilo this way, there's no harnessing of potential energy or other shenanigans.
11. Also assume that you can only traverse a portal at certain speeds or whatever physics would be necessary

Sure, if you can arrange it well you could dispose of all kinds of things this way, but what would this allow for on larger, geopolitical scales?
