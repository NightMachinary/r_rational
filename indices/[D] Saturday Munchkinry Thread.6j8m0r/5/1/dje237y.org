A few questions for clarification.

1. What is the absolute amount of energy needed to create and to sustain a pair of portals at a given distance? You have given the scaling, but not the absolute amounts. The economic usage depends on how difficult it would be to disrupt, and how easy it is to prevent disruption, which depend on the power requirements.

2. Rules 8 and 9 appear to be contradictory. If there is no travel time, how can any matter be "currently traversing"?

3. Can the spell be cast mechanically, or does it require a human to cast?

4. What is the size of the portal's opening? Can the size be varied? For a very large portal with a small distance between the endpoints, what would count as the endpoint on the sphere?

5. Do the portals require power/machinery on both sides, or only one? What happens if the generator powering the portal passes through the portal?
