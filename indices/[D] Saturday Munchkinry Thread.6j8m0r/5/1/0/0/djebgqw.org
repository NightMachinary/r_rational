Ah, got it. I had been thinking of portal usage as instantaneous, not subject to lightspeed delay.

I have mostly been assuming that knowledge of portal generation will eventually leak to all involved parties.

- Small portals are the way to maximize usage. By having a long series of short hops, you can pass the majority of your journal through portals, while minimizing the volume covered and power usage.

- Subway tunnels are about 10 meters in diameter, which would make the minimum hop be 10 meters in distance. This would be about 1 W of power per jump. With jumps placed every 20 meter, transit time would be reduced by a factor of 2, as half the distance would be covered by portals. For a subway system the size of New York City's, this would increase power usage by about 20 kW, a trivial increase on top of its ~500 MW current usage.

- Long-distance passenger travel remains unchanged, as planes cannot take advantage of this. A plane could project a portal in front of itself, but could not travel through it without disbursing the portal.

- Portable disruption of service would be trivial to do. A laptop battery could provide ~100 W for an hour. This would be enough to maintain a 450 meter portal, or to initiate a 100 meter portal. Carrying one into a subway, or even above a subway, would be enough to take it entirely out of service.

- Subway lines could protect themselves by having more portals than necessary. There are the portals that the subways travel through, and then there are also many small portals set up around the subway. These portals would re-initialize themselves over and over, so that any intruder portals would short-circuit these first, rather than the primary portals. If any of the security portals go down, the subway system is halted and an investigation begins.

- Further protection could be done by activating portals repeatedly. Each time the subway is going through a portal, activate the portal once to disable any other portals in the area, then activate it again to use. It would increase power usage, but would avoid disruption by non-sanctioned portals.

- Country level disruption wouldn't be possible. The largest power station, the Three Gorges Dam, outputs 22.5 GW. If that were used in its entirety to open a portal, it would only go about 60 km. No way to make a portal sphere encompassing the Earth to disrupt portals across the world.
