Initially I was most interested in the implications for intercontinental and interplanetary scales, but during this discussion I realised for what I was curious to explore, the slapdash formula was far too simple.

I had a scene in mind where there's an international organisation managing the various portals, but then the first major catastrophe strikes when an unsanctioned portal is opened and the the equivalent of the Hindenburg happens.

But for that to take place I needed the groundworks, which was the hole reason for this discussion. But I came out of it smarter than I went into, so there's that. Thanks for the feedback y'all :)
