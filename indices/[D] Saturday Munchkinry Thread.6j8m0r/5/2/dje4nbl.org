It would be a weapon that's stronger than a nuclear bomb, and practically unstoppable. Train up a team of portal mages, and now send them to infiltrate enemy cities. Open a pair of portals, dump lots of stuff inside, and now open an overlapping pair.

Portal gets disrupted, stuff inside reappears in the real world, overlapping with real world molecules and atoms and thus triggering a nuclear reaction. The city is wiped out, along with your suicide agents. Cities quickly learn to stop using electricity in fear of your suicide portal mages razing them to the ground.

Life across the planet reverts back to the steam era, and a steampunk world eventually develops with no usage of electricity whatsoever.
