I haven't seen the animatrix. But I've read the wiki page on what happened before the movies.

I've decided that the processing part is basically an unconscious hijack of the brain. Most of the time, the brain is processing what the Matrix wants it to process. (Bitcoin mining, anyone?) A small percentage of the time, the brain is processing virtual senses and making memories and doing what's natural. The consequence of this is that time in the Matrix is slower than it is in the real world. This also /might/ allow the possibility for someone, either by hacking or being the One or something, to realize how shitty the Matrix's framerate is and learn how to dodge bullets. Although that might require the passage of Matrix time to be like, .1% of realtime? So maybe, not dodge bullets, but at least dodge fists and other stuff. Even at 10% realtime, humans would live for hundreds if not thousands of real years, hooked up to the Matrix, and experience a 80 year lifetime. Also, after Neo's spent a few days in there trying to find the Oracle, when he comes out of it it's already Christmas.

Why is the Matrix a simulation of the 21st century and not losing your virginity with your soulmate 24/7? Either for historical purposes, or so they can torture those who didn't assist in creating the Machines. Or both.

Why are there humans outside of the Matrix? Because there was a malfunction, or a robot human sympathizer helped them out, or somebody found an exploit, broke the laws of physics, and managed to wake himself up before an AI detected his hacking and shut his brain down. Or maybe there's something else going on that I will come up with later that's more interesting than the whole The One fiasco for gorrilla glueing the issue of humans randomly waking up.

Oh and in my Matrix universe, the Machines darkened the sky. Which is cool for them, because they designed it to /actually capture all the solar energy for them/, instead of just darkening the Sun to kill everything.

That was hard. Maybe I should write a rational Terminator instead.
