What if the machines don't actually need humans, but include them as a part of their original utility function? Like someone builds an AI whose goal is to maximize the number of healthy humans while maximizing the normalcy of their lives. It might consider a "normal" life to be a 21st century one, and create lots of humans in tubs like the Matrix, and only run that normal life 1 outta every 100 ticks of the brain, the other 99% of the time being spent on its own calculations.
