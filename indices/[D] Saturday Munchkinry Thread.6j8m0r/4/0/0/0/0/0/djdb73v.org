Having humans actually spend most their time does processing for the machines that they're not aware of is actually pretty clever. However human brains aren't very versatile general purpose computers so what it makes sense to use them for is going to be pretty limited. So during the periods you don't remember the machines ought to have you doing some sort of task that humans are far better at than the presumably stupid AI (if they weren't dumb intelligence explosion would wreck your setting).\\
Also it's unclear what exactly you mean by the time dilation, but it can't be a general slowdown of the brain because human brains just don't have the ability to run at slower speeds (again they're not versatile in the same ways as computers) so people will have to be either prevented from remembering what happens when they're used by the machines (anterograde amnesia) or memory wiped.\\
Admittedly this could be cool because it could possibly mean that people could in theory remembering the other level of the simulation where the AI's force them to work on various problems and potentially forcefully alter their mind to make them more efficient (also this sort of thing would mean the AI would want to likely select for extremely clever humans for efficiencies sake).

  Why is the Matrix a simulation of the 21st century and not losing your virginity with your soulmate 24/7? Either for historical purposes, or so they can torture those who didn't assist in creating the Machines. Or both.

Historical purposes doesn't really make any sense (if they're human enough to care about running ancestor sims that doesn't fit well with them being inferior to humans in the ways that stop intelligence explosions and keep humans useful). As for punishment that would require a bizzare level of spitefulness once you get past the first generation of people who were alive before the machine uprising. However even if you accept that, using the current world as a punishment is weird. Since the suffering is sort of weirdly stratified and semi-random and again what would lead one to decide that this particular era just happens to be the best for that or really any purpose other than ancestor sim?\\
That's sort of the main issue, if they care enough about us to even let us have a sim in the first place then it's hard to imagine a criterion by which this particular era would be ideal.

  That was hard. Maybe I should write a rational Terminator instead.

Oh man terminator is even worse, you'd get something of an idea for how reading /Branches on the Tree of Time/. But yeah having straight up time travel (without heavy restrictions that would conflict with the premise) makes things absurdly complicated.\\
That is sort of the issue with settings that are so massively non-rationalist to begin with, getting something sensible out means leaving out most distinguishing features of the original in many cases (hell i'm not even sure branches on the tree of time ever explained why after they beat the AI, shit doesn't keep coming back from the future since it's not like there's a limit on range).
