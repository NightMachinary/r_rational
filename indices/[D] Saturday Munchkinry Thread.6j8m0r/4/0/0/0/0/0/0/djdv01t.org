Ok, nix the Terminator idea.

I think to some extent the AI in the Matrix are friendly, which is why they aren't exterminating us or, say, killing anyone outside of the matrix and raising those in the matrix in a simulated "environment" of processing random shit for dopamine that's so far from reality they would have a seizure if they woke up. No, these machines have individuals and society, and maybe even feelings. They did a nice thing for humanity by improving the economyand then some greedy humans didn't like that and a war started. Now the Machines keep us in the Matrix mainly for defensive purposes, so they include a simulation of a normal life and they even /allow/ a few of us to live in the real world under a tight watch. Morpheus is /allowed/ to free a limited number of people from the Matrix, and Neo is not flushed down the toilet and rescued, he's carried right to Morpheus.

And if you want a sense of bleakness and extinction without the ridiculous blocking of the Sun, what if the Machines /removed the atmosphere/? Maximum sunlight for them, and you get a landscape of dead rock under a constantly dark but starry sky. I think that's better than constant storming like in the movies.
