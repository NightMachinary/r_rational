  What's the range and latency?
#+end_quote

Exactly the same as if you were using your hand, so arm's length, and force can be exerted for as long as you can normally push something with your hand.

  Do animals nullify this?
#+end_quote

No, only humans.

  Do I get exhausted/do my muscles actually flex? Does working out my hands strengthen my powers?
#+end_quote

You would have to work out your telekinetic hand to strengthen it, and it strengthens/exhausts the same way as your normal hands. So you can't use a prosthetic since that just replaces your regular hands, not your telekinetic one.

  If some monk somewhere sits down and keeps meditating about my magic, do I lose my powers? How precisely does he need to identify my magic - is discussion of such a power on the in-universe Saturday Munchkinry Thread enough?
#+end_quote

Yes for the first one, if anyone so much as thinks you specifically are doing something supernatural, you stop being able to do anything supernatural until they stop thinking/believing it. The second one no, because they are just discussing the power, they don't think that you specifically have that power.

  There are no pain receptors inside the brain. Can I squish it?
#+end_quote

No, the point of all these defects is to make it almost impossible to prove to someone that you can do telekinesis. Your telekinetic force can't be directly applied on any sentient being, nor can it be used in ways that allow a sentient being to observe you using them. You can throw stuff at them while hidden, but the fact that your telekinetic force is as strong as your hand means people will just think you used your hand to throw the stuff. You can record it on camera, but then the fact that you can't do in front of them what you did on camera makes it really suspicious whether its a hoax. And even on the off-chance that you do convince someone, the very fact that they believe you have a supernatural ability prevents you from using your supernatural ability.
