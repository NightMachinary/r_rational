  but the benefit is range.

The range here is the same as your hand though, so arm's length is the limit.

  If someone has our telekinetic cornered in a dark alley. He doesn't have the opportinity to walk around the other side of his attacker, pick up a bottle and nail him in the back of the head with it.

This would also be hard to pull off, because of the range limit and the fact that if they so much as hear your bottle being picked up, that counts as ability detected and your supernatural power nullifies itself.

  He would be an amazing theif btw. Float small objects out to determine what security cameras can see.

  Physically turn those security cameras around from 'behind'.

  Blindly grasp and unlock doors from the inside.

  Give himself a helping hand to lift himself over ledges.. this one I'd test to the extreme. Find the limits of how far I can lift myself. Does my telekinesis get tired? How high can I lift myself? If i can lift my own body weight can I use it as a limited form of flight?

All great ideas O_O. Due to the range limitation, the second one might be hard, but still better than trying to do it using your actual hands. The third one seems pretty doable if you know how the door is locked, though maybe not for all doors.

And yes, you can totally lift yourself! Not others because of the detection rule, but yourself is totally doable! Well, assuming you can lift yourself with your own hands (like a pull-up), which is typically doable with training and keeping your body weight low. So yes, you can use it as a limited form of flight (limited because you do get exhausted from all the pulling-up, not to mention the balancing of your body weight would provide some interesting challenges).

That said, it seems like a pretty dangerous thing to do. After all, if someone so much as sees you floating in the sky, your ability self-nullifies, and you fall to your death x_x.
