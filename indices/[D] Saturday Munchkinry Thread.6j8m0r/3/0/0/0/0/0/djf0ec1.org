Yes he could do that with his hand, but the benefit is range. If someone has our telekinetic cornered in a dark alley. He doesn't have the opportinity to walk around the other side of his attacker, pick up a bottle and nail him in the back of the head with it.

Sneaky telekinises offers him a range of options he didn't have available before. Including picking up that gun just out of reach that nobody is watching.

He would be an amazing theif btw. Float small objects out to determine what security cameras can see.

Physically turn those security cameras around from 'behind'.

Blindly grasp and unlock doors from the inside.

Give himself a helping hand to lift himself over ledges.. this one I'd test to the extreme. Find the limits of how far I can lift myself. Does my telekinesis get tired? How high can I lift myself? If i can lift my own body weight can I use it as a limited form of flight?

Telekinises is one of the most versatile superpowers out there.
