You have gained the supernatural ability to move objects with your mind, a.k.a. telekinesis. The accuracy/strength/dexterity/sensitivity/etc. of your telekinesis is exactly the same as if you are using your hand to move objects.

However! This ability is defective: it nullifies itself whenever someone else detects it. So if someone sees you levitating stuff, that stuff stops levitating. If someone hears you telekinetically bashing an object against the wall, your telekinetic grip on that object is released. If someone feels you telekinetically trying to move them, that telekinetic force is dispelled. If someone so much as thinks "Hey you're doing magic!" your telekinetic magic is immediately nullified (until they stop thinking it).

How do you exploit this ability?
