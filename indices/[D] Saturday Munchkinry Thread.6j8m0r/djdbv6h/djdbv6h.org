Munchkin this: You have a pocket computer, a magical device that shrinks a 1980s supercomputer into a tiny thin square.

Somehow, the basic operation of it -- acquiring and running and interacting with computer programs -- is easy and known to you. The programs on it can magically talk to pocket computers that other people have. Your total computational power and storage is bounded at, lets say, something like 1.5 Gflops and 24Gb of storage, give or take an order of magnitude. There are databases of common facts accessible by it.

How do you end up /thinking better/? Ignore all the easy everyday ways it'd make life simpler. How does having this with you help /you/ level up and do better at life? What can you /calculate/ that will lead you to better outcomes?

Edit: I also asked in the Friday off-topic thread (it's off the topic of writing/stories, at least) and have [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6j1r84/d_friday_offtopic_thread/djg9h6u/][reported some preliminary results]].

I also found a few words that better describe the problem: how can you use the pocket computer as a /mental prosthesis/? How does a supercomputer always in your pocket help as a mind-extension tool? If there are habits of thought that help you win, which habits of device-usage would help in the same way?
