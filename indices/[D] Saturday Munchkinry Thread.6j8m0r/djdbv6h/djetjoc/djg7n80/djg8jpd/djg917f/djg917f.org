You're right that spacial/position sensors are a huge advantage of cellphones, enabling kinds of usege that you just can't do with a desktop. I'll go add 'never get lost' or 'certainty of current location' to my list of current advantages that it gives me, which /is/ actually an improvement over a paper map or a map on my desktop computer.

But I was thinking along the lines of having that computing power available /in the moment/.

The idea is this: if there are habits of thought that help you win, are there habits of device-usage that would help in the same way? A tool you always have on you can become a mental prosthetic to a greater degree than a bulky machine stored at home.
