Hmmm. Always available, yes, but /using/ it often takes attention - you have to look at the screen and tap at it - which means that most uses are things that you need at least a quiet moment for.

An exception to that is when the phone interacts with you audibly ("In. Five hundred metres. Turn. Left.") which doesn't steal too much attention away from most tasks. Perhaps this can be leveraged to have the phone act as a kind of limited PA ("Taking current traffic unto account. To reach your. Dental. Appointment. On time. You should leave. Within the next. Fifteen. Minutes.").

Basically a schedule manager.
