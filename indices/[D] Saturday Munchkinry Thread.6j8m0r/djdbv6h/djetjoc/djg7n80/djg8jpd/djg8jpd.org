  You can definitely research malaria charities and experts, on your phone. But you can also research malaria charities from a library or a desktop computer... not much is gained by having a /pocket/ computer on you constantly. For long term planning in general, desktops and libraries dominate cellphones.

Ah. Hmmm. If you're looking for ways in which the portable nature of such a device dominates... I think that applications that make use of the GPS will be the most useful. (Efficient route planning, at the very least). Otherwise, applications that make use of real-time anywhere data updates in some manner?
