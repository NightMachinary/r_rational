Yep, but the idea is to go beyond funny cat videos and extra-huge emoji, and into life-hacks and rationality assistance apps. If I get ideas that I like that don't exist, I might use them as an excuse to get back into Android app dev.

An idea I see in transhumanism is that person + neural interface + computer can be smarter and win more and generally be better. How close to that can we get with person + low-bandwidth visual/touch interface + computer? What code would you have to run?
