I'm curious, what happens if you correctly identify every murderer, until you are the only one left alive despite not having murdered anyone? Are you then free to go?

Also, what happens if someone physically prevents me from entering the dormitory? Would I then be forced to sleep outside and get punished for breaking rule #3?
