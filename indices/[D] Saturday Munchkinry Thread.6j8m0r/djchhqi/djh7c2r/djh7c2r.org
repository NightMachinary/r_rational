I can think of three classes of scenarios describing how you end up in this situation. The first is that you are unexpectedly kidnapped by the crazy person running this and they appear to be running things with conventional technology. The second is that you are unexpectedly forced into this situation by an apparently supernatural force. In both of these cases you do not have a strong reason to believe that the rules that are handed to you will actually be followed by Monokuma. That rule #7 is explicitly written to allow Monokuma to change the rules only gives more reason to not expect them to be obeyed by Monokuma. In particular, although within the rules of the game rule #10 is the only way to escape alive, there is no way for you to witness somebody else successfully apply it. Attempting to take advantage of it yourself is a big risk with a small chance of success, so I don't recommend it.

Instead, I believe the best option is simply to try and survive, wait to be rescued, and covertly seek opportunities to escape. Unless I underestimate how much peoples' character changes in extreme situations, I don't expect anybody to murder anybody else for years, and you have a decent chance of living out the rest of your natural lifespan, during which time there are lots of chances of new development: Monokuma changing the rules in cruel and arbitrary ways, being rescued, someone discovering a way to escape.

The third scenario for how you end up in this situation is that some world developments lead to you recognize situations analogous this one as things that actually happen from time to time and to become confident that in situations like this the rules will actually be followed as stated. In that case the same evidence that convinces you the rules will be followed should also give useful information on what to expect to happen in this sort of situation. More details on this evidence is necessary to give advice.
