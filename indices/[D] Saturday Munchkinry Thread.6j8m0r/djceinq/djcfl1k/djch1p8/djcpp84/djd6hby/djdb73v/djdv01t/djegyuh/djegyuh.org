I think the main way you'll need to run this isn't that the human brains are being used as pure processing but rather as fuzzy logic simulators. to a species with limited creativity this is very useful, people are fed details and information about disparate fields and they 'dream' about what happens or run simulations during 'sleep time' which is why we have such bizarre dreams sometimes that so quickly fade away.
