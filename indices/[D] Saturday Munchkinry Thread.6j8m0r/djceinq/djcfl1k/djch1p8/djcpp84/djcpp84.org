Using humans for processing has its own problems, especially if the humans need to be basically unaffected and not become suspicious of the matrix.\\
You could potentially grow your own custom neural material, but using existing humans to do computing for you, without them knowing or being any worse for the wear is rather implausible.\\
Of course the whole matrix premise in general is based on the implausible idea that human minds would somehow be able to reject a paradise simulation (if you're considering a fanfic I assume you've seen the animatrix) and you'd really need to bend over backwards to come up with reasons for them to keep unwitting humans in an ancestor simulation.
