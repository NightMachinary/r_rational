  does fire burn?
#+end_quote

It would feel as though you are sticking your hand in a fire, so it would hurt a lot. But since your telekinetic hand isn't made of carbon like your real hand, it won't actually burn. So it would just feel as if you are touching something extremely hot. Very painful, but as long as you can endure the pain, yes you can use telekinesis to hurl globs of burning material around.

  Do I leave fingerprints?
#+end_quote

Huh. I actually didn't think of this one. I'll say yes, but the fingerprints won't match your physical hands, since it's a different "hand" that's doing the telekinesis.

  Can I drive in a nail while manually wielding a hammer?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure I understand this question. If you're asking if you can hold a hammer in your real hand and then telekinetically manifest a telekinetic hammer to drive in a nail, the answer is no. If you want to hammer nails with telekinesis, you have to pick up a hammer with your telekinetic hand and use it.
