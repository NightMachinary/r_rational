  You could still hurt someone by accelerating an object from behind and releasing it from your telekinesis before it hits them so that it just keeps going on pure intertia.

Couldn't you just do that with your hand though? Your telekinetic hand isn't any stronger than your real hand, so you could just run and throw stuff with your actual physical hand.

  (unless I'm manipulating tiny stuff)

The dexterity of your telekinetic hand won't be any better than your real hands, so if you can't manipulate tiny stuff with your real hands, your telekinetic hands also won't be able to.
