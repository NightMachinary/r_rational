There are three things that this pocket computer can do for me.

It can /run calculations/.

It can /access information/.

It can /talk to other people's computers/.

The only real issue, then, is proper indexing and defining goals. Let us say, for example, that I have Goal X (say, um... "eradicate malaria"). Then, I want to find a way to accomplish Goal X. Now, ideally, I should have access to a number of pre-determined plans for accomplishing a variety of X's, in some publicly accessible database. However, for some X's (such as "eradicate malaria") there is no pre-determined plan because it has not been done before. In this case, if I wish to accomplish my goal, I need to talk to a relevant expert. Can my pocket computer find and identify an expert in malaria eradication, ideally one who would be willing to help in such an endeavour?
