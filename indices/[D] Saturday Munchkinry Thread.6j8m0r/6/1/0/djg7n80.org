I think so far we're doing better at info and communications than calculation. Then again, maybe those are just more available - I can tell when my phone has put me in contact with someone or stored data for me, but the math behind animating and drawing the interface, or using the radios, is less visible.

You can definitely research malaria charities and experts, on your phone. But you can also research malaria charities from a library or a desktop computer... not much is gained by having a /pocket/ computer on you constantly. For long term planning in general, desktops and libraries dominate cellphones.

A online database of strategies for common tasks could be helpful. (WikiHow?) I'll take a look and see what I can find and/or think about making and running it myself.

Alternatively, a real expert-finding app for networking might be helpful (LinkedIn?).

Still, that feels like offloading my thinking to others (which can be good, but slightly misses the point of the exercise) rather than the phone helping me think better. How could it help you achieve expertise, if no one had ever looked at malaria before?

I'm confused and I need to find better words for this. I don't think I'm communicating the concept I have very well. Some of my confusion is in the word 'thinking' -- if I break things down into memory, communication, research, understanding, planning, calculating, and awareness of time, then it becomes obvious that it actually is helpful.

Other mental tasks, like analysis (rootclaim?), imagination, decision, empathy, creation, it seems less helpful.
