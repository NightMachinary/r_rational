I'm a bit confused by your point - how would someone being an "expert in ai" make them more (or less) qualified to talk about philosophical goals?

I largely didn't see any unreasonable jumps of logic in what he was saying, even being someone who by default likely believes what he's dismissing. Narrative analysis is a valid form of analysis, and it seems hard to argue that transhumanism isn't "stories of how you want the future to be".
