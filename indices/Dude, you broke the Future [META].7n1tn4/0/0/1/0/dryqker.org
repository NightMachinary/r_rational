Depends on what the analysis itself is, and what parts of real life you're discussing. Humans think and communicate in stories, and transhumanism seems very much to be "stories about how we should want our future to go".

The rest of his talk doesn't seem to be relying on narrative analysis to discuss other real life events, unless I missed something obvious. However, with three distinct people seeming to lean that way, I'm wondering if there is a bias that I have that's stopping me from seeing something.
