I think it may well be an easier problem. Developing a bona fide artificial intelligence involves first figuring out what intelligence /is/, and that's a very hard problem.

Brain uploading merely involves some sort of scanner significantly better than any scanner we can currently create and some sort of simulation software on a computer that's extremely powerful by today's standards. The actual AI /itself/ is then merely copied directly. It won't be easy, but I think it will be less hard than developing true AI.
