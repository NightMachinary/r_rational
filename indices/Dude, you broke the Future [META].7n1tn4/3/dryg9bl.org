There is something interesting about the speed of things in regard to best practices. We've written a lot of code this year, that is likely going to be replaced rather than rewritten, because tech moves forward, which means all the time we've spent on doing it right, so it'll be easy to get into in five years, is essentially wasted.

Not that we're going to abandon best practices, because you never know, but it's somewhat hilarious to think about how much effort we've wasted doing something right that no one will ever notice.
