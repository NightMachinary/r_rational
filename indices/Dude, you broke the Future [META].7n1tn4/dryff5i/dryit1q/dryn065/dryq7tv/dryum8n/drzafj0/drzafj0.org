I actually think there's some merit to the "companies as slow AI" view. Companies /are/ slow AI. The key word there, however, is "slow". Companies behave exactly how you'd expect unaligned AGIs to behave, except much more slowly. One thing that AGIs do is self-improve--that is to say, they /create more intelligent versions of themselves/. And in fact, companies do this /all the time/--they're constantly augmenting their capabilities using machine learning techniques. The reason they haven't turned the Earth into computronium yet isn't because they're not "Unfriendly AI"--it's because they're /slow/ Unfriendly AI. The idea that some unsuspecting entrepreneur will one day create a company that creates a genuine, bona-fide artificial superintelligence that converts the planet into computronium is completely consistent with the view that the company /itself/ was a nascent superintelligence--one that eventually self-improved to the point where it destroyed the world. This is, of course, not a reason to worry /less/ about AI alignment, but to worry /more/.
