btw, this guy is a science fiction author and not an artificial intelligence expert, and he's making arguments based on narrative rather than on actual reason and evidence. I don't know if the quality of his reasoning improves at all later in the video, I stopped watching during his ignorant spiel about how transhumanism is (in his opinion) a religion. Was very disappointing.
