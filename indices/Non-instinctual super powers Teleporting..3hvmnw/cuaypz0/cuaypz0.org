  Is there a rational way to proceed other than "Hahaha. Nooope. Not touching the big red mind button."

I mean ... if this is just something you /know/ then you're probably just insane. So first, don't touch it, second, go talk to a shrink (and if you can figure out a way to do it on a budget, go get an MRI to see whether there's anything suspect in your brain).

That aside, put it in terms of risk and reward. At what value of =x= would you risk an =x=% chance of death in order to have the ability to teleport? That I think you can figure out without having to know how the power works at all. Once you've figured it out, you have to start working out what you might pessimistically imagine the risk of death to /actually/ be, in order to see whether it's greater or less than =x=.
