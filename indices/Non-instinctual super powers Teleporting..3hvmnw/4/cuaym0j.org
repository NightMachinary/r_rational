Contact James Randi. Explain the nature of the ability (What you posted here). Set up an experiment, with the stipulation that in the event of your death, the resulting million will go to your next of kin.

Learn the GPS coordinates for the area you will attempt to teleport to. Learn the information you will need to account for the earths rotation, movement through space, ect. Acquire a functional space suit. Make your first teleport to the Lagrange point of a large planetary body, not the Earth due to satellites, by considering every aspect of the location you can. Return to the earth, and back to space, eliminating aspects one at a time until you have the minimum amount of information you need to safely teleport.

Assuming this goes well, you have a teleport power, and know how to use it.
