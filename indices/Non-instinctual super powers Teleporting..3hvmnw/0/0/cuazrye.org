Question: would a human body appearing in a space filled with air result in dangerous thermonuclear fusion? The space between particles is fairly large, and I feel that it would be unlikely that any two nuclei will appear in the same location (or at least in appreciable quantities; you might be exposed to some internal radiation, but not enough to harm you)

Although I'm pretty sure that if you survive, you'll suffer from the bends pretty quickly. Survivable, but painful.
