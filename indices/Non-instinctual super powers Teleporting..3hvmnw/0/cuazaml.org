Let's play a game. You are the GM. I am the player of the teleporting character.

Question 0: *How* exactly do I know this? Am I granted a powerful irrational conviction which I cannot dissuade despite my objective lack of evidence in favor of accepting it, or has some evidence been planted, or does it retroactively seem like it was always sufficiently evidenced to accept? How has my mind been altered from the previous state when I did not know I could teleport? You used the word know, not believe, and this suggests I already have the means to demonstrate to others that I can teleport, even before I actually try it. While dwelling on that, let's get to work.

Test 1: I need a vacuum chamber, a high speed camera, and a space suit. I will wear the suit with the intent of taking it with me. I attempt to teleport to the same position I am currently standing. This test is an attempt to determine null movement costs and baseline lag. I want to know if this causes me to be tired, I want to know if I am gone for any particular duration of time. I sincerely hope that I do not arrive before I depart, but if I'm going to retroactive telefrag into myself and die it's better to have that known and to die that way to start with rather than die the far more horrific way of telefragging into atmosphere and suffering partial thermonuclear embolisms. If I arrive after I depart, then it is instead important to reduce the risk of telefragging rather than trying to maximize it. That's what the vacuum chamber is for. I don't want air to suck into the place where I was and be waiting for me when I come back. That's why I'm also trying to take the suit with me. If I can't take the suit with me, and also I don't displace air, then this power is only useful for committing painful suicide, and I'm going to arrive again fused with the air and suffering, and being in a vacuum chamber allows me the quick self-kill escape again. But! Let's be a little optimistic for our very first test, and see if I give off any strange radiations, have any lag when teleporting to my own location, or what have you. So, I'm going to strongly imagine an intent to depart with the suit and its air, to arrive immediately, in the same position, orientation, location, and reference frame as I hold now, and... I push the button. GM, results?
