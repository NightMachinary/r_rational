Question: How much teleports with you? You're assuming the suit comes with you, and that may or may not be the case.

- Is it all matter within a certain distance from your skin? Careful you don't take chunks of the wall with you when you go.

- All solid objects that contact your skin? Handy if you want to move enormous boulders. Kind of inconvenient that pockets don't work.

- All objects that you expected would teleport with you? Handy if you can manipulate your expectations.

- The closest solid objects to your skin, up to a maximum total weight, disregarding objects over that weight? You may end up leaving behind an overly heavy spacesuit, or unintentionally bringing along small objects near your feet.
