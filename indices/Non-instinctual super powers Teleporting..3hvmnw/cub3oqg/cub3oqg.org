Honestly? Either I'm wrong, and it does nothing, or I'm /right/, and this is risky but incredibly valuable.

I'd try to visualise a spot in the same room, keeping in mind the velocities involved just in case it uses one of those silly "the Earth is /really/ going at a zillion miles per hour, sooo..." rules.

If it works, great. If something goes horribly wrong, well, I'll almost certainly die unless I can guess /correctly/ in the next few seconds - but honestly, what kind of mysterious power-granting force /does/ that? And if nothing happens, well ... I'll try a few obvious methods of providing "co-ordinates", then conclude I was just imagining things and never speak of it again.

TL;DR: the risk strikes me as more than worth it.
