#+begin_quote
  You're assuming the suit comes with you,
#+end_quote

I didn't actually assume that. I planned for both outcomes, and strongly hoped it would come with me, and tried to will it so in case that's how the power works.

#+begin_quote
  All solid objects that contact your skin? Handy if you want to move enormous boulders. Kind of inconvenient that pockets don't work.
#+end_quote

Subject for future tests.

#+begin_quote
  All objects that you expected would teleport with you? Handy if you can manipulate your expectations.
#+end_quote

I can manipulate my expectations if I know the actual results are based on my expectations. Voluntary muscle movements are primarily a sufficiently strong expectation that your muscles will move a particular way.

#+begin_quote
  The closest solid objects to your skin, up to a maximum total weight, disregarding objects over that weight? You may end up leaving behind an overly heavy spacesuit, or unintentionally bringing along small objects near your feet.
#+end_quote

These are things my first test will hopefully tell me a little bit about. But my first test is a careful attempt to find out if my power is safe to use at all without telefragging myself into air. This is about as safe as I can make it since I can't survive vacuum without the suit.
