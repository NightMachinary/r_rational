  Question: would a human body appearing in a space filled with air result in dangerous thermonuclear fusion?

You are correct. I mis-spoke, and have edited my comment. It is fission that results, not fusion. When atoms of my body appear in locations too close to atoms of air for the position to be viable, the nuclei repel as if they were daughter products of a fission reaction. Air is mostly empty space - as is my body - but it's specific and important amounts of empty space. I do not want to be denser than my normal body mass by an amount of air that would fill my volume at STP. That would cause very bad things which would make me wish for death.
