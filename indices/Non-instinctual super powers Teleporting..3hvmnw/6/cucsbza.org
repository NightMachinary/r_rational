Test it, once, in the safest and most verifiable manner you can think up. Unapologist gives a decent enough example of that, though I'd be leery of showing up naked in vaccum. Then find some scientists and have them point every detector they have at you at the cost of small royalties on any tech derived from knowledge your abilities and some upfront moolah. The utility to humanity of discovering and figuring out teleportation cannot be overstated. Hell, even if that turns out to be infeasible, there's got to be something useful or applicable we can learn from it.
