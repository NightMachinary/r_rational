Although I /did/ like the opening Turing Test, it's a bit tropy to have the test-giver /already/ be disbelieving of the AI being capable of "aliveness". But, I also really, /really/ liked your take on it: the AI straight-up being like, "no, and I don't want to be, and I don't like what's happening." That sent a chill down my spine.

I definitely like your prose; your sentences have a good cadence to them, and the MC's internal monologue is giving a real sense of the character. However, your written dialogue (and some other bits) - "ugh", "you're here early", and "School was exhausting" are told, but not really shown. To me they're lacking the depth of the rest... which the next two paragraphs in particular do very well.

  I seemed to be in a shuttle, which led me to believe him.

Skipped a bit there. Why does he think he's on a shuttle? (But then you go right back to excellent depth).

(I go sleep now, rest tomorrow. But know that I do think this is real good, and I'm excited to see where you take it!)
