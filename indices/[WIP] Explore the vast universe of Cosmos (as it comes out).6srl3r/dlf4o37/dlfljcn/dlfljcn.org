Thanks! As for the tell-not-show, this is a problem I struggle with often. It's difficult to tell how much detail gives the reader a good sense of what's happening, since I already have the picture in my head. I'm not sure if I'm going to go back and edit what I already have, but I'll at least keep that in mind for the future.

To answer your question, he thinks he's on a shuttle mainly because the room he's in is round and metallic. I probably should have made that clearer.

On a side note, tropes honestly don't bother me very much if they're handled well. Pretty much every character, arc, setting, plot, etc. that can be written has been written at this point. As long as everything is believable and entertaining, it doesn't really matter if it fits a stereotype. I'd rather write something good that fits my original idea than go out of my way to create something that defies tropes but isn't good.
