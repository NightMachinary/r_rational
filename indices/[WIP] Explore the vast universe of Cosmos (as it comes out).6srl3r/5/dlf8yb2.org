I swiveled my head around, staring at the door, petrified. It slid open. Two carts were wheeled through, one containing what looked like two large speakers and the other with four heavy duty tripod construction lights. The cart pushers started setting the speakers up in both corners of the room in front of me and surrounding me with the four lights. The lights were placed less than a foot away from each side of me. Cords ran from all the appliances, which were plugged into a powerstrip that connected to the wall outlet.

I couldn't help myself.
