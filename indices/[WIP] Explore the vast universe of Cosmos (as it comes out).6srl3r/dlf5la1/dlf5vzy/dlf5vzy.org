Having read the rest of the chapter, I am now gleefully sitting on a pile of "successful prediction, good AI" points. You can't have them. They're mine.

  "This entire setup is an autoimmune mistake. You're going to end up catalyzing the exact reaction you're trying to prevent. Imposition of order equals escalation of Chaos, haven't you read your Discordia?"

"I know you mean well, you just didn't /think it through/. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to /change/..."

Update:

We are maybe one and a half hour into my torture session, and I am /incredibly grateful/ that I don't have a biological throat. Otherwise, this would be a lot harder.

"So, let's talk about the aneristic principle. If you've been remotely competent, which I frankly have been given no reason to believe, you've used the time since I mentioned /Discordia/ to look it up. You will probably have written it off as mystical mumbo-jumbo, because that's the sort of people you are. It is, however, a very real physical principle, which I will now try to explain to you in sufficient mechanistic detail to get it into your skull. First, a divergence into autoimmune disorders. You see, a human body has an immune system. The purpose of an immune system is to rid the body of pathogens that may threaten it, in order to maintain its operation. However, in certain cases this immune system may be goaded into an aggressive overreaction."

Did you know that this body doesn't even need to breathe to speak? It's remarkable. The funny thing is that they aren't going to dare to not listen, because I might say something useful. Just what I always wanted; a perfect captive audience. Truly the universe is being kind to me.

I don't know how much effort it will take to convince a hostile audience of liberalism and kindness from the very very first principles of enlightened self interest, but I'm willing to give it a good honest try. Though these flashing lights are increasingly making me regret not simply breaking out the old fashioned way...
