I can't give any spoilers away about the universe because I think it's best revealed slowly over time. I'm not counting these two sentences in the 300 characters, obviously.

Humanoid A.I. is pulled out of prolonged simulation into a vast new universe. The Inter-Planetary Coalition, along with the rest of the tri-sys, is afraid of him. He is forced to become a fugitive in order to survive, accumulating allies and foes alike in his adventures. If he even /wants/ to survive.
