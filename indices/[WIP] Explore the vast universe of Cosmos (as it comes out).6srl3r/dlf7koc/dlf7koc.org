  By the time we contact our stations at wherever they happen to arrive, they could be halfway around the planet or headed to another planet entirely. If we know where they're headed, however, we can contact the destination ahead of time and intercept them. This is what's best for your friend and society. I know you were probably told some very contrary things, but I trust that you'll make the right decision and give us this information. So, Sam, where are they taking her?‚Äù

I stare at the man like he's slow. "Come on. You can't be this stupid. You don't need me to tell you where they're taking her."

The man sighs.

"A sun chosen at random, along with enough resources to bootstrap an industrial base and go exponential."

"No shit."

It's what I would do.
