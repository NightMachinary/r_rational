Ah, Lighting up the Dark. Such a good story, shame it seems to have died.

Perhaps one day I might write something half as good. Ah, but at least soon I shall have my characters out and about doing missions and facing the harsh and unpredictable world. All this cheeriness and humour is the last thing I expected to write.

Edit: Hopefully I can manage the transition without descending into grimderp.
