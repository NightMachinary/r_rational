It's on the cards as a strong possibility. The largest problems are getting all the information across without leaving traces. Letters have scent. Messengers have short memories, which necessitates many messengers being sent to get all the information across. The more messengers, the higher the chance that a briefing will be interrupted or a detail missed leading to capture.

The solution to the problem - as with so many things - lies with shadow clones. That, and defeating Akatsuki has a rather large risk of Pain just deciding to level Konoha before Naruto is ready to beat him up.
