Presumably to avoid T&I. I like konoha, but not that much. Canon already has a "good end" so if you fix the uchiha massacre/rebellion you're pretty much golden.

I had a fanfic planned (now scrapped) where the SI would try to inform the homage about the uchiha massacre, but their communication got intercepted by orochimaru, who took the oportinity to grab some sharingan and become the end boss.
