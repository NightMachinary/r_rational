Finally sucked it up and made an account after lurking here for two years.

1. I miss Game by God. Has anybody read anything like it, not counting the other incomplete story the author did? (Does anyone know how the author of that is doing, also? I know they said they were going through addiction stuff.)

2. Are there any good scary rational stories?
