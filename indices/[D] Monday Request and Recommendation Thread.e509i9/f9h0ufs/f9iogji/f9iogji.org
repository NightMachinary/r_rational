[[http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/girl-intercorrupted/][A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero?!]] (warning: link has first four chapters free, full story costs 99 cents) by Eliezer Yudkowsky isn't /exclusively focused/ on dealing with the devil, but doing so comprises one of several major plot threads, and is executed in a very interesting way. There's some interesting supporting worldbuilding around demonic social structures and around the methods people developed to get maximally-good deals with summoned demons, and those bits of worldbuilding collide with the rest of the plot in a beautiful, if hard-to-summarize-without-spoilers, fashion.

(As an aside, while I have the impression my stance is somewhat unpopular, as far as I'm concerned Girl Corrupted is straight-up EY's best story. It manages to do some /really impressive/ weaving of plot threads in such a way as to have the eventual resolution be on the one hand a Dramatic Surprise but on the other hand easy to recognize in retrospect as the inevitable well-foreshadowed outcome of everything that came before, with a degree of neat everything-sliding-into-place-ness that overshadows that in any of his other stories. Plus highly-entertaining prose on a moment-to-moment level.)
