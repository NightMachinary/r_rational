In order of most worth checking out to least worth checking out:

​

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][Delve]] is a litrpg about a dude from Earth waking up the middle of a forest in another world. He quickly ends up in a town so there's no "random dude trying to survive in the wilderness for 20 chapters" arc thankfully, but has to learn the language from scratch and the early chapters are him trying to eke out a living in a fantasy world killing slimes in the sewers and such. Later on he finds some friends and actively works on a party-friendly build rather than the litrpg standard of broken bullshit solo-only god build. The story gets crunchy, with the MC actively scribbling down tables to work out the most efficient distributions of mana/metamagic multipliers, which the fact that the average dude he's encountered doesn't do that (partially because their number system has no concept of zero makes it difficult) is kinda anti-rational arguably, but you could counter it with the lack of general schooling and education in the world. The overall story is quite enjoyable (I joined the author's patreon, which is $2.50 a month for 6 chapters ahead of everyone iirc) and also updates twice a week, Thursdays and Sundays at the same time (although he skipped one update around Thanksgiving due to "personal stuff" then released a double-length chapter where shit hit the fan last Sunday). It's almost 70 chapters long and has a bit over a book worth of writing if I had to take a stab at length.

​

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]] is about a bio-weapon escaping a lab and trying to blend into and understand human society. Except the human society is America ~100 years from now when a small chunk of the population either has super powers or were horribly mutated as a result of highly stressful situations and some convenient viruses. World-building is interesting, there's some well-done humor in there, updates are decently sized and happen a few times a month. You could easily argue some of the actions of the side-characters and how accepting they are of the MC are not rational, but in the greater scheme of "the world is fucking weird now" it's not too out there. It feels like it's still on "book 1" in that the first major antagonist/mystery/"whatever you call someone frankensteining mutant/human body parts onto giant rats is" is going on, but there's quite a bit of set up before that so it's over the length of a standard novel as is. There's 37 chapters currently, but the author has a haphazard update schedule. The novel started a year ago and churned out updates multiple times a month, then went to an update a month for ~8 months, but recently updated 4 times in the past month, so the author might be back in the swing of things.

​

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22115/i-dont-want-to-be-the-hive-queen][Hive Queen]] is your standard Isekai start, except the dude gets turned into a humanoid-sized/shaped insect queen and dumped in a forest by his new "parent" all alone. Takes a bit to get going but is certainly original in some of the world-building aspects. 48 chapters long so far, updates slowed down to around twice a month after starting a year ago. Feels like it's still on "book 1" even if length wise it's crossed that margin due to the first big antagonist (goblin army) being dealt with right now, akin to the previously listed novel.

​

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20364/chimera][Chimera]] is also decent but on some sort of hiatus/iffy update schedule. Plot is a mix between Hive Queen and Super Minion (partial isekai of protag into alien monster/body/consciousness/world-view).
