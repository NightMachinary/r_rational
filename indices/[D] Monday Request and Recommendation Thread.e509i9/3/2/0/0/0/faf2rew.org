Generally anytime that Hazou has had a serious reversal has prompted rounds of debates about both "what went wrong" and "this is the QM's fault" in varying degrees - in roughly chronological order the killbox incident, the mission with Minami, a couple of times during the Mist Chunin Exams and most recently after the disastrous talk about getting Orochimaru to kill the Hokage. I'm sure there are others that aren't springing to mind now.

I'm impressed with the QM's resilience and ability to keep the thread open through the storms we've had so far.
