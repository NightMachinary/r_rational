Marked for Death, a rational Naruto quest is fantastic. It's run on SV. Choices matter, and plot armor doesn't exist.

The voting system is also interesting. Most quests give you several options during each update, MfD has completely open ended voting. We're encouraged to keep votes under 400 words for an xp bonus, but that's it.

Our character is talented, upper 3/4, but not S tier. Everything we have we've gotten through exploiting in game systems, which is explocitly encouraged.

"If you can break the setting in a way that conceivably hasn't been done before you got here it will be allowed."

We've already done it once, and are always looking for more people to join the hivemind to help us do it again.
