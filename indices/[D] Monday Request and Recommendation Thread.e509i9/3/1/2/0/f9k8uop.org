I meant that the quest hasn't reached a point where crits are 'mandatory.' for instance, in the latest update the mc's low assassination roll still succeeded because of her competence and the lower counter-roll. I've seen quests that would interpret that as an inconclusive clash and roll again

Ck2 quests (which typically employ modified d100) will often reach a point where cirts stop being exceptional results and start being just successes, or where cirts are so expected that players will plan for them (ie AGG: CORE).
