I'm going to recommend [[https://thralls.weebly.com/novel-index.html][The Loyal Ones.]] It's a serialized biopunk story about a slave in an england-ish nation fighting against the hordes of a faction I don't understand yet. Solid writing and worldbuilding so far, and the author has accompanying art pieces that are pretty great.

I'm also going to semi-recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][Delve]]. Solidly written LitRPG. Falls prey to basically all the stuff I don't like about LitRPGs, but it well written despite it.

Finally, I'm going to re-reccomend the webcomic [[https://www.poppy-opossum.com/comic/poppy-8-page-34/][Poppy]] which is about funny animals in a magical world. Also, occasionally, it gets anime as fuck, with fight scenes I could almost swear are animated. Unfortunately on hiatus, but the existing content is more than worth reading.
