  and while lucky rolls happen, the story isn't dependent on them.

What do you mean by that? Because I can remember many dice rolls which, had they gone differently, would have resulted in a very different quest from that moment on. Granted, the most obvious of those were /un/lucky rolls, but one could pretty much take any difficult/risky situation we breezed through and see how a less lucky result would have had serious consequences. Especially some of the ones that just used a D6 to look at crazy results following from crazy actions.
