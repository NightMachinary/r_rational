In addition to the other quests already mentioned here:

Active/Complete:

- Divided Loyalties: A warhammer fantasy ck2 quest from the PV of a spymistress and shadow wizard. Great sense of progression, and while lucky rolls happen, the story isn't dependent on them.
- A Destiny of Strife: A bleach inspired hollow quest. Features a protagonist with a penchant for dramatic speeches, implausible adventures, and honestly really solid characterization all around.
- Where Nightmares Fear To Tread: A silly/fluffy quest where you play as an eldritch embodiment of fear protecting a little girl. World-building is good, but the update structure makes non-archival reading somewhat dull.
- Even Further Beyond: I can't recommend this enough. The prose is fantastic, the world- and magic-building is top-notch, and the narrative and character arc are great. You have a giant xianxia empire in the same world as Tolkien elves and 3.5e wizards, with the protagonist as the destined evil overlord whose predestined death will mark the end of the age of cultivation. Its complete and only about 3 pages in reader mode.

Incomplete:

- Seeing Red: Naruto SI, but far from the only one in the setting. Good world-building, very hype, but mc get overpowered very fast. Still manages to create tension despite that
- White Collar Cultivator: Some guy from earth get kidnapped and press-ganged into an +evil+ cultivation bureaucracy. Fortunately, the benefits are great, and a modicum of skill with office politics can be extremely rewarding.
