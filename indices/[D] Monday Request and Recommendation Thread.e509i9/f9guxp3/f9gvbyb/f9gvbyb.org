To start off with, I'd recommend [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny by yrsillar]]. It is a Xianxia style story that dodges most of the common pitfalls. While the protagonist is clearly talented, she isn't the strongest person ever, who effortlessly brushes aside the arrogant young masters. The story is well paced, carefully thought out, with gradual but meaningful power growth.
