Some of my favourites have already been listed here, but I'm going to throw in After The End, a Dragonball quest that takes place after Dragon Ball Z/Super. After Goku and Vegeta died of old age, a mysterious foe came to Earth to fight the Z-Fighters... and killed them all. The last of the Saiyan's descendants fled to an isolated corner of the galaxy, to live in fear of this Enemy, hiding what they are, hoping to never been found.

Centuries later, we start with Kakara Goku, heir to House Goku - one of the extremely few who are allowed to reach the pinnacle of strength - at least, of what is deemed safe from detection... Super Saiyan.
