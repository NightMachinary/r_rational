[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/reader/?page=4][I woke up as a dungeon, now what]] is a worm/dungeon isekai. High quality prose, until recently frequently updated.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/reader][Sins of Cinnamon, NSFW]] alternate game system universe/pseude time travel shennanigans? High quality prose, for now on hold until author finishes their same universe world building quest [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-days-of-thyme.9683/][days of Thyme]] which is also currently very slow at updating.

My endorsement quote is: "Reality strains to remain backwards compatible to you." which without in-story context would be such a sick burn and kinda the better version of "ok, boomer". In-universe its even better.
