Other than the already-mentioned /Forge of Destiny/, currently my favorite is the Warhammer Fantasy quest [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/warhammer-fantasy-divided-loyalties-an-advisors-quest.44838/][*Divided Loyalties: An Advisor's Quest*]]. You play Mathilde Weber, a Journeywoman shadow mage of the Empire, shoved into the position of Spymaster for a newly chosen Elector Count of Stirland by a mysterious conspiracy.

Just about everything about this quest is top notch, it's so damn fun. The world is rich, the characters are well-developed, and the writing leaves little to be desired. Catching up before the end of our current mini-arc will allow you to experience Mathilde's Bullshit in its entirety.
