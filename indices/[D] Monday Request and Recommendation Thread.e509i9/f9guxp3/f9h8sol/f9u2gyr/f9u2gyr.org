As someone who's been lurking Marked for Death since the beginning, I can second this recommendation. The portrayal of characters and a living world is excellent, and it's a good rational take on the Naruto setting. There are chapters that have given me the wrenching feels or urge to exultantly shout "Yes!" at the page that I'd normally only expect from genuinely brilliantly written novels.

That said, it also consistently throws up issues about exactly how is the best way to run a quest - how much agency should the PC's characterisation have vs how strictly should the voted plan be followed? After a few things like the Youthsuit Incident, it seems to have settled into a reasonable compromise.

It remains a more socially-exhausting environment than I want to interact with for fun, due to the fierceness of debate and occasional salt levels, so I'm still going to be sticking to lurking and maybe occasionally voting for the foreseeable.
