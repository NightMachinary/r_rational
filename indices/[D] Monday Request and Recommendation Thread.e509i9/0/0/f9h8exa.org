I can recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/two-steps-forward-one-step-back-worm-au.568306/][Two steps forward, one step back]] (Worm fanfic), or, if you're in the mood for something more... abstract, the game [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/683320/GRIS/][Gris]].

Neither of those have the psychological aspect, though. Maybe [[https://www.parahumans.net/about/][Ward]]? A good part of the story follows a group therapy team.
