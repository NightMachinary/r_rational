[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][Hear the Silence]] is one of my most favorite fanfics ever. It's a precanon Naruto SI that focuses on how even though the SI is something of a prodigy, the entire world is still incredibly traumatic to her and every ninja, and the fic does a great job of dealing with trauma. She's strong, but she's far from overpowered like most SIs, and power balance is done very well. The majority of the characters are original, being precanon, and the author does a lovely job of making me care for them.

I read /tons/ of SIs, and this might be my favorite one. I highly recommend it. It's the only Hurt/Recovery fic I've ever read that's been done well, or at least, I've not read any that are nearly this good.

I love this fic.
