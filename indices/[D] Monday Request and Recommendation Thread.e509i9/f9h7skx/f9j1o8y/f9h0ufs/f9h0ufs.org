Are there any rational deals with the devil plots or stories? I just listened to the short but excellent "The Details" podcast where the Devil tries to make a deal with an intelligent and logical man so he can do a job for him. The man acts like a normal person would, asking important questions, clarifying things like language, and the price is not for his soul. With a very interesting twist ending that makes me sad, there is no sequel to it.

I'm really interested in seeing if there are other such stories where the characters are intelligent enough to look for half-truths, clarify things, and make sure they don't make a stupid deal.
