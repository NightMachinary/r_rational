*[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/][Polyhistor Academy]]* over on QQ, following a first-year student in a magical academy where students are encouraged to murder one another in order to graduate. Does a great job of keeping the stakes high and in managing its three separate magic systems. The first thread pre-dates the threadmark system, so you'll need to navigate by clicking through from one post to the next. Currently in the middle of Year 2, with mistakes from first year coming home to roost and things not looking great for surviving through to the end.

If you enjoyed Worm, I'd at least take a look at *[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/18xcEYRK0Ts-k6--ZOuDFh-ILK9hLzcgkDTIf6L_G90s/mobilebasic][PRT Quest]]*. Written by Wildbow himself, the players took on the role of a new PRT director in Anchorage, Alaska.

*[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]]*. Definitely NSFW, surprisingly deep.

The aforementioned *Forge/Threads of Destiny* and *Marked For Death* are also great. A special mention goes to the Avatar: The Last Airbender quest *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/deep-red-avatar-the-last-airbender.50358/][Deep Red]]* for convincingly managing to get the Questers to railroad /themselves/ into the canon storyline through their wishy-washy interactions with Zuko's family.
