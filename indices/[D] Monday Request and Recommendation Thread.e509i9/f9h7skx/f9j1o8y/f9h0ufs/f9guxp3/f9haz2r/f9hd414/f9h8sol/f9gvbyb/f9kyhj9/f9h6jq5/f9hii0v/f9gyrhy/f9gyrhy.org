Now You Feel Like Number None [Bleach Arrancar Quest] on sufficient velocity as it greatly expands the lore, is very well written, the choices matter, and for once the main character while growing stronger is limited by design to never become powerful enough to wreck the setting as she has hard limits on how strong she can grow. She changes the plot by forming connections with others, fostering rebellion in a believable way, and helping other characters grow stronger instead.
