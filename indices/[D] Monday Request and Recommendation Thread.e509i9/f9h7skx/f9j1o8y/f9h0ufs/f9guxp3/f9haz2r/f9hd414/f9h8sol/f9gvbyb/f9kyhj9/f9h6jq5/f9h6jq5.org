I enjoy All Night Laundry. Time travel, plots, time traveling plots. The actual questing part is pretty much over, as the author is wrapping it up and tieing off the last loose threads.

Note: The bar at the top of the page shows your farthest read comic, and a link to reset that. There are several time loops that actually alter previous pages, and the first few chapters have all been corrupted by paradox. So if it's all "i SEV ?wbbpu :AQ O!Yt" just press the reset button to clear that up.
