LitRPGs almost invariably use their game system as numbers-go-up wish fulfilment, rather than having them actually add anything to the story. Usually the video game veneer ends up being nothing mora than an excuse for the author to not think up a consistent magic system. I actually tend to enjoy exceptions to that rule, like Log Horizon (my favorite anime),.
