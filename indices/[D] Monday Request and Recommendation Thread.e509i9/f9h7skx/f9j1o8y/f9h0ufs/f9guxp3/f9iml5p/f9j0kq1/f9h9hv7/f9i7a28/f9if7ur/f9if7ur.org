There's a quite entertaining WWII self-insert as the guy in charge of RAF Bomber Command, Sir Arthur Harris: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/and-they-shall-reap-the-whirlwind-ww2-insert.547249/][And They Shall Reap The Whirlwind]].

I really enjoyed reading it, it's written by a historian that specializes in this very specific field, RAF Bomber Command in WWII, so it's very detailed and feels plausible. I wouldn't call it rational by any means, and some bits are a little weird, but overall it's mostly great. I was hooked for the entirety of it. Not finished, but it gets very far.
