If you can isolate what it was about Isekai Speedrun that you found enjoyable you might get more recommendations, but off the top of my head I can't think of anything that "feels" like it. That story was a very odd duck.

Edit: actually after thinking about it I realized that Isekai Speedrun is, in a lot of ways, similar to a Doctor Who episode - except from within the Doctor's perspective, where you can see the mad improvisation based on meta-knowledge as it happens. From that perspective I'm pretty sure I can recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy][Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy]], though I don't remember finishing it and also it updates fairly slowly.
