Have you gotten into Neal Stephenson? I like Diamond Age a lot, but people seem to enjoy Anathem. Cryptonomicon is starting to feel like a product of its time but it's also a great doorstop read. If you like cyberpunk a la William Gibson, you could also kick back to Snow Crash, though it's substantially different from most else he's written.
