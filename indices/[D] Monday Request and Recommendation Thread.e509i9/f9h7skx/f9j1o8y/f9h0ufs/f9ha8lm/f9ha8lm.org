There was a short story posted a while ago where a guy tries to make a deal with a devil (really, he's making a whole series of deals) in a society where such things are routine and systematized but he is breaking the rules. Can't remember the title, but it has an interesting take on the whole thing. Hopefully someone else will remember the title and post it.
