The character has clear goals and acts consistently with those goals, and any mistakes he makes are reasonable mistakes s person might make and not carrying the idiot ball for the sake of the plot. Is he scared? Yes, but that's a normal human response in that situation.

I would also argue that he really didn't panic at all. As for "better ways", I think he did pretty ok. He tried a bunch of things and got confirmation (such that it was) before he took the step of selling his soul.

But remember, rational fiction is not the same as rationalist fiction, and while this /might/ be borderline on the second (I personally would count it), it's DEFINITELY the first.
