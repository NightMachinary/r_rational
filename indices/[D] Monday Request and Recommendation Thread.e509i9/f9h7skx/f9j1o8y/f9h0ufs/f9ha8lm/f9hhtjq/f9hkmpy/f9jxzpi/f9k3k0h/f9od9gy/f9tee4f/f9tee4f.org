That was surprisingly compelling, or maybe I'm just a terrible gatekeeper. I've only read this twice; I haven't even interacted with a demon directly, and already I'm inclined to sell my soul.

My interpretation is that selling my soul acts similar to saying "I wish to emigrate to Equestria upon my death", thereby enabling entry to a virtual reality called "Hell" after death. The superpowers is just a bonus.

In this case I think it aligns with a common trope in rational fiction: immortality in reality is good; immortality via being an upload is not bad either.

Remind me to never try to box an AI... in fact, I should never even read transcripts of AI box experiments.
