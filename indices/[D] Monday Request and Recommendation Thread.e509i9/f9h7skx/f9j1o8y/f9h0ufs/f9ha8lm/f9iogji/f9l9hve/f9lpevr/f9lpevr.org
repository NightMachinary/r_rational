I haven't yet read Trust in God (I'm waiting until I get around to consuming the source material first), but I don't think Sword of Good really does the thing? It has plenty of foreshadowing, but it doesn't have the same sense of /inevitability/ to it that Girl Corrupted's ending has.

Some comparisons (spoilers for Sword of Good and Girl Corrupted): The Lord of Dark being Good is information new to the readers at the time of its revelation, whereas the Wicked Emperor being non-wicked can be inferred by paying attention to the setting. Hirou killing Dolf is a choice which could easily have gone the other way, whereas Yuuki summoning Satan is essentially inevitable from the moment she's put in position to summon a demon of her choosing. Et cetera. Girl Corrupted's ending /does/ have components which lack that sort of inevitability and just have foreshadowing of the same sort that Sword of Good's ending has (e.g. the manner in which Yuuki befriends Satan), but it also has many components which /have/ that sort of inevitability, and it's /that/ which really makes the story as good as it is as far as I'm concerned.

(Of all of EY's stories that I've read (which is... I think all of his original ones, plus many (but not all) of his fanfics), the only other one I can recall offhand which really has some of the same sort of thing is HPMOR, with the reveal of where all of Harry's weird intuitions about the wizarding world come from; but it's much less central to the plot's structure in HPMOR than it is in Girl Corrupted.)
