  It manages to do some really impressive weaving of plot threads in such a way as to have the eventual resolution be on the one hand a Dramatic Surprise but on the other hand easy to recognize in retrospect as the inevitable well-foreshadowed outcome of everything that came before, with a degree of neat everything-sliding-into-place-ness that overshadows that in any of his other stories.
