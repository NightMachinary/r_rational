I greatly enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593][Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach]], which was [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/e1h8gc/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/f8p9tp4/][recommended last week]] by [[/u/Juansson]]. It's Good Omens fanfiction that follows Crowley's therapist as he works to recover from the traumatic events of the book/show.

What are other (good) works of fiction, nonfiction, or even fanfiction that focus on recovery after trauma?
