I also second this.

And [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27872/confessions-of-the-magpie-wizard][Confessions of the Magpie Wizard]] I feel is higher quality than usual but isn't rational to my understanding.

It's about a modern day world that got invaded by (from what I understand) Christian devils and with them comes humanity's ability to use magic. The story is told through the lens of a devil spy far in the future looking back at his past. He infiltrated a Japanese magic academy.

World building wise it's interesting as multiple human counties fell at the start of the invasion. Magic wasn't a thing until the devils invaded and the two sides (humanity and devils) have an incomplete understanding of each other. The devils seem to have invaded at least another world before and that gave them the minions and animals they use. Last thing would be it isn't finished and has 22 chapters posted as of now.
