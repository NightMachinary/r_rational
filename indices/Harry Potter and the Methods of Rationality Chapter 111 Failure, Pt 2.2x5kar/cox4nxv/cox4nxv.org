Still reeling from the loss of Dumbledore honestly. That's a masterful chess move if I ever seen one. The definition of playing the game "one level higher than you do".

I really want to see what Voldemort's end game for Harry is. He's seemingly investing a lot (although I guess, on his scale, a unicorn, a murder, a troll and a 5 minute ritual isn't THAT much) in Harry's well being here. Even accounting for the prophecy here. In addition, I feel like prophecies play the game at level zero anyway. As in, I feel they're invulnerable to the sort of direct manipulation Riddle (both of them) favors.
