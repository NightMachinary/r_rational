Those other languages are spoken, not signed. So the pouch needs to have both a microphone equivalent /and/ motion detection equivalent, unless it's directly inferring intent regardless of how the communication takes place.

As a real world example, Siri understands commands in ~10 languages, but none of them are sign languages, for obvious reasons - they require vastly different technologies. (It wouldn't be impossible by any means for an iPhone to understand sign language, but it is a very different problem set.)
