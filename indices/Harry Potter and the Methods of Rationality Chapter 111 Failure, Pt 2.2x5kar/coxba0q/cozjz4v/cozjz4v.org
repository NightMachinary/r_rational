I think that Voldemort isn't killing Harry because he wants an enemy that is challenging to him, even if Harry isn't there yet. He's not willing to risk his own death for that though. If Harry ends up being a current threat, Voldemort will kill him.

I think Voldemort recognizes the need in himself for a challenge. He's a grandmaster chess player who lives amongst masters at best. He wants to live forever, but living forever would be extremely boring without something interesting to do. I suspect that if Voldemort were to kill Harry, he'd simply raise him again.

There's also the mention of a prophesy, which Voldemort doesn't seem to want to interfere with.

*EDIT* Corrected spelling of Voldemort. Odd. For some reason I've never realized I spelled it wrong.
