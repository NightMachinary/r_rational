No. Magically moving dirt doesn't actually make the dirt magically in anyway. This way Voldemort can block Harry's spells without his magic 'touching' Harry's magic in any way. It's why he reacted so quickly too. Voldemort was already prepared to block a spell or some non-magical projectile (I thought Harry had tranquilizer darts, I mean where did he even get a gun from? The Weasly twins?).
