So uh, why /didn't/ he kill Harry, then? Why is he able to parseltongue-promise to kill him if he tries anything (indicating that killing him couldn't be /that/ bad) yet has not already killed him?

Maybe killing Harry is no use, maybe he just gets transferred to another Horcrux since he shares a "soul" with Riddle? (Riddle fixed the whole continuity issue, right?)
