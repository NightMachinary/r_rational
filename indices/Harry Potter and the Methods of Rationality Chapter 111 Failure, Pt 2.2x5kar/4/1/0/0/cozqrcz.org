Voldemort went as far as trying to teach an entire class of students to fight intelligently. I don't see it as entirely impossible that he wants those students to be well-led. The more I think about it, the more it seems to me that Voldemort is creating either an enemy worth having, or shaping Harry, Hermione, and some other students to make a prophesy valid.
