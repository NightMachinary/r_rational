I'm a huge fan of Anathem --- but the Concent is built on Rationalist principles and the main character is just a passive observer who follows the rationalist characters around as they deliver their speeches.

In many ways it's good --- because Lio is the “dumb innocent jock” who is unafraid to ask world building or plot driving questions. He does work well with others and the text is philosophical and touches on different forms of thought as an explicit plot-device to win... so that's pretty cool too.
