I really enjoyed Anathem. The fact that it was a YA novel strapped to the side of a Spec Fic novel enhanced my enjoyment rather than took away from it.

It was pretty much a throwaway line, but I found the Technie Sammann's dialogue on "Bogons" to be very insightful and applicable to the modern internet and disinformation.

  “Early in the Reticulum---thousands of years ago---it became almost useless because it was cluttered with faulty, obsolete, or downright misleading information,” Sammann said.

  “Crap, you once called it,” I reminded him.

  “Yes---a technical term. So crap filtering became important. Businesses were built around it. Some of those businesses came up with a clever plan to make more money: they poisoned the well. They began to put crap on the Reticulum deliberately, forcing people to use their products to filter that crap back out. They created syndevs whose sole purpose was to spew crap into the Reticulum. But it had to be good crap.”

  “What is good crap?” Arsibalt asked in a politely incredulous tone.

  “Well, bad crap would be an unformatted document consisting of random letters. Good crap would be a beautifully typeset, well-written document that contained a hundred correct, verifiable sentences and one that was subtly false. It's a lot harder to generate good crap. At first they had to hire humans to churn it out. They mostly did it by taking legitimate documents and inserting errors---swapping one name for another, say. But it didn't really take off until the military got interested.”

  “As a tactic for planting misinformation in the enemy's reticules, you mean,” Osa said. “This I know about. You are referring to the Artificial Inanity programs of the mid--First Millennium A.R.”

  “Exactly!” Sammann said. “Artificial Inanity systems of enormous sophistication and power were built for exactly the purpose Fraa Osa has mentioned. In no time at all, the praxis leaked to the commercial sector and spread to the Rampant Orphan Botnet Ecologies. Never mind. The point is that there was a sort of Dark Age on the Reticulum that lasted until my Ita forerunners were able to bring matters in hand.”

  “So, are Artificial Inanity systems still active in the Rampant Orphan Botnet Ecologies?” asked Arsibalt, utterly fascinated.

  “The ROBE evolved into something totally different early in the Second Millennium,” Sammann said dismissively.

  “What did it evolve into?” Jesry asked.

  “No one is sure,” Sammann said. “We only get hints when it finds ways to physically instantiate itself, which, fortunately, does not happen that often. But we digress. The functionality of Artificial Inanity still exists. You might say that those Ita who brought the Ret out of the Dark Age could only defeat it by co-opting it. So, to make a long story short, for every legitimate document floating around on the Reticulum, there are hundreds or thousands of bogus versions---bogons, as we call them.”

  “The only way to preserve the integrity of the defenses is to subject them to unceasing assault,” Osa said, and any idiot could guess he was quoting some old Vale aphorism.

  “Yes,” Sammann said, “and it works so well that, most of the time, the users of the Reticulum don't know it's there. Just as you are not aware of the millions of germs trying and failing to attack your body every moment of every day. However, the recent events, and the stresses posed by the Antiswarm, appear to have introduced the low-level bug that I spoke of.”
