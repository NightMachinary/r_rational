Honestly, I found Reamde to be utterly forgettable. As in, when I got a copy of Fall from my sister, I had literally forgotten everything about the plot of Reamde. I had to read the Wikipedia synopsis to refresh me.

I thoroughly enjoy watching Stephenson's thought processes play out on a page when he goes on rambling. But for a spy / hostage thriller? Meh. I'll just pick up the nearest book with Tom Clancy's name on it.
