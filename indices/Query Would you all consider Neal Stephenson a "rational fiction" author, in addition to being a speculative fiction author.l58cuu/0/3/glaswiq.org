I think you're being too harsh on Seveneves. Addressing your main gripes in particular:

1. The survival of the people on the surface I don't remember enough to comment, but I do recall thinking that the survival of Dinah's relatives was an extreme stretch. I don't recall them saying that they used geothermal, however, and the very existence of the submarine people indicate that not all water on Earth got boiled away either. That they could survive the hellscape deep in the Marianas trench implies that even if 99% of the oceans were boiled away, somewhere there are still locations where temperatures were survivable and usable.
2. I can confidently state that you missed the point with the lunar colony. They didn't bootstrap themselves back in one generation with only seven people, none of which who have the background. They survived and multiplied with the old stockpiles of material for generations before they were able to bootstrap anything back up. Seven people didn't bootstrap their civilization back. Seven people bred more people who bred more people and did all the bare minimum things needed to survive before they got back to where they got to. It was five thousand years after all!

It also makes damn sense that their culture ended up echoing the modern world once again, because they were in the extremely unique position of recovering from a fall where *all the records of the past civilization, especially media and science, were available to them in digital format*. We can't rebuild the civilization of Stonehenge because we don't know how the people of Stonehenge lived; by contrast, these people literally had to survive off our records and our media for countless generations. Even then, you can notice how it's not at all identical; there are plenty of subtle differences and a few glaringly obvious ones like actual races.

Finally, yes, it is a plot point in the last half of the book that their genetic engineering really did break something human in each of them. Each of the new races were caricaturized because the allied races knew they could depend on each other to make up for the other's oversight or weaknesses.

I don't believe the last third of Seveneves was at all an example of good writing (actually it was pretty atrocious), but as worldbuilding and ideas? I think you missed many points.
