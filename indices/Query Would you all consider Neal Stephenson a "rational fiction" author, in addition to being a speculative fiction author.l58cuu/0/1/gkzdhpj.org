Nitpick: geothermal power requires a temperature gradient which is typically achieved because it's hotter down deeper but it doesn't need to be this way. If the surface were thousands or hundreds of degrees, you could make power by pumping that heat into comparatively cooler depths. After all, unless you're living near a volcanically active zone or near a fault-line or something, you actually need to dig quite deep before it gets hot
