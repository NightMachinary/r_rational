" Oh, random droid escape with the plans to the great weapon just seconds ahead of the evil lord? OK, cool story. Oh, those droid are salvaged by the hidden son of the evil lord on this random planet? That's a stretch. Oh, those droids were built by the evil lord when he was a child? Oh, that son was never found by his evil lord father despite having the same last name and living with his immediate relatives? For fuck's sake, that doesn't make any sense. "
