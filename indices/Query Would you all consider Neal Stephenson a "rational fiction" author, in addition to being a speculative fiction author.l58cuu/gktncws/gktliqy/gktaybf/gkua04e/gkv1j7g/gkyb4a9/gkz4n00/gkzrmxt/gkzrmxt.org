I mean, if we're calling it rational fiction, surely there should be a rational character involved somewhere? Like the sidebar says, intelligent and creative characters (none of the above characters manage both), clear motives for character decision-making (Fang and Dr. X manage this; nobody else really does), intellectual payoff (definitely not), a focus on the processes of thought (generally only the case with Nell, who thinks in narrative logic) and thoughtful world building (some of it checks out, but there's also a lot of nonsense). Call it five main plot threads and give every thread a point for each criteria that thread meets and we're looking at maybe 6/25, if we're feeling generous about the world building.
