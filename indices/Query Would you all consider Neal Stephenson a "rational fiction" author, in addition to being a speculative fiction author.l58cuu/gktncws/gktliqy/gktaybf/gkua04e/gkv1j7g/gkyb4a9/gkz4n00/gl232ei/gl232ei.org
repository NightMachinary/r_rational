  Finkle-McGraw, who admits that his high status is the result of mere epistemic luck, and whose 'solution' to a perceived lack of pluck and grit in his society is to proliferate *dangerous and untested forms of nanotechnology* in the hopes that the resulting chaos will be character building?

Are you talking about the Primer, or the Seed?

I don't think the Seed is Finkle-McGraw's idea. It's presented, in-universe, as being the Celestial Kingdom's hypothetical counterpart to the Feed. It shows up in the Primer because that's what Hackworth is working with among the Dreamers.

The Primer isn't a "dangerous and untested form of nanotechnology." It's a storybook. One with an agenda, which can intelligently and reactively change its plot, and which is acted out by actual people, but a book.

  Nell, who is literally raised by a book,

If you think that Nell was raised by a book, I think you missed the point. Nell was raised by Miranda, *via* the book.

  which raises her to consider all authority figures so useless that she'd rather attack a grown man several times her size with a knife than try telling an adult who could help her

I think the "consider authority figures untrustworthy/useless" is more an artefact of her biological mother than the Primer. Although I suppose that the Primer was designed to teach them to be subversive, so, maybe?

  John, who was a nanotech engineer instrumental to the implementation of both of the above schemes, but who decided all the same that he could get away with stealing from his boss, since the only security nanotech worth considering is clearly the stuff he personally implemented.

The wellbeing of your children is a hell of a motivator. He was given a (to his mind) once-in-a-lifetime chance to make his daughter's life better than it otherwise would have been, to give her an education that rivalled only one other person in the world. It's not irrational to take what would otherwise be a stupid risk, if the payoff to that risk is a huge furtherance towards achieving your goals.

  Miranda, Moore and Carl, respectively Nell's mother, father and cool uncle figures, who collectively love her and want her to grow into a healthy young woman, but who see no reason to consider the appropriateness of the seemingly unique superstimulus media which she religiously consumes?

There are a whole lot of people who communicate via Facebook, despite [[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/12/10/fast-facts-on-americans-views-about-social-media-as-facebook-faces-legal-challenge/][most people thinking social media has too much power and has a mostly-negative impact on the US]], because it's [[https://www.consumerreports.org/social-media/what-do-you-think-of-facebook-now-survey/][how they stay connected with the people they love]].

The Primer is the *only* way that Miranda can stay in touch with the girl she's been raising as a daughter for years. Carl isn't really much of a character in Nell's story, so I don't know why you're bringing him up. Constable Moore, you maybe have a point about (especially given that he's part of the Dovetail community).

I'm not going to dispute your characterizations of X and Fang, because I can't remember them all that well.
