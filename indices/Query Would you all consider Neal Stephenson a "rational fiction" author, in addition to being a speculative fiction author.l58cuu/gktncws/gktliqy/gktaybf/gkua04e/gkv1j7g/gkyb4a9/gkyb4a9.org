I don't follow this. The book opens up with a guy getting a gun implanted into his cranium (a premise so ludicrous that I almost set the book down then and there) and it only got more absurd as it went on. Who exactly are we supposed to be looking toward as a rational character?

Finkle-McGraw, who admits that his high status is the result of mere epistemic luck, and whose 'solution' to a perceived lack of pluck and grit in his society is to proliferate dangerous and untested forms of nanotechnology in the hopes that the resulting chaos will be character building?

Nell, who is literally raised by a book, one which tells her how to use martial arts and program Turing machines, but which raises her to consider all authority figures so useless that she'd rather attack a grown man several times her size with a knife than try telling an adult who could help her?

John, who was a nanotech engineer instrumental to the implementation of both of the above schemes, but who decided all the same that he could get away with stealing from his boss, since the only security nanotech worth considering is clearly the stuff he personally implemented. Nobody else can be clever!

Dr. X, who strives toward a noble goal and never does anything directly foolish, but whose entire MO is to wait for useful tools to come to him, rather than applying his skills to seeking them out or developing them directly? Fang, who follows largely the same arc, simply with moral causes instead?

Miranda, Moore and Carl, respectively Nell's mother, father and cool uncle figures, who collectively love her and want her to grow into a healthy young woman, but who see no reason to consider the appropriateness of the seemingly unique superstimulus media which she religiously consumes?

Everyone in this book seems tailor-made to embody some stereotypical vice of rationalists, rather than being a role model directly.
