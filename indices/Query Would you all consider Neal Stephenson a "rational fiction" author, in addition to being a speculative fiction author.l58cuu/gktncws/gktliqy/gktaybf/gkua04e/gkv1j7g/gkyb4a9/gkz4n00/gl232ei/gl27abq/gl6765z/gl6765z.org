Great, now I actually have to pick up my copy and find out the specifics of what you're talking about.

#+begin_quote
  Finkle-McGraw sends Hackworth to help the Dreamers develop it
#+end_quote

I'm not doing a thorough re-read, but from skimming through various Hackworth chapters, I'm *pretty* sure that's Dr. X.

#+begin_quote
  seemingly sets up Nell to help see it released into the wider world
#+end_quote

I think that Hackworth did that under his own initiative (he is, after all, the King Coyote in Nell's Primer); having solved the problem, he had to entrust it to someone, and he didn't want to give it to Dr. X, who had commissioned it from him, so he hid it in the Primer as the Book of the Seed in King Coyote's library.

Which, yeah, that's a questionable choice, but given that Dr. X said that the Celestial Kingdom would figure out the secret in another decade or so, I'm reminded of some people's belief that the only/best way to prevent an unfriendly AI from coming into existence is for a friendly AI to happen first. If someone is going to have that technology, shouldn't it be someone trustworthy?

Again, I'm not exactly sure how Hackworth determined Nell would be a trustworthy person to hold that secret, so YMMV as to how rational that is.

  It leaves her with a seemingly pathological inability to reach out to authority figures, even benevolent ones.
#+end_quote

I don't know; she doesn't seem to have an issue reaching out to Miss Matheson or Constable Moore. A blind *trust* of authority figures would seem to be an even worse idea than a blind *distrust* of them.

  I'm objecting to a man who we are supposed to take as one of the better nanotech engineers in his phyle being totally unaware of the nanotech-based law enforcement tools which result in him getting caught pretty much immediately after stealing the book. The aerostats weren't even a secret - random children knew enough about how the system worked to successfully subvert it. It is deeply weird that he got caught like that.
#+end_quote

He didn't. The mites were flushed out of his system by the immune system of the New Atlantis Clave; that's as far as they could track him. He got caught because he had his name written on the inside of his hat. Which suggests to me that he didn't expect to be accosted (and if he hadn't been, he wouldn't have been tagged by the mites, either: the assault is what triggered the aerostats to release the mites).

Although I'll concede that criming while wearing monogrammed clothing, especially that which can be easily lost, is its own brand of stupid.

  Consider the scene where Nell stabs her pedophile stepfather. Miranda is horrified that Nell was molested (good! she should be!), but seemingly fails to notice that the Primer has been neglecting to teach Nell about Stranger Danger in favour of encouraging her toward martial arts training and half-baked ambush attempts.
#+end_quote

You keep going back to this as an example of how the book failed her, but I just don't see it. She lives in a lawless part of town, with a neglectful mother and her series of abusive boyfriends. To what authority should it be directing her? When her father died, the authorities said the following about Nell:

#+begin_quote
  "Who will save her?" Miss Pao said. "We have the power to punish; we are not given the power to raise children."
#+end_quote

The authorities are not willing to take her away from her mother, and her mother is not willing to stop bringing home abusive boyfriends. What other escape was there for her? What adults were around for her to trust?

Yes, I'm willing to admit that having a girl result to violent self-defense and escape was a less-than-ideal solution to abuse. But, given where she lived, who she lived with, and the authorities' unwillingness to protect her, I'm not really seeing a better one.

When she actually gets to a place with trustworthy adults (again, Moore and Matheson), the Primer doesn't seem to in any way direct her away from them.
