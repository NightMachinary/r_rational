Hell no. I've read a fair amount of Neal Stephenson and while there are some entertaining aspects, there are some infuriating ones.He's got generally good ideas then just blows them to shreds. Read Cryptonomicon and Anathem then stop there.

Fall; or, Dodge in Hell (kind of sequel to Reamde) had a couple great elements, but 3/4 was just so boring. I would have read a whole book about the road trip through Red country and the Purdah system, but instead all those trees wasted.

Most fiction relies on zero or one weird things (aka coincidences) to happen to be entertaining. The more you get than one, the more it's clearly the author putting his thumb on the scale. Oh, random droid escape with the plans to the great weapon just seconds ahead of the evil lord? OK, cool story. Oh, those droid are salvaged by the hidden son of the evil lord on this random planet? That's a stretch. Oh, those droids were built by the evil lord when he was a child? Oh, that son was never found by his evil lord father despite having the same last name and living with his immediate relatives? For fuck's sake, that doesn't make any sense.

SevenEves was just absurd...They never address who destroyed the moon. If it was a highly unlikely random event, ok, weird coincidence that that happens now when the world has just enough capacity to survive. Then Part Three of Seveneves made me throw up in my mouth. The evolution was dumb of all three groups was just dumb. That they remembered each other's ancestors from 5,000 years ago? GTFO.

Reamde was pretty dumb. Oh, you do some shady stuff and get wrapped up in a Russian mob's mission to find the hackers? Ok, cool reason for a story. Oh, your mission to find the evil hackers means you choose a random door that accidentally results in you attacking Muslim terrorists? Dumb plot turns galore.
