Of which they have even more stockpiled. As they mentioned time and time again, they originally sent up enough of the core chips to last a colony of a thousand for virtually centuries; these chips are amongst the few things that would not get eaten up by the descent into cannibalism either, and can be trivially salvaged if need be (although I recall virtually all of them were stored in the ISS anyways). In fact, this is one of those things which is valuable enough and lightweight enough for them to have sent them up in absurd bulk quantities, which they explicitly did, and then went out of their way to jealously guard from radiation.

The author thought about this. Half the book was spent dealing with this exact problem. It was one of the reasons they needed the ISS and the asteroid so much; why there was a schism in the first place.

I find it plausible that by the time they actually run out of relevant electronics, they'd have enough warm bodies to misuse in their place instead.

Their robotics, especially as of the future society state, are absurdly advanced though. They explicitly say that their future society is less advanced in integrated circuits, but more advanced in robotics somehow. I don't think that computes.
