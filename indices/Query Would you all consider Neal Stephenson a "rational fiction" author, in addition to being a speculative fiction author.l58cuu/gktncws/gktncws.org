Maybe in some of his earlier works, particularly the Diamond Age, he was fairly successful at presenting rational characters in a well-designed world.

More recently, Stephenson fakes "rational" characters by putting anachronistic 20th/21st century people into past or future contexts. That was kind of the whole schtick of the Baroque cycle, I forget where I dropped that one mid-book because I couldn't deal wit the Swiss Family Robinson-ness of it all. But SevenEves was kind of the bottom for me. The first part was entertaining Kerbal Space Program fanfic, but everything after the landing in the gap was completely plot driven impossible fantasy.

There is no way any of the groups of "survivors" would have survived.

- Thermodynamics would doom the Earthbound groups (for example, you can't extract power from geothermal sources when the atmosphere is as hot as the upper mantle).
- And the lunar colony? There is no way they could have bootstrapped to the point of building new chips for their magic robots with seven people, none of whom have the background knowledge, and an already declining stock of robots.

And then the new society, thousands of years in the future, is basically 2000s Earth, except with a financial center in probably the most dangerous location in their society, but somehow nobody has thought of colonizing the rest of the solar system outside cislunar space. Perhaps the genetic engineering broke something in them, and froze them in a perpetual New England.
