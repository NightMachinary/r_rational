For the first generations, they actually have a considerable proportion of the supply meant for over a thousand people from the other habs which broke down. They even addressed food, whereby the ISS-icehab combo managed to preserve the vast majority of its stored food supply. Similarly, they do have basic fabrication, oxygenation, and food production, from the algae farms amongst other things. The most plausible fate normally would have been a slow, agonizing death for the colony as they run into a lack of A or B and slowly wither away, but survival isn't provably impossible. They domed over the ravine early on, giving future, less capable generations time to follow routine and do the basic minimum needed to expand and survive.

Taking several steps back, however, some of your declarations are simply hyperbole. We know they have oxygen production (I recall they had an immense supply of scrubbers, amongst other things), and they have packaged food meant to sustain hundreds of people for years if not decades (the other half of the convoy was the one that ran out and fell into cannibalism). Split amongst the seven of them, this changes things. They don't have minimal supplies. They have minimal supplies for one thousand people. They have all the supplies and then some for just seven.

The 'unlikely to survive until the first generation can take over' screams is only true when we consider that they are stuck living in zero G. This first generation need merely eat packaged food and crap around and do nothing to live out their natural lives, and even the next generation can do much of the same.

My point is, you missed almost all the details and points with the lunar colony, and are portraying its survival in an unfair light. It's not necessarily plausible long-term, but short term? 10-30 years? We have a very different story. Chances are, your negativity towards that part of the story blinded you from even looking for the details the author put in which made such survival not impossible. Even if it remains implausible.
