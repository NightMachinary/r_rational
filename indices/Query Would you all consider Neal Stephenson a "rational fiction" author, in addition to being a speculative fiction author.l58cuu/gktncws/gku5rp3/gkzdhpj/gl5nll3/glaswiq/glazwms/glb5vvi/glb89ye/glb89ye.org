The critical consumable is not food it's electronics. They're dependent on the suspiciously advanced robots (remember, this was set in basically our time... there are lawsuit-proof expys of people still alive) for basically everything they need to do outside the pressurized habitats... working in vacuum is super hard, and vacuum suits are not durable. And building replacement electronics for those robots (that they spent profligately) will require developing integrated circuitry fabrication facilities.
