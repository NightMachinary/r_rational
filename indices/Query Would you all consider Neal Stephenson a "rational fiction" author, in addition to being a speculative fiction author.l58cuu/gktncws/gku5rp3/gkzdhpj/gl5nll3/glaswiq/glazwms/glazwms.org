I don't believe in the survival of the submariners either, but they were so unlikely there's no point mentioning them.

The lunar colony simply could not have survived a century let alone millennia. It would be unlikely for them to survive until the first generation could take over.

They're starting with basically our level of technology, with no resupply, and hardly any supplies. There is simply no room in the convoy for generations. They're trying to use precision laboratory equipment for bulk production. The breakdown rate will be horrendous.
