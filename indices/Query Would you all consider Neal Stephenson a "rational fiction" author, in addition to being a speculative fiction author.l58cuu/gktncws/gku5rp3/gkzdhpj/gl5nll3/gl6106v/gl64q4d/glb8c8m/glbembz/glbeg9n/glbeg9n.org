Honestly I hadn't noticed till I got heated up writing that comment, and IMO it isn't the biggest issue in the book, just the one that hits the anti ratfic checkpoints.

Right now I'm listening to brandon sanderson a rhythm of war, which isn't great and follows a pretty terrible book, and I'm fuming because this dude cut the legs out from underneath a perfectly good story. Like half of each of these books are flashbacks, and he could have just opened the series earlier, led us through these characters lives and built some empathy for them, and instead he kills half of them in the first book then makes us sit through the slice of life stuff for characters that are already dead.

End rant.
