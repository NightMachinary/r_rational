I think your dislike of the story is rather striking and not entirely reasonable. To me, there's clear motives for basically every character's decision-making, even if they're goddamn morons (like Mr. Skullgun, who is textually and obviously a moron), and the entire structure of the novel is a slow-burn payoff about humanity in utopia, the nature of rebellion, and the raising of children.
