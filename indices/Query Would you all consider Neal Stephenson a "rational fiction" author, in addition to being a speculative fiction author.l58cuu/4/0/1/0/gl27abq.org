  Are you talking about the Primer, or the Seed?

I'm talking about the Seed, yeah. Finkle-McGraw sends Hackworth to help the Dreamers develop it, and seemingly sets up Nell to help see it released into the wider world. But in the same briefing where Hackworth gets sent off, the intelligence goons are all very certain that the Seed is going to give everyone access to nanotech weapons and worse. This makes me say that Finkle-McGraw's plan is, at best, needlessly reckless with countless lives.

  If you think that Nell was raised by a book, I think you missed the point.

The content of Nell's education was decided by the book. Miranda provided the voice and the emotional character to the Primer's rearing of her, which is itself very important. But that doesn't change the fact that Nell thinks she's being raised by a book, and that the book's actual lessons are based around a years-long quest in which Princess Nell outwits and overcomes a series of malevolent authority figures. It's definitely teaching her to be subversive, but it is a very naive sort of subversive that doesn't understand the value of central coordination. It leaves her with a seemingly pathological inability to reach out to authority figures, even benevolent ones.

  The wellbeing of your children is a hell of a motivator.

I'm not objecting to Hackworth wanting to steal a copy of the Primer. That part was totally plausible to me. I'm objecting to a man who we are supposed to take as one of the better nanotech engineers in his phyle being totally unaware of the nanotech-based law enforcement tools which result in him getting caught pretty much immediately after stealing the book. The aerostats weren't even a secret - random children knew enough about how the system worked to successfully subvert it. It is deeply weird that he got caught like that.

  The Primer is the only way that Miranda can stay in touch with the girl she's been raising as a daughter for years.

Consider the scene where Nell stabs her pedophile stepfather. Miranda is horrified that Nell was molested (good! she should be!), but seemingly fails to notice that the Primer has been neglecting to teach Nell about Stranger Danger in favour of encouraging her toward martial arts training and half-baked ambush attempts. This ties back into the thing where the Primer keeps hammering home the point that adults are not to be trusted. Even in situations where Nell should absolutely be trying to find a trustworthy adult, the Primer doubles down and forces a small child to attack a grown man with known violent tendencies and three to four times her body weight. Nobody comments on this.
