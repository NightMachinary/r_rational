I'd say (conditionally) yes:

- Stephenson frequently writes highly intelligent characters and does it well (arguably his greatest strength next to prose). That's not to say they never make mistakes or never make irrational decisions, but those decisions and mistakes they make are in line with the character, so it makes sense
- Stephenson's worldbuilding is thought out and the implications of the fictional elements are considered in a wider scope.
- There are very few instances where I can point to a decision a character makes and say "this happened because of plot purposes, not character motivation"

While I wouldn't call Stephenson a "rationalist" author first, he definitely embodies many "rational" principles in his writing.
