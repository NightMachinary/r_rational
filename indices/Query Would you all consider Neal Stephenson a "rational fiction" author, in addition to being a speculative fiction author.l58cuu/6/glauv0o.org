Only having read Seveneves, tentatively no, not really. I found Seveneves to be great as a [Science] fiction novel, in the sense that countless little bits of scientific phenomena are brought up and are actually grippingly plot-relevant (ex. painful death by radiation sickness and how to somewhat survive it, comet mass sacrifice, delta-v considerations, etc.), but few of the characters explore the depth of thought normally seen in rational fiction, and at times there were definitely railroads of sorts (ex. everything to do with Julia's evil behavior).

Rational fiction, as far as I've read it, is very much focused on the personal experience of each character and their thought processes. Seveneves doesn't do it very much justice, and when it does it's usually focused on the powerful emotional moments, much like traditional literary fiction rather than the gripping thought processes of rational fiction. Which is also why it's a crying shame that Neal's writing in Seveneves is terribly bland. His ideas in the book were amazing, many scenes were poignant and poetic to the point of bringing me to tears, but most of the characters were cardboard and it feels almost like Orion's Arm in how great ideas are horribly restrained by mediocre writing.

Edit: Let's analyze it with the definition:

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  - This is partially true. Some characters do this, and do it very well. But there doesn't feel like there's a focus on this - the focus is on the overarching epic of humanity's struggle for survival, and our incredible ability to both come together and accept our fate... and fall apart and ruin each other. It does this to some degree, but not at all in the way rational fiction tends to do it.

- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  - If anyone can really explain Julia/the American president for me, then please do so. As a background character, and a hard woman making hard decisions, nuking Venezuela made sense. In the last half of the book, however, she became mostly an unrepentant monster, and a caricature of politicians in general. Overall, I'd say that the book fails to convey this point very well.

- Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

  - First half, getting off Earth and Earth's end: Yes. Ish. This can be disputed; I think the poetry of humanity's civilized end may be clouding my judgement.
  - Middle part, civil war in all but name: God no.
  - Finale with the future society: Not in the slightest.

- Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.

  - On character's thinking - some characters yes, mostly no.
  - Improving their reasoning abilities: Not in the slightest.
  - So not rationalist.

- Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

  - It's conveyed terribly, but overall it is reasonable worldbuilding, if not necessarily the most plausible outcome.
