From chapter 29:

  "It snows pretty heavily here in winter, and whole towns can sometimes get cut off from the rest of the world for days, so it's hard to marshal a response in time. Most of the time no one even finds out there was a crisis until days afterwards, when nothing can be done," Vani tapped the table with his fingers contemplatively, as if considering something. "Or at least, that's what the hunters and the authorities like to say. Personally, I just think they're afraid of the Silver One."

  "Silver One?" asked Zorian curiously.

  "It's a rumor. A few years back, when the winter wolves first started acting up, there was an attempt to organize a wide scale cull and a large hunting party was organized. It ended... poorly. According to stories, several winter wolf packs worked together to lure the hunters into traps, separating them into smaller groups that were then defeated in detail. They acted more like an army than a group of wild animals, and survivors claimed they were led by a huge winter wolf with a shiny silver pelt. The Silver One -- an alpha of alphas, as smart as any man and with the power to direct his lesser brothers against humans. There was an official attempt by the Eldemar's mage guild to locate and eliminate this winter wolf, but they found nothing -- neither the silver wolf nor any evidence of multiple packs working together. A lot of the locals are still convinced he exists, though -- they say that anyone who goes after the wolves ends up getting confronted by it sooner or later."

Looks like the Silver One is real and hanging around the Iasku mansion. Perhaps it's a shape-shifted human mage (EDIT: with mind powers to direct the wolves)?

Also, "Iasku" sounds like a setup for a joke.

"Why do I have to carry all this crap to Iasku mansion?"

"I ask you and you do it."
