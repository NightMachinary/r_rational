Actually, Zorian has reliably spent multiple loops (or just the rest of the current loop) laying low whenever he thought someone was after him. For example, this chapter, the loops after the fight with Red Robe, and when he first investigated Zach. If the enemy knows who he and his family are, they would have acted by now.

In addition, he is currently working his way through soul magic, the only known magic to help against perma-kill spells.

I think he only sounds laid back, because he is spending months at a time practicing all of these valuable skills and it's hard to maintain suspense over such a long time period.
