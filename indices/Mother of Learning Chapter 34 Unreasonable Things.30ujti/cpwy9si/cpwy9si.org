Interesting chapter. A lot more content than most.

1. The mayor is in on this, they're assassinating soul experts to aid the Ikosian invasion somehow. Perhaps they have some grand scheme to figure out like the Bakora gates? Contacting primordials? So either they abduct them for their knowledge or mind rape them for their knowledge or somehow weakish soul magic would allow someone to stop whatever scheme.

2. He's skilled enough to kill assassins. Pretty fine. He should probably try incorporating some soul magic into his warding scheme, should be near impossible to bypass. I'm surprised no mention was made of interrogating the assassin.

3. The fire animation spell looks pretty cool. He could probably use it to kill the Grey Hunter. Lure it in with those, set up a ward somewhere, draw it in, hit it with some potent non magical trap like a deep pit.

4. Transformation is seriously useful. And plus it's very accessible to him- he just has to delve into the dungeons a few times, get rich, and he can purchase all sorts of useful potions.

5. Sounds like he's levelled up. Too strong for wilderness trash encounters. But he needs more wards to protect him against attacks. A basic protection one should be obligatory.

As to what he could do for the future.

Crystallized mana. Presumably he could use this in spells? If so, very useful in setting a trap for enemies.

Trial 1 of Aranea contact. The Aranea will presumably want something from him for their help. He needs to find out what. To help him it would be excellent to have some help- that priest could do a lot of good for him in surviving any traps or overcoming any initial issues. Plus he may need a few restarts to master skills to get contact. He should try, near the end of a restart, to feel out the priest's reaction to him time travelling.

Getting Silverlake's aid. The priest can burn selectively. With his aid he could capture an egg. Perhaps as a favor to him for saving him from undead. This would strengthen his soul magic protections and alchemy.

Mastering flee. He should make it a regular thing to get some sort of fleeing potion from Lukav. He often encounters fights where there are teleport wards, being able to transform into a bird at will would do wonders.

Getting a combat golem. His golem making and combat abilities would progress a lot faster if he raided a golem expert. Doing it from scratch is slow.

For the greater goals, I think getting powerful allies is key. The priest and the transfiguration expert would be excellent allies, learning how to convince them to help him would be great. Then they could help him defeat the mayor's necromancer.
