Yup, I think I enjoyed Leftover soup for the thoughtful comments from Tailsteak. The other comic that also makes me think in this way is Strong Female Protagonist. I don't always agree with either of their view points (although I tend to) but it's always interesting to read viewpoints on society from thoughtful people and sometimes they lead me down a path that makes me update my beliefs.
