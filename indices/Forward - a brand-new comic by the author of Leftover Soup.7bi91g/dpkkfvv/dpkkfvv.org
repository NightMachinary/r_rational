  As for me, though, I do get annoyed when I see people misusing and appropriating psychological terms. "Depressed" does not mean "sad". "Triggered" does not mean "made upset". "ADD" does not mean "feeling antsy". "OCD" does not mean "I like it when things are tidy". Words have meanings, damn it, brainsciencey words doubly so.
