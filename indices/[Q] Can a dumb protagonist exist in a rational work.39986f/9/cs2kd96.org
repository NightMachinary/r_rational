I was just revisiting this thread and realized that the state that the OP mentions fits practically the entire history of mankind before the scientific method was firmly established.

Yes, there were several more rational civilizations, but most of the world lived without the ability to really understand what was happening around them, because they didn't have the mental or physical tools to properly isolate cause and effect.

Humanity did learn. One little bit at a time. And that learning was frequently bitterly opposed by people in power with a vested interest in maintaining ignorance.
