Everyone is dumb some of the time. Low IQ rational characters would simply be so more often, and in realistic ways based on their psychology and sociological context. Avoiding giving people the idiot ball or involving them in clich√©d Scooby-Doo* plots is the key to keeping it rational, not the protagonist's IQ or skill set.

To me, rational fiction is about not making "just so" stories, and spending more time on smart motivations and world building than is usual in speculative fiction. That still works with a less intelligent than average protagonist. But it does seem to require a more skilled writer than average.
