Jinkies. If actually placed in a supernatural-is-real 'verse, that would be pretty swell, gang.

Twist: It's a /rationalist/ fic. And Velma isn't the rationalist--it's Daphne.

Clearly sub-optimal situation for someone who knows their stuff, you say? Nah. Gotta stay on the move once you've uncovered how supernatural things hide down practically every dark country road. Can't stay in one place too long, even if it isn't some small town with an abandoned circus just across the tracks.

The cities are worse. Have you seen their lost person statistics for young women? Brr. Not a good idea. Even stopping for gas is dangerous, though they really ought to do that more often...

Point is, someone or some/ones/ are obviously running a deep masquerade. This stuff is really, really obvious if you scratch the surface. Can't trust anyone very much, but a close circle of friends, proven in the fires of adversity, is the best one can do.

Shame [[http://i.imgur.com/7wxbLPn.jpg][the boyfriend]] is so thick. Something something healthy sex life for improved mental stability. And he's loyal, tall, and can lift heavy things.

The [[http://i.imgur.com/Q3xPvl7.jpg][skeptical nerd]] (on right: my unimpressed face) is immune to many supernatural effects through sheer force of bloody mindedness, and the self-made shamanist with his [[http://i.imgur.com/UtNHEHE.jpg][spirit animal]] fill their roles, too. In addition to further dividing monster attention to improve the odds.

And the public act? Better if everyone underestimates the leggy, strawberry-blond, ex-Stanford professor with a PhD in psychology specializing in cryptozoology and parapsychology(*), and a ten-years mastery of /[[http://i.imgur.com/bTPdVcy.gif][Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do]]/(**).

Double Topical Twist: though Daphne is */a/* main character, the story's primary protagonist and POV character is really Fred. Fred isn't very smart, but his girlfriend's really neat-o, man!
