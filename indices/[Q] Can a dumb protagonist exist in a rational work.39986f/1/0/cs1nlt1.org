Unless the character is already aware of the power of focus (which isn't what I would expect from a stupid person), his answer sounds underconfident. It's a surprising result that something that obvious can be hidden, because normally the brain is very good at sifting through visual data and noting irregularities. Expecting it to suddenly fail for the gorilla just because you're focussing seems unwarranted.
