I agree with wales in that the sidebar rules are more guidelines than laws, and it's more spectrum than anything else.

For me, rational works are stories that have intelligent elements about them, to a degree that it noticeably affects the plot (There's tons of media out there with that snarky side character that's making good observations, but is never credited/noticed/utilized) And the protagonist is one of the most powerful vehicles for this, as we're, presumably, going to be spending most of our time with them, and it's much easier to have an intelligent human than to just try and make your setting really intelligent and hope the audience notices. Although having a rational protagonist and stupid setting doesn't fly too well either, at least in my opinion. There are a few works out there that take a setting that's been stupid for a while, and is only becoming intelligent as we see the protagonist interact with it (This is stupidly, ridiculously blatant in HPMOR. While individual characters vary on the rationalist scale, the setting of the magical world is this (although it's not AS bad as JKR's original, it's pretty close), and EY uses this fact to both comic and serious effect a number of times. Two Year Emperor is another place where this happens, although it's rapidly deconstructed as the fic progresses.) For those works, I'm neutral. It's about how the author goes about doing it that decides it for me.

A rational fic can be a rational fic, simply because the protagonist (or associated characters) use every single tool they have at their disposal in an attempt to form a solution. Even if one isn't formed, the fact that they go through the critical thinking necessary to say "Hey, maybe this paperclip and battery CAN do something here" is really important to me. Thought needs to be displayed for me to consider a work rational. But this thought doesn't necessarily need to come from the protagonist; it's just easiest (for both the writer and the reader) when it does. And reading stupidity is just painful. Ignorance? Incompetence? Acceptable to a degree, as nothing is perfect. But it may be too grating to see it constantly displayed on someone who we're supposed to be inclined to like and support.

I think a rational fic with a dumb protagonist could work. It would just be much more difficult than if the protagonist was smart. An easy out may be having him in a role that constituted advisement from smarter people, say a boy king with wise advisors, or the front guy with a really intelligent guy being the "brains" of the whole operation?
