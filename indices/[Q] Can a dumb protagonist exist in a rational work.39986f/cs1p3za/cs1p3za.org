You're looking for a way for characters to avoid carrying the idiot ball while not being conventionally intelligent.

Well, you can have fiction where all the characters are less intelligent than a human. Consider Watership Down as an example.

There's a story I read that I would consider rational where the main character is not particularly smart, but it's still rational. I can't find it now, but it's about a stolid soldier who puts a dying alien pilot out of its misery.
