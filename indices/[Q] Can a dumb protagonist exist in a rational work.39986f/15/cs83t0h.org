I am curious. I mentioned animal stories before, but I have a fairly modern example in mind now. Cujo. It's been decades since I read it, but I just reviewed it's Wiki article. I do not remember the characters being particularly smart, but I seem to remember most of them being fairly rational. They were just dealing with something they didn't expect. Parts of the story were told from the perspective of the dog, if I recall right.

Of course, we're talking Stephen King here, who has a rather disconcerting ability to make things work in a book that just don't sound like they will work until you can't put the book down.
