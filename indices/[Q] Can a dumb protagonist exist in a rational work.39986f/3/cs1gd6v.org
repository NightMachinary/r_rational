It would be really difficult. The sidebar guidelines are only half the story; there are other, more nebulous characteristics that define rational fiction as a genre (or ethos). Competence and intelligence, specifically in the protagonist, are definitely part of it.

You can definitely have a character who's /flawed/ in some way. Hubris, overconfidence, social awkwardness, things like that. A protagonist who has some specific failure mode in their thinking is almost a staple. The thing is, those flaws can be overcome, or laid bare. Plain dumbness sort of can't.

The other big problem is that you have to think long and hard about "because the plot requires it". It would be really easy to railroad the plot with the character's dumb actions, and "the character didn't think of it" is often identical to an asspull.
