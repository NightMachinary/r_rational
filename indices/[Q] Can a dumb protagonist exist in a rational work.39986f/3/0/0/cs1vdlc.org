The sidebar has its origins in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rkkam/in_light_of_the_recent_slew_of_recommendations/cdo5nto][this post]] in [[/r/HPMOR]] by [[/u/Vivificient]].

The problem with it (to the extent that there is a problem) is that it's not a very tightly focused rule; it's like a rule designed to select zerbas that does a good job of keeping out cows, but also keeps letting in horses.

This is why you will see debates about whether a work is or isn't rational in the comments of many submissions. To me, it's more of a spectrum/ideal rather than the binary that some people treat it as. Coming to a firm definition is difficult, because we only have /maybe/ a dozen works that we might agree on as "the rational canon", and of those dozen, it should be expected that a few of them (maybe even all of them) violate the ethos in some way.

Anyway, things that I somewhat expect when going into a story that either labels itself, or has been given the label, "rational":

- An intelligent, competent protagonist with a fair amount of agency
- "Thinky" type problems with "thinky" type solutions
- A focus on science and technology
- A focus on what people are thinking, and why
- Transhumanist themes
- An emphasis on making the world logical and consistent
- A push towards progress, understanding, and advancement

But it might be better to think of every text as an arrow that's already been launched; this just happens to be what my personal target is, and some of those arrows are going to land closer to the bullseye than others. I'd consider /Flowers of Algernon/ to be tweaking that same part of my brain, with /A Scanner Darkly/ doing it to a much lesser extent (and I haven't read /More than Human/, so can't comment there).

(My biggest problem with the sidebar is actually the second point, because it would seem to exclude Man v. Nature stories; nature doesn't have beliefs or values. If the story is about an imminent asteroid impact, you don't need factions or interpersonal conflicts.)

Edit: I can't spell.
