I would like to see more works discussing low-IQ rationalists, people who are very careful, unjudgemental, well tempered, but who arn't very good at identifying patterns, noticing things[1] thinking of novel solutions or exploring implications.

That last thing might make it difficult for them to invalidate cached thoughts when they ran into counterevidence for past assumptions, which may be hard to reconcile with rationality. I imagine they would have to be highly disciplined. That may result in their ultimately seeming a lot more competent than many of the better endowed characters around them.

[1]: but they know how little they see. If asked, "Did you see the gorilla walk through the scene?" They would not respond "No, I can't believe there was a gorilla", they would tell you that they were paying attention to the players, as instructed, not the presence or absence of gorillas on the court, and they would not have noticed any if there had been.
