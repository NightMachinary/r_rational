I don't see why it couldn't be done, carefully. There is a class of literature that does this regularly - animal-as-main-character books. Jim Kjelgaard wrote a lot of young adult fiction with animal protagonists.

You're going to have to work to make this happen, and you're going to have to work /really/ hard to make it happen with an adult human and not turn people off. Very few people want to be drawn into the mind of an unintelligent person, and that's the first thing you need in a story - a lead character that the reader wants to associate with.
