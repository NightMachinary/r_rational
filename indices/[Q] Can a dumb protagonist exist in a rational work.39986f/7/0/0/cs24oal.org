No, this is on Earth. The alien is the pilot of an interstellar lightsail that crashes in North America. The soldier is taking a message to the scientists studying the alien and realizes it's in pain, so he asks the scientist where its brain is and shoots it. Years later after he's been released from his prison sentence, the rest of the aliens arrive.
