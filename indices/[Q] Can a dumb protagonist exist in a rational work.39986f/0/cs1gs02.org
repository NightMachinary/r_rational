The thing that can redeem it is if it highlights mental skills for the reader, for pedagogical purposes or otherwise.

For example, you could argue that some of Pratchett's Rincewind books qualify (The Last Continent being a favorite of mine) despite most of the main characters being quite stupid. We might formulate a general rule about satire, like - In satire, stupidity by the characters should highlight good thinking rather than obscuring it.

Another sort might be stories where the setting is wonderfully imagined and stands regardless of the characters. Stephenson's Diamond Age might qualify as this, for example.

Yet another might be if the story's plot is clever and understandable by the reader, either through chance or the actions of intelligent background characters. Ringworld might exemplify some of this.

Or if the story simply focuses on thinking without worrying about intelligence in particular. For example, The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-time.

Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
