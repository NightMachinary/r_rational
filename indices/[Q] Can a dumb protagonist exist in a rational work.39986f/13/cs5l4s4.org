Rationality given bounded computational resources: take your own lack of intelligence into account. If someone presents you with a valid mathematical proof that you don't understand, then you don't know if it's valid or not, so it's not very strong evidence to you. There is certainly such thing as computationally bounded rationality, and it's a more practical concept than computationally unbounded rationality, i.e. information-theoretic rationality.

For example, one character in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (who is allegedly unintelligent) encounters two people, one of which is an enemy and one of which is an innocent. He can't tell which is which, so he knocks them both out. Actually he guesses and he happened to guess right first but he was willing to knock them both out. A more intelligent character might have figured out which was which somehow, but he took his lack of knowledge/intelligence into account and made the best decision given the available resources. This demonstrates rationality, but, assuming there was a way of telling them apart, it also demonstrates a lack of intelligence.

Analogously, if there's a big rock in front of a door you want to open, it demonstrates a lack of physical strength and a presence of rationality to use tools / assistance to move it instead of moving it yourself.

I don't know how much fun it would be to read such a story though.
