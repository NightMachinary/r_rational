Hm. I like the idea of posting stories without posting their authors, but it's logistically hard if every author is providing their own link to the story hosted at a location of their choosing. I'm using a personal website, but even a Google Doc is attributable. The only alternative would be to have the contest-runner post each story to a standardized site.

Why'm I thinking about this? It would divorce the story from the story-author, so that authors with established fandoms or authors with no fandoms would be able to have their stories considered on the merits of the story, rather than the author's reputation.

With the current setup, it may be better to spoiler-tag author names, or to make the link to the story the top thing in each comment on the story-voting thread.
