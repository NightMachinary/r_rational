Before the thread went into contest mode, I could see stories being downvoted. (Which I thought was needlessly unkind.) I don't know if it's because people didn't know that rule or because they didn't care, but it might help to edit these rules into the contest post. I assume they're the same rules that used to be used for the biweekly contests, but people who didn't participate in those or who came to the sub after they ended won't know them.
