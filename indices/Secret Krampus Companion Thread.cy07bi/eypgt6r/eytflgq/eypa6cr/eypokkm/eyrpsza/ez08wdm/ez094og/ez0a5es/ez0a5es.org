Ah. Might make that clearer next time for Dumbos like me. I kept looking for a link or something to go and vote.

Does Reddit have a tool to disallow downvotes? If not, maybe setup a strawpoll (where you can't see the results of the until you vote). Incidentally if Reddit does have that feature, I sure wish more subs would use it -- I think downvotes suck.
