Honestly, probably not. I'm assuming that mining is ubiquitous enough in dwarven culture that /everybody/ mines (call me /racist/, but I calls it like I sees it.)

While it might be a core - if not /the/ - pillar of dwarven society, mining would be too common for it to be a 'special talent' or 'defining trait' that is inherent to a Role.

If the Role of Dragonslayer was a deep and narrow gouge in the fabric of reality, painstakingly etched out by every single wide-eyed peasant boy who had the balls to draw a sword against a dragon, then the dwarven 'Role' of Miner would be broad but shallow - defined by the millions of bog-standard Joe Blows who have ever used a pickaxe in their lives.

Of course, this is all headcanon and you're free to ignore it if you please. But who knows - maybe our 'Knight, princess, dragon' story is their 'Miner, pickaxe, giant man-eating mole rat.'
