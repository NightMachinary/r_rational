I like it.

"Triumphant" gives you the impression of someone taking over and doing amazing things, bragging about their accomplishments and everyone acknowledging how awesome they are.

"Victorious" is simple. "I beat everyone else". No pretentious claims to grandeur, just a flat out statement that everyone who tried to fight her lost.
