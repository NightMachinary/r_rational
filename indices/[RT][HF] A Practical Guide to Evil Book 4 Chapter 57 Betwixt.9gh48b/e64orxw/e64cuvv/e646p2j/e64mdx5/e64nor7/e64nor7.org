Good point. There's no reason to think there /aren't/. From what I can remember about Naming dynamics, a mantle is etched into the fabric of reality over time as narratives and stories within a given culture are repeated; e.g. the White Knight slaying a dragon and saving the princess, the Tyrant stooped over in their throne, plotting for total Calernian domination, or the Wandering Bard getting sloshed and meddling.

Dwarves definitely have a culture, which means they would have their own stories, which naturally implies they would have their own Named. Makes me wonder what /kind/ of Names they would have.

Cat should /hopefully/ realize this, at the very least. Having the "world's foremost Namelore expert" as a mentor would have its upsides, one imagines - regardless of her Foundlingâ„¢ brand impulsiveness.
