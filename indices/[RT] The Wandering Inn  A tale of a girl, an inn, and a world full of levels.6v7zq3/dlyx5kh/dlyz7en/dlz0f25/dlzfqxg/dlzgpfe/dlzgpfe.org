havent watched netflix daredevil series but i agree. Also i hate it when we get her 1st person pespective.

But dont get me wrong i still kinda enjoy a story but compared to MoL or Worm or other webnovels it just isnt there with the prose or the quality in general. Although its a pretty good isekai as far as the genre goes tho. I really like the world also and some passages with the faries or other characters are damn impressive and have a lot of potential only if they werent such heavily misplaced because they dont have the impact (on me) they should have
