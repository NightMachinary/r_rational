Erin just gets worse. It's very odd, especially how she starts treating fiction as real (Thinking LOTR elves are the same as the half-elf she runs into) and then promptly forgets bits of the fiction she /should/ know just for plot reasons.

Fairy gold, for instance. She knows enough about the fair folk to give them a proper feast... but doesn't remember far more pertinent details. She treats the skeleton as if he is retarded but is continually surprised when he makes a mistake.

It's a fun story, but my experience is it gets worse as time goes on. The concept is great, but it feels like bad things happen for no reason but to keep Erin scrabbling.
