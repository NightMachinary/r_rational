I've just read it all in the past few days. I wouldn't call it rational fiction, because it isn't really. All the protagonists are more reactive than active, and there is a standard ration of idiot balls, plot armor, etc.

That said, I quite enjoyed it. Erin is no genius, but her genuinely open and friendly personality was refreshing. Ryoka is...perhaps less likeable, but a necessary counterbalance, smarter (usually) and harder and more independent. Having the main character become the innkeeper instead of the adventurer is interesting all by itself. And there are some really moving sections, like the Doctor side story. Actually, most of the side stories are very much worthwhile.

My favorite character, though, has to be [[#s][Toren]]. Couldn't stop myself giggling when [[#s][he]].

The sheer length and breadth of the story ensures that it will either be a rich experience, or a dull slog; I found it to be rich and complex.

My biggest dislike was the amount of strong language. I know most readers aren't concerned about that, though. I just find it detracts from my enjoyment of the story, like an unwanted ingredient in an otherwise great meal.
