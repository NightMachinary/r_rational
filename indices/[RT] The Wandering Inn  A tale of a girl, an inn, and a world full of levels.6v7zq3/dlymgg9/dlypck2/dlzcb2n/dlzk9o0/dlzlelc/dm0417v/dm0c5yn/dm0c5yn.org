  Erin is more like the person that connects all the key players in the world and causes things to progress forward.

And does this happen due to her intentionally putting significant effort into it? Or do key players just happen to randomly stumble their way to her on their own again and again? If so, then this is hardly a point in favour of the work. After all, it's not as if every inn in the universe is such a nexus of influence. Does this particular one has anything to distinguish it to such an impressive degree, aside from having the POV character inside?
