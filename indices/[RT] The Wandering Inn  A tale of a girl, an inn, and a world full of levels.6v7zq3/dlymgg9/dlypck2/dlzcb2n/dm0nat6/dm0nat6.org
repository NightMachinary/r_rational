Goblins are horrible creatures. There's a bounty on them, and they're all considered to be criminals by default.

Erin has a "no murdering goblins" rule. This has gotten people killed. This has gotten her severely injured several times. It's probably a bad decision.

But she also has several regular goblin customers, who interact peacefully with the other patrons.

In so far as she has agency, she's /tolerant/. Not in the "I can tolerate anything except the outgroup" sense, but actually tolerant.

It's not what I'd call "agency", she's not working towards a larger goal, or anything like that. But it is interesting, and they show the consequences relatively realistically.
