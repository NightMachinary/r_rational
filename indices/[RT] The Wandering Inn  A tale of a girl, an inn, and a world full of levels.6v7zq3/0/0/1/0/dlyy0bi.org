Fair enough. The early chapters are bad enough(compared to the rest of the story) that even the author says she's dreading the eventual rewrite that she will have to do. Maybe you'll have better luck with it once the book version is released in the far future.

Till then there are far to many stories out there to suffer through something you don't enjoy :)
