It's a lot of chapters before it grew on me but it's definitely not because of Erin and anything she has to do. By far, everything I hate about the story centres around Erin, she's probably one of the dumbest most annoying characters I've ever had the misfortune to read!

Although things does get better once, mild spoilers, the perspective shifts to a different main character. Ryoka. It gets more refreshing and it starts to dive into more world building, actually, most other perspectives will offer more world building and lore than anything Erin chapters have to offer. But back to the point, Ryoka has quite the anger management issue and it leads her to make some real stupid decisions, which is very very grating to read. And all I have to say is that the author really has a knack in making likeable characters unrelatable and infuriating. Though it doesn't get much better at least until arc 2 where there's this noticeable improvement in quality once the main players are in play.

All in all I actually enjoyed this the more I read, the world as it is with its different players has so much to offer and so much lore and world building etc that it keeps pulling me back. Thats my thoughts on it, it's like a light game of thrones with the many events and perspectives taking place but with a dense, thick headed main character.
