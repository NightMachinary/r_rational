All right, I like this story, and it's definitely one of the better litrpgs. But, seriously, this ain't a rational story. The main character is an actual idiot, in the old school, God smiles on the dimwitted, savant sense. The secondary lead is more intelligent, but far from rational. She's a highly educated, tightly compressed ball of emotional triggers.
