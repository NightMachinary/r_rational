The novel has an interesting premise but one word i can say about it thats its inconsistent. Especially so in the begining where atleast for myself i found the characterization of erin extremaly inconsistent. IT stabilized in the later part of the story but god damn was it annoying while reading. Also the power levels are quite... inconsistent aswell i think that author like changed his/her opinion like 2 times in the story in terms of establishing powerlevels and it shows.

also 2 main characters are annoying af. I cant stand especially ryoka because she is edgy and a mary sue with her knowledge and ability even if they arent as useful in the fantasy world. Also erin is just stupid. She is clumsy and easy to distract as if those traits served some purpose to nerf her so she wont be too op, but she is anyways and its annoying that at the begining of the story she didnt act that way.

the story is pretty good anyways its would just need a serious editing and a rewrite and i am pretty sure the author wont do that so :/

edit: not that i want to whine about downvotes but i want to whine about downvotes. Downvoting for opinions is kinda bad and i would gladly discuss anything related to this novel and why i am not fond of it, just comment, message me or smth...idk
