From what I remember she found that on the next day she arrived in the inn. Quickly searched the inn in the morning hoping she would find something and gave up quickly because her stomach was rumbling badly. Decided to search for something to eat around the inn instead and found some. Wanted to try preparing it and did a proper systematic search of the whole kitchen only to find food in one of the cupboards.

I agree that she should've searched better from the start but that's just how Erin is (as well as many people I know). She's a kind hearted young girl with her head in the clouds and not a rationalist skeptic.

If this is what made you drop the story I'd recommend trying it again and reading until Chess starts playing a role in the plot.

In my opinion The Wandering Inn is a modern age fairy tail that I can't wait to read to my children before bed, once they're a little bit older. And over the years both the writing and story become exceptionally better. One of the only webnovels that managed to make me tear up or laugh out loud on more than one occasions.
