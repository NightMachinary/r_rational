I've just finished reading all of the chapters. It does get much better but I'd also recommend skipping the first 20 chapters... I've also skipped all the ryoka chapters on the first volume. After reading those, I think it's the right choice. Ryoka is much better in the 2nd volume but in the first volume she's an unlikable unstable stupid angsty teen.
