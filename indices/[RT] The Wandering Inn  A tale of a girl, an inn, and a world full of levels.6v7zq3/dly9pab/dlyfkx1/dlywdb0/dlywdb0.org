I read the first seven chapters and then stopped. I don't know what the total word count was at that point, but I felt like almost nothing had happened and was annoyed by both the pace and the prose.

I feel bad about putting down things that people say get better later on, because I'm sure there's some good stuff that can be found by wading through when the work plods, but I always start thinking about the other ways I could be spending my time, and eventually I get antsy enough that I can't go on.
