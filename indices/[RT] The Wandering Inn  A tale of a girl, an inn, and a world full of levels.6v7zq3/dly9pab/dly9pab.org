(I found the story from [[https://particularvirtue.blogspot.com/2017/08/online-fiction-ive-been-reading-lately.html]], and in the last week I've read up to the current point)

I've really enjoyed the story. It is about 3/5 as long as Worm so far and new chapters are coming out regularly. The author is definitely nowhere near the end yet.

The description from that blogpost is

  You know how webcomics like Questionable Content have an extremely clear arc in the creator's art skill, from the beginning to present? This is the first time I've seen this happen clearly in a solely written web serial.

  The protagonist, Erin Solstice, is from our world, and wakes up one day to find herself fighting off low-level monsters in a fantasy world. After a day of just barely surviving monster attacks, she finds an abandoned inn, cleans it up, collapses in a heap... and just before falling asleep, she hears the words in her head: "Innkeeper Level 1!" The series follows her and her adventures in a world with monsters, levels, and sapient nonhumans.

  Erin is a great example of a character motivated primarily by friendship who is super badass. Her foil and the secondary protagonist, Ryoka, is close to the mold of a stereotypical rationalfic protagonist: logical, intelligent, knowledgeable about our world's science and technology, bitter, and bad with people. But they're each extraordinary in their own way, showing that greatness can come from many sources.

  The main downside of this series is that it drags. Many words lie between the most interesting events of the story. I'm also annoyed that the author frequently breaks lines on dialogue unnecessarily, which makes it hard to tell what's going on.

Some parts are definitely reaching rationalism levels, especially in the last third of what's been written so far. There are also a few points when it's a bit weak and not even rational, especially at the beginning of the story. It's definitely worth getting through those to get to the good stuff.
