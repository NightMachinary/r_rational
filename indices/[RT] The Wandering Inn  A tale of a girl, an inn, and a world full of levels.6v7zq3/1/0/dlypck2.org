The first several chapters are for the most part the weakest. Personally, I felt the story first started coming together when the first side characters were introduced. There are actually two main characters: Erin who remains the innkeeper and is sociable and resilient, and Ryoka who is a Runner(messenger) and is intelligent and adventurous.

Ryoka is out and about the world more often, but Erin doesn't just hang around the inn either. Most of the time Erin leaves the inn it's for an inn-related purpose, but that doesn't mean that doesn't involve her hunting monsters or heading into a dungeon. Ryoka on the other hand naturally gets into trouble.

The main point is that story isn't about how an innkeeper works in an inn. It is about how the story and actions of this innkeeper play a part in the greater story of the world which filled with diverse factions and a rich history.
