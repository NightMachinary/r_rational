Erin does put significant effort into attracting strange customers, both by coming up with special food and having strange interactions with the world's levelling system.

It's a conceit of the work so far that the strange customers tend to be important or powerful people. Given that though, it's reasonable for those people to know other important people, who then come by.

However, a lot of it is clearly author fiat. One group of customers comes by because all the convenient inns are full, for instance. Erin's inn has a terrible location, which means regular customers don't usually show up. That makes "coincidences" seem very not coincidental.
