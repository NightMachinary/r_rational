At first things just happen on their own. This is similar to any other story and happens during the initial world building and side character introduction chapters. Once those are over with Erin becomes more proactive and the plot starts moving forward as a direct result of her actions. Later in the story she begins to seek to do/solve things on her own.

The cool thing about Erin in my opinion is that her uniqueness comes not from some system breaking power but simply from the fact that she comes from a modern western civilization. Many stories try to portray this contrast between modern values vs middle age monster infested ones, however, most stories simply give the MC some unique skill or power that the MC gets "because they come from modern Earth". In the Wandering Inn, Erin's only power is her values and personality that is a direct result of growing up on Earth. Not much else.

The way the story develops because of how she acts is done, in my opinion, in a believable way. I remember one chapter in particular where Erin meets an important side character and we understand how amazing and important to the plot she is. And why only she could have accomplished what she did.(Even though she herself will tell you that she didn't do anything special.)

Erin is the innkeeper. People come into her life and she does her best to help them. The strength of the story, to me, lies in the huge amount of side characters and how each characters side story comes together because of Erin and culminates into a story big enough to affect the whole world.

Clearly I'm biased when it comes to the story as I've been following it for almost a year now and enjoyed it very much. I hate Ryoka. Love Erin. Enjoy most of the side characters. And now that the end plot-line has begun and all the side plots are starting to come together into one, I can't wait for the weekends just so I can read how it all progress.
