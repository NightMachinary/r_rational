Hi, just wanted to say that a character that has been stated to be a protagonist in the future is an [[#s][]], and will most definitely do things of consequence. I also think you'll like the most recent sidestory, following a [Doctor], as I feel like it actually doesn't have any of the things you complained about. Chapter 1 is [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/2017/07/14/1-00-d/][here]], the climax chapter 2 is [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/2017/07/14/1-01-d/][here]]

That being said, I totally get if this isn't your cup of tea.
