I guess it depends on what you consider consequential. I'm not caught up nor is it completed so I can't answer definitively, but I doubt any of the protagonists will be conquering kingdoms. And even if it did, there are volumes of other works that get to the point faster.

The characters do have agency in some areas such as confronting intolerance or repaying debts to lost friends, but mostly their impact on the world is accidental. [[#s][Minor Spoilers]]

I would say Erin is interesting after reading nearly 2 massive volumes. However, although she is important to characters who are important, she isn't very recognized to the greater part of the world. I could talk in further depth of her character, but if you aren't looking for a protagonist that is more directly impacting the world, this might not be what you are looking for.
