That's all useful information, but none of it seems to answer my question about protagonist(s) setting out to do anything of consequence. There is nothing wrong with slice of life in a fictional setting, but that's not what I'm looking for these days.

Honestly, it sounds like the very best you could do with this setup is something like a story about someone working at Caf√© Central in early twentieth century. Certainly there is an appeal, but I'd prefer if the story followed one of many interesting people that visit it, rather than a girl who happened to serve food to many interesting people, but isn't terribly interesting or notable herself.

A POV focused on someone who will at best be mentioned in footnotes of history books, if even that, feels like a waste.
