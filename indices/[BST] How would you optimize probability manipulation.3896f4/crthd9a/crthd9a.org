I am having trouble understanding the mechanism by which this world works.

You say that if someone shot you you could manipulate the probability so he would not hit you\the hit would not be fatal. but also that if you were playing poker and that one of the other people has an ace you manipulation of the probability that you would get an ace would be changed.

But these dont make sense, i mean to demonstrate the point if you are told that a new employee is going to enter the door to your office you could in theory place the probability that who will enter your office will be a man at 50%, but that would be wrong, because the person was already hired before and actually the probability is 99.999999% that the person would still be the same person which was hired and you weren't aware of until now, so how could you manipulate the probability? In the same sense if there is a pack of cards in a theoretical situation the probability that you would get an ace is 4/52, but in reality while you don't know it yet the cards already have a certain order. unless the event is based on some quantum phenomena generally the world is fairly deterministic.

And once you go through this any kind of decision you will take with the power will by definition by arbitrary.
