The first abuse I could think of would be to step-stone my way up to better power. The instant-probability power could help you to find what factors would actually influence your power's limits. You could then slowly nudge your odds of successfully circumventing those limits, one decision at a time like the left/right step idea [[/u/RMcD94]] uses.

The power has to be prevented from working on itself and its own causes or else you can snowball your way into godhood fairly quickly.
