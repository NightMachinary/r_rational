Yeah, no meta-application. I'd have it as the damage being a constant, but how much you hurt per application and how much your body can take is dependent on the individual's skill and power. Kind of like the Dresden Files mages, who have a variety of skill and power depending on training and raw ability, but all take backlash from casting.
