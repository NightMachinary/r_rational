I imagine the number of things is a factor, with how many things are in a group depending on how many possible outcomes there are. For radioactive decay, the command would be "As many molecules as I can control have not decayed/have decayed". It's a binary outcome, but you're talking about moles of atoms, so the cost would become exponential to impossibility rather quick. I could see a nuclear isotope attack at a high level of use (entropy is probably easier to provoke then artificial order), but not making quick and easy dirty bombs. Also, this takes concentration and time, so a dirty bomb attack anywhere where the media would pay attention would get more heat on you then you're able to handle. It might be worth it...if you're desperate and have a lot of time on your hands.
