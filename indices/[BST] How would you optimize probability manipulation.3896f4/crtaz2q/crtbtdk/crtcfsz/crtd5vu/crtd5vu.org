I imagine the actuary as doing bell curves and individual outcomes, based on the user's intent. If your actuary is acting on faulty information, you are still penalized for the higher "actual" cost of what you tried to do. I imagine an upper limit of some kind when you try to do something far beyond your limit-trying to draw the fourth ace in your example would hit you like trying to secure a fairly low probability event. It would hurt you, do nothing, and let you know you failed.

As for making money: Both sides in this conflict have certainly set up traps for any easy ways of making money. Excessive casino winnings, a series of short-term in the stock market or what have you beyond a certain point would probably attract attention and get you investigated (and attacked or killed).
