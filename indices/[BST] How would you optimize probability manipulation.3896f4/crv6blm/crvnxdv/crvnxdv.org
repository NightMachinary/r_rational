My thought was that in combining clauses, you suffered all of them cumulatively-your chance at making gold appear out of thin air (effectively impossible) would also have to be paid if you tacked that on to changing a coin toss as well, or perhaps causally linking things that were not causally linked before is impossible (a coin toss does not affect the outcome of an election).

The initial idea sounds elegant, but I'm not sure how to make it work. I might cheat and just declare that it only works on physical objects within sight of the mage, combining variables makes you pay the cost of the most unlikely variable in the equation at minimum, and that you can't materialize what wasn't there before, which might address your loopholes. Thoughts?
