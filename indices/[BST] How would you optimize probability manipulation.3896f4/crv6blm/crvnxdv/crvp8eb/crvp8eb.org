#+begin_quote
  combining variables makes you pay the cost of the most unlikely variable in the equation at minimum
#+end_quote

variable X = something effectively impossible DOES NOT happen (prob. almost 1)

variable Y = tossed coin lands tails (prob. 0.5)

Spell 1. make the probability of X AND Y = 0 (originaly a little less than 0.5)

Spell 2. make the probability of Y = 1 (originally 0.5)

Profit :)

I don't think you can make this non-OP. It's just too general. The best bet would be to design path-invariant way to calculate the cost of manipulations that works like relativity velocity change equations - the further you ultimately change the probability from original - the closer to infinity the energy cost gets. For changing the probability from 0 to 1 (or vice versa) the cost should be infinity no matter how you achieved that. But I've failed to design such equations (haven't spend much time on that).

My first idea was equation like:

#+begin_example
    energy cost of changing prob A to B = - constant / 4*(a-b)*(1-a-b)
#+end_example

For changing 0.5 to 0 or 1 it would make the cost = constant.

For changing 0 to 1 the cost would be +infinity.

But it's not path invariant. For changing 0.5 to 0.75 and then 0.75 to 1 it would be 8/3 * constant.
