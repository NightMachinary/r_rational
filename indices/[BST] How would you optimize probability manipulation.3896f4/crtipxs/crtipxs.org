Probability is an abstraction, arguably even at the tiniest subatomic level that we can measure. Odds make sense in our heads - they tell stories in a satisfying way - but there isn't really a chance that a particular thing will happen. In a very real way, either it /will/ happen or it /won't/. The concept of probability manipulation is as absurd as Superman picking up a whole car by lifting its bumper.

It's one thing to change the wind or the speed of rotation and alter the result a coinflip. It's quite another to change the odds that a particular person knows your name, or that a particular product is available at a particular shop. In either of those cases even though you're /narratively/ changing the present, you're /physically/ changing the past.

If changing the past is possible, then assume the character was born female. The odds that she would have been born female are roughly 50%, so it ought to be effortless to change. The male individual she changes into will be almost 100% likely to have lived an strikingly different life than she did.

Alternately, the odds that she /was/ born female is 100%, because there she is... female. So it ought to be practically impossible to change.

Which one is easy and which one is hard?

This sounds like a freak case, but the same thing is true about relatively bland probabilities like "What are the odds that this closet has a broom in it?"

Speaking of which, developing perfects odds - whether you're a book maker or a meteorologist - is a matter of collecting enormous amounts of data and crunching the numbers. A magic ability could theoretically be doing exactly that, Asimov's psychohistory writ small, and it's a very powerful ability all by itself.

Even without manipulation knowing that the ability says 80% can help you know how to bet, but you'll still be betting wrong 20% of the time.
