I imagine the cost to you being relative to the amount of change you want to do to the odds. Lowering the $1 million jackpot in powerball from 5,000,000:1 to something where you could have reasonable odds of winning would just kill you. You might be able to get a cabal of probabilimancers together to buy as many increased probability tickets as they can, but your cabal would probably have an easier time at a casino or the stock market, or for scratchoffs for quick petty cash.
