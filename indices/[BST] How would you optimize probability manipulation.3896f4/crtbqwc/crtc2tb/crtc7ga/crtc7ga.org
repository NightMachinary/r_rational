Ah, so you can't predict the entire future, just immediate events.

I imagine the immediate improvement chain of statistical abuse would likely have you snorting cocaine until you OD as your brain maximises dopamine or something.

Best thing to do is set your self up in a way that you can make a large number of hugely impactful decisions in a short timespan, while making sure that the range of potential results aren't going to kick you in the face.

Good thing is that you'll pretty much be the most charismatic person ever, "saying "X, Y, Z" will have a big chance to endear this person to you", then manipulate the chance. Also 45% chance to be fatal would mean it's really easy to manipulate it to 0% chance right as you're going from 55% chance you survive.
