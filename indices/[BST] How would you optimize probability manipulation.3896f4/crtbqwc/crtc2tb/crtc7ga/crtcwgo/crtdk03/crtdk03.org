  , but not impossible-you are unlikely to die immediately from a single shot in a gunfight, but once you get shot your opponent can just keep shooting you as your odds decrease

Better chances in faking being hit probably, or convincing them you're not worth shooting for whatever reason. Not immortal by any means but direct human death rather than say a nuke or AC130 is a lot easier to avoid.

In the truck scenario, my question would be how reductionist can you make it?

IF you manipulate death to 0%, can you say "what is chance of injury on this part of arm", 0%, then move along until everywhere is zero.

Even if the odds of your whole arm being injured were 100%, of course, depending on how it works it might mean that by the time you get to your last section of arm it is 100% and so impossible to manipulate.
