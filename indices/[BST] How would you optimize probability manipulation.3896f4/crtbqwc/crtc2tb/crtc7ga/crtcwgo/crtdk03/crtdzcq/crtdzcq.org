Exactly-you aren't immortal, but direct human death is hard enough to make a good story, and make things like gun battles an interesting conflict of magic and ability. You aren't Neo, but you can do a pretty damn good impression of Inspector Tequila, and even better the more you train.

As to how reductionist you can make it, the biggest problem you run into there is time. How many small changes can you make before you need to take the big cost for the aggretate? How fast can you think? You can toss a bunch of coins in the air, and probably focus on each one fast enough to make them all individually turn heads. How many parts of your arm could you secure before you got hit by a truck?
