Is there an hard limit or a person with enought knowledge and experiece can influence even quantum phenomena?

I understand the limitation is on the percentange you go to influence but how many things you influence at the same time should matter too.

Otherwise you could do something like this :

Take a substance that has a really high chance to decay in a given time , accumulate it by manipulating his chance of decaying : you can freely produce dirty bombs.

Or assassinate people via radiation poisoning that for non-altered probability would be completly harmless. By the same metric you would be able to shield yourself from radiation if you're in the most skilled cathegory. Only really fast decaying isotopes would be a problem.

So i assume the limitation is not only in the probability altered but on the magnitue of how many things you alter too. Otherwise you could make the villans going nuclear-crazy , which is a possibility ;)
