  Manipulating probability takes a physical toll in physical and mental exertion on an exponential scale. Making a 50% chance come out the way you want is trivial, anything over 20% requires a major expenditure of effort. Some users of this ability can reach 5 or 1% probability, but it risks serious injury or even death.

Given this, it seems like the best bet is to compound 50% chances. For example, the odds of a coin coming up heads are always ~50%, so I can do this as many times as I want in a row, even if the odds of flipping heads 50 times in a row are something like ~1/1,000,000,000,000,000.

So going binary seems like the way to go, until this loophole gets closed.

Simply seeing probabilities (without manipulating them) is almost more useful, because it would allow you a form of prescience. There probably needs to be some limitation on the time frame; if I'm looking at a television, can I see what the probabilities are for a poker game in the next room? Or better, the probability of an armed nuclear exchange, major terrorist attack, path of a hurricane, etc.?

I don't necessarily think that you need to add in limitations to make for a compelling narrative; you just need a big enough threat.
