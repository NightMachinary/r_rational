  My thought is two sides in a conflict, both with the same power. I'd want it to have interesting uses of the power, but to heavily discourage being so blatant as to be easily discovered in the age of ubiquitous cameras and the Internet.

You can always set it in a time before our current panopticon society; I've been idly writing a story about wizards getting up in a huff about the advent of the Betacam and what it means for their society. If there /is/ no internet, then you don't have to worry about it foiling your plots.

How smart is my imaginary actuary? Can he act like [[http://anydice.com/][AnyDice]] and calculate bell curves, or is it a matter of single outcomes? Does it have some social awareness, like, for example, telling me the odds that a woman would say yes to coming back to my place (even if my own personal understanding of women is virtually non-existent)?

In the case that my actuary is working on faulty information, am I still penalized based on the "true" odds for manipulating probability? /(ex. Let's say that I'm playing poker, and the deck has secretly been swapped, so that there are only three aces. I have pocket aces, and a third ace comes up on the flop. My actuary says that the probability of the fourth ace on the river is ~1/50, but since the deck is missing the fourth ace, the actual odds are ~0. Alternately, let's say that one of my opponents is holding the fourth ace.)/

Anyway, step one is to figure out exactly how the power works. Step two is to make gobs and gobs of money, probably by taking 50% bets repeatedly (betting all on red over and over again instead of all on 17). Step three is to use my new fortune to do more interesting things than getting rich; probably feeding myself with as much information as possible in pursuit of getting better and more accurate odds.
