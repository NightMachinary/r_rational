  Given this, it seems like the best bet is to compound 50% chances. >For example, the odds of a coin coming up heads are always ~50%, >so I can do this as many times as I want in a row, even if the odds >of flipping heads 50 times in a row are something like >~1/1,000,000,000,000,000. Exactly. The limitation being that you would have to think about every single coin flip, or take the higher cost of doing all of them at once. Going binary is a good way to go about it, but you'd have to think about it each time you did.

I imagine it as having an imaginary actuary calculating odds for you in the back of your head based on the information you know. If someone asked you about a theoretical poker hand, you'd /just know/ how probable that condition would be. If someone is coming at you with a gun you'd know the chances of being shot, how likely it is to be hit somewhere important, your chances of survival if you get shot, etc. In brainstorming about a hurricane, you could theorize a probability by looking at recent weather patterns. The limitation is what you know about the situation-You can estimate the odds of a terrorist attack, but without insider knowledge of terrorist groups your estimate is likely to be inaccurate. You can predict the odds of a poker hand coming up, but you don't inherently know if the dealer is stacking the deck unless you can look at the cards or try to manipulate them and see how much energy it takes. You don't know if another probability manipulator is changing the probability of an outcome until you try to change it yourself and it takes more (or less) effort to do so.

My thought is two sides in a conflict, both with the same power. I'd want it to have interesting uses of the power, but to heavily discourage being so blatant as to be easily discovered in the age of ubiquitous cameras and the Internet.
