I imagine it as you can imagine the optimum outcome for a situation, in your immediate area (line of sight), with the information you know or can imply. For example, the output for stepping to the left would be "There is nothing that will change overmuch right now stepping left" or depending on the scenario "There is a 5% less chance of being shot by twisting yourself to fall to the left" or "If I step into traffic in front of this truck, there is a chance rapidly approaching certainty that I will be hit before I can react. The injuries are nearly certainty major, with a 45% chance to be fatal on collision. If I survive initially, I have a 60% chance for survival if I make it in the next hour.", etc.
