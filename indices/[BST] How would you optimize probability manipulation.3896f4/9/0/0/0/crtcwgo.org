You'd be hugely charismatic, and even more so the better you know somebody-the odds for the average person vs. the odds for a specific individual with X personality traits who is in Y situation, for example. You'd be rather hard to kill in most ways, but not impossible-you are unlikely to die immediately from a single shot in a gunfight, but once you get shot your opponent can just keep shooting you as your odds decrease. You're unlikely to die outright in the truck scenario, but it's virtually impossible to escape serious injury, where you're rather helpless. You can heal ideally fast...for a human, if you can concentrate on it through the pain, any painkillers, etc.
