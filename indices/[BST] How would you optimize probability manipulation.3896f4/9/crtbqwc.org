  2) You can calculate approximate relative odds by seeing or imagining the scenario.

How long does this take? If I have a binary tree of choices, can I imagine the probability of one being better than the other?

"What is the probability that my life is improved by stepping left", etc?

Since you can then manipulate those probabilities you can create a path to victory ala Contessa from Worm, find the step around you that will lead to your life improvement and also is above 50%, manipulate it to 100%, continue.

Edit: Also this ability would strip me of my belief in determinism which would be sad, but on the other hand free will has slightly more grounds to stand on.
