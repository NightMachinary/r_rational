I'd be down with going full Maxwell's demon. Another post here suggests inducing or delaying radioactive decay for a dirty bomb, which seems doable given time. I could definitely see someone reversing entropy as a use of the power...if they could concentrate on moles of atoms interacting all at once, which seems either mechanically expensive, or requiring a LOT of imagination :).
