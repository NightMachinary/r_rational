I didn't mean it as a definitive thing. I meant, most people's understanding of statistics comes out looking something like frequentism. It IS, after all, fairly simple, and anyone who studied the simpler parts of statistics in middle school or high school will have been exposed to frequentist techniques.

A frequentist interpretation says that if you were to try something 1000 times, and it happens 10 times out of that, then the event's probability is 1%. People likewise intuit that something with a 10% probability ought to happen once out of every ten trials.

Enumerating the possible outcomes of an event, assigning a likelihood to each event based on your knowledge of how these kinds of events have played out in the past, and extrapolating forward from there is very much a frequentist line of reasoning. (Note that this is subtly distinct from the assignment of prior probabilities in Bayesian reasoning.)

Keep in mind that most readers on this subreddit are going to have substantial exposure to Bayesian reasoning, so their intuitions are going to be tuned differently than the average person.
