The frequentist interpretation of statistics states that probability is a statement about frequency, so "70% chance of rain" means "In 70% of days exactly like today, it rains the next day."

The Bayesian interpretation of statistics (aka the LessWrong style, aka the style that more-or-less inspired the website that inspired HPMOR which inspired this subreddit) states that probability is a statement about uncertainty, so "70% chance of rain" means "It'll either rain tomorrow, or not; we're 70% certain that it will."

It's a fine line, but it has applications and /causes a lot of people to yell at each other over the internet/.

Umm, but anyway. Yeah. With a Bayesian interpretation, the idea of "probability manipulation" makes no sense, since probability is understood as a statement about the mind (the map), not reality (the territory). So, umm, anyway. Carry on. Interesting thread, etc.
