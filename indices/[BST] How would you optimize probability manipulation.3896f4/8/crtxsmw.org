You could go kinda meta with this and ask for a list of outcomes to affect in order to achieve some goal (eg. money without attracting attention or killing yourself). You generate this list by flipping coins to create a sequence of bits that you convert to text (which should have a 50% each flip).

If you wanted to go a step further, you could ask for a list of outcomes to achieve your "best possible" (eg. CEV) world even if you don't know what it is. Though maybe it takes this a step too far if you can't visualize the outcome you want...
