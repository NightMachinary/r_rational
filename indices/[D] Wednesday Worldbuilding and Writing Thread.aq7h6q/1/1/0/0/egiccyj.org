I don't think the brain has a garbage collector so I'm guessing they would remain in "storage". Although, I read a paper a while back about some experiment where neurons were injected into an animal brain and the preexisting neurons started forming connections with the injected ones. So maybe the brain would try to form connections with with the cluster of neurons with no references/pointers/synapses, resulting in some sort of upkeep requirements.
