The brain does actually have a garbage collector in a manner of speaking. If neurons aren't used they will rewire themselves so that they are used. This is evident in the brains of people that get struck blind or deaf. Over time the neurons in the areas that used to process information from the absent sense change to start assisting in the processing of other information instead.
