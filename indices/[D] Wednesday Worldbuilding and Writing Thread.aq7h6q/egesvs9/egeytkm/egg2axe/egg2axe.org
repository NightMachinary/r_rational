What about other cultures, say on a distant continent, with poor communication between them?

Being part of the same world, they would run on the same fame-based magic system; but being really, really separated for a long time, they'll be working with different cultures (and the difference in cultures would affect the magic available to their respective heros).

Thus, if (as an example) Light is seen in the other continent as mainly searing, blinding, burning and Dark is seen as cooling, comforting, calming, then perhaps a Dark user from the other continent can use his powers in a healing/restorative way unavailable to Dark users from the main continent. (Sure, there'll be a lot of overlap in what Dark users can do, but the differences can still make an interesting contrast).

At the same time, the new (and presumably recently contacted) culture is a /resource/ - magic users already famed on one continent who move over to the other continent and become famous there as well will have rather significantly more power than those who stick to just one continent.
