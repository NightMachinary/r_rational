What about space, time, electrons/lightning, gravity, and magnetism. I don't quite remember how advanced civilization was in Shadows but time, lightning, and gravity would probably be well-known concepts, if not particularly well understood. I'm not going to pretend like I have a strong enough grasp on the physics of time and space to extrapolate what generating, moving, or altering them would do though ( perhaps something like Vista from Worm in the case of space). Electricity and magnetism have some potential to mimic each other as well, kind of like heat and sound, although they're not quite as similar. I've always liked the idea of being able to pretend like you have access to a certain kind of magic by manipulating the properties of another. So you could generate strong currents in mental rings to produce a magnetic field strong enough to propel a piece of metal or fluctuate a magnetic field to produce an electric current (if I'm recalling the physics correctly).

​

On a weirder level what about Domains based on the metaphorical usage of terms like life and death. You could breathe life into an idea or movement, kind of like soothing/rioting in Mistborn but targeting memes (or emotions attached to memes) instead of emotions. Not sure how this would fit in with genesis, alteration, and movement though, unless killing an idea generated apathy towards it and breathing life into it generated whatever concoction of emotions lead to intrigue and excitement. Could also be used to make people more lively or feel like death, I'm sure there are more metaphors to work with.

​

As a side note, if the intensity or frequency of thoughts about someone influences their fame, a small cult of extremely (psychotically) devoted followers could be an interesting plot device.

Oxygen? It's very relevant to human life, well-known, works as a "material" Domain, and it would probably have a fair amount of creative possibilities and synergy with other domains.
