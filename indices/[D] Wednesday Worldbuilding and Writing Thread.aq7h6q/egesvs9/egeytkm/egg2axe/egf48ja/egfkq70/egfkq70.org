I put a fair amount of importance on the ability of any such system to easily distill a power down into something that can be easily grasped just from hearing the one word it's associated with, which 'Mystery' is a bad candidate for, or at least one that needs to fit within a greater class. Basically, if I were coding this, and I had to make a special case for a word, then I'd probably just nix that word, because there are tens of thousands of words, which means hundreds of corner cases.

I think you can break them out into different /groups/ fairly easily, e.g. "Emotions", "Materials", "Physical Verbs", "Intellectual Verbs", and it might just be a matter of creating enough "special" cases that there's enough coverage ... but it's kind of hard to say for certain without actually breaking it down.

(/Shadows/ always had a little bit of superhero in its DNA, but I'm trying to resist my temptation to just go full-blown Worm, where everyone has some power that's unique to them, whether or not they fall into a classification system, in part because that means that everyone needs at least a little bit of an introduction to their power on top of their introduction as a person.)
