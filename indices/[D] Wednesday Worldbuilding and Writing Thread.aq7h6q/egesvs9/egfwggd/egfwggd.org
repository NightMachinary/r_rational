I've been toying with the idea of how different algorithms and concepts in computer science could (if you ignored a lot of technicalities), improve how the brain works (in a sci-fi or fantasy setting). Basically defragmenting, backups, sorting algorithms, threading, etc. What ways could we implement our knowledge of computers to make our brains work better?
