I didn't even think about how it could effect mental trauma, that would be a huge plus. Another large benefit over changing stored memory is that you could change the method that it's stored, get rid of duplicate memories and move everything around to preserve spatial locality within memories when possible. Not sure how much of a difference it would make, but it theoretically should make you think a little bit faster.

If you could link memories by yourself you could do a lot of mental fuckery. Make it so that you can't remember specific things without certain stimuli, prime yourself to have certain memories and knowledge in certain scenarios.
