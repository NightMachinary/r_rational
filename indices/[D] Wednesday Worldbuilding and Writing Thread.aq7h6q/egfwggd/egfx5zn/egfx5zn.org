Memories (and other things) seem to be stored in the brain as linked nodes. For this reason, it's often the case that certain stimuli get associated with certain memories, for reasons that really aren't that objectively great. The smell of a rose can trigger a memory from childhood, which is a human pleasure, but the functionality of that is kind of bad, since it seems like it's "designed" for a small use case and then applied all over the place.

If you could take a look at those nodes, you could reconfigure the whole graph so that, say, doing diagnostic work as a doctor wouldn't tend to bring up irrelevant memories. It would also pretty effectively allow us to remove a lot of the triggers for various mental maladies, like PTSD.

I think that would probably be enough for a relatively small and tightly constrained mental magic system, though the biggest impact would probably be the ability to remove memories by unlinking them.
