I'm continuing to do worldbuilding and magic system work on /Shadows of the Limelight 2: Electric Boogaloo/. You can read the two appendices [[https://alexanderwales.com/shadows24/][here]] and [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows25/][here]], but the short version is that fame gives you powers, and those powers all relate to a domain in one way or another.

One of the big things that I'd want to do in a years-later sequel is expand upon the domain system. As it stood in /Shadows/, it was ~60 domains, each of them a single-word noun that referenced a specific animal, material, or phenomena.

For the expansion (which either works in-universe as an upset in the alternate dimension meme-beast ecosystem, or as its own thing in an unrelated universe), this means many more nouns, and some verbs as well, meaning that people (in-universe) don't have a memorized domain list along with best practices, established strategies, etc., they have to tailor themselves more closely to individuals. I'm still working through the implications of this though, because it inevitably weakens the system somewhat, while also opening up the possibility for some really "out there" domains. But this brings it back to the "if there are lots of different powers, we need to do some math on power distribution, who's disrupting what, what systems arise from those power distributions, and the powerful corner cases, along with rules for it all" problem (the ITALODP,WNTOSMOPD,WDW,WSAFTPD,ATPCC,AWRFIA problem, for short). That's always thorny.

*So,* if you've read [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][/Shadows of the Limelight/]], or at least the appendicies, then what domains are cool or powerful as implied by either the text, the appendicies, or your imagination?

(I've been sick with norovirus the last few days and I'm on the tail end of it. Hopefully this (and the other writing I've been doing) is coherent.)
