Oh hey, I loved Shadows of the Limelight, though it's been a while.

I wonder if you could have a Domain of Mystery? In other words, the more rumored the person is, the more powerful they become, but the cost is they can't allow anyone to survive that they appear before, because truth is antithematic. They can only leave behind calling cards that identify any particular deed as having been committed by them. And of course, they need to exterminate people who might leave behind false calling cards.

​

Even if you have a lot of nouns, I imagine a fair number of them will be able to be grouped. Elemental, archetypal, spiritual, of or related to the human condition, that sort of thing. Good luck with it!
