From the appendices, it sounds like it might be possible for there to be a domain of something that is part of the popular consciousness but is nonetheless false. For example, domains of miasma (as in the miasma theory of disease) or of phlogiston. If so, how would these manifest?

Alternatively, what happens if a domain suddenly becomes broader in scope? For example, if sound and heat become popularly understood to be based on the same principles, would an Illustrati with a single one of those domains gain the abilities of the other?

Have you read Jayne's "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"? (EDIT: not endorsing its accuracy) This seems like the kind of memetic shift that might be relevant, and could produce a domain of Thought or similar.

I like the idea of a domain of Self, which would allow great control over one's own body and mind only. Maybe they could use the domain kinesis to fling themselves about or fly?

Also, a lot of the domains deal with substances or processes. What about other abstract categories, such as shapes? Could you have a domain of Wheels? That would presumably be substance-agnostic (inasmuch as the substance could serve as a wheel) but would depend instead on how much the substance counts as being a wheel.
