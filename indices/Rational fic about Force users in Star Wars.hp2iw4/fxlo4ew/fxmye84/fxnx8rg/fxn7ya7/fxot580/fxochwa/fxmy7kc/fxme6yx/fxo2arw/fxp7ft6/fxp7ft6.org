I'm a little disturbed by that site. I've never signed up for Quora, and yet it showed me a popup with my name.

Seems to be using my google account. Weird and disturbing.

edit: maybe I signed up and just have no memory of it. But I never use "sign up with google" or such. I'm paranoid about linking accounts.
