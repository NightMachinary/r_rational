I meant more that in most of the classic examples, you get a sense that this is the state of the whole world - eg /1984/, /Brave New World/, etc - whereas here it's just a country that many people don't like anyway.

I mean, there are /already/ very large and powerful countries where things generally suck, and that's normal (for them, which is bad) not a dystopia.
