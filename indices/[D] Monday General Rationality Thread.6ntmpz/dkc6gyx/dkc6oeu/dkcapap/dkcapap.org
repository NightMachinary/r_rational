I think you misunderstand youtube's goals and how its algorithms work. First off likes don't actually affect how much a video is recommended unless you have a youtube ratings preview plugin the only thing likes do is put the video in your liked videos and let you see like to dislike ratio after you've already clicked on it.\\
Secondly youtube doesn't care directly about how much you like what you watch it just has an algorithm that shows you videos based on what it predicts will end up getting you to maximize watch time. As a result it is somewhat less likely to recommend shorter videos regardless of how much you might like them because it's goal is watch time and that's it.
