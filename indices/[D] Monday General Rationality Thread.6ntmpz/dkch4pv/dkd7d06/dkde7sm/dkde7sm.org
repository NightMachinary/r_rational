It isn't exactly hard to come up with cases where the human brain fails at tasks it is ordinarily very good at.

Déjà vu (failure of familiarity), optical illusions (failure of visual processing), attention blindness (failure of change detection), [[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2011.571267][doorway forgetfulness]] (failure of retention), etc.

Those are just cognitive failures, not failures of rationality, and occur even in healthy brains. If we want to get into failures of rationality, well... the list is pretty extensive.

The great thing about the shortcomings of machine learning is that we know what they are, which means we can use them appropriately. Working around the shortcomings of human cognition is a lot harder; it relies on the thing that's experiencing the problem also coming up with the solution.
