  I've seen a lot of deep learning papers hyping themselves up

That is the nature of advertising.

I don't really see a need to be concerned. No serious researcher to my knowledge thinks neural networks can do full AGI on their own; most interesting things that come out of the field require more. For instance, AlphaGo was built largely on a couple of neural networks, but it only became a Go playing program when augmented with a search strategy. Yet the impressive thing about neural networks is that they work so well with so little; post training, AlphaGo Master's top level neural network supposedly makes a darn strong player all on its own.

We're in the exploratory phase of AI, and we'll be here for a while yet. We've just found a well that keeps on giving. so it's not a surprise that people are excited about it. It all seems like a good thing to me.^{until we get enslaved}

  Phrased another way: can we prove a smoothness condition on human categorical assignments with respect to the space of sensory signals?

Good luck proving squat about a human brain. ;)
