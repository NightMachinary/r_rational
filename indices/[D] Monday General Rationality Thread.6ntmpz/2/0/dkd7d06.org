This is fairly frequently mentioned in my experience. I've heard exactly these comments a bunch of times, despite not being in the ML field. Why does this surprise you?

That said, one wonders if some of these comparisons are unfair. It's true we don't observe these weird behaviours against adversarial examples in humans... except of course those edge-cases when we do. Can we really be sure there wouldn't be similar error cases had we an equally observable brain state? This is especially true given the sensory input we receive is so much higher bandwidth than these small images.
