It's not that your life has to be shitty. It's that there simply has to be something you want enough for a reminder of its lack to hurt. If you dangle an image in front of me showing me getting tenure and being acclaimed for revolutionizing the field, it's going to hurt, simply for the regret of lost time.

Show me "the deepest, most desperate desire of [my] heart", and that's a massive fucking gutpunch. As in, loss of composure and collapse into tears for several actual minutes.

Mind, I'm on this sub. After those several, I'm going to figure out that what comes out can only conserve what went in -- that the Mirror is pulling things out of me rather than showing me anything with its own objective existence, possibly modulo what someone else put in. And that's when the revenge starts.
