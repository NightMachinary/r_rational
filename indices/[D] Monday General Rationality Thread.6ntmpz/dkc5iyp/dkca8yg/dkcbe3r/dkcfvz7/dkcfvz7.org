I meant shitty in comparison to the life portrayed in the mirror. My point still stands that not all things it shows people are necessarily going to make it work as a torture device. Some people would probably even be comforted by seeing dead loved ones (like people sometimes say they are when they hallucinate dead loved one's) though I can't understand how.\\
Similarly many people like myself could see anything they desperately wish for and it's not going to make us devalue our current life because we already thought about those things a great deal. For instance I would most certainly see some post singularity utopia server living in which would be staggeringly fun, but the fantasticness of the whole thing makes it less likely to devalue my own life since I'm not going to think anything I could have done would have ensured I would be there instead of here.

Also given the existence of vastly more effective methods of torture it being made for that purpose seems unlikely. It seems rather more probable and thematically appropriate that its origin is probably more of a downer. With some desperate mage creating it hoping to see their dead family again and becoming obsessed with the facsimile that the mirror displays (like many later mages said to have become obsessed with the mirror) or something else similarly depressing.
