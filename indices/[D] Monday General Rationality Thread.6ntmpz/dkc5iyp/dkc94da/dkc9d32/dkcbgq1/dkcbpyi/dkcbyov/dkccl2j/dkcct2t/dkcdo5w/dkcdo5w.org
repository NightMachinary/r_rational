1) I know he heard something, and he saw thestrals, though that could be Quirrel. He could have extrapolated based on him+aunt to get mom?

2) Therapy, memory retrieval as poor man's pensieve, possibly anti-obliviation?

3) Pictures of his grandparents? If so, a super-weak test can be done. Since he didn't comment on how the mirror grandparents and his picture grandparents looked different, we can either conclude the mirror is an information source, it's really good at extrapolation, or it's OK at extrapolation and he's just bad at remembering things. He does 100% see his parents again, the album, lupin and OotP pictures, magic spell connection in 4, and the also probably super powerful resurrection stone in 7(In which they are either saying the things he thinks they would say, in which it's also similar, or it's a spy network and proof of afterlife, which has all kinds of implications).
