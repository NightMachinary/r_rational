I don't think so. Powerful magical artifacts include:

- The Philosopher's Stone, which was created over 900 years ago and can only be created by one person. Nobody ever changed how it worked except by destroying it.

- The Sword of Griffindor. Its functionality did change, but only as a result of the enchantments on it functioning as intended. The Goblins might know how to make more, but we never hear of a weapon with similar properties.

- The Elder Wand. It was never changed, it only passed hands as it gained new masters.

- The Resurrection Stone. Voldemort didn't know what it was, but it's implied you can make a horcrux out of anything. He certainly added enchantments to it, but it continued to function exactly the same /even after being sliced in twain by the Basilisk venom infused Sword of Griffindor./

- The Diadem of Ravenclaw. Nobody ever tries to wear it on screen, so we don't know if it was changed. Then it got eaten by Fiendfyre.

- The Goblet of Fire. We don't know exactly what it is for or what it would have done if Harry had refused to participate in the Tournament, but everyone just agrees that the consequences would be bad. A powerful Confundus was apparently sufficient to make it allow a fourth school. Which either implies that I was wrong or that the goblet is in some sense sapient, and therefore susceptible to spells that directly attack sapience. Inconclusive.

- The Cloak of Invisibility. It never changes and it resists practically every spell cast upon it. Moody's eye can see through it, but that isn't a spell being cast on the Cloak as much as it is an artifact apparently designed to do just that. We can know, to a certain degree, that the eye is an artifact because it was apparently easy to remove and operated independently of anyone wearing it.

- Moody's Eye. A bit player that never changes. Apparently, putting it in a telescope allows someone to use it without installing it in their face, but that doesn't appear to be a magical alteration.

- The Sorting Hat. Apparently taken off Griffindor's head and then never altered. It is as much a part of Hogwarts as anything else, so its capability to give people Griffindor's Sword when they really need it isn't too surprising.

- Hogwarts. Its wards are so ancient and powerful that nobody has ever been able to travel quickly into the grounds via any means. Voldemort managed to get in multiple times, but that just implies that the wards don't have an evil detector, or that such things just don't exist.

I don't think we ever see someone directly change or corrupt what one of these artifacts does. Some were made into Horcruxes, with deleterious effects on those who attempted to use them afterwards, but that appears to be a function of being a Horcrux. They still seemed to work exactly the same.
