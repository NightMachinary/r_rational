  I think you misunderstand youtube's goals and how its algorithms work. First off likes don't actually affect how much a video is recommended unless you have a youtube ratings preview plugin the only thing likes do is put the video in your liked videos and let you see like to dislike ratio after you've already clicked on it.

Aren't hot videos based on likes?

  Secondly youtube doesn't care directly about how much you like what you watch it just has an algorithm that shows you videos based on what it predicts will end up getting you to maximize watch time

Well, youtube doesn't actually care about your watch time, it cares about your ad-watch time. If short videos have the same duriation ad as a long one, having someone watch a lot of short videos actually gives you more ad impressions.
