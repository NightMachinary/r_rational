  Well, youtube doesn't actually care about your watch time, it cares about your ad-watch time. If short videos have the same duriation ad as a long one, having someone watch a lot of short videos actually gives you more ad impressions.

That may be the case idk but the end result is that it tends to favor longer videos and as a result videos on the whole have tended to become longer with vastly more ~30 minute videos than you used to see on the site.

  Aren't hot videos based on likes?

Not sure specifically what you mean since i'm not sure there's such a thing as "hot" videos in terms of being part of the youtube system in the current iteration of the site. However if you mean trending videos or just those you might see on the homepage then I can tell you from having a rating preview extension that a significant number of those videos have pretty terrible like-dislike ratios.

As for my sources, any information is slightly circumstantial since people are sort of forced to try to reverse engineer the algorithm which has undergone significant changes over the years and isn't publically transparent.\\
However the fact that you will absolutely see plenty of poorly rated videos on the homepage and if you're in incognito you'll get suggested videos for videos like whatever you are watching which are sometimes poorly rated. As well as the documented shift in video length (which people started doing because it was affecting their performance) should be enough to at least establish what I'm saying about likes not mattering and them optimizing for watch time (whether ads or video length the result has been the same overall).
