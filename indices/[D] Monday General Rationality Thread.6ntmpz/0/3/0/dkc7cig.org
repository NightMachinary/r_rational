Even if websites knew that you liked something without you having to say something, the problem would remain, because I doubt sharing and subscribing will ever be automatic (or rather, that automatic sharing and subscribing will ever be accepted). And though there's probably a technological solution with sufficiently advanced technology, the idea of a bot writing comments for me seems both pointless and frightening.
