I don't see it as much of an annoyance on YouTube, since I upvote almost every YouTube video that I watch anyway.

[[http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/6m96ur][This recent moderately-popular submission of mine]] has 10 700 views*, but only 720 (648 ÷ (95% − 5%))---not even one in fourteen---of those views actually translated into an upvote or a downvote. On the other hand, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6MlEfXGL9M&t=1051s&index=5&list=PLQFX9B_9L4-ml7MfzU99AzHwhjd5xDjt2][this moderately-popular YouTube video]] has 21 500 views but only 679 (under one in /thirty/!) votes. Note also that FilthyRobot is much more "niche" than [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]], so you'd expect to see higher engagement than usual.

*If you weren't aware, Reddit recently started allowing submitters to see viewcounts on their submissions.
