I find it really annoying how the end of almost every video has a reminder to "like, subscribe, comment, and share". However, the reason so many people pursue this strategy is that it works, right? It kicks at least /some/ people out of their passive reception mode and into an action mode where they're more inclined to do something instead of clicking on the next link that seems interesting.

Yet most people also think that it's annoying, and reddit has (non-policed) rules prohibiting asking for upvotes, presumably because it increases the noise and would result in almost every post on the frontpage saying "please upvote".

I'm wondering whether this is a problem with a solution, or just a problem that has many different solutions that all have their own trade-offs wrt user engagement and annoyance.
