YouTubers' income is based almost entirely on views (or watch-minutes; the difference isn't really relevant here). Subscriptions help because subscribers see new uploads on their YT homepage, leading to extra views; likes help because YouTube's search ranking takes into account engagement, i.e. likes, comments etc -- even dislikes help.
