  It seems rather more probable and thematically appropriate that its origin is probably more of a downer. With some desperate mage creating it hoping to see their dead family again and becoming obsessed with the facsimile that the mirror displays (like many later mages said to have become obsessed with the mirror) or something else similarly depressing.

That sounds like an /inadvertently/-made torture device. The problem here may lie in the word "desperate". If it can just show you things you very much want, but which don't induce any form of desperation or longing, you're fine.
