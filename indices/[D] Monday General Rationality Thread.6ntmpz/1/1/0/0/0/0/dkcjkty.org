  That sounds like an inadvertently-made torture device. The problem here may lie in the word "desperate". If it can just show you things you very much want, but which don't induce any form of desperation or longing, you're fine.

If inadvertent torture devices count then a hell of a lot of things count. Also Dumbledore says /most/ desperate desire which implies it doesn't need to be particularly desperate (such as how it's said a totally content person sees the mirror working like a normal mirror), also cannon examples demonstrate that what counts as most desperate may not be that desperate, but it's unclear exactly how heart's desire works. So going by what people see in canon (such as Ron) it's effects are not necessarily desperation inducing.
