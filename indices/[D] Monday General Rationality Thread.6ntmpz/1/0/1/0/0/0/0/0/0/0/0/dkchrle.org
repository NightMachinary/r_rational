Bad communication, sorry-He sees thestrals in book 3. I had forgotten he had killedish Quirrel, and that probably counted as seeing someone die. Otherwise, seeing thestrals would have been evidence that he had seen his parents. As it is, it's been too long since I've read 3 to know for sure with the dementors, and the movie as well.
