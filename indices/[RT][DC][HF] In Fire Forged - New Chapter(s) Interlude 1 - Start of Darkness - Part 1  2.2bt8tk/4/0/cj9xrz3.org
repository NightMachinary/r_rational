Both. The story is intended to be readable for people clueless about canon, and there were a lot of /very/ significant changes.

There were a lot of things about the Uchiha massacre that made little sense in canon. The Uchiha are a massive asset - where is the value gained in slaughtering them completely? Even Danzo would not be that stupid. It's insane, it's baffling, it's completely and utterly... I don't even, what. Also, in canon Itachi's reason for doing it was really sketchy, and [[#s][far-in Naruto canon spoiler]]

It's like Slytherin is plotting to take over Hogwarts, and Dumbledore expels the entire school just to be sure instead of just the key members behind it (bad example, but yeah :P). It doesn't many any sense whatsoever, and it always bugged me immensely. The reasoning behind the massacre /had/ to be different. I was tempted, in the beginning, to just cancel the massacre out or have it not have been as complete, but in the end I figured out another way of going about it that actually made good sense, working it into the greater "myth arc" plot of the story.

There's also the idea that the entire clan (which was fairly big, remember) would have been in one place at the same time. Nobody on missions? Nobody stationed elsewhere? As well as the ridiculous idea that Itachi by himself would've in any way been capable of slaughtering the entire clan by himself, even not taking the former points into consideration. Here, he clearly had help (the idea that he did it alone isn't even entertained), and it's emphasized just how immense an undertaking it really was. Also a lot of other small things thrown in, here and there, that will become very relevant later.

So, at least... I thought that there was a point to it :P

However, people don't seem to have liked the interlude(s) as much as Sakura POV, which I'll have to remember in the future when I put something like this together, though I'm still not sure why it was so.
