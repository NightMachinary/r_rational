That makes sense. I don't mind a little extra reading but I think most people prefer that each chapter directly advances the plot. Shifts from POV that take give extra insight on backstory or sidestory slow down the pace. Not sure exactly how that can be addressed, but in HPMOR changes to the backstory were made clear through explanations to Harry by the adults as the story went along, which didn't break up the pace. In Lighting Up The Dark changes in POV are used in sections of chapters, not on the entire chapter. That way even if someone doesn't like a certain POV there is still something in the update that they find interesting. I know To the Stars has interludes too, but those often take place in entirely different time periods (centuries apart) and enhance the world building. I don't think this will be an issue in the long run since once the story is complete people will just skim past the parts they don't like. It's just a problem of serial fiction.
