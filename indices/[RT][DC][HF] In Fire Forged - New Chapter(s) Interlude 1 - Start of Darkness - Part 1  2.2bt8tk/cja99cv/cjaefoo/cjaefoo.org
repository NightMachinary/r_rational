It was a suggestion by one of my betas, but I do see your point. It didn't even occur to me, since I'd already put a warning at the very beginning of the story, but I didn't see the harm in doing it just as a courtesy.

... I'm going to have to do that for a lot of chapters in the future if I keep that standard, though (don't worry, it's not going grimderp), so maybe I should just change my policy.
