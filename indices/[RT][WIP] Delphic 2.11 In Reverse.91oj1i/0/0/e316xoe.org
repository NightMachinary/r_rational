It seems to me that that is a result of Delphic's unique relationship with the other heroes.

He is independent, while the others are all part of the system. Having joined it, they naturally have suspicion as to why he won't. Unless I missed something, there isn't the focus on wages within the super groups.

Furthermore, they think of him as a super-AI, and a supercomputer that can do what Delphic can, and at the same speed, would be incredibly powerful. Certainly more powerful than Hector is in real life.

There is a TON of room for misunderstanding and suspicion, but I think that over the years, Delphic would become one of the team.
