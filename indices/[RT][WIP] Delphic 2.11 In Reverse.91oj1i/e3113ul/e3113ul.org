"You solve unsolved cases. " um,,,, i would hope that EVERYONE only solves unsolved cases... xD what would be the point of solving already solved cases?

hm~~ yanno, i kind of feel bad for hector. all he ever seems to get from heroes (that aren't spinner) is either "thanks, but why aren't you doing more", scathing comments about his pay, or getting thrown under the bus if things go south. i mean, dang. even if he /could/ do more, why would he? they bitch at him the whole time and it's tedious work. and instead of praise he gets brow beat for every person he doesn't manage to get to. you would think they would understand, being heroes and all~
