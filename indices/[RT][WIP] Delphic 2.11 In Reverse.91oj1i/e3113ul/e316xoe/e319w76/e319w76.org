that is a thing, but even if delphic /was/ an AI entity, there are very good reasons for him being a mercenary:

computer hardware costs money, and if he lived in hardware that was not his exclusive property he would be giving up /his body/ to his patrons. unacceptable.

his contractor status allows him to only take as many cases as he is able and not be forced into more cases than he can handle.

the bounties also limit the kinds of cases that are given to him. if you hand the fbi the google of investigations they'd start relying on it for a lot of things that they could do themselves.

he has always been forth coming with his abilities and the FBI practically thought he was an employee... so,,, idk why he's considered "unregistered" anyway~~

the wage comment was mostly about pereguine (i.e. LL's besty) being strongly against him taking money and also the whole interview thing claiming he's profiting off tragedy.

actually I'm pretty sure this whole conversation was brought up by lady liberty. refraxx did say that /harmony/ told him that delphic only worked a handful of hours. so she's just stiring up more crap. after allowing him to be blamed for the bank fiasco. hmph. i really dislike her.
