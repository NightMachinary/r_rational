This game is great stylistically. I didn't play it, but, IMO, it's not very good for rational players unless they are confident in role-playing madness. Even with all limitations and without power-play, most funding problems driving the game can be made much more trivial. Ofc it's just my opinion and heavily depends on Game Master.
