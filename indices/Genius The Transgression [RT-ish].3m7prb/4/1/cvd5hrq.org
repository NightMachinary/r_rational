The acts of genius are unrepeatable and unexplainable because they're not operating according to actual physical laws. "Unmada" are Geniuses who have totally lost their reason and now bend the world around them so that they cannot be shown evidence that conflicts with their beliefs. As a Genius who hasn't reached that point, you're just not /that/ bad, but you are still someone who has Problems.

Being a Genius is something that you can find silver linings in, but ultimately it /is/ a horror game, and there's something to be said for people who aren't Geniuses.
