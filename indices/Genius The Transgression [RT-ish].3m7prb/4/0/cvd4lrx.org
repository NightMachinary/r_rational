  "What are we doing?" He dropped the half-finished machine on the desk, just hard enough to draw the old woman's attention, but without enough force to damage its delicate mechanisms.

  "We are creating the future," the old woman said. She leafed through a glossy copy of Alloy Blend, frowning at the garish use of color. Danish modern was in again for robots, it said. The picture showed some hulking Rubix Cube-looking monstrosity with two big glass eyes.

  "There's no future here, grandma," the boy said. He poked at the machine, like a kid moving broccoli around his plate. "It's all just mind-tricks, some kind of consensual hallucination. It's not like we can mass-produce this stuff. It'd be like thalidomide crossed with giving kids dynamite."

  "Don't look at the technology, then," she said. She flipped a page. More stuff on Mars: ruins, and girls surrounded by rust wearing too much makeup and too little jewelry-slash-clothing. "Look at the raw science, the knowledge you can accumulate. You have an avenue of discovery that regular people don't have."

  "What's that?"

  "Build something--a flying machine, say--then strip it down. See what's fueled by Mania, what just works. Figure out the principles behind the parts that work normally. Write up said principles in a sane scientific paper. Submit to a sane scientific journal. Profit!"

  "Would you want to tear apart what you've made, hunting for mundane truths that you can sell to Nature like a photojournalist with salacious pictures? Or would you rather do what you're doing now?"

  The boy looked at the machine in front of him for a moment, then picked it up and set to work, delicately adjusting the copper wires that framed the tiny power plant.

  "That's what I thought," the old woman said. "Finish your robot, dear, and then I'll make dinner.
