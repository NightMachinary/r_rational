Rational horror of a sort

  "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush," Dr. Cliver repeated. "It's a simple proverb. What does it mean?"

  I knew what he was doing. I was by no means an expert on schizophrenia, but I was familiar with the symptoms. Blunted affect...disorganized speech and thinking...No one symptom by itself is evidence of schizophrenia...No one thing by itself is evidence of...

  "The proverb," Dr. Cliver said. "What does it mean?"

  "It means...the bird in the hand stands for your inner character," I said. "While the outer world seems larger, the inner world..." No, that wasn't entirely clear. I tried again. "It means that what you understand is more important than...what you...what you do."

  I felt naked as Dr. Cliver stared at me. He looked sympathetic, but I could only imagine him shaking his head.

  "Am I getting it wrong?" I asked. "I feel like I'm..."

  "You're close to the mark," Dr. Cliver said. "If you were a schoolteacher instead of a psychiatrist, I'd praise you for your nonstandard reasoning abilities, like I was the teacher and you were the student. But instead I'll act like I'm the shrink and you're the patient: you're displaying evidence of a schizophrenic thinking disorder."

  I was drowning. No air. Air.

  "I don't want this," I said.

  "If you didn't want this, you shouldn't have spent all last week trying to figure out the true nature of thought. You shouldn't have started building that thing that you think can glimpse the thoughts behind the thoughts, the syncopated concepts that piggyback on what we call consciousness." Dr. Cliver sat up. "You deduced their existence, and now you want to see them. You want to see the world of Inspiration, to see that light face-to-face."
