  We would do this a lot; there's no reason not to.

Except that as far as we know, a to-the-quarks physically accurate simulation of a basketball uses up a hell of a lot more mass, energy, and information than an actual basketball. We could learn something about the way reductionism and sloppy effective theories work that tells us, someday, that we can "cheat" and only simulate low-level physics /sometimes/. However, when is sometimes? When sentient people are looking? But how do we detect sentients within our simulations? We could suppose that post-AI or post-solving-cognition we might have some idea how to do that, but it still seems like we'd observe a much less causally consistent universe if we were inside such a thing.

Causal consistency with an underlying physics inside a simulation seems to require infeasibly large amounts of resources to have such simulations recursing into each other like a Matryoshka doll. At some point, you either stop having simulations, or one of the simulations starts to look more like /Super Mario 64/ than like reality.
