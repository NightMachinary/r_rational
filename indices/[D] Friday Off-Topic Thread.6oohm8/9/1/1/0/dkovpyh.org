I mean having an AI that is entertained by running highly unethical simulations of entire civs strains credulity a bit too far. I mean why the hell would anyone program in any of the mental traits? Having a AI that even feels boredom is rather counterproductive as is making it find humans uniquely entertainment. Plus even with those traits it's /still/ hard to imagine why the best it could come up with for entertainment is running ancestor sims.\\
I mean given what's physically possible in terms of computing once you have nanotech having enough processing for all this is actually the least contentious part of this sort of simulation hypothesis.
