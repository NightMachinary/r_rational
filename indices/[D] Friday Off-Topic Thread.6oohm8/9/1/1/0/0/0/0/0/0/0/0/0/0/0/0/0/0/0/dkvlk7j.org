  (a) Only if I accept your claim that AIs are only interested in other AIs, which I do not. (b) I don't know that I'm not integral to the development of AI. Maybe I'm going to be a close relative of the person who actually does the code, and a large influence on their life.

The points you made in the previous answer apply here, why not just use AI subagents or something? Like how exactly is it going to be worthwhile to do a /perfect/ mental sim of somebody, because at some point in the future they may interact with people who matter in the context of GAI?

  Let's say that the AI has no use for our solar system except as raw materials for computronium and an energy source in the middle. That AI would still benefit from a close study of humanity, because it cares about how to use its energy with the greatest efficiency;the better it can predict human behaviour, the better it can use a little bit of energy to persuade us to spend a vast deal of our energy doing what it wants us to do, which is a lot more efficient than having to use its own energy for everything.

If the AI running the sim has the processing to justify running this sort of wasteful sim in the first place it isn't in containment. So GAI that's reached maturity just can't be affected by any actions humans could take in any of the scenarios it seems like you could be referring to here. Like it's not going to mine the surface of the earth, it doesn't even probably care about much except gathering raw energy and matter which it can use to get everything else, or gathering concentrated heavy elements from the core. Once you're dealing with the relevant tech's here it makes the most sense to just disassemble planets, anything people on the planet could do would have no impact on you whatsoever, not even enough to justify the cost of spending mental energy thinking about diplomacy. Not to mention if you don't immediately start ripping the planet apart anything alive on the surface won't survive whatever grey goo you likely dumped onto the planet anyway.\\
Idk it just sort of seems diplomacy in this situation seems basically applicable to trying to negotiate with the ant colonies on a plot of land you are about to turn into a open pit mine. Like sure ants are super predictable and you could probably control them if you wanted, but what would be the point?
