  Given we were talking about a mind sim that's absolutely not true, deconstructing /even just the earth/ would give more than enough resources to run numbers of human level minds that are far too large to even really be comprehensible to humans and vastly dwarf the numbers of humans who've ever lived.

If we're in a mind level sim, then there is no Earth to deconstruct and, even if we were to try, we wouldn't be able to get more computing power out of it than is being used to run the sim (because that computing power is simply not there to be used).

The sim might not require more processing power than we /think/ we have available. It will certainly require vastly more processing power than we /actually/ have available.

  It's rather hard to imagine how exactly how you get an AI programmed with that sort of ethical system.

A simple "let anything that can think decide its own destiny" ethical system will do it...
