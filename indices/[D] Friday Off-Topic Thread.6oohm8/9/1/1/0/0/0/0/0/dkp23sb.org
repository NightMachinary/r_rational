  And even that is not a requirement. It is possible that the AI does care, but simply cares more about following orders.

See that sounds like a genie which is a type of GAI with considerable problems gone over in length in /Superintelligence/ and touched on [[https://www.gwern.net/Tool%20AI][here]] as well. Given how easily an AI can circumvent nearly any restrictions you attempt to put on it I rather doubt there's any solution to AI friendliness that doesn't involve actually solving ethics well enough that you can be certain the AI's goals coincide with your own nearly perfectly.

  Or it could be that a percentage of apparent people are truly nothing more than NPCs - competer-controlled non-sentiences.

See this has struck me as the best solution to the ethics problems, provided one is willing to go down that weird quasi-solipsistic rabbit hole. On the other hand this objection also doesn't work if your life is shitty enough since you know /you/ aren't an NPC. Anyway I'm not sure anyone espouses this particular line of reasoning because it's just too weird.

  I'm not seeing how this follows. Do you really think that our world is such a terrible place that it would have been better had it never existed?

That and the prior objection only really work in a answer to job type scenario where it is creating every possible world (which would also place this scenario out of the realm of things possible to speculate the likelihood of). Because otherwise it's rather clear that you could easily create any world you please /without the morally horrible bits/. In semi-realistic scenarios you only have limited processing so you ought to be prioritizing sims where the people within wouldn't prefer to live in a different sim.

Anyway none of my rebuttals are really ironclad merely statistical, and given you said you don't actually think the simulation thing is likely anyway I suspect we don't really disagree.
