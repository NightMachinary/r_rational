  Why on earth would you need to simulate more than, say, two dozen minds? Fill the rest in with newspapers, background characters, and a few dozen semisentient AI-controlled drones, and you can make a sparsely populated world look overcrowded from the inside.

Exactly my point, if you aren't /personally integral/ to the creation of GAI then your very existence refutes the idea of that sort of simulation hypothesis.

  From an inside-the-sim point of view, I'm not seeing any difference between "abrupt end of the sim" and "rolling back time" - I'm just as dead, even if a younger me gets a new lease on life.

Yeah neither do I, but still a great deal of people seem to have philosophical models where it wouldn't count as permanent death. Since in many of the future iterations the sim will result in individuals who are at least briefly able to fulfill the necessary amount of similarity to current you to count under their system.

  Also, there's plenty of other reasons to simulate minds. I can't imagine a successful GAI that stops caring about anything except other GAI, partially for the same reason as most humans haven't stopped caring about cats and dogs, and partially because humans have a dramatic impact on our environment, and while a GAI is not at severe risk from this, it would still benefit from understanding (and, if necessary, directing) that impact.

I would disagree with that, other than as a progenitor of other GAI I can't actually come up with /any/ circumstances under which there's any benefit to learning about lesser lifeforms. After all it won't have much impact on how long it might take you to deconstruct solar systems containing such life. Humans care about cats and dogs because they both have some effects on us, and because we're fond of knowledge for its own sake. However it seems questionable an AI is going to have any reason to care.
