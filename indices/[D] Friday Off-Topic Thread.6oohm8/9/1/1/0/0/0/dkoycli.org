That makes more assumptions than I think you realize.

For one it requires a civ that made AI that only cared specifically about the mental states of members of it's own species, which screws itself since it restricts their ability to change very much without the AI destroying them. After all if the AI cared about suffering in sentient minds generally then it would never allow such a sim to be done in the first place. Plus even if the AI allows it you also need assume a governing body which is fine with this sort of obviously extremely unethical sim. Plus even if the AI only cares about a particular kind of alien minds it might well refuse to run such sims on the grounds that the processing could be better used to run sims of that alien mind in utopian worlds.\\
Also we aren't likely to be talking about a "bored alien teenager" here, but a sadistic or amoral mind. Because otherwise the alien would likely be terrified with how much suffering running that sim would cause and as a result the AI would have predicted that and convinced them not to run it in the first.
