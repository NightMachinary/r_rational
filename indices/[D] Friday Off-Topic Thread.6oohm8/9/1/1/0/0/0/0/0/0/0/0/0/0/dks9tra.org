  Of course the question isn't an ideal setup since being unconscious isn't comparable to oblivion. After all even in deep sleep i'm quite certain there's some level of experience going on. I've found it rather odd however that so many people seem to describe sleep as basically like just skipping forward into the future, whereas even if I wake up from a deep sleep phase I can remember some sort of mental experience before waking up, though not one of great complexity.

Yeah, dreams are a fairly common experience.

  Firstly mind only simulations require that the simulators care about the specific simulated minds for /some/ reason
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. They might only care about how the minds react to certain stimuli, and not about the minds themselves.

  and that they constantly intervene to avoid people noticing discrepancies since they aren't fully simulating parts of the world when nobody's looking and have to try to hide that fact.
#+end_quote

Granted.

  Importantly however as the original comment in this chain mentioned, it means that the simulation is almost certain to end at some point /vastly/ before when someone might stop running a base level sim (which might be at the heat death when there's no longer anything notable happening).
#+end_quote

Yes. This seems reasonable.

  Plus it means something bad is likely to happen to you if you try to create a superintelligent AI, since it's rapid expansion and conversion of matter into computronium will increase the costs of upkeeping the sim within the earth's future light cone to something potentially within a few orders of magnitude the cost of just running a base level sim.

More than likely the attempt will just fail due to either unknown reasons or reasons that look plausible at first glance. But enhancing /yourself/ beyond the level of the processing power assigned to your simulation will probably simply result in the simulation abruptly ending with no warning...

  Basically with a base level sim nothing is really too different and there's no reason to act drastically differently. It's just that our world happens to exist within a much larger one. However with a mind-only sim it means everything we know about the world is largely wrong and that we likely need to drastically change what we're doing especially once we start considering singularity tech.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. That seems reasonable.
