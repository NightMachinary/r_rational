  The points you made in the previous answer apply here, why not just use AI subagents or something?
#+end_quote

It's possible that people close enough to the writer(s) of the AI would need to be simulated at a fairly deep level. (I'm not talking about a single interaction - there a subagent would work - I'm talking about close, longterm contact at a minimum) Alternatively, I /do/ write code for a living - perhaps some of my code could end up in such an AI in any case.

  If the AI running the sim has the processing to justify running this sort of wasteful sim in the first place it isn't in containment.
#+end_quote

Alternatively, it could be in containment by someone who likes running sims. Or, it could be in containment (but with a good deal of extra processing power) and running a sim in order to figure out how to break that containment.

  Idk it just sort of seems diplomacy in this situation seems basically applicable to trying to negotiate with the ant colonies on a plot of land you are about to turn into a open pit mine. Like sure ants are super predictable and you could probably control them if you wanted, but what would be the point?
#+end_quote

The point is getting the ants to do the open-pit mining for you. Sure, it takes longer, but perhaps it's more energy-efficient...
