  I dunno. I can think of situations where I'd prefer to be unconscious but would not wish to stop existing. (The two main reasons there are (a) would like to relax for a bit as by a night's sleep, and (b) would be undergoing surgery and would prefer to just wake up once it's complete).

I don't mean that those people necessarily want to stop existing, just that a significant amount of the time people's experience is a net negative. So given the numbers were so high (as far as I remember) it means a significant subset of those people consider /the majority of their existence/ to on the whole worse than nothing, they have more negative experiences than positive one's.\\
Of course the question isn't an ideal setup since being unconscious isn't comparable to oblivion. After all even in deep sleep i'm quite certain there's some level of experience going on. I've found it rather odd however that so many people seem to describe sleep as basically like just skipping forward into the future, whereas even if I wake up from a deep sleep phase I can remember some sort of mental experience before waking up, though not one of great complexity.

As for the difference between base level and mind only simulations: Firstly mind only simulations require that the simulators care about the specific simulated minds for /some/ reason, and that they constantly intervene to avoid people noticing discrepancies since they aren't fully simulating parts of the world when nobody's looking and have to try to hide that fact.\\
Importantly however as the original comment in this chain mentioned, it means that the simulation is almost certain to end at some point /vastly/ before when someone might stop running a base level sim (which might be at the heat death when there's no longer anything notable happening). Plus it means something bad is likely to happen to you if you try to create a superintelligent AI, since it's rapid expansion and conversion of matter into computronium will increase the costs of upkeeping the sim within the earth's future light cone to something potentially within a few orders of magnitude the cost of just running a base level sim.

Basically with a base level sim nothing is really too different and there's no reason to act drastically differently. It's just that our world happens to exist within a much larger one.\\
However with a mind-only sim it means everything we know about the world is largely wrong and that we likely need to drastically change what we're doing especially once we start considering singularity tech.
