  I can't seem to find the survey but I also remember seeing a survey that basically asked whether at a given time someone would rather be unconscious (basically a roundabout though flawed way of asking whether they'd rather currently not exist) and the number of people who said yes was /disturbingly high/
#+end_quote

I dunno. I can think of situations where I'd prefer to be unconscious but would not wish to stop existing. (The two main reasons there are (a) would like to relax for a bit as by a night's sleep, and (b) would be undergoing surgery and would prefer to just wake up once it's complete).

  See here you seem to be talking about a sim where reality is being run at base level here, instead of the much simpler one where you only simulate the human minds,
#+end_quote

Yeah... running the sim at base-level makes a lot of sense to me. (A mind-only sim is also possible; but if my mind and not my world is being simulated, then I find it very hard to see any proof at all that /anyone else's/ mind is actually being simulated; I can't tell the difference between talking to another simulation and talking to (say) a Simulator with an in-universe avatar.)

  As I said in my original comment to run a simulation of the universe at base level would require a larger amount of energy than the universe itself and thus only makes sense to run in a universe with physics that allow for vastly more computing.
#+end_quote

Well, yes. That's clearly true. There's a limited amount of simulation levels 'down' that we can go from here, but not a limited amount of simulation levels 'up'.

#+begin_quote
  However you really can't begin to assess the likelihood of such a thing, and it doesn't really have the same pressing implications that might be present for a non-base level sim.
#+end_quote

What pressing implications does the mind-only sim have, exactly? (I thought we were both talking about base-level sims all along; I may have missed some important points. I'm already noticing how a lot of your arguments make a lot more sense when talking about mind-only sims...)

#+begin_quote
  I'm confused so what versions of the simulation hypothesis /do/ you find more plausible?
#+end_quote

In general, I find the base-level sim significantly more plausible than the mind-level sim. Any /specific/ scenario under which the base-level sim runs tends to end up with a complexity penalty, but there are at least two features of known physics which appear to hint at some slight adjustments having been made to physics to make it a good deal more computable - this is evidence in favour of the base-level sim /and/ evidence against the mind-level sim (since the mind-level sim would not need to compute physics in the same way). So I think the base-level sim is a good deal more likely; but the reasons and motivations behind such a sim I can only guess at.
