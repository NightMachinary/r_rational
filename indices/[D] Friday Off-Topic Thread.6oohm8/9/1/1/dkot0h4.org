  For one thing there's the question of what the simulator is hoping to accomplish since it seems rather doubtful whatever you're hoping to find out about human minds and social structures couldn't be figured out with vastly less resource expenditure in other ways.

Maybe the simulator is just playing a game of Galactic Civilisations. (Of course, this assumes that the simulator is from somewhere where computational power is /ridiculously/ cheap as compared to here - but wouldn't that be overwhelmingly probable in all simulation hypothesi?)
