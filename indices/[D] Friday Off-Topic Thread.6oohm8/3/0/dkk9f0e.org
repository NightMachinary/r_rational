  I'd like to see a game where the AI usually has an active role, and uses elaborate dynamic strategies to achieve it.

I have half of an idea for a roguelike heist game with good AI. The enemies would have overarching /goals/ instead of simple combat algorithms.

A guard that finds you in a room would be perfectly happy to stand in the doorway and call for backup because they would just uselessly die if they fought you alone.
