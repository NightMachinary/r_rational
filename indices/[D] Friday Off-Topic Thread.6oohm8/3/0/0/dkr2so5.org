  I have half of an idea for a roguelike heist game with good AI. The enemies would have overarching goals instead of simple combat algorithms.

  A guard that finds you in a room would be perfectly happy to stand in the doorway and call for backup because they would just uselessly die if they fought you alone.

Bit of a late reply, but:

No, that isn't what I was describing. The problem isn't about making an AI that is more likely to win, has semi-realistic self-preservation, or tries to outmaneuver the player. All those are relatively easy.

What I'd like to see is an AI that consistently nails that "Clever girl..." moment where you realize you've been outsmarted. Having a NPC hang back and shout "I need backup!" doesn't really do that, especially after you hear it for the 100th time.

It can be achieved with scripted sequences (the 'soldiers shoot through the air duct' setpiece in Half-Life), but I'd like to see a game that does it dynamically.

Ideally, I'd like such a game to nail the following factors for the enemy AI:

- I can see exactly which sequences of actions from the enemy lead to the current situation. If the mooks surrounded the building I was in, but I couldn't see any of them and have no idea how they got there, they could as well have teleported. I won't think they were smart.

- I can visualize which chain of decisions lead to these actions, and which information informed these decisions. If shoot an enemy, then retreat to a hidden position A, then move to a hidden position B, I don't want the enemy to throw a grenade at position B unless I can visualize how they knew I was there (for instance, A and B are the only hiding spots in the room, and they already checked A).

- The default state if I don't move or do something smart is that I lose. If I can stand in a doorway with a shotgun and pick off anyone who tries to come, or use my time-slowing power to headshot all the enemies who tried to ambush me, then I won't feel like their intelligence matters.
