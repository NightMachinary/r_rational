Yesterday I tried the 10 years old game F.E.A.R., which is a survival-horror / tactical-shooter hybrid. The two genres work together surprisingly well so far. Right after I'm done taking out a squadron of elite soldiers by myself, and I feel like the king of the world, a creepy child appears and creeps towards me with a menacing music and bullets don't do anything to it, and I feel powerless and in danger again.

I've checked out this game because of reviews mentioning how good the combat AI was (which is a subject I love). So far... eh, I'm not terribly impressed, but I get why it got these reviews.

The AI reminds me both of the Arkham Origins predator AI (announces their intention and tactics so you know that they're trying to outmaneuver you) and the Half-Life/Black-Mesa AI (feel dangerous because their weapons can kill you fast and they start shooting as soon as they see you).

As a result, the combats so far are mostly a matter of exploiting the terrain to play a game of peek-a-boo, and pick off the bad guys one by one. Once you're spotted, you try to back off and flank the enemies while they're looking in the direction they last saw you. It's pretty fun!

Making a smart-looking AI in a combat game, especially a FPS, is pretty hard. The HL2 combine AI is smarter than the HL marine AI, but you wouldn't know that without looking at developer commentary, because the HL marines are more threatening: they start shooting fast, require your most powerful weapons to take them down (if you use the default machine gun, you'll probably lose as much life as them); the combine never get an occasion to demonstrate their intelligence because they die way too fast.

The Mister Freeze boss in Arkham City was an example of a smart-looking AI done right: it clearly announces what he's going to do "I'm going to cancel the thing you just used to beat me", and then when he does it, it has clear, visible consequences (you can no longer use the thing). Other AIs had similar mechanisms, especially in Arkham Knight (shot down the vantage points, throw grenades to neutralize vents, etc).

But overall, these AI still lacked something that would have made me respect them as smart. The Arkham Knight AI especially, kept broadcasting their decisions (destroy that vantage point, travel in groups so he can't sneak up on us), and it /was/ cool, but after a few fights it felt kind of pointless. Batman's victory is a foregone conclusion (especially with the Fear Takedowns, which kind of defeat the purpose of stealth sections), the only thing the goons achieve with their tactics is making it slower and more frustrating.

I would have liked for some missions where the goons have an objective that you must not let them achieve, and where the AI is dedicated to achieving that goal. There a few missions where the goons are trying to move items from point A to point B, but there's no real pressure. The goons carrying a payload aren't escorted by other goons, even if they were, you could use fear takedowns to get them anyway, and they usually never come even close to completing their "objective".

I'd like to see a game where the AI usually has an active role, and uses elaborate dynamic strategies to achieve it. Not just "the aliens need to wait 3 minutes and then they'll open the portal to space hell", but "the aliens have breached our underwater base's control room, if they manage to access 3 Gamma terminals, they'll overload the reactor and we'll all die", and then the gameplay is about trying to kill them before they reach the terminals.
