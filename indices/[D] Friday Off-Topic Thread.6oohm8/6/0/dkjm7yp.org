  A generic system for creating powers is difficult!

Tell me about it. It took me forever to find a game that did what I wanted it to with superpowers, but in the end I could never find an immersive sim. The best I could find was the narrativist (as opposed to simulationist) Strange FATE, where powers are defined according to what purpose they serve in the plot compared to mundane skills.

GURPS definitely tries to be a perfect simulationist game, but there's just so much to keep track of and ways to break what game balance there was that it wouldn't make for a very fun game. I prefer to give powers a simple rating that applies to everything they do, then players can just be clever in how they use them and roll to see if it works.

Edit: FATE is uniquely well-suited to using abilities creatively thanks to its Aspect system, where any skill can attach a descriptor to something on a successful roll against an appropriate difficulty. You can declare enemies to be /Grappled/, decide you are /Behind Cover/, or choose to light the building /On Fire/ all with the same basic mechanic. Once the Aspect has been created, further rolls can remove or modify it and Fate Points can be spent to gain advantages or give disadvantages from them on rolls. Of course, the GM can do all this to the players too.
