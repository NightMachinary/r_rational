A /GURPS/-style system would be very useful in a video game, yes. Each basic "advantage" (or "disadvantage") costs a set amount of "character points" (experience points), but that amount can be adjusted by "modifiers" based on its specifics (e.g., a laser beam that can be used only under a full moon, or a /Worm/-style Manton Effect circumvention).
