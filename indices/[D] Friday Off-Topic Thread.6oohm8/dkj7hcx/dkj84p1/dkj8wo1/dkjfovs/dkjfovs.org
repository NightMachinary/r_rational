Eh. I've seen it before (though I couldn't name any examples), but I think most of the time it's either very anime and goofy and "look at how weird and original our world is, so different!", or it's a CSI-style "we are important people dealing with important problems".

The Bright trailer has this thing that most (post-Avengers) Marvel Movies have and DC movies haven't (except some of the animated ones), and that Suicide Squad tried to have: the feeling that you're seeing a small part of a big, diverse world; and that people have already seen everything you're seeing.

From their perspective, it /is/ a story about cops and investigation in an otherwise mundane cop. On the other hand, that style works a lot better when there are a lot of different monsters and curiosities for the protagonist not to be surprised at, Harry Potter style.

(also I heard good things about Grimm, on that front)
