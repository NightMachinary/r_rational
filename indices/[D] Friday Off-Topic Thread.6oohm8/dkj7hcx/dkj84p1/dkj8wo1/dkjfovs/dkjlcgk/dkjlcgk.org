I really like that style, taking the fantastic and making it mundane, the problem is that the story still needs to be fantastic from our perspective. Bright just looks like a generic cop movie where they just changed some details to make it an urban fantasy, which isn't enough for me.

Grimm is definitely not an example of what you're talking about, it's another monster of the week show where the protagonist only knows the mundane world and gets exposition dumped on him whenever he ventures into the fantastic world. I enjoyed it at first, but got really tired of it after a while.

Supernatural is much closer to that style, since the protagonists have been hunting monsters for years and know exactly what to do. The anime Mushishi is basically a fictionalized docudrama about an expert in the supernatural helping people who aren't. However, neither is particularly rational.

My personal favorite example of what you're talking about is the comic [[http://dragondoctors.dhscomix.com/archives/comic/ch-7-page-1-last-victim][The Dragon Doctors]], a medical drama in a post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. The first chapter sucks and the artwork isn't very good, but I love everything else about it and it's totally rational. I suggest starting with Ch. 7 and then going back, though it's the only one told from the patient's perspective.
