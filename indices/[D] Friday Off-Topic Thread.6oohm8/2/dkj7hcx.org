When I first heard about the Netflix original movie /Bright/, I was worried the idea would be too weird for traditional filmmakers to handle or to find an audience. Now that [[https://youtu.be/6EZCBSsBxko][the full trailer has been released]], I'm worried the film won't be weird enough to have its own identity or impress nerds like me.

The way the trailer is presented, it looks like a fairly typical inner city buddy cop movie that just happens to feature fantasy creatures and magic. For an urban fantasy junkie like me, fantasy races as ethnic minorities and a wish-granting MacGuffin isn't crazy enough to keep me interested in an otherwise mundane world.

If you're going to splice a fantasy adventure and police drama together, I want you to go /nuts/. Biker gangs on broomsticks, vampire drug dealers, stone golems as club bouncers, soul-trafficking hellspawn mafiosos, cops shooting fireballs at poltergeists...just embrace the absurdity of the premise!
