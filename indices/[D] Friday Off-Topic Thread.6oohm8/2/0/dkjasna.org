I'm okay with the toned-down levels of nutsness, it actually makes me think of a low-tech Shadowrun, where things are fairly gritty-but-relatable rather than mostly alien, but I agree that if it's just "buddy cop movie that happens to feature magic creatures" I'll probably walk out of it disappointed.

The different races will have to have an identity that puts them beyond analogues to our own world. Like, they have to FUNCTION as analogues, obviously, but they can't JUST be their equivalent but with makeup, or I'll feel like it missed its true potential.

That said if those elf-looking people are actually fae folk, I'll probably appreciate something in it anyway assuming they're done even remotely competently. It seems like an original script, which is surprising.
