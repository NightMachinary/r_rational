I was surprised to see so many people reacting to it as if it were a fresh and new idea they were all curious to see more of. At first, I assumed they are more casual moviegoers who haven't cut their teeth on surreal comics, goofy anime, and weird tabletop games the way I have, but then I saw fans of Shadowrun getting excited about how this could fit into the universe as a prequel so now I'm not so sure.
