A joke:

There used to be this town in Arizona that most major truck routes heading toward LA stopped through. A lot of trucking routes would pass just through the bottom tip of Nevada, coming down from Utah and passing through Vegas on I-15, but a good number would stream into the state along I-40 or, somewhat less commonly, I-10. Now any trucker who can stop in Flagstaff in north central Arizona does so, but sometimes the timing doesn't line up right for that so you'd come to a stop in this little town just before I-40 dipped south to get around the Colorado River and Lake Mead.

Anyway, this town was just big enough for a few diners, some small businesses, and a truck repair shop. The mechanic there, he could work on any rig in the country. Your Kenworths, your Freightliners, your Peterbilt 379s, you name it, he could work on it. He was an expert. Just one thing about this fella, though: he was a dog. A walking, talking dog, sure as I'm telling you this story. He made the news a couple of times, if you remember those stories. What a sight to see! But he got the work done quickly and cheap, and he was good at it, too. What do I care if a mechanic's a dog? He was a crotchety old bastard, but he got the work done. Get the job done and I'll pay you good as anyone else.

Now, I got out of the business a long time ago. Probably been, what, ten years now? Fifteen? What with these new self-driving electric trucks, there's not much call for someone like me. It's a good living on the UBI, though, and I don't mind it. I've paid my dues and I'm retired now. Never figured it would happen, but there you go, easy as pie. Those crooks up in Washington finally got something right.

Well, enough politics. As I was saying, I passed through that town again the other day. It wasn't as big as it used to be, but the old diner was still there. Strangely enough, the truck repair shop was closed down. I figured, what with these self-driving trucks, there'd be a lot of work for a repairman. I asked the waitress what happened. Surely there was plenty of work on these new-fangled electric trucks for him.

“I thought that dog was the damn near best mechanic I ever saw. Why'd he close up shop?”

“Well, you know what the say,” she replied. “You can't teach an old dog new trucks.”
