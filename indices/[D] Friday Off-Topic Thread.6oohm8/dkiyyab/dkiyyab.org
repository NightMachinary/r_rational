I'm catching up on Boku no Hero Academia (and haven't been on these off-topic threads in a while, either). Anyone seen it? I'm really enjoying it, especially as an uplifting foil for the slightly nihilistic One Punch Man. The world /seems/ pretty rational on the surface, and the main character actually uses his mind to overcome his obstacles as he struggles to gain mastery over his superpower. And the shonen-style exposition focuses on tactics and how to /effectively/ become *the very best*.

How rational/enjoyable have you found it, if at all? I saw the first season a while ago, so the setting and set-up aren't that fresh in my mind.
