I agreed with you at first, but when I thought about the show's story structure I begrudgingly admitted defeat. Considering that it has such a large supporting cast but wants to keep the focus on Deku's personal arc, I think the series has done as good a job as it possibly can when it's trying to be both a school drama and a battle action show. There are so many ways it could've gone wrong, so I'm content.

If they picked up the pace then there'd be even less time for character development for an already simplistic cast, and if they slowed things down there wouldn't be time for nearly as many cool fights that you're here for. I think RWBY handled its pacing much better by making the story about the whole class, but that series has never had an arc /for a single character/ as satisfying as Deku's.
