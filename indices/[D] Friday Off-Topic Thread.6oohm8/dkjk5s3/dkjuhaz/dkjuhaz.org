Finding out loopholes like that is only “stage-one” deconstruction of the original universe --- acceptable for casual CYOA gameplays, RPG campaigns, cracky fanfics (among which I'd list [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][/To Shape and Change/]] as well), and so on.

If the writer wanted for his modified setting to be more self-consistent, however, they'd have to delve deeper into “stage-two” deconstruction. Using the AK-soulshield example, they'd have to ask themselves “How come the protagonist was the first character in this universe to have ever thought about something like that?” From which point it would usually turn into:

- either [1] “The protag wasn't the first one, the technique just isn't as effective as it seems to be.” → [1.2] “What makes this seemingly very efficient technique so useless that nobody ever uses it?” (at which point you kinda close the loophole of your own discovery and maybe also introduce some changes to the canon mechanics to make it all work together);
- or [2] “The protag wasn't actually the first one to have thought about it.” → [2.2] “How should the world of this fanon differ from the canon to make way for this important change?” (at which point you start rewriting the entire history of the canon universe, like some [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140][Keter class artefact]] to make answer [2] make sense).

Working on top of the canon universe works as long as you just don't touch the loophole-looking things that you know are there. Because as long as you're not touching them, your story's focused on other things --- things that you've actively been working on to keep the whole story self-consistent. But right as you decide to use a loophole, it instantly becomes something that you have to carefully think about and re-design, which is as difficult as (if not more difficult than) doing a completely original world-building from scratch.

This is actually why I think it's so difficult to write rational fanfics for works that do not comply with Sanderson's third law of magic \ storytelling. A rational character would actively investigate all these nooks and crannies that the original texts themselves have left untouched. And with each new such path of mental experimantation discovered, the author of the rat!fic suddenly has to answer one more question about a possible loophole and thoroughly cover it in his setting. So it eventually either turns into a gargantuan effort of world-building, or into a story where the protagonist is only nominally rational and in fact ignores a vast horizon of unexplored possibilities.

Here are two additional examples of what I mean:

- In the same /To Shape and Change/ (spoilers) there's a scene where VD and Dumbledore are fighting each other, bunnyhopping through Apparations, and somehow both end up seriously wounded by stray muggle bullets. Now, in Rowling's original setting the issue of muggle weaponry used against wizards isn't touched /at all/ --- so the reader can accept that this just isn't the focus of the story and move on. Here, however, it affects a crucial part of the plot, and the reader can't keep doing that any more. And suddenly a whole lot of questions rise up from that, none of which is being answered by the author of the fanfic.

- Similarly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9659792/1/The-Boy-in-the-Team][/The Boy in the Team's/]] rendition of the Orochimaru's attack during Chūnin Exam Finals shows how Orochimaru has booby-trapped several important parts of the Konoha village (the academy, the hospital, etc) to such extent that he can completely obliterate the buildings there by simply snapping his fingers. It's explained that explosives can be stored inside storage scrolls moments before going off, so that when a scroll is activated the explosion will be guaranteed to happen in less than a second, and that seals themselves are relatively easy to sneak into enemy village. And, again, I don't think something like this has been touched in canon --- so maybe there is something preventing this from happening that the reader doesn't know about and so can just enjoy reading the story. While here, in this fanfic, suddenly rises a question: if village security can be bypassed so easily, how come there are still so many villages still standing, and so on.
