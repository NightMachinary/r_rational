I agree. I don't think the law is a very good solution because it doesn't really change all that much from a legal standpoint. Especially when, as you said, someone could regret it and change their mind and, unless they asked for consent at literally every new caress, it could technically be seen as a violation. Doesn't really seem realistic or helpful when you think about it that way.
