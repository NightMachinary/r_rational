Well, within the constraints of the (local) legal system as I understand it, it would indeed be much more convenient for everyone if there were no people with weird mental hang-ups that prevent them from verbally giving consent.

Now, I don't think mandatory consent actually solves anything, unless you require that people file legal paperwork that would reliably indicate that every party has given their consent while in possession of their full faculties and to what exactly they consent ahead of time. Otherwise, it's not clear what it's actually supposed to achieve, other than making it impossible for people to play out rape fantasies without someone committing a felony (I'm not aware if there is legal precedent on use of safewords vis-Ã -vis affirmative consent, but given that they are used to communicate the lack of consent, I wouldn't be optimistic).
