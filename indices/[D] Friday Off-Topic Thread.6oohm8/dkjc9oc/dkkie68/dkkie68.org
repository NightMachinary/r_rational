The Worm video game I'd like to see would be a Telltale-style CYOA/visual novel about dialogue and consequences, where you take the role of Taylor and have to make the tough decisions she did. I'd love to see DLC that explored AU concepts or told the story from different perspectives. Speaking as someone who loved Worm at first but eventually stopped reading, I think the story would suit that medium even better than book form.
