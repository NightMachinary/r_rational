I have no manifesto, no new show to discuss. But I do have a spare 20 minutes to the past week.

About a week ago, Wildbow, the Author of Worm, Twig, and Pact, joined one of the Discord servers I frequent and began talking. There, he discussed his idea of a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IkTunIcvDb2Dfhrs3TOyU_JCIa_1DKhfqPVyf_Wl9qA/edit#][Worm game.]]

Three main points stuck out to me:

1. Permanent Death
2. Randomizing Worm Powers
3. SRPG, or an X-Com style input

His imagining for the game is one which is more about exploring the world of Worm and getting into fights.

After some discussion, I've discovered that his desire is based on what I've come to know as the Immersive Sim. Design a world, interface, power systems, slam them all together and put them into a world!

I spent the last week or so attempting to design a system for powers and power creation, but I haven't been able to get very far.

Programmatically speaking, a generic system for creating powers is difficult!
