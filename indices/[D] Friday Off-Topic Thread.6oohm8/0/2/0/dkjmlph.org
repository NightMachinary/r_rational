There are a number of downsides to the bee swarm tactic though:

- The bees could sting you, you would need to also use magic to stop that from happening.
- You would constantly lose mana (or whatever the Harry Potter version of mana is), since you need to keep fueling the magic spells that keep the bee swarm around you instead of simply dispersing and leaving you unprotected.
- A swarm of bees presents a much larger target to the enemy than your body, so it is relatively easy for enemies to cast spells at the swarm to disperse/kill your bees or negate your magic on them.
- It makes it obvious to your opponents why their Unforgivable Curses aren't working.

In contrast, you could wear an ant colony under your clothes, making it seem like the curses are hitting you yet have no effect on you whatsoever. Just imagine, you could calmly walk through a battlefield of mages, Determinator-style, tanking all their Unforgivable curses, stunning spells, sleeping spells, petrifying spells, body-binding spells, etc. since they all hit ants instead. The sheer intimidation alone from seeing you survive all those spells with no visible damage whatsoever would be enough to send your enemies into panic.
