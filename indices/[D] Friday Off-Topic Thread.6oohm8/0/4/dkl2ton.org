Here's the thing, you're focusing too much on one aspect and not enough on others. Firstly just as a minor note, we don't actually know the unforgiveables target souls specially or anything. Details about how they work are very sparse, and the closest we really get to an answer is the incredibly special cased instance of Voldemort, and one comment he made on what it felt like to be hit by the killing curse. Basically, any theory involving them being soul stuff is super sketchy.

That said, the thing is that the killing curse isn't special the way you want it to be. Your idea is that it's bad because if it hits someone else who is standing between you and it you don't get hurt? So what? Pretty much every spell in the entire series won't hurt you if it hits someone else, that's just how single target spells work. What's it matter if it's a cutting spell or a killing curse? Either way it's the thing in between you getting hit, not you. This is one thing people seem to regularly overlook with similar ideas, focusing overly much on the killing curse and not on how if this worked it'd also work against nearly everything else, so you haven't really made the killing curse weaker relative to near everything else.

So the question actually becomes, why can't you just cover yourself in ants and be immune to effectively everything barring AoE spells? Worst case for you is the simple hit logic kicks in and it just doesn't count. How clothing/armour doesn't seem to affect the single target spells, something like a stunner or a killing curse hit you and doesn't care that technically it hit your clothes, it hit you and that's what important. They clearly can't phase through walls or anything after all, so it's not just flying through what you're wearing, it can just affect you by hitting what you're wearing. If you're wearing tubes filled with ants? Whose to say it wouldn't still affect you despite wearing plastic tubes?

Plenty of different ways you could explain it either way, but a critical thing to remember is pretty much every defense that works against the killing curse is going to work against most other spells as well.
