  That said, the thing is that the killing curse isn't special the way you want it to be. Your idea is that it's bad because if it hits someone else who is standing between you and it you don't get hurt? So what? Pretty much every spell in the entire series won't hurt you if it hits someone else, that's just how single target spells work.

  This is one thing people seem to regularly overlook with similar ideas, focusing overly much on the killing curse and not on how if this worked it'd also work against nearly everything else, so you haven't really made the killing curse weaker relative to near everything else.

Au contraire. The main reason why the killing curse is regularly used in the series is because of its allegedly unblockable nature, aka the ability to go through shields. If it is cast and you don't dodge out of the way, you die, period. But if you have an ant colony with you, that's no longer true. The ant colony *does* make the killing curse weaker relative to near everything else, because many (if not most) spells aren't as "single-targeted" as the Unforgivable curses.

The killing curse is known to have absolutely no physical effect whatsoever, to the point where victims appear perfectly healthy, just dead. As far as I'm aware, if a killing curse hits an ant, the ant just dies, nothing happens to you. Severing charms (diffindo) would cut through the ants and continue onwards to cut you too. Flame spells (incendio, fiendfyre) would set the ants on fire, fire which would then spread to you. Water spells (aguamenti) would drench you and the ants, which would then allow you and your ants to be electrocuted, or make it harder for you to maintain your balance. Levitation spells can be used to drop heavy stuff on you along with your ants. Summoning/Conjuring spells can be used to summon creatures which then attack you physically, biting/crushing through your ant colony pseudo-armor. Animagus spells allow the casters to become powerful animals and just trample you. Transfiguration spells can be used to create physical weapons to attack you regardless of your ants. Same for other weapons like the Sword of Gryffindor or Basilisk Fangs or throwing daggers.

  but a critical thing to remember is pretty much every defense that works against the killing curse is going to work against most other spells as well.

So no, the ant colony is a very specialized defense against the Unforgivable curses and other kinds of mental/soul spells, and won't work well at all against most physical spells, of which there are several.
