I was reading some Harry Potter fanfiction the other day, and came across a scene where Neville was shot with the Killing Curse, but lived because his toad jumped into the path and took the hit instead. Which was sad and all, but the Munchkin in me immediately thought: Wait a tick, why don't wizards just carry tons of toads with them!? Just get a bunch of toads, petrify them, and glue them to clothes! So instead of meatshields, we can have soulshields!

That was the point I realized the three Unforgivable Curses are just garbage in combat. They are spells that move in straight lines and directly target souls, with no physical effects whatsoever. And for all that talk about being "Unblockable", it is actually really easy to block them: after all, lots of things have souls.

At which point I started thinking, what is the most practical defense against the Unforgivable Curses? I browsed some reddit threads and found that some other people had the "Soulshield" idea as well, but didn't find any practical suggestions. It is not clear whether you could use ghosts. You could wrap a snake around your body, but that restricts movement and would only tank 1 killing curse, since the next would just go through the dead snake and hit you. The same problem for toads, too heavy and too few souls.

No, what you really want are tiny creatures. As Moody demonstrated, even tiny spiders have souls, and it's generally hinted that anything with a brain is vulnerable to the Killing Curse. So use insects. The easiest ones would be things like ticks, fleas, and headlice. They already normally parasite on our skin. Get your combat wizards to stop bathing and using their Cleaning Charms and soon enough they will be covered with countless tiny parasites that can tank the Unforgivable Curses for them.

Unfortunately, even with all these parasites, it is unlikely that they cover a significant fraction of your surface area, so a Killing curse could still get lucky and hit you. Furthermore, the parasites don't really form a dense layer, so if you are hit in the same spot a few times, you die. Which is when I thought of my next idea: Ants. There are ways to breed ants really quickly to form really dense colonies, and have them live in small plastic tubes. Make clothes out of these plastic tubes, fill the tubes with ants, and then just fight while wearing these clothes. Now you can tank a truckload of Unforgivable Curses without taking any damage whatsoever.
