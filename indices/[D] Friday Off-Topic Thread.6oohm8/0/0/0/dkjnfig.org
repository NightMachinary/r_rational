This assumes that if the spell's "killing power" is stronger than the target's "lifeforce", it continues onwards and continues to kill everything it hits, as opposed to just killing whatever it hits faster/more certainly.

It didn't go through and continue onwards to hit whatever unfortunate student was on the floor below the classroom.
