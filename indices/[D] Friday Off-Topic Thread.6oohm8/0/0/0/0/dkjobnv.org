  when Moody casted the killing curse on the spider, it stopped after hitting the spider.

Easily explainable by moody not really hating the spider all that much.

Anyways, while the answer is probably "J.K.Rowling didn't think of using meatshields," from a Death of the Author perspective, there has to be /some/ reason that none of the protagonists in-canon ever deliberately use meat shields against AK, and therefore the likeliest explanation is that meat shields (as you envision them) simply aren't effective for one reason or another. That's not to say meat shields aren't effective at /all/, but merely that there's more going on in the background that readers aren't directly privy to.
