I understood it to mean that the Killing Curse has hefty requirements that most people can't fulfill. "If you all tried to cast this spell at me, it wouldn't do anything at all [because you can't cast it properly]" doesn't necessarily imply that the spell doesn't work by a binary success/fail model. In canon, anyone hit with an AK is dead. Nobody ever treats a successfully cast AK as anything other than instadeath.
