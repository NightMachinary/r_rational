When fake-moody was lecturing the class, he mentioned something along the lines of "if everyone in this class cast the killing curse on me, I'd probably get a nosebleed. (Paraphrased). Meanwhile, voldemort instakills anyone he targets with it, because he just has /that much hatred/.

Which leads me to think that the killing curse's damage dealt can be modeled as "hatred of caster"/"soul capacity of target". Which in turn, leads me to suspect that using non-persons as a shield is either unnecessary (because most people couldn't kull you anyways) or useless (because if they have enough hatred to kill humans, they can probably spare the hatred to penetrate straight through your meatshield.)

The same principle would likely apply to the other unforgivables as well. In the end, the best defense is to just not be where they aim the spell. (Or, alternatively, expelliarmus).
