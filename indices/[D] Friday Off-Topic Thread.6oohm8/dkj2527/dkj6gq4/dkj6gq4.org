There are quite a few issues to even the steelmanned version of the simulation hypothesis wherein it's only simulating human minds and it's likely tampering with minds to avoid letting people know discrepancies. For one thing there's the question of what the simulator is hoping to accomplish since it seems rather doubtful whatever you're hoping to find out about human minds and social structures couldn't be figured out with vastly less resource expenditure in other ways.\\
Second are the moral issues, in that there seems to be a relatively small subset of civs/AI singletons that would both have reason to do such a simulation and would be permitted to/want to. For instance any AI that cares about human well being is obviously not going to run such a sim, but on the other hand a paperclipper couldn't give a shit about any information that sim /might/ be useful for obtaining once it had the resources to run such a sim.

Of course the most plausible simulation idea would seem to be one where things are simulated at the quantum level, but that would only make sense for simulators in a universe unlike our own with vastly more potential processing power, and such things are nearly impossible to speculate about, plus were that the case nothing entities within the sim could do would really be likely to be able to affect it in any way.
