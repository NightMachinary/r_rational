  For an AI to have the kind of processing that is relevant when it comes talking about running many hundreds of thousands or more human simulated minds /while still in containment and presingularity/, requires a universe with much more processing power to justify which as a serious proposal doesn't really work for the reasons I've already gone over.

/Any/ universe which is running ours as a sim needs to have significantly more processing power than we have available.

  Firstly /time matters/, because we're talking about exponential growth and delaying expansion will mean more parts of your future light cone will become permanently out of reach

As long as the probes to other star systems are sent out in time, I'm failing to see how it matters whether it takes ten year or ten million to absorb a given system.

  Secondly and most importantly however there's no way humans could help you in any way here /even marginally/

I don't think that there's any way in which having grizzly bears on the planet with us is a significant benefit to humanity, yet we're willing (as a species) to go to quite some effort to ensure that they don't get wiped out. Maybe it's an AI interested in nature conservation?
