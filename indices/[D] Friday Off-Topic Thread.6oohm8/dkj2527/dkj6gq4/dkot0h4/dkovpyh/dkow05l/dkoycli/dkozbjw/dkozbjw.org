/Any/ scenario that ends up with our universe being a simulation is going to make a multitude of assumptions. (Note, I do not say that the scenario that I describe is necessarily /likely/ in any way).

However, to address your specific points:

  it requires a civ that made AI that only cared specifically about the mental states of members of it's own species
#+end_quote

No, it simply strongly suggests a civ that made AI that doesn't care about the mental states of humans. It might have a definition of sapience that requires the presence of slood, which has been carefully left out of our universe in order to ensure that nothing that meets said definition of sapience ever turns up here.

And even that is not a /requirement/. It is possible that the AI does care, but simply cares more about following orders.

Or it could be that a percentage of apparent people are truly nothing more than NPCs - competer-controlled non-sentiences.

Or perhaps the AI is simply permitted to run any simulation where the total amount of suffering is a negative value (that is, where, over time, there is more good than bad).

Or perhaps the system was designed by some species with some form of non-human morality, which does not see suffering as evil.

  Also we aren't likely to be talking about a "bored alien teenager" here, but a sadistic or amoral mind. Because otherwise the alien would likely be terrified with how much suffering running that sim would cause and as a result the AI would have predicted that and convinced them not to run it in the first.

I'm not seeing how this follows. Do you really think that our world is such a terrible place that it would have been better had it never existed?
