  Yeah, dreams are a fairly common experience.
#+end_quote

I don't just mean dreams though, I'm saying that all stages of sleep have something which it's like to be in them, even though the mental activity occurring isn't particular complex. There is something which it is "like" to be in even the deepest non-rem sleep. Whereas I'm not quite sure the same can necessarily be said about being under anesthesia, since from what I remember it did feel exactly like I just skipped forward in time.

  Not necessarily. They might only care about how the minds react to certain stimuli, and not about the minds themselves.
#+end_quote

I meant "care" in a more general sense, in that they need some reason to care about any information they could get out of the mind for some reason. However as I argued before it seems unlikely that the best way to get good data on minds would be to simulate not only a perfect copy of the relevant minds, /but also that you would need to simulate a massive swathe of other minds in a civ, that aren't directly connected to the development of GAI./ That's because it's hard to imagine any point to running those massive sims until you have become powerful enough that you only care about other GAI, and even in that case you'd only want to run the sims to see what kinds of programing the humans would put in the AI, so as to maybe get some insight into potential competitors. Though I've argued with the OP that this still seems hard to justify as a likely strategy for a number of reasons.

  More than likely the attempt will just fail due to either unknown reasons or reasons that look plausible at first glance. But enhancing yourself beyond the level of the processing power assigned to your simulation will probably simply result in the simulation abruptly ending with no warning...

Well as I just mentioned it's also probable that the point of the sim in the first place is likely to investigate stuff related to the creation of GAI generally. Or if the simulators have some minds sufficiently weird as to justify running the sim as basically a zoo, then they would likely just consistently roll back time once we got to GAI.
