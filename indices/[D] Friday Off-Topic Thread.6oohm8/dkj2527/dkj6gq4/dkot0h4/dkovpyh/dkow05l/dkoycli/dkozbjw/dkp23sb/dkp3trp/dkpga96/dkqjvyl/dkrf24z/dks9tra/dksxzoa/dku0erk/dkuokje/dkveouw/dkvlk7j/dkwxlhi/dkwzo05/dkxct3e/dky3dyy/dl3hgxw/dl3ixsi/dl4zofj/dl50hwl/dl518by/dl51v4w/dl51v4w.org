  Ah - there's an important point here. Self determination doesn't mean not harming people. It means not influencing people. And dropping helpful grey goo down onto a planet is most certainly influencing people (for one thing, as you point out, it influences them to become part of your civ).

See that's the thing though, what exactly is self determination /actually mean/? Because it obviously has to disregard the preferences of the people who it's supposedly helping if it cares more about not influencing them then it does about helping them get what they want.\\
If you're really totally dedicated to not influencing other civs the literally the only way to do that is to wipe yourself out and trying to avoid even leaving any signs you ever existed. After all it's the only way you can hope to avoid interacting with them. Similarly it would seem to necessitate that you never expand either since people would notice that, however not expanding is basically a guarantee that you will be overtaken by another civ that does, and trying to prevent upstarts from doing so is most definitely negating their self determination.\\
The issue here is that avoiding interfering with civs is basically an impossible and incoherent goal system that's also totally incompatible with any form of altruism. Hell how do you even get an AI like that in the first place? Wouldn't the AI just destroy itself so as not to interfere with its creators civ? Or spread it's grey goo and use it to ensure that its creators never create any new form of intelligence such as future GAI's which would "negate their self direction" as it were.

Fundamentally it's not just that self direction is a hard goal system to design, it's that it's sort of incoherent and seemingly incompatible with getting a post-singularity civ in the first place.
