  Alternatively, it could be in containment by someone who likes running sims. Or, it could be in containment (but with a good deal of extra processing power) and running a sim in order to figure out how to break that containment.

For an AI to have the kind of processing that is relevant when it comes talking about running many hundreds of thousands or more human simulated minds /while still in containment and presingularity/, requires a universe with much more processing power to justify which as a serious proposal doesn't really work for the reasons I've already gone over.\\
As for the GAI creators making you create sims, that is basically the scenario outlined before, except with the added implausibility of pre singularity tech being sufficient.

  The point is getting the ants to do the open-pit mining for you. Sure, it takes longer, but perhaps it's more energy-efficient...

While I think the metaphor still kind of works here continuing with it isn't actually going to simplify things so I'll just say there are serious issues: Firstly /time matters/, because we're talking about exponential growth and delaying expansion will mean more parts of your future light cone will become permanently out of reach, and that you will be able to gravitationally bind less of your local cluster (star lifting is a possibility here). Secondly and most importantly however there's no way humans could help you in any way here /even marginally/. Any energy you spend on diplomacy with them is energy you could use to dump grey goo on the planet which would be able do anything the humans could do but better. To even do diplomacy requires halting the default strategy of shooting von-neumann probes/grey goo at everything or just tearing apart the planets for resources with a stellar power laser or similar.
