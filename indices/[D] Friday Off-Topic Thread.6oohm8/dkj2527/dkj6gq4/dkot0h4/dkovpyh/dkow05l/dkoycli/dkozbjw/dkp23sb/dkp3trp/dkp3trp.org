  Given how easily an AI can circumvent nearly any restrictions you attempt to put on it I rather doubt there's any solution to AI friendliness that doesn't involve actually solving ethics well enough that you can be certain the AI's goals coincide with your own nearly perfectly

Now consider a programmer who does not care about what happens to simulated entities but does care about whatever he gets from the sim...

  On the other hand this objection also doesn't work if your life is shitty enough since you know /you/ aren't an NPC.

...your life has to be pretty consistently horrible if it's /that/ bad.

#+begin_quote
  Because otherwise it's rather clear that you could easily create any world you please /without the morally horrible bits/. In semi-realistic scenarios you only have limited processing so you ought to be prioritizing sims where the people within wouldn't prefer to live in a different sim.

...question. What effect would re-running the universe with a 1% stronger weak nuclear force have on the formation of the United Nations?

Is there any way to answer the above question without a simulation that includes various horrible bits?

#+begin_quote
  Anyway none of my rebuttals are really ironclad merely statistical, and given you said you don't actually think the simulation thing is likely anyway I suspect we don't really disagree.
#+end_quote

I said that the /specific scenario/ which I had suggested was unlikely. This is very different from saying that the /simulation hypothesis/ is unlikely (and honestly, the simulation hypothesis being true would not surprise me).
