  ...your life has to be pretty consistently horrible if it's that bad.

I mean yeah, but I have heard more than one person on this subreddit express things that seem to the effect of while they aren't suicidal they /would/ really like the idea of something killing them.\\
I can't seem to find the survey but I also remember seeing a survey that basically asked whether at a given time someone would rather be unconscious (basically a roundabout though flawed way of asking whether they'd rather currently not exist) and the number of people who said yes was /disturbingly high/. So yeah my point is the number of people who if there were no external factors (like fear of death or repercussions for those around you) rather not exist is probably really disturbingly high.

  ...question. What effect would re-running the universe with a 1% stronger weak nuclear force have on the formation of the United Nations?

See here you seem to be talking about a sim where reality is being run at base level here, instead of the much simpler one where you only simulate the human minds, but are forced to intervene on occasion to avoid people noticing discrepancies. As I said in my original comment to run a simulation of the universe at base level would require a larger amount of energy than the universe itself and thus only makes sense to run in a universe with physics that allow for vastly more computing.\\
However you really can't begin to assess the likelihood of such a thing, and it doesn't really have the same pressing implications that might be present for a non-base level sim.

  I said that the specific scenario which I had suggested was unlikely. This is very different from saying that the simulation hypothesis is unlikely (and honestly, the simulation hypothesis being true would not surprise me).

I'm confused so what versions of the simulation hypothesis /do/ you find more plausible? Because the scenario you proposed is still rather more plausible than the ancestor simulation idea that is often argued for. Though were you talking about the version where we are in a perfect sim run in a larger incomprehensible universe one can't really assess likelihood, but at the same time it wouldn't matter the same way.
