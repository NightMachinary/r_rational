  For instance if a system doesn't already have intelligent life it seems hard to come up with a reason not to consume it on the basis that something might hypothetically arise there eventually, since you could use those resources to run minds that are part of your own civ or to gather resources to push back the heat death of the universe and extend the life of pre-existing minds.

Yes, any system entirely without life would be consumed as soon as the AI got to it.

  Secondly even if there is already a pre singularity civ there, that's not much of a reason not to incorporate them into your own civ. It doesn't need to be malicious or anything, just send down grey goo and help the people on the planet. It seems pretty inevitable that people will come to grow dependant on your assistance and due to the significant advantages of cooperation will for all intents and purposes end up part of your civ. Given most people on a planet would definitely want things you could provide them it's hard to imagine how leaving them on their own is easy to justify.

Ah - there's an important point here. /Self/ determination doesn't mean not /harming/ people. It means not /influencing/ people. And dropping helpful grey goo down onto a planet is most certainly influencing people (for one thing, as you point out, it influences them to become part of your civ).
