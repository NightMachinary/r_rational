  how do we detect sentients within our simulations
#+end_quote

When they try to query something. We already have simplifications of more complex processes that work as well as those more complex process (the one that jumps out to me is the coefficient of friction---when calculating with friction, we don't have to look at things like electromagnetism). The simulation could sum up the results of complicated internal processes using simpler equations, so those things could have causal consistency with things around them while still being able to spew out the individual components of the internal processes when something (a sentient being, for instance) queries them.

  seems to require infeabily large amounts of resources to have such simulations recursing into each other

If I'm not misunderstanding what you're saying here, that's my point: it takes so much energy to have recursive simulations that if one ever reached this point it would just be shut down, so if we assume ourselves to be in a simulation should we also assume that would happen to us? I know we haven't /quite/ reached the point of assuming we're in a simulation, but it's a definite possibility.
