I've only watched up to halfway through season 2 because I'm waiting to binge the rest of the dub when it's complete, but so far I've quite liked it. It's a good shonen anime that will appeal to young boys while tackling themes that challenge them but is just mature and intelligent enough for adults to enjoy, so [[https://66.media.tumblr.com/0acaafa9948a77d038422c8c37b31404/tumblr_o96wq8LpCY1ujb0aho1_1280.jpg][I'm happy it's gained the popularity that it has.]]

In term of its artistic merit, I find its take on the superhero genre to be interesting in how it blends ideas from both American and Japanese culture. The Youtube channel Mother's Basement has done two editorials about the show so far, [[https://youtu.be/8WDwBgjbRT4][exploring how it reflects cultural changes in the target audience]] and [[https://youtu.be/LmRfmJqE0kM][how it uses the superhero genre to deliver relevant social commentary]], which I recommend viewing.

This series is going to be a long runner and I'm ready to follow it. The show definitely isn't my favorite action anime and I've yet to see the show do something I haven't seen done better elsewhere, but it does everything it needs to do pretty darn well and has been consistently entertaining with just enough surprises and hidden depth.

The only real complaint I have is that some of the female characters are objectified unironically, but even that is less distracting and more self-aware than many anime I've seen. I wish some of the side characters were more interesting, but the show at least makes an effort to give them depth and has to keep the focus on Deku and All-Might in order to maintain good pacing.

My one totally subjective nitpick is that the theme of Deku as an underdog is getting a tad repetitive with him just barely succeeding in /every single situation/, which I can see resonating with other people but doesn't appeal to an autistic savant like me. All-Might's struggle to live up to his own standards is what clicks with me, so he's my favorite member of the cast.

In the end, My Hero Academia is a 4 out of 5 from me, but that's hardly a detraction against it. It's a world I want to dive into filled with characters I want to see more of and delivers on the emotional satisfaction it promises. As shonen-style shows go, I prefer RWBY, but this is still a fandom I'm happy to be part of and am always willing to discuss the series with other fans.
