So, some of you probably noticed the Erogamer story posted here recently and in a comment thread prior. I started reading it and stopped because I lost interest in it. I want to discuss something that occurs in the story, so *spoilers and NSFW content ahead*.

I've put a link a bit further down, but here's the context you need to interpret that link if you haven't read that story: [[#s][]]

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EvxfLESwTN6E6_Jgw1qB9rGeKQZZ-DO4zZ5t2ZTcQwE/edit?usp=sharing][Here's the ensuing discussion/self reflection. It takes place in chapter 1.6, /Morning After/, of the story.]]

It's a ~950 word section, a quick read. Just wanted to know what some of your thoughts were on this piece and what it says about explicit/implicit consent. I'm interested enough in hearing your thoughts that I may repost this comment to next week's thread, considering I'm 2 days late to this one. We'll see how it goes.

EDIT: Just to clarify; I did not lose interest with this story because of this particular event.
