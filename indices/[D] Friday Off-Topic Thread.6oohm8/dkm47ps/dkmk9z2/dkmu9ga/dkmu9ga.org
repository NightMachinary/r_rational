Interesting! I didn't imagine things from a legal point of view.

I think mandatory consent is one of those things that works better on a more flexible, emotional level than a strictly legal one. The idea is that no one gets (or feels as if they have been) assaulted. Or unknowingly commits assault. Of course, very little prevents someone from turning around and claiming they didn't get consent to charge someone as there's not usually a witness to that sort of thing. But I still feel that it's a policy in place to try and shield people from doing something they're uncomfortable with.
