Well, the problem is: what situation does it make a difference in? To me it seems like the precise set of circumstances in which the legal requirement to explicitly get verbal affirmative consent would make a difference is rather small.

Since it's not recorded, it does not remove the issue of parties disagreeing about what happened or someone lying. Drugging someone to the point where they can no longer reason and then having sex with them is covered already without affirmative consent law, I think, so it doesn't help there. One would have to be pretty conscious of the possibility of legal trouble to even remember about it when they're about to have sex, and, frankly, if you're worried enough about legal repercussions to remember to ask for explicit verbal consent, then you're probably worried enough not to risk it in the first place. Not like there is any actual admissible evidence that you got said consent, in case you get accused, after all. What problem is this supposed to solve? Teenage people agreeing to have sex in the heat of the moment and then feeling ashamed the next morning and claiming they didn't want it in the first place? I suppose some people at least would accurately recall that they had given it when it's verbal and explicit and wouldn't consciously choose to lie about it. What I'd really want to see is some reliable data on what difference the law made, but that's obviously not gonna happen.

Making sure your parters are alright with what you're doing is extremely important on all levels. I'm just not sure the particular implementation they went for in cali solves more problems than it creates. Thankfully the trade-off isn't horrible for /most/ people (I hope, but I've heard some anecdotal evidence that indicates otherwise), but there are probably some people who /do/ have mental hang-ups, or, hell, what if you want to be gagged and restrained while someone fucks you silly? It's a pretty thorny issue no matter how you try to handle it. What if you were alright with it and verbally (or even in writing) consented before you were gagged, but then changed your mind once you were restrained? Can one even consent to something like "keep doing it even if I change my mind", in legal sense or otherwise?
