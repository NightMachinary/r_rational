So, I'm trying to get a plot skeleton for an urban fantasy werewolf novel I may or may not end up writing.

One of the two potential main characters is a "supernatural lawyer" - basically, she helps any local supernatural creatures ("sups") navigate the law. This can be anything from stealing identities, doing immigration paperwork, that sort of thing, or it can be stuff like telling a vampire client who was done for murder that it will be "only 20 years" and arranging for them to get special treatment with no exposure to the sun for their "medical issues".

I am thinking a good story to tell might be the story of her "getting her big break" - my current headcanon is that she defended a siren in a high-profile murder investigation, lost the case, but got that siren some special treatment that they really needed during the sentencing (house arrest? got a dietitian to sign off on the siren getting an all-meat diet due to some "medical condition"?), and that made her well-known to sups.

But I think that's not very interesting. I think it might be more interesting to tell a story of how she helped a sup /integrate/ into society (you know, "we don't kill and eat people. you WILL get noticed."/"you fed someone a burger with human meat you bought on the black market and now they have kuru? let's make sure that it never gets back to you" - that sort of thing).

But I don't know, I'm too steeped in my tiny little corner of my brain and I think I need to be poked by external forces. So I'd love some help with the brainstorming thing to get me thinking of other things.

So, my question this week:

If there was a lawyer who dealt with supernatural creatures, specifically in helping them operate in society in a human-ish manner, what sort of things would the lawyer deal with?
