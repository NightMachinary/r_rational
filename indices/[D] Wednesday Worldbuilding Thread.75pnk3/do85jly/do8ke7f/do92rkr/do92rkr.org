What I like about this idea is that it rationalized why people would to want to inhabit human bodies if they can download their mind into anything. It gives justification for a person's body to be seen as a status symbol, like how it is in the setting Eclipse Phase.

In EP, it's much cheaper to live in the cloud without a permanent body and simulations are so advanced that I wondered why nearly everyone either has or wants an expensive organic body. Now there's an explanation that isn't all irrational bias.

Humans aren't just sentimental about our natural forms or prejudiced against artificial options, we're simply concerned over much influence our body has over our mind and whether that means our body is an intrinsic part of our identity.

Maybe I find this a more interesting question than most people because I have never viewed my body as an intrinsic part of my identity and wholeheartedly welcome the possibilities transhumanism presents, but discoveries about the microbiome could challenge that view.
