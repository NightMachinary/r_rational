/Yes, period./ This is one of those Embodied Mind things. A fair portion of the signals coming into your brain, /especially/ the reward/value signals, are interoceptive signals about the state of your body's internals. That is actually where your emotions are coming from.

You're going to need a reasonably well-simulated biochemistry to get a reasonably well-simulated experience of being /human/, even mentally human/oid/.
