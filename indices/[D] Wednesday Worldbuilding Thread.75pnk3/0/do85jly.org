After watching [[https://youtu.be/VzPD009qTN4][this video]] about the effect bacteria in our gut has on our bodies and minds, I got to wondering what implications this could have on transhumanist sci-fi scenarios. Would the psychology of uploads be fundamentally different if they didn't have complete simulated biochemistry? Could the relationship between bacteria and humans be used as a model for the sociological relationship between humans and singularity AIs?

The former question leads me to envision a future where humans can live comfortably as digital uploads in a simulated environment, but scarcity over processing power results in people paying extra to inhabit biological bodies. They see the influence their biology has over their mind as an aspect of their self that they couldn't otherwise experience. Thus, we have a disparity between social classes.

The latter question makes me think of some weird combination of space opera and Osmosis Jones. The galaxy is ruled by superintelligent AIs but humans live in relative autonomy and operate an economy that produces/refines things the AIs value. Each planet, city, or district functions as a living organism in a symbiotic relationship with its different classes of residents while interacting with other AIs the same way humans interact with each other.

Put the two ideas together, and we have a reason why AIs wouldn't just assimilate everyone into a hive mind uploaded into solar system-sized supercomputers. To do so would mean denying themselves potentially valuable sensations or cognitive functions, possibly turning them into ruthless optimization machines that would be destroyed for violating the social contract with other singularity minds. What do you guys think?
