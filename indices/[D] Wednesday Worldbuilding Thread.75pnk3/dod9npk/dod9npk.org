After reading Please Understand Me 2, a book on Kiersey's take on temperament, which I think is much more empirical than the MBTI since it focuses on observing human behavior than introspection on one's feelings, I got a weird idea for a relatively more rational take on the houses of Harry Potter.

Kiersey divided the 16 temperaments into 4 groupings, each with their own list of stuff and a mythological ideal which represents the category.

Grffindor - Artisan Known as the Dionysian temperament, they live in the moment, and desire freedom and adventure.

Hufflepuff - Guardian Known as the Epimethean temperament, they are hard working, and focused on heritage and the community.

Ravenclaw - Rational Known as the Promethean temperament, they are focused on understanding the world, and continuing progress.

Slytherin - Idealist Known as the Apollonian temperament, they are focused on self-actualization, and on the values and ideas that give meaning to one's life.

I have no idea what to do with the idea but I'm not surprise to find Slytherin being the idealist house. To strive for an ideal will make one do things both terrific and terrible to reach it.
