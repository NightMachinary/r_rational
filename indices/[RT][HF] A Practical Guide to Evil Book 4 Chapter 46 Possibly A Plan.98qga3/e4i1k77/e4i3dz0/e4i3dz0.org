I dunno. Surely Malicia knows that Cat is also the Queen of the Wild Hunt and should be able to summon them. I'd be disappointed if Malicia didn't have countermeasures against the Hunt in place too. They'd probably end up being a distraction for Cat's real trump card.

Speaking of trump cards, is Thief officially a villain now, or is she always neutral, or can she switch back and forth as needed? As a Named of Callow, facing the Dread Empress of Praes, maybe she can switch back to Good for a moment and claim a BS power up to use against the arch-nemesis of her people.
