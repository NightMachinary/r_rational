Invisible crossbow is definitely talking about Archer, and since she hasn't appeared till now, I suspect she will be playing that role. Their plans are messed up enough that Archer probably has a different timing on when to come out compared to what Catherine wants, or she might be somewhere ahead.

Wards for archer are because archer uses her name skills to power her arrows, which can be warded against. Thief is just using regular arrows, which are most likely non-magical and hence can simply go through wards.
