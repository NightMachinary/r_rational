I don't think that's the reason. It's stated several times that Archer has special arrows that pierce wards, and we know that mages can generate shields against physical objects as well as magical ones. It would be pretty foolish of them to be so focused on anti-Archer wards that they don't include a physical shield as well.

My guess is that either Thief borrowed a special arrow (it was meant to hit Malicia, after all), or the mages were so focused on Cat that they couldn't spare any power to shield themselves.

EDIT: Found the [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/08/02/interlude-apprentice/][exact interlude]] where they explain her special arrows.
