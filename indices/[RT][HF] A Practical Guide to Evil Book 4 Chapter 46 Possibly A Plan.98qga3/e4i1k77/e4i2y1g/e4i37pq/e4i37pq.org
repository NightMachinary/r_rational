If they have wards against Archer, how can Thief successfully land hits with a common bow and arrow? Surely the wards aren't just protecting only Malicia since they need the mages to hold Catherine down.

Is the Wild Hunt supposed to be her "invisible crossbow"? Isn't summoning them just one of her regular powers? Even if she can only do it once or for a limited number of times, it's not really strange enough to require all the obfuscation since even without seer powers her enemies should be expecting them.
