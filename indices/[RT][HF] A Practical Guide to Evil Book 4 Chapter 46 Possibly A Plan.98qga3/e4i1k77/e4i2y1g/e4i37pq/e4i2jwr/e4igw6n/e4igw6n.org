Malicia won't be impressed, no. If anything, she'll loathe Cat even more. The Dread Empress has only disdain for swords, even her own Black Knight wasn't spared her saying "nice going kid, you killed someone again, now adults have to clean up the mess again". People are tools, you see, and disposing of one is failure. And performing said disposal inelegently is the sign of the dim-witted and the incompetent.

No, seriously, Malicia won't be impressed. But she may re-evaluate Catherine's threat level upward.
