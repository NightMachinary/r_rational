You may freely call me a bleeding-heart for it, but I really love that this story endorses Emma's desire for, so to speak, universal salvation.

I was worried that Lewis' death would be a "wake-up call" for Emma that no, you just gotta be a cold-hearted emmereffer to survive in this world, and it is really, really nice to see that this is not so and that, even in the face of Norman's plan and the logic of it all, Emma is still committed to a world where humans /and/ demons are saved.
