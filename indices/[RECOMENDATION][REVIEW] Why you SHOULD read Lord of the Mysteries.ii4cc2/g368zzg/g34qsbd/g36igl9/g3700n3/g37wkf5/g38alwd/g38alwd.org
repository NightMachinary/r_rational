I am rather enjoying reading this story (I've stuck with it for over a thousand chapters!!), and I am sharing my honest thoughts on it, so it is unfair of you to accuse me of trying to misrepresent it. What I said is information I would have liked to have known going in, and that others may benefit from. Whether it's once every 10 chapters or once every 20, the transphobia is perennial enough that it becomes something of a rhythm within the story.

It is subtle and gentle enough that one could *very* generously read it as not having that problem at all, but that would be stretching things just to turn a blind eye. At the very least it was written without delicacy or understanding of trans issues, despite insisting on delving into related topics in a fairly dismissive and perversely intrusive manner, all the while being influenced by wider anti-trans philosophy.

To be fair to the story, despite the ongoing theme surrounding the relevant pathways, I did not expect a naturally trans person to show up at all, and when one did many hundreds of chapters in, while she wasn't understood well or fully accepted by the author nor by the other characters in the story, she at least was not unnecessarily maligned, and was treated as human (except by those who were clearly exploiting her, and properly framed as in the wrong). So there is that.
