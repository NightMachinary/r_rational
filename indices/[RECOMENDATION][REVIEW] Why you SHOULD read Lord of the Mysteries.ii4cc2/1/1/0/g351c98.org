here's the problem dude, I haven't read a single chinese or korean novel since A Will Eternal was completed in wuxiaworld and even then that was the only one I was reading, this was barely after the webnovel model changes so I have no idea what pages are currently the most used to get around that problem. so that answer is not exactly helpful.
