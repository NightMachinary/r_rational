The power fantasy and progression is pretty good, though it does fall to the standard asshole-protagonist-murders-and-exploits-lots-of-people-and-creatures-but-it's-justified-cuz-he's-the-protagonist(and somehow he's still a good guy cuz of that one good thing he does that he gets to congratulate himself over) framing that we've come to expect from the genre.

In order to gain power in this setting you have to eat lots and lots of sapient beings, including humans.

I'm on chapter 1000 or so, and the main things that bother me are the casual transphobia every ten chapters or so (which is bad enough that I've vowed to never give the author money in any way), and the anachronistically jarring fact that they play Texas Hold-Em in a Victorian-esque setting (and the translation even calls it "texas").

It's also in this odd place economically where it's both very cognizant about the plight of the poor and the environmental issues resulting from unfettered capitalism, but is also very adoring of money and capital. Combined with the transphobia and attitude towards animals etc, politically it's all very conservative Chinese.

The translation is a little janky, which might bother some people, but I don't mind; I like to think it's pretty clear to me the times when something is an artifact of the original language that didn't get ironed out in the adaptation, and to some extent I actually prefer it that way.

Some odd frequently-used words: Glabella. Genuflect.
