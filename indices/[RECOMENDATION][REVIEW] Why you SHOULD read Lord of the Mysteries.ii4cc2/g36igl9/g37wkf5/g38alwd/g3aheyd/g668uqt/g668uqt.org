I am now very close to the end of the story, and instances of transphobia definitely taper off after chapter 1000 or so, so I can understand someone who has finished the story and was not particularly affected by the earlier instances might say the story is not transphobic, because of the availability heuristic -- the most recent 400 chapters they read of it are mostly fine in that regard.

Unrelatedly, a different complaint I had has been resolved, but I won't explain cuz spoilers.

EDIT: I have now finished the entire book. I rather enjoyed the ending, but I can't say I look forward to the sequel since it will apparently heavily involve the hunter/demoness pathways and I do not trust this author to handle that in anything approaching an appropriate manner.
