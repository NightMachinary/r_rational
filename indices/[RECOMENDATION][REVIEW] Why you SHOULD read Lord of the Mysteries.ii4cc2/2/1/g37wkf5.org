The novel isn't transphobic. Dont try to completely misrepresent the entire story. With over 1300 chapters, you can count on one hand the instances where that could happen, which is hardly every 10 chapters. And in those scenes, you don't have to interpret it as transphobia. Especially since it involves a character physically transforming into the other sex, for the purpose of gaining a power level. And they do this by conducting sketchy rituals, and risk losing control of their mind and turning into a monster.
