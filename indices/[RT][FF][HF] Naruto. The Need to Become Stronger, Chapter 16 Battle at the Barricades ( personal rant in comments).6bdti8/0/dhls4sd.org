The following is reposted from fanfiction.net:

*A/N:* I just received word that my grandmother is in the hospital. She has always been an unbelievably strong, laconic woman in my eyes, with an ability to laugh at injuries that made me shiver just to hear them described. At one time, she told me she was in so much pain that she couldn't stand for three days because the night before she had crawled around on her (severely injured) knees to turn of the standby button on the TV - because she was afraid it would take up too much power if she left it on all night - and yet she was more upset when I told her afterwards what a stupid thing that was to do. And then she went straight into the kitchen to cook for me anyway, because after all I had come all that way just to see her. Another time, she was operated on her leg, and she spent the entire time (awake) joking with the surgeon about how funny it looked. I don't know if it's because she survived the war or if it's because she grew up differently or if she was just that crazy a person, but I always admired her attitude. She used to say that she didn't really mind pain as long as she has her family - she absolutely hated the idea of being lonely you see, and she was terrified of growing senile and losing all of her memories (she would proudly remind everyone of the endless french poems which she could recall by heart), but pain, pain she could handle.

So of course she got a brain tumor, and now she stands to face her absolute worst nightmare: Forced into a foreign place far away from home, not knowing where she is or what's going on and sometimes forgetting even the names of her own children. Because fuck reality, that's why.

So, this would probably be a good time to remind everyone that we're all living in a nightmarish deathworld, one far worse than I or any other author could possibly come up with, through the sheer virtue of such a thing being real. The sheer horror of it is difficult to comprehend, and I do believe we were evolved specifically to be unable to understand it for the sake of our own sanity - for like a monster straight out of the Cthulhu mythos, it can drive you to despair if you look at it too closely. And yet, you have to remember that these things do not go away just because you don't think about them, as one day they will come for you as well.

I haven't talked about it much, but one of the reasons I started writing rational fanfiction was because I hoped I could help with Eliezer Yudkowsky's efforts to make the world a saner place by teaching rationality through fiction. And my decision to pursue a finance career was partly inspired by the hope that one day I could amass enough resources to maybe help in the effort to fight back against this sort of thing. I dunno. Maybe I just watched too much Naruto as a kid, but the idea of just doing nothing and waiting for everyone to die seems maddening to me.

All right, enough self-indulgence. Thanks for letting me rant for a bit, guys. We now return to your (ir)regularly scheduled weekly dose of fantastical escapism - sorry, I mean Naruto fanfiction.
