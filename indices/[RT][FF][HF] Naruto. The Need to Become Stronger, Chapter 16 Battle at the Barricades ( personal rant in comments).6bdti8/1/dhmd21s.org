By the way, I thought it might be a nice idea to share my original beta reader feedback with you guys, since the guy really knows what he's talking about and it might be interesting for other writers here as well. I didn't add up implementing this (fragment of his) advice in this particular case because it took too much effort to try and rewrite it all (actually having to publish things is also an important lesson) but I think it's very good:

Re: Naruto's breakdown

  Stil, I think you can do better. Add some self-doubt, don't make a joke of it. This is a significant and defining character-moment. Make it count, by changing it to something like this:

  Was he really being cowardly? Naruto's gaze fell on one of the villagers huddling near the barricades, clumsily clutching a spear and startling at every loud noise. He wasn't like that, it was a sound tactical decision to...

  “Well? What are you waiting for?” Sakura scowled at him, her face distorted in hot anger quite unlike the girl he thought he knew. “GO!”

  He went.

  It wasn't a conscious decision, not really. It was more like there were no other choices. Not if he ever wanted to stop Sakura from looking at him like... that. Somehow, facing the enemy was the lesser terror in comparison.

  So yeah. I like parts of this but think you can do better when it comes to a] Humanising the extra's, and b] making Naruto's reactions and emotions tangible. We have to feel it. Even more: we have to feel something, when reading this. Sakura's section accomplished this, Naruto's doesn't.

  Of course, you don't want to hit the same beat several times in a row, which is a risk when you describe the fighting scenes of each character in turn. One way out would be to, well, NOT describe all of them. You could only do Naruto and keep the other two mysterious, only showing bits of their reactions through Naruto's eyes, and then later bringing it up in conversation or flashbacks. But that'd require a lot of rewriting.

  Alternately, make sure that their reactions are sufficiently different that it is interesting. So far, you're doing pretty well on that. I liked Naruto's “I'm not hiding, I'm being smart” rationalisation, and the whole “experience seven times the PTSD with Shadow Clones” thing you had going. (Which I totally predicted!)

  Also, you might intersperse some other PoV with the Terrible Trio's

On the last segment:

  Yeah, well. The gist of my comment on this last bit should be clear. A] End with Sasuke. B] Don't use the Gonzo and Gizmo PoV.

  It's not badly written by any means, and does accomplish the “humanising the attackers” bit I was complaining about earlier, but not very effectively because a] they're samurai, not ordinary guys and b] they're a couple of psychos.

  Further observations: Naruto was extremely useless here. Now, that's not unrealistic, but telling it from his PoV would be much more effective. The tragedy would have far more impact. There could be actual weight to the deaths of Inari and Terumi.

  Also, you could re-use the theme of the disappearing shadow clones to end the chapter.

  “This time, when his clones dispelled themselves, it was Inari he saw falling, through seven sets of eyes.”

  All in all, this chapter is an important part of the payoff of all the setup that you've done, so it is important to get it right. There's a lot of good material here, but I think it needs work if it is to have the impact it needs to have. The Naruto bit shows promise, the Sasuke's section is great, but whilst there's nothing wrong with Gonzo and Gizmo, I don't think your story is best served by including them.
