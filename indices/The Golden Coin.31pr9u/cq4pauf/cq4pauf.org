Write a computer program that accepts text input and outputs random text data, ala "Infinite Monkeys on a typewriter"

Use hypnotist to convince me that the program is actually a specific type of mechanical genie, which can output instructions for how to build or do anything I ask of it by request.

Ask for next week's lotto numbers, than how to get big returns on the stock market, to get a large monetary base.

Complete laws of physics? Eat your heart out, Einstein.
