I assume you are trying to say that the coin can only alter the probability of plausible outcomes, not add additional outcomes that are implausible.

In other words, if you go to a casino, you aren't going to be able to use the coin to make tarot cards show up in a standard deck, but despite altering physics, your coin can make different cards appear in different orders to give you good hands.

It stands to reason that you are going to need an irrational person to work with you to have any benefit. A rational person will probably not be very useful, unless they are legitimately ignorant about the events you are trying to influence. It's somewhat likely that a rational person will puzzle out more realistic odds than an irrational person though, making them less useful.

This generates a situation where it's most rational to work with an irrational person.

Recruit a gambling addict and start buying high dollar scratchoff lottery tickets. Gambling addicts are gambling addicts because they think they can win. The more they win with you, the more they think they will win. With scratch off cards, even if you know the odds, the gambler doesn't. Not really. So you know the chance is somewhere around zero, the reality is somewhere around zero, but in the gambler's mind, it's much, much higher than that. Average of zero + zero + ludicrous probability = ludicrous probability.

EDIT - After you prove to yourself that the coin works, the odds of winning would jump significantly, because your expectation of winning would go up.

ANOTHER EDIT - You can reinforce your gambling partner's dependence on you by simply letting them see what happens when you (and your coin) walk away from them. YOU know this will work. Once they see that their chances of winning drop when you aren't there, they will lock into you as their luck. That's when you go to Vegas and sit at high dollar slots. Be nice though, set them up a trust fund after you both have enough to retire, because they are never going to stop after you do this to them. You're probably going to have to fake your own death or something to get them to leave you alone.
