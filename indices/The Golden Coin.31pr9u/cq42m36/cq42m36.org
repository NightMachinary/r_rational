As the others have mentioned, it mostly depends on what exactly you can influence and how. For example, if you blindly throw a bunch of cards and have them rearrange themselves into a stack as shown here: [[http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/comics/00000383.jpg]] ? Or would each card falling down count as a different incident and have to succeed separately?

If you write a program that actually just spews out pseudo-random gibberish at the press of a button, but manage to convince someone that the dummy interface lets you input an account name and the output will be the password corresponding to the account, would the program give you actual passwords?

How about influencing things that are outside the 3m range? If you throw a dice and expect it land on a 6, but dice rolls far away, will the coin work? The dice got all its velocity and such within the circle after all, so it could work. Similarly, if you play in a casino in Vegas which is more than 3m across, how much does the coin work then? How about lottery tickets? If you get a ticket, will that ticket have a higher chance to be the right one?

In any case, I'd learn a single neat trick, or cheat at a game, to convince someone that I can do certain things. Then I'd use that to convince them that I have learned, for example, to always roll the number I want on a dice. Once a few of these things are set up, I will expand to ever more difficult and unlikely events. Then

The 3m radius can be used to convince people outside the radius of what you can do without their scepticism influencing the result.
