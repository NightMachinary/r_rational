No, you become a three-meter-radius God.

Can you make appear a lamp with Genie?

Can you feed an RNG into an assembler file to do very stupid experiments trying to make an FAI?

Can you make more coins?

Can you start warping space around the coin to include more and more of the universe in its 3-meter-radius?

Is there some sanity rule that prevents all the gazillion probabilistic events that nobody talks about from blowing up the universe in the way you'd expect when you start messing around with the ones and zeros in the universe simulators's RAM?
