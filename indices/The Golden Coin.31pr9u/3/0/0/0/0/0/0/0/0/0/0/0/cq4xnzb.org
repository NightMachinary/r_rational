I make it a point to leave conversations before they turn uncivil. I have anger issues that occasionally flare up and I was starting to have trouble managing them. In other words, I quit because I didn't want to reach the point of rage. Because when I get angry I sometimes get dizzy and go temporarily blind. That's why I ended it while it was still largely a debate and not yet an argument, because I didn't want it to get to that point.
