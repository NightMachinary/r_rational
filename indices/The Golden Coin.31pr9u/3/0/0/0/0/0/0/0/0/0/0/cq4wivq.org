This isn't about winning at all. No one was arguing with you. Even when they tried to accept the hypothetical they genuinely could not come up with any coherent answers that fit your premise exactly as you wrote it.

Not every disagreement is a conflict. But if you want to treat a normal, civil discussion like a game that can be won or lost, then go ahead and ragequit.
