I'm going to ignore the fact that you're completely subverting the intended purpose of the hypothetical. Let's just assume for a minute that you're right, and the laws of physics are thrown out the window completely.

You still can't do any of that because you'd have to have enough people within a three meter radius convinced that you could do that, including yourself, as to offset the actual chance in the average. Even if you tell someone you're a god and they believe you 30%, you know the chance is 0% and so does the universe, so the final odds of you being a god would be only one in ten.

Anyway, people tend to doubt the probability of things that they view as physically impossible. Good luck trying to find someone who honestly believes that there's a 30% chance of you being a real world god, even when you can't show any power to back up the claim.
