If you look any meaningful distance into the future there are actually divergent possible timelines, even given identical starting conditions. If you are about to flip a coin any number of things can influence the final binary output, wind pressure, muscle tension, etc. The many worlds model of quantum physics states that all these possibilities happen in branching alternate realities adjacent to and equally real as our own. The Golden Coin simply forces you along a certain path among these branches to achieve the expected result.
