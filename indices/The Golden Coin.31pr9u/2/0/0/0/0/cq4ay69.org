You can keep saying this, but it doesn't change the fact that many of the hypotheticals you are giving are situations not where something is truly random (which might happen in a quantum superposition collapse scenario ala Schrodinger's Cat) but simply a situation where people have insufficient information.

Let me give you an example. I stand outside your 3 meter bubble. We do 400 consecutive experiments with a house of cards. To control, we run a seminar before hand which convinces people that the house is 33% likely to collapse in each situation. In each example, the coin is on the table and the person (only one in range) is told to stand in front of the table.

I then use a 3.1 meter pole or similar to push over the table.

This happens every time. But it happens in a closed room, and the person is not allowed to communicate with any other test subjects.

This experiment I have laid out is deterministic. My stick will make the house (and the table) collapse 100% of the time unless I take a heart attack.

But the only person there in range of the coin thinks it is 33% of the time, and the coin changes the 'possibility' to be that much. Does that mean my heart randomly shuts down, as it could at any moment with varying low possibility? If it does, then it is picking futures with such low probability (while still being physically possible) that it effectively is changing reality, and is therefore useful.

If it doesn't, then it doesn't really work for anything useful, because studying it to examine the true probability, or forcing it to modify a known quantity makes it fail. So it's useless.

Also my stick example works in /every/ case of non-quantum phenomena, because the 3.1m stick is a sufficient knowledge of physics and the area around the coin to accurately model its path.

Even if you believe the universe is not deterministic, specific physical events are absolutely provably deterministic.

Shit always falls here at 9.1m/s^{2} , and an estimate that relied on something happening otherwise would either be 100% likely to fail even if the person watching it believed otherwise, or necessarily modifying the laws of reality.

Anything else relies on a woo misinterpretation of what is meant by 'observer' in quantum mechanics.
