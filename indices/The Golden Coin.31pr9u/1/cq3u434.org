What /doesn't/ the coin know, that it has probabilities that you call the actual chance?

For example, let's say that I have a coin-flipping program on my computer run by a pseudorandom number generator (like a lot of computer programs are). When I look at the screen and click the button, I predict a 50% chance of heads and a 50% chance of tails. When a competent computer programmer looks at the code and current state of the computer, they can have (theoretically) 100% confidence of the outcome.

Me (50% heads), the programmer (0% heads), and the coin (???) are next to the computer. What is the true probability?

Or perhaps a better example: Someone flips a coin onto a table, sees that it landed on heads, then covers it with his hand. I open my eyes and predict a 50% chance that it will be heads when he takes his hand away, he predicts a 100% chance, and the coin (presumably) predicts a 100% chance of heads. Would that make a 83% chance of it still being heads when he takes his hand away?

Edit to add: Who gets to ask the questions? In my last example "what will be facing up when he takes his hand away?" returns different behavior than "will the coin flip itself while under his hand?"
