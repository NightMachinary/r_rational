It seems like this is just infinitely passing the buck. It can't change the outcome of a coin on the table (it is already heads or tails), but I can't see how it could change the outcome of a coin in the air (it already has a certain momentum, position, etc.) without rewriting reality. The same reasoning goes for a coin before someone flips it. Their neurons, muscles, and all the rest are already in certain positions, which will 100% result in the same outcome given the same inputs.

The coin /needs/ to rewrite reality in order to do anything.
