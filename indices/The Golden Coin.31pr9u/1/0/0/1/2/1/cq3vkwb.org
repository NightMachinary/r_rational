I suppose it would skew the results as much as it could towards the perception without breaking something. If someone believes finding a shiny red ball to be more likely than finding any color ball then the majority of balls they find will be red, and a majority of those will be shiny. If they believe there's impossibly a 50% chance each for red, green and white balls as you mentioned earlier it would have to settle for 33% each, being the same ratio and most probably what they intended anyway.
