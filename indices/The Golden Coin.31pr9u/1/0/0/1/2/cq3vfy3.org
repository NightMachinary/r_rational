Fair enough, true randomness exists.

How does the coin deal with probabilities that are not only wrong, but incoherent as well? I can't remember the name, but there's a bias where adding details to a description makes people see it as more plausible than simpler descriptions that strictly contain them. (eg. people rate "finding a shiny red ball" as more likely than "finding a red ball" (whether it is shiny or not) and also more likely than "finding a ball" (no matter the color, or if it is shiny))

What if someone gives a mutually exclusive set of results >100% probability, or a fully comprehensive set <100% probability?
