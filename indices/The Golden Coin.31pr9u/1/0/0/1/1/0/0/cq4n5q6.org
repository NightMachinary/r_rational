Oh, so it only influences quantum probabilities/quantum information. Problem is, that's already more-or-less arbitrary reality warping, due to all /physically coherent/ outcomes having some quantum probability, no matter how goddamn tiny.

Which means, actually, that we can use the coin to try to investigate what /is/ physically coherent, and thus what the true laws of physics are.
