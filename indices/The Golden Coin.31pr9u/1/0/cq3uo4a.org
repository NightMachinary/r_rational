For the purposes of the actual chance, the coin is omniscient. There would be a 0% chance on the computer test because there's no real chance of the computer changing its algorithm without being told to. The coin can't rewrite the computer any more than it can rewrite reality. The coin on the table would always be heads because the coin is already objectively on heads with nothing that could reasonably change that. Only probability is influenced, not possibility.
