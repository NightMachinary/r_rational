I actually think that rewriting reality is the smaller issue.

What if someone's probabilities are not only wrong, but /incoherent/? For example, there's a basket with 10 red, 10 white, and 10 green balls in it. When asked, someone thinks there's a 50% chance he will grab a red ball (either it happens or it doesn't), a 50% chance he will grab a white ball (...) and a 50% chance he will grab a green ball (...).

The same idea works with a lot of biases, such as rating the likelihood of something being "shiny and red" as more probable than "red" (whether or not it is shiny).
