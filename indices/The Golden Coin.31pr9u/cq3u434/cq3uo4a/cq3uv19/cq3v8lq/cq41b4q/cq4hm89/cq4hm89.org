I expected that people would realize that the premise relied on the existence of true randomness and be capable of figuring out from context that they should attempt to answer it accordingly. If you post a hypothetical about angels coming to earth and rivers of blood you can determine from context that part of the premise is a biblical universe, regardless of your own beliefs. Therefore when someone comments asking what technology the sufficiently advanced aliens are using to turn the rivers to blood it's perfectly reasonable for the poster to correct you with the intended setup of the situation, that was assumed to be something that the very intelligent target audience could figure out on their own.
