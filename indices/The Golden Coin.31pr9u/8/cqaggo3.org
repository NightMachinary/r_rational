Step one: Abuse metacognition.

#+begin_quote
  I know the coin is magic. This means I can truthfully expect it to perform probability manipulation to my advantage in every situation.

Step two: Abuse metaamplification.

#+begin_quote
  I can demonstrate the magic coin to James Randi. This gives me a million dollars, but more importantly abruptly surrounds me with people who increasingly and self-reinforcingly believe in the coin's power. As it becomes more potent thanks to their beliefs, its effect reaches higher into the improbable.

Step three: Ascent to godhood.

#+begin_quote
  I have an increasing cult of belief and personality based first on demonstrable evidence and secondly on the increasing likelihood of people joining and accepting that the coin is magic. Soon though, the coin is doing more work than the evidence itself is, though they reinforce. It becomes blatantly obvious the coin can restructure reality at the quantum level according to my will. And indeed, as the limit approaches 100% asymptotically, I find my power waxing without limit. Sure it's not LIKELY that every particle in three meter range would spontaneously tunnel and rearrange themselves into self-replicating Superintelligent AI bits friendly to me... but that's what the coin's for. I send the nanites out in an expanding shell at near lightspeed. I can now position particles arbitrarily within my light cone without a need to concretely imagine the finished pattern. Hell, I don't actually need the coin anymore at this point. But I'm sure as hell not letting anyone else have it.
