I actually gave it a try just last night. I love how the main characters interacts but the setting leave a lot to be desired. I believe this fiction has been recommended here when it just starting out and it did not receive the best reception. Well, because it's new, and hasn't scratch this community itch yet. And after all this time, I can say the novel did not scratch our itch.

Anyway, even if it doesn't fit this subreddit theme, I will still follow the fic because I just love witty verbal jabs. At least until the plot develop into either tedium or utter ridiculousness, which I hope will never happen.
