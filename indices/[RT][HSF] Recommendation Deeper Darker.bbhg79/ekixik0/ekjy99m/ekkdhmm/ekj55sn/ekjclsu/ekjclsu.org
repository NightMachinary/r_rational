I mean, for all intents and purposes, the organics discovered from the alien sites are your aspect of magic. They/re sufficiently advanced relative to what humanity has as to essentially turn users into a super-powered gods amongst mortals.

We've seen some limited uses of them, one of which was apparently from the most powerful human being (if that term even counts anymore) around.

For what it's worth this has my recommendation. I'm enjoying it way more than The Good Student and frankly wish chapters were longer. Now that the different character viewpoints have sort of converged it's become way more interesting.
