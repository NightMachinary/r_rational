Sounds interesting, I haven't actually tried deeper darker yet, I am waiting for it to get some backlog. Though honestly my hopes aren't exceptionally high, the author isn't my favourite, I tried The good student and enjoyed it initially, but honestly the convulted mess of "Aha! I have discovered the truth! Let me be a badass and solve the situation! Wait what? That was exactly what the villain planned for!?" That that story became has kind of turned me off getting into his stories.
