The problem is that it's *too much* of a pattern. I like "The Good Student", but it follows a well-trod self-made pattern of having the main character explore something new, have the character be confused as to what he should do and question his worthiness, have him set out to do something, have that something completely hijacked by another (more powerful) player in the game, then come back around to him deflecting it, then asking if he really is the right person for the job only to have the other main(ish) characters constantly go on about how awesome he is but he still doesn't feel up to the task. Like a wheel, it rolls through this process over and over and over.

I no longer classify it as 'rational' since the MC never learns from this process, merely going through it over and over. At some point, he should stop questioning *if* he is good enough and instead try to be *proactive* about finding out why and leveraging that to his advantage.
