Rational fiction shouldn't require you to throw throw your brain out for immersion. If you're going to dodge worldbuilding by ostensibly setting your story in the future light cone of the real world, it should be consistent with its rules, just like any other piece of rational fiction is expected to present the reader with consistent world rules.
