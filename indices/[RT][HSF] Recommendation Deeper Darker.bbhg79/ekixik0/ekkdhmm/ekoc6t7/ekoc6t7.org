Pretty sure the Garbage Worlds are per star system only. It seems that when humanity colonizes systems, they try to get on every possible planet that isn't stupidly lethal. I could be wrong about this, though.

I'd personally be OK with the colony ship being solar powered if, and only if, it wasn't explicitly stated to have 64 gravity engines and massive singularity cannons. If it had some light ion engines and generally just drifted or had a set path, using carefully researched orbits to change course, I'd be fine with it. But... it doesn't.
