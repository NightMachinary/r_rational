  It's dungeon delving adventures in a sci-fi setting
#+end_quote

I find this fairly misleading when you have to get to *Chapter 35* before any 'dungeon delving' actually occurs. And, in so much as its a dungeon, it's a ridiculously lethal one due to its traps (automated defense system), with life expectancy in minutes or seconds.

This is a sci-fi series with three protagonists that happens to focus highly on cybernetic modifications and happens to have dungeon delving as a key part of the background as to how some of these modifications came to be.

Good key word there. It's rational because they *try* to make intelligent choices--given the limited knowledge and experience that they have, and when they mess up they try to learn from the experience.

So far I rather like this series, but the slow buildup might not be for everyone.

Good points that should be mentioned: 1) The different worlds have different cultures, and each protagonist comes from a vastly different background with a specific set of skills. When the skills overlap, they are from different perspectives and sometimes even opposite ends of the spectrum. It seems as if the writer is trying to give them all roughly equal 'screen time' so we stay invested. 2) None of the protagonists are assholes for the sake of being assholes. I don't know why this becomes a trope where some main or semi-main character is just an utter ass to everyone for no particular reason or because he had some harsh upbringing. None of these people are harsh to anyone else unless its part of a planned strategy to get what they want, and always a short-term solution. 3) The 'cut away' moments to other characters *never* happen in the middle of the action or as a cliffhangar. I can't express how much I appreciate this, as I find the whole "Let's cut away from this person at a critical moment to pick up with another character in a calm situation instead to keep you reading (or watching)" to be /monumentally stupid/. I will keep reading if I like a series, do not attempt cheap tricks such as this or I will leave. Fortunately, *Mooderino* understands this well and doesn't treat his readers like attention-starved children, and because of that has earned a lot of patience and goodwill as I wait for the story to continue.
