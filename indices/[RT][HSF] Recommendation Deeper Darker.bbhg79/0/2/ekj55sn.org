Don't worry you aren't alone, I have almost exactly the same experience, if said science fiction doesn't have any aspect of magic, I can read fantasy stories that get into space travel and multiple planets, and I can read Sci-fi if the main character is an esper it psychic of some kind, but remove that magic element and I just can't immerse myself, I guess a part of me just doesn't find the idea of a fictional world with no magic entertaining.
