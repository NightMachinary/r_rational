I... disagree with this completely.

Semi-spoiler time.

OK, so one character is on an eternal Generation Ship where everyone has to follow the laws established and enforced by an AI with supreme authority. Violence is not tolerated and use of it will get you executed or exiled. It has a very specific method of handling human relationships and reproduction, the welfare and healthcare is top notch, and the people are quite insular and think of themselves as better than everyone else. Different families jockey for power and position, but must use non-violent means and have developed a code of conduct for 'unofficially' solving problems. Whenever said people go out into the universe, they are considered ruthless and pragmatic to the extreme by everyone else.

Another character lives alone under a giant trash dump used by passing spaceships. His past includes being abandoned as a child and becoming an urchin in a street gang. He's had to learn social skills to survive as a loner in a society that otherwise would accidentally, and with no hard feelings, crush him. That planet is mostly run by various companies and has a society stratified between the dirt-breathing ground dwellers who range from slave to well-off businessman all the way to the super-rich who live in a veritable paradise orbital ring and have no qualms about annihilating anyone who threatens them or doesn't move up the right way.

The third character comes from a noble family that is the de facto rulers of their world, and who helped other families out by advancing them, only to have them turn traitor. His mom and dad are from two seperate families, and both are 'organics' (read: Biotic) users of great and specific powers, and his mother used to be a planet-bombarding mercenary Space Amazon who is backed up by a biotic Space Amazons organization that has a thing against misogyny. And by 'thing', I mean, 'willingness to exterminate families of those who abuse women'. The people are mostly properous, but like in the first example, the families jockey for power and finally the main character's parents get tired of it when someone tries to kill the mother.

Each is an example of a wildly different society, each developed around different origins, rules, and values. Given that human biology has remained the same for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years, and the only biological alterations in this setting come from /alien tech/, it's no surprise that humans are mostly baseline but vary wildly in culture. It's almost like how humans develop in the real world.
