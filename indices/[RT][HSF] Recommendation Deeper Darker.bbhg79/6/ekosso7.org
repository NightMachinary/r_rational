I made it to Chapter 7 and am stalling out.

One of my pet peeves is when SciFi authors get blatantly heavy handed with their Current Year commentary. And the Trash Dump guy was just spamming that button.

Oh no - - we hear four or five times - - our society has gotten wasteful and just dumps trash instead of repairing things! We've despoiled a planet!

Except, this idea is just dumb. I can believe that recycling, in deep space, somehow costs more resources than just building new things. But the societies aren't just dumping stuff. They're accelerating it, inside a ship, crossing an interstellar distance, then decelerating it, entering atmosphere, and dropping it at a dump. They're willing to put that much work in, but don't bother consolidating the trash pile to a mere quarter of the planet. No, while thing is covered.

And I'm probably nitpicking, but ugh, this is like talking to someone who thinks California's drought was caused by people lingering too long in the shower. And the book is signaling that this is one of the major setpieces, that's probably been carefully thought out by the author
