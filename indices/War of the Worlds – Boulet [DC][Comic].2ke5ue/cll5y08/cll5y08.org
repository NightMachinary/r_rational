I've been thinking about this sort of thing lately. I was thinking about the Mary Sue scenario where the powerful fictional character shows up in the "real world".

Hate him or dislike him, Capaldi's Doctor would immediately recognize the danger he was in and how badly he was outclassed. The wittiest and most cunning of all of his enemies back home are only as sneaky as the guys who write television scripts here. He would immediately determine that he was outclassed by brutal savages and work to escape.
