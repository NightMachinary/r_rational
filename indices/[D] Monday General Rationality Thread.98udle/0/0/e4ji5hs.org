I wonder about that as well. What makes you think that uploading will save you? (Is it the possibility of editing the brain?)

Imagine Conway's game of life; all finite grids eventually become static or cyclic. And all infinite grids eventually run into processing power issues (ha ha). Conway's game of life is Turing-complete, so if human consciousness is computable, I've got some bad news.... (to be fair, if consciousness weren't computable that would probably be worse news).

Don't worry, though. The amount of time for a very complex pattern to stagnate in that way might be much greater than the lifetime of the universe. You can't go insane if you starve to death first.

Anyways, I wrote a short story about psychological consequences for immortal uploads in response to one of the weekly challenges. Here's a link if you're interested: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0Sx3cbNpozAcMtLO3yG4L3y3tIjpNaKPgqsxxDTgww/edit?usp=sharing][The Only Thing that Proves You]]

Spoiler: without extreme intervention, as you put it, all uploads eventually delete themselves
