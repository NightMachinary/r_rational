There are some assumptions in your random thought that I'd like to question.

The brain is not a Ship of Theseus. It doesn't replace itself with parts that replicate the existing model, it assesses and reorients existing parts as they're used. The "neural algorithm" is not a singular process, but rather an iterated consequence of a number of other algorithmic processes. In the other direction, distinct parts of the brain are used for different purposes even as the neural operations within each are superficially similar.

So question one: What do you mean by "the brain"? Why is it a singular entity that gets defined as "any" specific "one"? Which part or parts is most important in that assessment?

Question two is about the other assessment: By what measure is "the brain" guaranteed to be "insane"?

It is not unfair to say that every human being thinks differently, even as it is not unfair to say we all think the same. Deviant thought and careful conformity are /each/ both frowned upon and celebrated. Entropy is a decline to disorder, but such disorder could seem like whimsy or creativity... from within and from without.

From the point of view of a mind's eye, seeming and being are separated by a thin border indeed.

So, question three: /Who/ cares?

The brain is not a Ship of Theseus. You aren't constantly rebuilding a copy of yourself. You're a different self than you were when you started reading this, and some impossibly old you wouldn't have the same response to it as you do now. You wouldn't have quite the same response to it if you read it again next year.

Do you care now about the potential insanity of a future you? Do you care about your own sanity now? Do future yous care what any previous version of them thinks about their sanity? If their brains destroy a little of the old order, forgetting thinks that were so it can remember thinks that should have been, does that inspire sanity or insanity? According to whom?

Question three point five: At the heat death of the universe, does it matter if the think that used to be you remembers or resembles what current you thinks at all?
