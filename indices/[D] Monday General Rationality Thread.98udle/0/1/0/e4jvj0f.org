  What do you mean by "the brain"?
#+end_quote

The squishy thing in your skull. Made of evolved biological neurons. I don't privilege any particular part of it. It functions as a whole to generate the experience of a singular consciousness, which values its own continuation.

  By what measure is "the brain" guaranteed to be "insane"?
#+end_quote

Good question. I would say either 1) inability to function as an intelligent agent (by some definition of "intelligent" involving ability to survive and thrive without drooling all over yourself and being spoonfed by a nurse in an asylum), or 2) significant mental distress caused by incoherent or conflicting internal experiences. When I had the random thought, I was envisioning people who had lived to, say, 10000 years of age and then began to lose track of which experiences were happening in the present and which were mere memories. Perhaps such a person would experience significant anxiety due to constant deja vu.

  question three: Who cares? Question three point five: At the heat death of the universe, does it matter if the think that used to be you remembers or resembles what current you thinks at all?
#+end_quote

It doesn't matter if you change, as long as the change leads to continued thriving for you and society as a whole. Increased mental distress and decreased ability to function in reality are not good for these goals. The insane people I'm envisioning would not say that they are fine with who they are. Rather, they would beg for a cure in their brief moments of lucidity.

Of course, whether this entropic Alzheimer's would actually happen biologically is an open question.
