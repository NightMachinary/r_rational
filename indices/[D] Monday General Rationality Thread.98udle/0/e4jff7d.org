Random thought I had today: I wonder if the brain is affected by a sort of inevitable entropy over time, such that anyone older than age X (500? 1000? 10000 years?) is guaranteed to be insane without extreme intervention. This would be a separate problem from standard aging: you can make the cells live forever, but can you make the human neural algorithm remain organized long enough for extended sanity? If such neural entropy existed, it would put a hard upper limit on how long you could live biologically without "uploading."
