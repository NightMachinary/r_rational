  What makes you think that uploading will save you? (Is it the possibility of editing the brain?)
#+end_quote

Yes to the parenthetical. "Uploading" (in quotes because I'm including aggressive artificial neural restructuring of the existing brain) would buy you lots of time because presumably we could come up with ways to combat the mental entropy. Of course, the heat death of the universe is still an upper bound on your possible lifespan.

  The amount of time for a very complex pattern to stagnate in that way might be much greater than the lifetime of the universe

It might be, assuming artificial intervention. But evolution didn't optimize brains for existing much longer than a hundred years - the biological limit without modifying the basic functioning of the brain may be much shorter.

Interesting story. I looked at the beginning, but it's a bit long for me to read right now.
