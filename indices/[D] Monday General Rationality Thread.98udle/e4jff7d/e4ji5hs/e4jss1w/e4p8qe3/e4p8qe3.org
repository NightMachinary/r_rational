A possible effect would simply be that as time passes old stuff gets completely erased. This might become more possible with uploading (after all, the limitations of biological matter are exactly why you /can't/ keep living on biological substrates for more than 100 years or so anyway). So after 5000 years you remember basically nothing of what it was like 5000 years ago, and you're a completely different person. Heck, I'm 32 and I feel like a completely different person than when I was 14, so...

The consciousness remains 'immortal' in the sense of continuity, though it's so thoroughly renewed that in some sense the original person is still dead. But then again, in that sense, perhaps 14-year-old-me is dead too. Unless there's something special about the sense of self and its preservation that we're not getting yet, I'm afraid that ends up being the only logical conclusion.
