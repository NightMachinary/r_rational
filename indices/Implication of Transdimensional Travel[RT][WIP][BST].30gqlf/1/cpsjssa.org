The portal isn't terribly great for transporting goods. Even if you set up a rail system pointed at where the portal is going to be, you're still going to run into cost issues pretty fast. The single portal-hour is, however, great for transporting people, especially if you can get them lined up and passing through at sixty miles per hour (which would get you thirty miles worth of people per opening).

There would be an initial glut of intellectual property from the other side. Red has a full history of radio, movies, television, etc. which they can trade to Blue. The countries would have to decide whether to honor each others copyright laws, and how their legal interface is going to work, and who has jurisdiction over what, but it seems likely that this would end up spiraling out of control (and fighting hard against smugglers). What would mostly end up happening is a glut of content, followed by a reorganization of the entertainment industry as lots of people lost their jobs. Movie budgets would go up, and marketing budgets would go up, but the number of blockbusters would probably stay the same.

It's not actually Red and Blue. It's all the Red countries, and all the Blue countries. Most likely, there would be some new legal framework with a bunch of signatories. Depending on how free travel between the sides is, there would have to be some determinations about immigration/emigration, intellectual property, jurisdiction for transdimensional crime, extradition, taxation of trade ... basically every single thing that modern countries have to deal with when dealing with other countries, except sprung on them with hundreds of new actors all at once. This is going to be especially tough where territory doesn't overlap entirely - where the Accord of 1873 never happened, and France is missing half of its land.

(If any politicians are duplicated, expect attack ads to focus on what their parallel counterpart did in the other universe.)

** Religion

Here you get into a problem - there are now two popes. There were, presumably, two of Jesus. There are two Meccas. This duplication shoots a lot of theology squarely in the foot. It raises questions of free will, if there are any people who followed different life paths (if any of the people are duplicated at all).

** Science
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: science
   :END:
Science works through collaboration and open communication. You're doubling the population of scientists and engineers in all specialties. This does /not/ mean that half of them are out of a job - it means that they'll increase specialization. Information travels freely through the portals (with any format or hardware standardization differences probably figured out pretty quickly) but it seems likely that scientists would be the first to cross the portal in order to set up shop with their counterparts. This will quickly lead to specialization - say, with Red being better at certain areas of biological science and Blue being better at certain areas of semiconductor manufacturing.
