I can see why finding a new world that never heard of Jesus might be theologically troubling, and I'm sure some people were troubled when they found out the inhabitants of the New World didn't know about Him. But now that that's established, why would this happening with a different reality be a problem?

Differences grow exponentially. If you have modern America, Christianity isn't just similar. It's identical. There was one universe with one Christ, and then the universe split into two. Though that does create interesting theological implications for whoever was alive during the split.
