Politically, since RED and BLUES are pretty damn similar, I am thinking countries will instead unites with their counterpart rather than remains apart.

Those that don't merge will have a harder time competing.

The rich countries are able to afford more gateways, thus they are more connected to their counterpart, which amplify their powers.
