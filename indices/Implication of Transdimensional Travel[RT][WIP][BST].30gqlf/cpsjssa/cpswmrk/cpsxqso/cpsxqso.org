  It seems highly unlikely there were two Jesuses. Even a slight change will quickly result in completely different children being born. In order for there to be two, the universes would have to split during his lifetime. If the split was after, there was only one universe to have a Jesus. If it was before, only one of the two universes would have a Jesus.

One universe not having Jesus /at all/ is actually even more theologically troubling. An entire planet full of people who never experienced salvation is a big problem for Christianity, and would necessitate a shift in thinking that the Christians who believe in aliens have long been preparing for. And the Evangelicals would probably pitch a fit. But since OP stated that Red and Blue were pretty damned close to each other, I think something like a major world religion that's been around for two thousand years is probably the same between the two of them - maybe with some differences in the Bible - because you can't get modern America without Christianity playing a role.
