It seems highly unlikely there were two Jesuses. Even a slight change will quickly result in completely different children being born. In order for there to be two, the universes would have to split during his lifetime. If the split was after, there was only one universe to have a Jesus. If it was before, only one of the two universes would have a Jesus.

"This does not mean that half of them are out of a job"

No, but it means some of them are out of a job, and the way economics is, the rest get a pay cut. The pure sciences seem to be more signalling than anything, and I suspect would actually increase now that countries have doppelgangers to compete with. But the rest of the have to face the law of diminishing returns. Twice as many scientists is not twice as good.
