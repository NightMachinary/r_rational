You mean like have a hundred Californias working together instead of one Earth? I imagine both would happen. I don't know what would be more common. On the one hand, Californias are culturally similar and all speak the same language, which would make working together easy. On the other hand, I suspect finding identical copies of Earth would make people want to make their Earth stand apart.
