Any sort of intellectual property only has to be made once to be used in both universes. Basically, once you get a gate working, you can eliminate the cost of an entire planet's worth of software, movies, drug research, material science research, etc.

This would require a change in economics. Competition in these fields will instantly double. A lot of people will lose their jobs. But everything will become a little cheaper and a little higher quality.

Even without a universal TD theory, the growth will increase exponentially. You'll have to do just as much work, but you'll have twice as many universes working on it. Suppose it takes five years to build a gate. Two universes are connected. After ten years, it's four. After 50 years, it's a thousand. After a 165 years, there will be more worlds connected than there are people on each world. Entire worlds will use their whole economy just to create one move, one piece of software, one technology so amazing that they might be remembered. Few worlds will succeed.

Exactly how similar are the universes? Do they have the same people? The same countries?

It sounds like your gateway sends physical objects, which seems like overkill. Could cheaper ones be made to send only information?
