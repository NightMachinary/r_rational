It's actually pretty far from what you say:

2) The possession check is (1) useless because if Cat was possessed by Winter or any other Eldritch entity, it's not 25 footmen and 15 mages who can do anything to stop her. Vivienne might be, with the Oaths, and it's another reason why her not being there was a major screw up. If Cat was really possessed, their only chance was Vivienne being at the front to use the oaths and not at the back so Cat destroy half the army if she wanted to do something bad and (2) was undermining her autority. If you have to do tests on your fucking queen, no matter how sensible it is, you don't do it in public, right after she saved your ass in a major way and cleaned up after your screw up. And it leads to (3), if Cat was possessed, her first move after getting in there WOULDN'T be to end a procer charge at a huge personnal risk, save Callow's Army and try to get a cease-fire. (Which kind of eldritch entity would do that? Just that would be a definite proof that she was not possessed)

3) She never said anything about agreeing with their goals. Empting Callow of soldiers when Praes is back into the game (no more crusade aimed at them for now), with major frontiers conflicts was not the right move. Trying to intimidate Cordelia when she has her hands full with the Dead king was not the right move. And the worst of all, relying on a fucking magical trick for everything in the plan (the magical gates) was NOT THE RIGHT MOVE when you know that it will obviously fail at the worst moment (and surprise! It did!) and everyone (Hakram, Vivienne, Juniper) should know better than that.

You can add to that the whole separation scene in book 4. Vivienne tells clearly to Cat that she can't be trusted with negociation. And in the end, Cat perfectly fulfilled her mission, while Vivienne made a continental mess when it REALLY wasn't needed. Typical case of talking big and deliver little. So yeah, it was 100%, 200%, 300% deserved on ALL aspects.
