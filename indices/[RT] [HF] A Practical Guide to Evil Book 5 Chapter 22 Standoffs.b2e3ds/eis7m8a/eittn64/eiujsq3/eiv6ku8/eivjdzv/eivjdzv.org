I do not believe it would be out of character for the Tyrant of Helike or the Hierarch of the Free Cities to, having possessed Cat somehow, negotiate a ceasefire between her army and its antagonists. The Tyrant would do it for teh lulz and because he might need their assistance later. The Hierarch would do it because the killing was not sanctioned by the People.
