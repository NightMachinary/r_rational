I was annoyed at first by how Cat acted, especially since she knew the situation more-or-less from Hakram but didn't tear HIM a new one. I'm guessing her being so angry is a combination of factors:

1. Two of the four armies of Callow were about to get wrecked - and would have, if she hadn't appeared when she did. That would have been a pointless loss, in a larger war where every loss is unacceptable.
2. Juniper is a brilliant commander who always makes the right decision - which makes her predictable. That's how Cat's described her since they first met. It's a huuuuge weakness when you get heroes and villains and fae involved, because those all operate not on tactics - which Juniper is amazing at - but on narrative... which Juniper failed to account for. That Vivienne, an-until-recently heroine, also didn't account for the narrative bit of "villains always suffer failure at a critical moment" is even more egregious.
3. The security measures are common-sense if some simple mage was impersonating Cat, but were utterly useless for what they were supposed to accomplish. 40 soldiers would not stop a corrupted Winter demi-goddess. Sending Hune to lead them was an unintentional rebuke to a steadfast soldier. And the queen does not subject herself to something like that, especially in front of her armies. Doing so would be as good as declaring that she places herself beneath and subject to her regent and her general. As Black once said: *We do not kneel.*

So it feels like Cat's anger makes sense when you think about it. She understands why Juniper and Vivienne acted like they did, and the logic behind their choices. But their inability to see the larger context almost led them to annihilation; and their refusal to come out and atone for their mistakes made them seem like they were looking down on Cat and her position. The stakes are too high for them to mess up this badly. I think I just was annoyed by her behavior because I want them all to get along immediately and kick butt as a team again.
