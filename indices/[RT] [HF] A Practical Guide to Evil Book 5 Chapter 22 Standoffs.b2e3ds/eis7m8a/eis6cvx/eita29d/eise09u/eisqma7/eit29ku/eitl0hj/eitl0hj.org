It annoys me that we were never given a proper explanation of oaths, and the difference being Fae made regarding them. Obfuscating those oath rules to the reader while allowing characters to take advantage of them in-story is anti-rational fiction.

Also regarding oaths, given the intricate oaths that Thief used to thwart Akua possessing Cat, it seems theoretically possible that someone could get a couple thousand slaves together and create a computer equivalent or start some hive mind shenanigans.
