Some unrelated unrelated thoughts;

1). It's gotta be really annoying to constantly unpersonned as a villain, re the Proceran contingent.

2). Not allowing the possession check seems bad policy. Its clearly a good idea and costs her nothing and removes any red flags that the haranguing she's about to give is from anyone other than her.

3). I thought Cat already grasped Juniper's strategic goals and didn't disagree with them, I would think her presumption would be that the setbacks were unavoidable or impossible, rather than that Juniper screwed up, given her history of competence, I'm unsure why she's going in so angry at her, rather than just getting updated as quickly as possible.
