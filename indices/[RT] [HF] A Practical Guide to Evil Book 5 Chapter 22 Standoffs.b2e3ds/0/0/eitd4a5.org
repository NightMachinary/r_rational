For #2, I don't think that the problem was that they wanted to check her - even she said it was a good idea - it's that they were essentially taken her into custody in front of her soldiers. It completely undermines her and her authority, and probably would have started some nasty rumours too. If they had waited until she was inside the tent and done it privately Cat probably would have been okay, if not pleased, that they were making sure everything was what it seemed.
