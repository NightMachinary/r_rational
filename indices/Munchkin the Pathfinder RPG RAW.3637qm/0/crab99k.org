[[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?222007-The-Definitive-Guide-to-the-Tippyverse-By-Emperor-Tippy][Here's a link to the Definitive Guide to the Tippyverse]], which might share some similarities. Crafting doesn't cost xp in Pathfinder, so you can basically ignore all the stupid xp harvesting schemes. IIRC, an automatically resetting /Wish/ trap only takes 100,000gp. Less for an automatically resetting /True Creation/ trap.

Better, you can use [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blood-money][/Blood Money/]] to get around (most) money requirements, and /Restoration/ will get all your Strength back. Depending on whether you're allowed to pay more Strength than you have, you can make permanent teleportation circles for the low cost of having a cleric cast fourth level spells on you.

The end game is a total elimination of scarcity, every important location linked to every other important location so that travel times are negligible, and no real need for a labor class because you can make golems all day, every day. Anyone important is going to have +5 to all stats from the /Wish/ traps, magic items are handed out like candy. [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/simulacrum][/Simulacrum/]] removes the need for real work, given your nigh-infinite money supply.
