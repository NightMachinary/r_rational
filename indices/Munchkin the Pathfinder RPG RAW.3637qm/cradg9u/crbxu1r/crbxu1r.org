  2YE is now being published on Amazon.

  In accord with their Terms of Service I need to take it offline at all other locations.

  You can read it for free by creating a Kindle Unlimited account (free trial at: bit. do /ku-free-trial) and then going to the book at bit. do /amazon-2YE

I've paid for your stuff before, but if you're going to do stuff like that I'm not going to do it again. Natural monopolies are a lot worse in the tech world, and it's even more important that one company doesn't use anti-competitive practices to own humanities books, and how humanity is allowed to use those books.
