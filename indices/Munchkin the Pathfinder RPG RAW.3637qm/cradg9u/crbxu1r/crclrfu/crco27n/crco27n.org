Well, I had a few options:

1. Don't monetize, which means don't write full time which means don't produce nearly as much stuff for you to read for free.
2. Take the story down completely. This would have been the easiest option for me.
3. Publish on something other than Amazon that doesn't require exclusivity but also doesn't have the audience to be worth it
4. Publish on Amazon with the exclusivity-not-required option, which pays 35% royalties ($1.09 on a $3 story) and requires that the story be purchased instead of borrowed.\\

With the way I've done it you get to read the story for free. To do that you need to click one link to get to the story, a button to borrow it, and then a link to go to your cloud reader. (Yes, you need to set up a KU account /once/ but that's pretty trivial and amortizes over everything you ever borrow.)

I get roughly $1.34 (it varies) when you read it for free or +$1.94+ $1.76 (EDIT: just checked the actual value) when you buy it. (70% of $3 - "delivery charge" of $0.15 per MB because Amazon is a bunch of bastards.)

So. Given those options, what would you like me to have done?
