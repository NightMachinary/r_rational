Seems like kind of a raw deal for readers, even leaving the deal with Amazon aside. There are a bunch of links to that story that now basically say "go jump through these hoops if you want to read it", which doesn't feel great. I get the desire to monetize, but I would way rather have that monetization be upfront instead of after-the-fact.
