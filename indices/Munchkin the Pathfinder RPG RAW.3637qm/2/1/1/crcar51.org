This seems like an odd place to post this -- in public, on a site that isn't the one where the message was posted, in a thread about something else -- but I'll respond here.

First of all, I'm sorry to hear that you're offended by my choices and I'll be sorry to lose you as a customer. I hope you'll keep reading Team Anko and any other things that I write for free, as well as subscribe to [[http://bit.do/dks-list][the mailing list]], where I give away everything I write for free before posting it on Amazon. In the meantime, see below for a way to protest more effectively.

As to why I'm publishing with Amazon, it's simple: I need the money. Not too long ago I stopped being a computer programmer so that I could be an author. The reasons aren't important here, but they make sense to me.

Being a professional author is hard, and it's even harder to get started. There are a lot of places to publish online, but based on the research I've done, Amazon is by far the lion's share of the revenue. Personally, I have some moral problems with them as well -- I boycotted them for years over their 1-click patent. At the end of the day, though, if you want to make money writing eBooks, it's Amazon or go home.

There are still a couple ways for people to read my work without giving money to what I think we both agree is a predatory company.

First, you could join [[http://bit.do/dks-list][my mailing list]]; as mentioned above, everything I write gets given away for free to the mailing list before it goes up on Amazon. That may not be sustainable forever, but it's my current plan and I've been following through on it.

Alternatively, you could sign up for Kindle Select, which I suggest would be more effective than your current position.

The [[http://bit.do/ku-free-trial][Kindle Select]] program lets you read unlimited books for free. It costs $10/month, but that link gets you a 1-month free trial. It's basically a library; you borrow books, return them, and borrow more. You can read them on any device (Kindle, iPad, etc) [[http://read.amazon.com][or online in your browser]]. As long as you read 10% of whatever you borrow, the author gets paid.

If KU is the only way you give money to Amazon and if you read at least 8 books a month then Amazon is losing money on you as a customer. (Note that when I say "read" I actually mean "open, then scroll through the first 10% of".) If you really don't like Amazon, I suggest that instead of boycotting authors, a more effective form of protest would be to sign up for KU and spend a few hours a week checking out books, scrolling through the first 10% and then returning them and doing it again.

Boycotting authors hurts them (and, arguably, you) but does nothing to affect Amazon. Taking my KU suggestion and encouraging others to do it would be a more effective way of punishing Amazon's bad behavior -- of course, you should really send them an email notifying them of what you're doing and why. It might get your Amazon account banned, but you presumably weren't using it anyway.

Once again, I'm sorry to hear you are so upset at my choices, and I hope that this has helped you understand why I've made them and given you some tools to make your objections heard by the people you're angry at.

EDIT: I just realized that maybe what you're irritated about is that you followed a link here to something that was pointing at a redirect to Amazon. My original post went up two days ago, but the first chapters of 2YE were removed only a few hours before you posted. The chapters that are NOT on Amazon are still available for free.
