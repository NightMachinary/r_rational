I've got no problem with monetization. I do have a problem with monetizing something that owes much of its popularity to the fact that it was free in the first place, in such a way that you're removing it from easy access, and introducing barriers for people to read it. The 30-day-free-trial-then-upgrade-you-to-paid thing is a sleazy business model invented because businesses know that they have your credit card on file, and a fair number of people are just going to forget and get auto-billed every month without realizing until at one point they think, "Hey, what's this charge?".

It feels like a bait-and-switch to me. That's what's unpleasant about it. Removing the story entirely would be even more of a bait-and-switch, but you know that. This is how I feel. I don't expect you to change your mind, but you did ask.
