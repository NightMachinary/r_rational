Someone said Felix Felicis on the other one. Health Potion is a vialable option, though personally I'd go with Worm's Superpower Lottery Drink for the fun of it.

However, in the interest of breaking things, and if you're counting imaginary beverages anyway, you might as well choose to fill it with 'magic water that turns into/does whatever I want once I pour it out of the original container'.

Edit: That's totally a real, fictional beverage, it's called 'miscellaqueous' and is described in this work of fiction [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2mfvnv/askredditbst_if_you_were_given_a_magic_flask_that/cm3xlpf][right here]]. Obviously the first things you'd produce are a coating for the original flask imparting invincibility and other useful properties, a tonic to do the same for yourself, and a spare copy of the flask (not necessarily in that order)
