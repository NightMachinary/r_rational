A quick Google search provides a list of the most expensive liquids, some of which could be described as a beverage in that I'm pretty sure a large number of people ingested them on purpose at some point.

Blood is apparently worth over $1,000/gal, but more importantly it's, y'know, blood. Get it in O negative. Be a hero.

LSD is worth over $100,000/gal, but it's, y'know, LSD. Renegade option, I guess.

Mercury was also on the list. Not sure if it counts, or why anyone would choose it, but I felt I should mention it anyway.
