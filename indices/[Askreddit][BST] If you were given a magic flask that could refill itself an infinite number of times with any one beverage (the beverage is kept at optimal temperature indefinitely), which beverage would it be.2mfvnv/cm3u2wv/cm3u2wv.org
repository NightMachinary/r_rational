100% ethanol. It's the most useful thing I can think of that still qualifies as a beverage.

The main bottleneck in this scenario is that you have an infinite /flask/ instead of an infinite /amount/. This means that you are limited to as much as can pour out of it in a given amount of time. To solve this, I would build a centrifuge with the flask pointing outwards. At 20g of centrifugal force I would be getting far more out of my flask than normal (I think 20x as much, but I don't know fluid mechanics).

Now you have several options. The simplest is to just sell the ethanol at bulk rates, somewhere around $0.70/liter. I think we con do better. One of the biggest obstacles to reaching space is that you need to have enough fuel to lift the payload the last bit of the way, and also the fuel to lift the last bit of fuel the last bit of the way (as well as the payload), and the fuel to lift that fuel (and payload), and so on and so forth until you end up with spaceships that are mostly giant fuel tanks so that they can lift the fuel to make the trip. This flask breaks that vicious cycle. Ethanol isn't the best rocket fuel and it need oxygen to burn, so it might be restricted to the first stages only, but it could still make for massively cheaper spaceflight.

Alternatively, exploit the "optimum temperature" clause to get free energy out somehow.
