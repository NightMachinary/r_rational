Why would you use another companies branding for your liquor?

A flask pouring 24/7/365 is a very small amount of liquor on a business scale. If we are comparing it to any liquor made on a production scale (rather than the novelty super limited more-cash-than-sense type that are expensive because of a name rather than taste) you dont stand a chance in hell of affecting the price significantly.
