I've approved this post, since there's obviously a demand for it and the thread had a lot of discussion by the time I got here, but this subreddit is not the place to come dunk on the current installment of some franchise that's not making an attempt at being "rational fiction", and if you want to talk about such things, we have a number of threads you can do it in, such as the Friday Open Thread or the Wednesday Writing/Worldbuilding Thread. /If you are going to make a thread/, one with more interesting content would be appreciated, and spoiler-scoping it to the film in question would be way better than spoiler-scoping such that everything for the current film needs spoiler tags (which the mods then have to police). Better, you could write your own short treatment of the sequel trilogy that addresses or discusses all the things that you found to go against the concept of rational fiction.
