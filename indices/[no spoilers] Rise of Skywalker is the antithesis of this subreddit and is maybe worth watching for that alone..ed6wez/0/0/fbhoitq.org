Just for the record, I am working on a short treatment and perhaps should have waited, but I think I am (understandably, but unfairly) misunderstood---

I'm not claiming "lol this is bad" with generically intense words. I am in fact /actually/ making the claim that this movie /in particular/ is the /antithesis/ of rational fiction, i.e. that it is the least-good fit for rational fiction that I have ever encountered, which is a rare claim to make, and at least potentially worth registering by itself.

Thanks for your clemency, though---as noted in the OP, I was nervous about my lack of substantive content beyond the declaration, and I get that we don't want many posts this empty.
