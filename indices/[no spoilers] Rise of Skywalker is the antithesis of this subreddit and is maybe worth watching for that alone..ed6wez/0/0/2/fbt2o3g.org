Okay, so there were definitely a lot of issues with the movie and I'm not sure whether I actually liked it or not. I was pretty severely disappointed with... Quite a lot of it, actually. Especially the decision to make Rey Palpatine's granddaughter, a /somebody/ with an Important Name.

But I don't see how any of that makes it any more anti-rational than any other movie. What specifically is it about The Rise of Skywalker that makes it the exact opposite of rational fiction? What about something like Jurassic World? Surely if there's one singular movie that you can point to as being the exact opposite of rational fiction, that movie would be Jurassic World?
