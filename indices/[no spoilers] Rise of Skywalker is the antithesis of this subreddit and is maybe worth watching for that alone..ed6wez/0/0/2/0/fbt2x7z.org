I wouldn't disagree with Jurassic World as a contender. My strongest evidence without making this comment into a diatribe is "Watching Jurassic World didn't produce /specific/ and /repeated/ thoughts about how much [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would hate this, and watching Rise of Skywalker did."

Also, I believe that Jurassic World had stretches of greater than two minutes at a time without violating some basic rule of storytelling or its own world's cohesion; I spent a period in the middle of Rise of Skywalker literally counting seconds between moments-that-would-take-off-a-full-letter-grade and gave up when seven such moments passed without there ever being more than two minutes between any two.

In other words: I agree I haven't actually laid out the argument, but I nevertheless feel confident that I could (and weakly confident that I /shall,/ at some future point).
