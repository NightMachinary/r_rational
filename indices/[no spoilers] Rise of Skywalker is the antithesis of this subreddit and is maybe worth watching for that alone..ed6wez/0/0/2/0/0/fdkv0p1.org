  I agree I haven't actually laid out the argument, but I nevertheless feel confident that I could.

After having thought about this travesty of a movie literally at least once a day every day for the last two weeks, I've come around to what you're saying. I think you /could/ make the argument. I think I might purposefully go out of my way to attempt to go the rest of my natural-born life without watching the original sequel trilogy ever again. I legitimately hate it. I can't believe it's been allowed to exist.

The only reason I can think for why they pushed these movies out as quickly as they did with literally zero planning is so that they could simply establish the existence of a "sequel trilogy" as part of the original Star Wars saga. That way, when they start over in 2029 with the remake of Episode I (followed by remakes of II and III and IV and V and IV in 2031 and 2033 and 2037 and 2040 and 2043) they can continue on with remakes of VII and VIII and IX in the late '40s and early '50s without those future people thinking that it's weird for Disney to be making 9 remakes when there were only 6 originals.

Presumably they plan on so thoroughly rewriting the story of the prequel trilogy that they had to assume that the story of the OT will be altered enough that any sequel trilogy they made in the present would no longer fit, and rather than waste the creative energy coming up with a new story for the original sequel trilogy, they decided to just make all three of them soft remakes of the OT. I doubt the sequel trilogy remakes that come out in 30 years will have anything close to the same overarching plot as the original sequel trilogy (mostly because the original sequel trilogy doesn't have an overarching plot).
