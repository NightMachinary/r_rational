This isn't exactly a fresh take, but I'm astounded that they didn't even plot out the broad strokes of the trilogy before they started sinking money into it. If they knew they were making three movies, why wouldn't they, you know...decide what was going to happen in them? No one at Disney had a better idea than "really expensive exquisite corpse"?
