Is irrelevant. Those people aren't a large enough group to pay the way for big budget films. And often what they hate is what the larger market loves. For example, DC fans hate Teen Titans Go, but it's very successful with both the kids its aimed at and "normal" adults. The sort of people willing to devour dozens of sub-standard SF novels because they're in a certain universe aren't a good guide to general public taste - thank God.

> The prequel movies are some of the worst fantasy films of all time,

Are the actually worse than the 3rd movie? The one where irritating teddy bears defeat an elite high tech military force? And the first is one of the most derivative films of all time. It staples together the servant characters from Hidden Fortress with a Lensman ripoff and ends with a clone of the finale of Dambusters. It's a kid's film that actually starts using a plot device that any adult would laugh it - one much more dubious than anything used in any of the other films people complain about. (The bad guys don't shoot at a lifepod because there are no life signs... In a universe full of freaking ROBOTS!) The second film was saved because they had one of the best screenwriters ever working on it - and she had a background in writing old style SF pulp fiction.
