  Fans are stupid and inconsistent. They sulk over Jah- Jah and forgive Ewoks . They complain about relatively small plot holes and ignore the one the franchise is based on - the Empire not shooting up the droid's lifepod because of a lack on life signs, in a universe full of robots.

Fans might not be representative of the audience at large, but to me saying that fans are "stupid and inconsistent" only shows that you didn't pick up on the logic behind those things. Stories have a certain amount of credit when it comes to suspension of disbelief. You gain credit with some things, and spend it with others. If your objective isn't to be 100% rational it's fine to make something that's a bit weird or silly if it works, makes the movie more fun, or is balanced by something else. Most of the Ewoks' antics concern one specific battle that's interspersed with other two - a space battle and a lightsaber duel, both among the best of the franchise. Jar Jar is simply pointless, in a movie whose entire tone is more childish than any other that preceded it, and which is the entry point, not the end, for a trilogy, which means it's got to do more groundwork to get people to buy into its setting and conflict, as they're all brand new.

Fans might be selective in which things they complain about, but they're not reacting at random. I think you can make a movie that both fans and the general public enjoy, on average. Sure, you'll always have the occasional party pooper, but nothing can be enjoyable by literally everyone. Marvel movies however have a much better track record in this regard.
