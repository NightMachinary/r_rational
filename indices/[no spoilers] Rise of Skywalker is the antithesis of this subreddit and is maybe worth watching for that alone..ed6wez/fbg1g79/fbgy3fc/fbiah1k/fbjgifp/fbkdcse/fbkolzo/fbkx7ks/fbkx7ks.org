It's not a hard sci-fi franchise; it's always been pretty loose in plot and rules. However, that does not mean that the amount of suspension of disbelief required to buy into it enough to find it entertaining rather than frustrating is constant. Basically, everyone tends to have a threshold of bullshit they're willing to entertain and forgive for the sake of something being cool and fun. As the movies went by, Star Wars has gotten increasingly less cool and fun while throwing increasingly more bullshit at the viewers, and that threshold has been gradually passed for a lot of people. It's as simple as that.
