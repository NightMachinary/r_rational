No, it's just bad writing. Nazis had contempt to Poles and Jews. That didn't mean that the left concentration camps unguarded. The Confederacy had contempt for African Americans, but it didn't *literally forget that they freaking existed.* Which is the type of stupidity you're talking about.

To be fair, he had no way of knowing that teddy bears with spears could beat elite troops armed with energy weapons. Because there literally was no way that could happen. It was just accomplished, again, through the Magical Power Of Bad Writing.

Which works, because some people are silly enough not to notice in the first place and then find sillier excuses when it's pointed out.

(There's a deliberately hilarious example of this in Indiana Jones: Jones stows away on the deck of a submarine after the hatches have been sealed. Its shown to make at least part of the voyage submerged, but this doesn't cause him any problems...)
