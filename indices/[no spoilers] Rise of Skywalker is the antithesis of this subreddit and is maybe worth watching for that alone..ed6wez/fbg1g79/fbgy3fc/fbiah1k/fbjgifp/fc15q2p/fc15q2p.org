There's nothing to complain about ewoks, Jar Jar, or the oversight of the droids. All three are showing how the elite power structures in the universe consistently undervalue, ignore, and trample on the lowest classes of society (aliens and droids). The Empire ignoring the possibility of droids on the shuttle is emblematic of their institutional flaws, and a direct corollary to the Emperor's downfall - his plans account for everything except the ewoks, because they don't factor into his worldview.
