It's born of longing. Some of us spent 20 years or more imagining what happens after Return of the Jedi, and to see someone come in with all the money and support but none of the sense, and create something worse than 10-year-old us came up with...its a mix of bitterness, and befudlement, and ultimately, the sense that (even) we could have done better.

First step of doing better is identifying what went wrong, but the second step of improving on it is out of reach to us, except in the occasional "let's make a new script" YouTube video. So here we are firing up those skills that let us pick apart the failure state, and hoping the act of doing so burns out the frustration that's settled in our bones.

Tho that doesn't speak for everyone. Some people do indeed take it too far.
