TFA undid the meaning of all the triumphs before it, but had enough mystery boxes that fans could cook up theories to satisfy themselves.

TLJ undid TFA by taking each mystery box and opening it to reveal nothing. It also took each character and restarted their character development. The only question really left after that travesty was "How the fuck are they going to progress from here?"

TROS answers that.

Poorly. They progress poorly.
