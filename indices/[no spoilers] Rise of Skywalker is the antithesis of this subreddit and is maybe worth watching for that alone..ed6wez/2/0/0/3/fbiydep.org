The point is, in the first trilogy, it was somehow believable. Jedi existed but they need training, they've long been exterminated, their memory is starting to fade, especially because the big totalitarian Empire has a vested interest in going revisionist on their asses. Fair. It's the current sequels that (like in many other things) dug themselves deeper into a mire of plot holes. Not that the original trilogy didn't have plot holes, but this one is really bringing things to the point of collapse, they can't step anywhere without contradicting something that was previously established.
