yeah, breaking from previous canon was the equivalent of deciding that they don't want this machine which creates gold, and instead they want to scrap it for parts and sell those. if they had just made some of the novels into movies then I suspect people would be a lot more excited when a new star wars comes out. there is probably a good 2-3 trilogies worth of material available before you even need to start looking at other eras like the old republic.

if you do pick up some books, try "legacy of the force" and "fate of the jedi". both are nine book series which follow directly from the movies, both very good. if you want something shorter, you could check out crosscurrent and riptide: two books that follow jaden korr. he's the protagonist of the jedi academy game, a jedi who can make use of some dark side powers and not fall completely. it's a good example of how the extended universe can take something random, in this case the fact that the game lets you choose whatever powers you want because it is more fun that way, and make it into the basis for a good story.
