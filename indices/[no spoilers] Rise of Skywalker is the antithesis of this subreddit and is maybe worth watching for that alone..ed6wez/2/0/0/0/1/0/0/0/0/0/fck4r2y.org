no, traits must provide some benefit on their own in order to appear at all. complex traits that are linked to multiple genes or separate synergistic traits only arise long after some initial component trait is widespread or ubiquitous in a population. in this case the two traits do not provide anything without the other. thus no selection pressure to increase the likelihood that either will spread in a population.

if an animal needs force sensitivity to hunt effectively, such as is the case with vornskr, then that selection pressure will cause a population to gain the trait. after this, there now exists a selection pressure which will favor populations which are able to make greater use of the already existing trait, causing the animal to exhibit greater control and range of force abilities. it could conceivably work the other way - a population of animals which, for some reason, are better able to survive by having some sort of meditative mindset (or whatever it is that allows a force user to become better). maybe something like bears, with their hibernation, I don't know. this hypothetical population would then benefit from force sensitivity appearing, because then every individual in the population would be primed to make use of it, creating utility for those who gain force sensitivity and thus creating a selection pressure.

but again, without either trait already existing in a population for external reasons, there is no selection pressure to gain either of them.
