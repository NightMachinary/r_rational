it is possible for enclaves of force sensitive creatures to appear, which could explain a few of the force sensitive creatures that don't appear to have a good reason to be. but again, this still relies on extremely small chance of that specific mutation appearing. I'm not saying that there is zero chance that it could happen, I am saying that it is sensible to look at a universe where it doesn't always happen everywhere to every animal population.

to explain why sentients tend to always have the potential, I assume that whatever mindset that would allow someone to eventually learn to use the force is already present. this could easily be accounted for by simply having a more complex thinking apparatus capable of many different modes of thought. what keeps sentients from ALL being force sensitive is the tendency for an untrained force user to only develop significant control over his powers long after puberty, thus avoiding any selection pressure. for the traditions of trained force users, who can wield powers much sooner, there is a tendency toward celibacy for whatever reason. the one counterexample I can think of helps to make my point - the lost tribe of the sith. an entire planet of force sensitives who train their young as much as possible. they have seen the trait spread to the entire population due to the vast utility it provides, but only because they are already primed to use it, and because they train it up early enough to impact selection.
