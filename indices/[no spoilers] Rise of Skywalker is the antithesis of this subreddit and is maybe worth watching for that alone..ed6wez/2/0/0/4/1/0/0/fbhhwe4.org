  Eh. Usage of terms shifts. The "fantasy, but low fantasy" martial-arts stories that might have been referred to as xianxia back then, would be considered wuxia by modern readers/writers of the two genres. By modern standards, these stories are not fantastical enough to be xianxia.

This is pure nonsense. Eg from Journey To The West:

/Once an immortal who was the Marshal of the Heavenly Canopy commanding 100,000 naval soldiers of the Milky Way, he drank too much during a celebration of the gods and attempted to harass the moon goddess Chang'e, resulting in his banishment to the mortal world. He was supposed to be reborn as a human but ended up in the womb of a sow due to an error on the Reincarnation Wheel, which turned him into a half-man, half-pig monster./

And the point is that *that all the mystical traits in Star Wars were already well-known from Shaw Brothers movies.* In fact, most of them had been imported into Western pulp fiction decades before. And 1970s California was full of people teaching silly martial arts based on chi.
