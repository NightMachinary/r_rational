You mean Poe's attack on Dreadnought or maybe Finn and Rose attempting to destroy the hyperspace tracker? Because the former turned out to be the single best tactical decision in the entire movie, while the latter was simply poorly executed (e.g. landing on a private beach instead of hiding the vessel in the forest nearby, bringing a shady dude on a very important mission, etc.).

The problems experienced by the characters generally didn't lie in bold maneuvers or risky dramatic things, but in the fact that almost everyone was given an idiot ball in order to push the plot forward.
