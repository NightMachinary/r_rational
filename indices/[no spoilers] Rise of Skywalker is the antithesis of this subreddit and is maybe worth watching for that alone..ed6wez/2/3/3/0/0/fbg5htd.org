I can see your point with Poe, however I still disagree. Results-wise his decision was proven right, when the Resistance was forced to fight on Crait. After all Dreadnaught could just glass their outpost like it glassed the previous one. Moreover, while the losses in people could be considered a blow to the Resistance, later events made it basically irrelevant by killing off almost all of remaining ones. So even if they didn't die against Dreadnaught, they would still die soon after. As for the losses in ships, they weren't really that significant, since the bombers they've used were basically flying coffins. Sending then against anything other than unarmed, helpless targets was basically a death warrant on the pilots.

As for Finn and Rose the problem was not the risky decision, but the fact that due to utter incompetence and a streak of irrational decisions they basically forced their hand. Have they acted thoughtfully, the setbacks would've likely never happen. In the end the reason why it didn't work wasn't that they took a gamble, but that they brought the failure on themselves through acting like idiots.

So I would say that it's not the righteous choices themselves that were bad, but rather their execution. Also the movie was basically an antithesis of [[/r/rational]], since the plot moves forward by making most of the cast act irrationally.
