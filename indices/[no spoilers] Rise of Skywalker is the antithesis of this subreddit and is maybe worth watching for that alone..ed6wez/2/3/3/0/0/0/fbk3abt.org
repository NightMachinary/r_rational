The Dreadnaught being destroyed was validated /even earlier/ than the battle on Crait.

Imagine if Poe had held off on the bombing run, and the Rebel fleet had just escaped into hyperspace. The First Order fleet would have caught up with them immediately, /with the Dreadnaught ready to go,/ and blasted the entire Rebel fleet to pieces there and then.

If Poe hadn't ordered the bombing run, the movie would have been over in 10 minutes. The only reason the entire rest of the film could happen, is because of Poe's "mistake".
