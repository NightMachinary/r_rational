I see where you're coming from, but I still don't think that the specific reasons that the Macguffinquest failed are relevant to what I liked about that part of the film. Even as Finn and Rose made one dumb choice after another, I was expecting everything to somehow work out for the best. I was primed by dozens of other movies to assume that the success of Macguffinquest was a foregone conclusion, no matter what specific things happened on the way. And then that...didn't happen. Their fuckups were actual fuckups that actually mattered. The gamble was an actual gamble that was never guaranteed to pay off.

I certainly wouldn't claim that TLJ was a rational or rationalist movie on the whole. Only that there were echoes of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] in the film treating risks as /actual risks/ instead of just lip service to raise tension, and in how it rejected the idea that it's always right to do the Gryffindor thing at any risk or cost. (See: Poe ordering the retreat near the end instead of committing to a badass but doomed offensive, and this being portrayed as a wise move rather than a weak or cowardly one.)

I'll refrain from arguing the Dreadnought thing further because it's been too long since I saw the movie and I don't remember all the details of the fallout of that decision.
