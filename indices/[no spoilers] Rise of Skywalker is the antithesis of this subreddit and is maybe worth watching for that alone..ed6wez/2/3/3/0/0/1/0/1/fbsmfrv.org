  Rey's attempt to enter Supremacy on her own and let herself get captured didn't cause any setbacks either

It's still shown as a bad decision, that leads to an unfavorable situation that requires... I dunno, like, "effort" (and luck), to get out of.

Even if there aren't long term negative consequences, there's a sense of "Whew, Rey messed up, and barely got out alive. She should probably be more careful in the future".

This is /not/ a feeling that Episode IX conveys, despite Rey making quite a few really dumb decisions which magically pay off.
