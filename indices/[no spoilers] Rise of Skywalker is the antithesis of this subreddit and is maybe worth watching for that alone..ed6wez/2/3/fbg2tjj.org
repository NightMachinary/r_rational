At least TLJ sort of tried. I thought it was refreshing that it depicted heroic gambles that didn't pay off, bold maneuvers that felt noble/righteous in the moment but were ultimately harmful to the cause...There was for sure some silly shit in that movie, but I liked that for once it wasn't a given that doing the super risky dramatic thing would automatically work out.
