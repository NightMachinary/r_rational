In my opinion, what TLJ does isn't trope deconstruction. For example even "A new hope" has a few trope deconstructions. Farm boy goes on an adventure to rescue the princess, but turns out the princess doesn't need rescuing and is better at fighting her way out compared to the farm boy main hero.So the deconstructed trope is some kind of logical conclusion: Leia is the leader of a rebellion, of course she is a better shot than the boy that grew up on a farm!Or in (earlier seasons of) Games of Thrones: The trope is that the hero always survives. But the logical conclusion is that he gets killed because he is handicapped by e.g. honor and makes mistake after mistake (which he usually would get away with narrowly).

TLJ doesn't do that. It just randomly turns the trope on its head. While the idea might be good, the execution is completely lacking. If you want to subvert the "Military Maverick" trope show that the general is competent (including communication with subordinates), that the general has a plan, and then let the ace pilot be a subordinate. If the ace pilot then doesn't follow orders the logical conclusion is that it will be some kind of disaster. "Military Maverick" will at the end be some kind of asshole/idiot or even self-centered villain, but that is the price you pay.

That's another issue. The price. If you deconstruct your main villain and you don't have some kind of backup villain you have ... no villain (and the guy after you has to somehow add a new one?). James Bond gets hit by a random bullet from a random mook, it's a cool cinema moment, it is a logical conclusion of being fired at a lot, but there'll be a lot of problems finishing that movie and the next movie in the franchise will have some explaining to do (cloning?). So it is a positive surprise if someone subverts a trope, pays the storytelling price for that while still telling a coherent story.
