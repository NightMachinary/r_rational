Dude. "Detecting something via a sixth sense" is not a magnitude. Telekineting a grain of sand is meaningfully easier for most people than telekineting a spaceship, despite the fact that Yoda's training can eventually change that. It's not my fault if you're unable to envision a range for any of the abilities I mentioned, stretching from "barely a glimmer" to "full-on Jedi master."

As for "link those threads," I'm talking about other subthreads IN THIS POST.

I'm not interested in reading anything further that you have to say; if you reply, it's for the rest of the world.
