  Also, I didn't say that Force sensitivity requires Jedi-level shenanigans. Strawman much?

No, it's shorthand for what you said:

#+begin_quote
  I've only ever seen the term "Force sensitivity" to mean "can detect things via a 'sixth sense'; can telekinete or predict the future or feel the disturbance of mass death and so forth."
#+end_quote

You said that the way you use force sensitivity is to describe that magnitude of effects. People who do not, under your definition, count as force sensitive are capable of using the force- they are sensitive to it. It seems that force sensitivity exists on a sliding scale. You said Han has 0 force sensitivity, which is not possible outside of someone being cut off from the force unless you draw an arbitrary line for force sensitivity and call that 0 (implying that you can have negative force sensitivity and still be able to use the force, funnily enough).

You're free to define it that way, but don't be surprised if other people disagree with you. And don't say you didn't define it that way.
