I don't know if that's in some random comic or video game, but it's nowhere in the text of any of the following list of books, and furthermore there are long sections of books (such as Syal Antilles recounting bitter words from her father Wedge, growing up, in which Wedge talked /at length/ about the hardships of being a pilot *with no Force sensitivity*, when Jedi can just pop in at any time and outstrip your years of hard work and dedication). [Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream], from the New Jedi Order.

Incomplete list of books which I have read, often more than once, which do not support, and occasionally actively contradict, the above claim:

- Cloak of Deception
- Rogue Planet
- Outbound Flight
- Star Wars: A New Hope (novelization)
- Allegiance
- Splinter of the Mind's Eye
- The Empire Strikes Back (novelization)
- Shadows of the Empire
- Return of the Jedi (novelization)
- The Truce at Bakura
- X-Wing: Rogue Squadron
- X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble
- X-Wing: The Krytos Trap
- X-Wing: The Bacta War
- The Courtship of Princess Leia
- Heir to the Empire
- Dark Force Rising
- The Last Command
- Dark Empire
- The Jedi Academy Trilogy: Jedi Search
- The Jedi Academy Trilogy: Dark Apprentice
- The Jedi Academy Trilogy: Champions of the Force
- I, Jedi
- Children of the Jedi
- Darksaber
- Planet of Twilight
- The Crystal Star
- The Black Fleet Crisis: Before the Storm
- The Black Fleet Crisis: Shield of Lies
- The Black Fleet Crisis: Tyrant's Test
- The Corellian Trilogy: Ambush at Corellia
- The Corellian Trilogy: Assault at Selonia
- The Corellian Trilogy: Showdown at Centerpoint
- The Hand of Thrawn: Specter of the Past
- The Hand of Thrawn: Vision of the Future
- The entire New Jedi Order series, comprising 19 books (i.e. don't be fooled by the fact that this is one line; it's approximately as much content as all of the previous; please manually import nineteen lines of bulleted list)
- The Joiner King
- The Unseen Queen
- The Swarm War
- The 9 books of the Legacy of the Force series, and the 9 books of the Fate of the Jedi series (again, that's a combined additional eighteen lines of bulleted list)
- Various other little bits and bobs that aren't occurring to me right now.

It's possible that Ardvarkeating's source is somewhere in the new Disney canon, in which case ... congrats, you win the argument by throwing your faith into /the new Disney canon./ What a way to win.

It's also possible that Ardvarkeating is defining "Force sensitivity" as "has intuitions and gut feelings," which /in this universe/ often originate from the Force. This would be weird, as /in this universe,/ the term "Force sensitivity" is clearly and unambiguously used to indicate either people with explicit, deliberate control over some aspect of the Force, or people who are deeply and unusually influenced by it (e.g. people who have visions but can't telekinete or anything). Smells like a deliberate motte-and-bailey, if so; it would be rather like claiming that everyone in the world has "some Jiujitsu ability" and then falling back on, well, everyone can grab and grapple to /some/ extent.
