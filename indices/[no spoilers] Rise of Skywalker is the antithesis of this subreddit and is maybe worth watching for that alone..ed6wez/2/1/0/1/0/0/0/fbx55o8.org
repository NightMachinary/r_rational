- During the final Fate of the Jedi novel, Jaina suggests Han might be mildly Force sensitive.

- In the Star Wars: CCG (lore approved by Lucas films), Han was "force attuned", the same level as Leia

- There's a novel where Luke described Han as having an unusual presence within the force

- Probably a bunch of other stuff - it's an easy excuse to let Han do cool stuff
