Except droids exist. This doesn't address any of the biggest issues with kamikaze hyperdrives, since there's still nothing stopping people from strapping hyperdrives to asteroids and putting a droid in it.

This /does/ fix the issue with SOP being to suicide if your capital is about to die, but doesn't stop the rebellion winning the battle of yavin with 30 X and Y wings flying until their noses touch, and have droids activate hyperdrive to cut a cross section straight through the death star.
