The Exile has zero force sensitivity because she intentionally cut herself off, that's it, and she got it back and is now non-canon. There is like, one species that shuts down force powers in a given radius, and the Yuuzhon Vong don't show up and can't be effected by certain powers depending on the author, but they are still force sensitive, their (secret) leader even has force powers!
