My point is that Han can't have zero force sensitivity, he wasn't a jedi beforehand so he couldn't cut himself off, and he didn't have someone do it to him.

Those are all known ways of having zero force sensitivity. Cut LogicDragon a break on a piece of trivia from an unfinished video game that was rendered non-canon both by Disney and it's own sequel more than a decade ago. He was correct on Han Solo not having force sensitivity.
