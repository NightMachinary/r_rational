I would like to point out that all of your points are ramifications of the sequel trilogy. Point 2 in particular is a stellar example of how a sequel managed to retroactively make the predecessors worse, by turning every single military person into an idiot, particularly if they had more than five seconds to anticipate getting destroyed in their ship.
