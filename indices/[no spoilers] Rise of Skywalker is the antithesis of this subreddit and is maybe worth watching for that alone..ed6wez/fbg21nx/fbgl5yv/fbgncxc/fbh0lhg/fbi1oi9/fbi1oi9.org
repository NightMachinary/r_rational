TFA is definitely the best of the sequel trilogy, but I always hated the existence of the First Order. That they are still a large military power means that all of the events of episode 6... basically didn't matter. They toppled a galaxy spanning empire, but 30 years later there's a reskin of the Empire in an apparently dominant position, still with the ability to make planet killing weapons, and the Rebellion still exists in basically the same state it was in the original trilogy. The reskinned Empire is even lead by a mysterious old sith, with a powerful yet conflicted and angry sith general. It wouldn't be that hard to show that the First Order isn't a near exact replica of the Empire, like showing that they are merely a strong power in the local region but they no longer are dominant on a galactic scale, but nope. The FO obliterates all non-Rebellion opposition with a single shot of their superweapon.
