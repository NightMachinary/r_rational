I think I understand what you are saying.

I think I was a bit too negative with this because whenever a trope got deconstructed, I asked myself "why isn't this going how it usually goes?" and because the universe seems unlawful I just think that's what JJA think is cool with no hidden meaning, just chaos, random noise. With the added effect that the fact that the heros suffer because of this makes this interpretation awful. I mean it is just /unfair/. If anything can happen because the force or because sci-fi tech, when bad things happen it must be the fault of the movie director.

But yeah I totally get how one would like these parts of the movie. Thinking back, I guess I did empathize with the heros a bit, hence my violent reaction to the bad things that happens to them for no (good) reason. I guess it's still a performance of the director.

I still am angry of the times I got pulled out of the movie by a plot hole. But yeah, not the worst movie of the year.
