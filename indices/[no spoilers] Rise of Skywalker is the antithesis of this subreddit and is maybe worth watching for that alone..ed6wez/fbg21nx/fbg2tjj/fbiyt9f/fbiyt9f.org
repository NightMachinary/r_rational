The problem is also when the heroic gamble is, like, one third of your entire runtime - an especially /boring/ one, I'd add - and then it amounts to nothing. And one of the other thirds is a chase between two spaceships, in space, with no reference points, and the only determining factor how much fuel they have in their tanks.

Action-wise, TLJ was a snoozefest.
