  3/ People doubt the Force exists, even if it played a major role in galactic history, that it is physically observable in blood (midisomething) and can be demonstrated with a simple telekinetic trick.

I think this makes sense. Jedi are and have always been absurdly rare. Before Order 66, there were 10,000 in a galaxy with a population of 100 quadrillion. When there's so few, it's easier to just assume the well-documented cases are hoaxes. They could have been using hidden repulsors. And even assuming they do establish some people are telekinetic, that doesn't imply any more mystical importance than a repulsor has.
