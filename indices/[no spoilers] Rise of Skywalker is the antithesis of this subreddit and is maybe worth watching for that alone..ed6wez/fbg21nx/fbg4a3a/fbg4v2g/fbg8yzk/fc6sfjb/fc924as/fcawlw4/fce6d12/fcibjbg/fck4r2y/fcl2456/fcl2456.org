  no, traits must provide some benefit on their own in order to appear at all
#+end_quote

Traits appear at random, their propagation through a population is determined by fitness and random chance. There is absolutely no connection between how useful a trait is and how likely it is to appear, only how likely it is to spread. The smaller a population the more significant the effect of genetic drift is on how prevalent a trait is.

Some creatures could have gone through a bottleneck where force sensitive ones happened to be the majority that survived, then evolved the ability to take advantage of that later on (unless force sensitivity is selected for or against the proportion of force sensitive individuals in a large population will stay the same; Hardy-Weinberg Principle). Once that happens once the descendants of those creatures would fill out almost every niche in the ecosystem due to having an incredible advantage.

Regular evolution also doesn't explain how sentient creatures almost universally have force sensitivity but only animals from some ecosystems do. If it's the case that only a few ecosystems had force sensitivity appear then only a few sentient species should have force sensitivity. If it's the case that it appears in all ecosystems it should be almost ubiquitous by now.
