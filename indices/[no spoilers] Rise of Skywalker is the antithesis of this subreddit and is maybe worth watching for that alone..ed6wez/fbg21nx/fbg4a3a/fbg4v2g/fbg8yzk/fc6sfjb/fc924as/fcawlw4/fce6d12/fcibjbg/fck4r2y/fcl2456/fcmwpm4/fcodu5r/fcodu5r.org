We know the force mutation can exist in almost all sentient beings (given that everyone has a very small force presence, it probably exists in all life). Once the ability to use that would appear those creatures would out compete all others, so we would expect all biospheres to eventually be filled with force sensitive creatures. Very few are, so strictly biological explanations can't account for what we see.

We also know higher thought isn't required for force use because of things like vornskrs.

  what keeps sentients from ALL being force sensitive is the tendency for an untrained force user to only develop significant control over his powers long after puberty

One of the tests the Jedi did on Anakin was subconscious clairvoyance. Even untrained force use is very useful.

  there is a tendency toward celibacy for whatever reason
#+end_quote

No, that's pretty much just the late Republic Jedi. They also don't have a rule against celibacy, they have a rule against relationships.

  the one counterexample I can think of helps to make my point
#+end_quote

That counterexample doesn't uniquely support your idea. The ship that crashed was already full of force sensitives. It just implies force sensitivity can be passed down through families, which we already know.

I don't think this is a satisfactory explanation for how the force appears. There's nothing to uniquely support it and it can't explain both the rarity of the force and the ability of non-sentients to occasionally use it, other than by relying on some abstract "mindset" that can't even be defined, much less identified.
