Animals can use the force. See: Ysalamiri, vornskrs, jubba birds; there's a whole [[https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Force-sensitive_creatures][page]] on wookiepedia dedicated to it. That mindset would also be selected for, as genetic drift introduces force sensitivity into some populations. That's how complex organs like eyes evolved, they show up in pieces.

  while it is true that the force appears sentient some of the time, this is most likely an impression left by force users from traditions which expect the force to be sentient.

[[https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ones][Eh... there's something kind of like that.]] Besides, a lot of force traditions talk about the "will of the force", so that's an indicator there's something there. Things done with the force certainly require a lot of computation.

  that said, there are also non-biological species which are force sensitive.

Yes, that's why it's not considered biological in origin in legends. The cause of the force is something outside of what could be explained with biology, so there's no reason to think there's a causal relationship there. It could be some mystical factor that passes down to children epigenetically, to explain why it acts like a gene within families but doesn't have a biological cause or acts like a gene in the long term. Legends has a lot of "life energy" garbage, so that could be a mechanism- off the top of my head the whole Ssi-Ruu thing makes 'life-energy' pretty explicitly canon- and if a specific type of that energy conveys higher force sensitivity, and unlike normal genes isn't passed down in an all-or-one way but gets diluted, then species would actually trend towards uniform mediocre force sensitivity over time barring random generation of that new 'life energy'.
