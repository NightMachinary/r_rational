One trilogy for Thrawn, one for the Palpatine clone, one for Pellaon and the surrender of the IR gets you a whole saga from the end of the Empire, plus possible TV series following things like the X-Wing series. Then you could have a whole saga for the Vong on top of that, and this is just off the top of my head.
