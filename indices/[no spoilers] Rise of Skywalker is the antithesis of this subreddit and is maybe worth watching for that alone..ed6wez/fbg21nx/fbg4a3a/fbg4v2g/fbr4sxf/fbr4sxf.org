Force abilities seem to be genetic. The Jedi have brought these people into their order for millennia, and then enforced chastity on them.

They've basically been bred out of the population.

Granted, 10,000 people aren't going to be able to do that, but we only see the tail end of the order. They may have started with millions or billions for all we know.
