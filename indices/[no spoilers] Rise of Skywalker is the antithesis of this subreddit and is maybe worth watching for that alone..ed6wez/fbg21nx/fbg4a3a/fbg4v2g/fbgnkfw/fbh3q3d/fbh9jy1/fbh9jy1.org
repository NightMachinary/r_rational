Eh. Usage of terms shifts. The "fantasy, but low fantasy" martial-arts stories that might have been referred to as /xianxia/ back then, would be considered /wuxia/ by modern readers/writers of the two genres. By modern standards, these stories are not fantastical /enough/ to be /xianxia/.

It's a bit like how some stories can be redefined from being sci-fi to fantasy, or vice-versa, as we better understand physics. "Speculative fiction" like Verne's /A Journey to the Centre of the Earth/ is now considered fantasy.

In both cases, you could probably argue for there being a need for a "middle word" that we don't currently have. A word between /wuxia/ and /xianxia/ to describe "stories that assume Taoist mysticism is literally true, but which try to be realistic /given/ those assumptions"; or a word between /speculative fiction/ and /fantasy/ to describe "stories that make one change to the set of axioms that the world is built upon, and then rigorously constrain themselves to evaluating what would happen in such a world, with the arc of the plot entirely constrained by the world."
