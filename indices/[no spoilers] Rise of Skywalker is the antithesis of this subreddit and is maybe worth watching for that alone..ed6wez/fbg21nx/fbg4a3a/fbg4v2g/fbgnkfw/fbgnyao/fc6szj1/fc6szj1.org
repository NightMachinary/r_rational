The force is never described as limited, everyone has it. The history of the Star Wars galaxy is basically a history of force users killing each other on a massive scale, they've almost wiped themselves out of existence. The prequels pick up on the tail end of thousands of years of Jedi preventing those with the highest force sensitivity from breeding.
