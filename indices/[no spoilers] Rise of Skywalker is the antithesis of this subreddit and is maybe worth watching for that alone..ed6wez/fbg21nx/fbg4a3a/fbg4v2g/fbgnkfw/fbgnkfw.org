  why are jedi rare? I mean if people with strong force aptitude can manage miracles without training, wouldn't jedi be more frequent?

I always read /Star Wars/ as following conventional Xianxia rules (even though those hadn't nearly been established when the first ones came out): there's /qi/---some sort of dark matter---out there in the world; it's a scarce resource; you [or your midichlorians, I guess] have to absorb it into your body (i.e. /cultivate/) to get more powerful.

It seems like, in the /Star Wars/ universe, there's so little /qi/ out in the universe that just a few cultivators can soak up the entire universe's supply, leaving none for anyone else.

(This also creates an actual /inverse ninja rule/ in the /Star Wars/ universe: if you create 50 clone soldiers made to all be cultivators, they have to split the already-tiny amount of environmental /qi/ between them, resulting in each being 1/50th as force-attuned as your average cultivator.)

Maybe /Star Wars/ is set in some sort of post-apocalyptic setting where /qi/ used to be abundant-enough for the progenitor of humans and other alien species to evolve the capability to manipulate it; but something happened and now it's mostly gone.
