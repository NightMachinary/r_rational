No spoil of the last movie ahead!

There is so many sins committed in this franchise, you don't even need to get to the not rational part.

I mean, there is no consistency or coherence. I'll take merely three examples that for me are worth a million sinful details :

1/ If you are Han Solo, you can apparently time going out of hyperspace to land between a planetary shield and the ground. Using your reflexes. At a speed greater than light. Seriously.

2/ If you have a big starship threatening you, you can turn around and suicide hyperspace your starship into it. One wonder then why :

2.1/ One doesn't use one of the expendable, mass produced and barely sentient droids to perform the suicide mission

2.2/ One make convoluted plans to destroy a death star, losing scores of pilots in the process

2.3/ One builds a BIG DEATH STAR in the first place when any big and expensive ship becomes a liability.

3/ People doubt the Force exists, even if it played a major role in galactic history, that it is physically observable in blood (midisomething) and can be demonstrated with a simple telekinetic trick.

That's why Star Wars (and especially the lasts movies) can't ever even reach the rational level of fiction.

1/ Not respecting basic / consistent rules of a universe

2/ Not respecting precedents set by previous movies

3/ Not having minimally intelligent protagonist we can empathize with

Maybe I'm more harsh because star wars is popular and some better constructed and deserving science-fictions are not.
