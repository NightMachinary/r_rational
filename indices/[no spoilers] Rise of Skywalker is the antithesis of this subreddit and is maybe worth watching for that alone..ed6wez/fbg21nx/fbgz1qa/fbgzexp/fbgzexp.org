Maybe you should try Lensman, the original space opera and source of a lot of Star Wars tropes. Start with the third book, Galactic Patrol - the two before it are inferior and were pushed into the series later. Its bizarre beyond words (imagine Star Wars with the Jedi based in the Pentagon and a smarter, impossibly good looking Oliver North as the hero) but the military technology is certainly consistent and pushed to its limit. (Among other things it predicted stealth and AWACS, and actually made fights with space axes work logically. And Worsel Of Velantia would eat Yoda as a snack before breakfast. It's also the source of some of the jokes in Hitch Hikers - eg "Horribly be-weaponed battleships" and "Jeweled battleshorts.")
