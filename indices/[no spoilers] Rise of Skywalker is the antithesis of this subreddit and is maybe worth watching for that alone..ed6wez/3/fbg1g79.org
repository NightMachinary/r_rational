Yeah, it's obvious that they jumped into this new trilogy with no overarching plot or themes, each film was an overreaction to the criticisms of the previous film. The prequel movies are some of the worst fantasy films of all time, but they at least had some original ideas and weren't shy about putting them out there.

I think it all comes down to greed. Disney jettisoned the Star Wars expanded universe because they didn't want to adapt anything and have to pay royalties like with Marvel, but the EU represented decades of market research on how to expand the setting , what works and what doesn't , and what fans love and hate about the setting.
