You could say the same thing about almost all Marvel comics, but every so often a diamond gets through and those are the ones that get adapted to film. Even if they don't want to adapt anything the EU is still useful , if only as an example of what not to do.

For instance, Abrams had to reshoot large parts of the new movie because his test audiences hated how they re-introduced and dealt with Palpatine. - (which I think I can say without spoiler tags, since he's on the movie posters). - But the expanded universe made the exact same mistakes with that character decades ago , and had documentation on how the fans reacted and how they fixed the problem.
