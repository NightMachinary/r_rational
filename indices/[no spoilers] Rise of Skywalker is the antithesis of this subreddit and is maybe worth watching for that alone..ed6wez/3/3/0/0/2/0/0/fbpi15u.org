Actually, It's interesting to trace the Ewoks' and Jar-Jar's lineage. Like virtually everything in Star Wars, they're not at all original. The Ewoks are rather similar the H. Beam Piper's Fuzzies. And the first big "adult" SF franchise to add a sidekick aimed at selling spin-offs to young children was Perry Rhodan with Bucky the mouse beaver - a psionic alien who would have kicked Yoda's ass and was probably inspired by the Lensman's Worsel and the realisation that furry alien tots to sell than scaled flying snake-crocodiles with multiple eye stalks. (Easier to manufacture too.)

For those who don't know what Perry Rhodan is (wikipedia) -

  Perry Rhodan is the eponymous hero of a German science fiction novel series which has been published each week since 8 September 1961 in the 'Romanhefte' format (digest-sized booklets, usually containing 66 pages, the German equivalent of the now-defunct American pulp magazine) by Pabel-Moewig Verlag, a subsidiary of Bauer Media Group. As of February 2019, 3000 booklet novels of the original series plus 850 spinoff novels of the sister series Atlan plus over 400 paperbacks and 200 hardcovers have been published, totalling over 300,000 pages. Having sold approximately two billion copies (in novella format) worldwide alone, (including over one billion in Germany), it is the most successful science fiction book series ever written. The first billion of worldwide sales was celebrated in 1986.[1]

A mere 126 novels were translated into English. From my attempts to skim one, they were awful - but probably still better than Star Wars EU novels.
