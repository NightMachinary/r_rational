..Oh God - David Weber. The one man (I'm aware of) whose work makes Star Wars EU novels look good. Otoh, this thread wouldn't exist without him and it's hilarious:

Not even Marissa Picard is worse than Honor - only Terran Jedi Harris (a million freaking words of fanfic badness) is worse.

Talking of tropes, the reason that Thrawn is probably that the race of hyper-competent humanoids on the villain's side in Lensman were. They worked for the even cooler Eich, who worked for the even cooler.. Umm, I can't remember. But they were basically scaled-down Cthulhus. There was also a race of sadistic telepathic dragon snakes.

Lensman also took quite a few hints from Olaf Stapledon - the scale of the conflict was truly "cosmic" with beings from multiple universes fighting a war lasting billions of years.
