That misses the point. Which is that

1. Fans aren't a reliable guide to mass market behaviour

2. Fans are stupid and inconsistent. They sulk over Jah- Jah and forgive Ewoks . They complain about relatively small plot holes and ignore the one the franchise is based on - the Empire not shooting up the droid's lifepod because of a lack on life signs, in a universe full of robots.
