This is a somewhat intelligent argument, but no.

  to me saying that fans are "stupid and inconsistent" only shows that you didn't pick up on the logic behind those things. Stories have a certain amount of credit when it comes to suspension of disbelief. You gain credit with some things, and spend it with others. If your objective isn't to be 100% rational it's fine to make something that's a bit weird or silly if it works, makes the movie more fun, or is balanced by something else. Most of the Ewoks' antics concern one specific battle

You're missing the point that the whole franchise is that stupid. The storm troopers are an elite force until they need to be incompetent, then they are. The freaking Imperials forget the existence of robots when they fail to shoot up the life pod. People in starships fight at closer ranges than pilots in WW2. Any idiot could easily defeat a Jedi using a shotgun. The Jedi are supposed to be wise and good but they fight using a slave army of unknown origins. Robots are easily available and the Republic has a massive population but they don't consider using droids, conscripts, or volunteers. And how the hell can one previously unknown planet produce enough clones to fight a galactic war? It's a children's movie franchise, based on the rule of cool. If you don't find Jar Jar cool but do enjoy pretend sword fights, then that's because you want the movie to pander to a 12 year old mentality rather than an 8 year old one. And really, that isn't any better - it's just a different demographic.

  Jar Jar is simply pointless, in a movie whose entire tone is more childish than any other that preceded it

Every movie was childish. Light saber fights are childish: they're just a different sort of childish. There is nothing grown-up at any point during any Star Wars movie. (At least that I can think of right now.)

  Fans might be selective in which things they complain about, but they're not reacting at random.

I don't think you can safely say that with cutting open a statistically valid sample and seeing what's inside.
