I don't think that's true anymore due to the changes in technology. The fans are the ones talking about the series and spreading word about it, and when the fans embrace or reject something they have the ability to make themselves heard now and have a real effect.

I wouldn't say that fans sulked over Jar Jar either. I think people realized that the Phantom Menace was a terrible film, but the average person might not be able to break it down and say exactly why the pacing was a mess, or the why characters were one dimensional, or why so many great actors were turning in wooden performances, so fans latched on to something obvious like Jar Jar. Return of the Jedi has some of the same problems as the Phantom Menace, but it's a much better film overall, so people were less willing to nitpick it.
