This is what I really liked about the prequels: the scope is truly galaxy-wide, and you really feel that there's stuff happening in the background.

7 & 8 feel positively claustrophobic after that. I actually think that JJ Abrams did a good job keeping the threads open with 7, even if the whole film is a step-by-step retread of 4 - but it was clear that he was not given any kind of direction where any of the follow-up films would go...
