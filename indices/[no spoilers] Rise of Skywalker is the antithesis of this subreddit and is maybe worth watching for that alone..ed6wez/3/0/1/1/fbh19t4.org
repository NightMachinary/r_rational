So like, I totally get all that, but it's still baffling to me for one small reason:

/Disney owns Marvel/.

They already /have/ a billion dollar franchise that has a license to print money /sustainably/ over /a decade/ and it's mostly thanks to starting momentum and careful planning, under the head of Kevin Feige.

Star Wars had more starting momentum than they could ever want. All they needed was to find someone who could act like Feige, possibly someone already from Lucasfilm or LucasArts or something, someone as familiar with the franchise as they could be without being George Lucas. They then have that person draft a series of phases, let them act as the last word on such trivial matters as "what is the movie about", and then let em rip.

(Actually, now that I think about it, if they could get George to do it initially, it would probably work great. He had already been doing something similar for years and years signing off on books, games, TV show plots and so on; keep him away from the script and away from the director's chair and he probably would have done fine.)

Instead they adopted the Marvel pattern of different directors without any oversight, and it fell apart.
