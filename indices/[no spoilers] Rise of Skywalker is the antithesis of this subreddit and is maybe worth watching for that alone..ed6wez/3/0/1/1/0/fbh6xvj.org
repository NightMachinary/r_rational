Right, but that was my point, here: the culture in Hollywood is such that studios like Marvel (who plan for ongoing creative direction) or Pixar (who at least ensure continuity of direction in sequels, even if they weren't planned as part of an N-ology to begin with) are /accidents/. One studio might have institutional knowledge of the value of creative direction, but that doesn't mean that an acquirer like Disney will /inherit/ or /absorb/ that institutional knowledge from them. Usually the other way around, in fact.

The games industry is very similar, and I bring it up because there's a helpful central example of this effect in the games industry that a lot of people are aware of: EA. EA buy studios with creative vision, who clearly have often succeeded /because/ of their creative vision, and then learns nothing from them, and gradually destroys any element of creative vision in the absorbed studio.
