This just isn't true of tent-pole franchises any more. Generally there's a concept, money gets behind, and writers are hired to base a script around it.

> The screenplay might get rewritten several times by the director, editor, etc. of the movie

No. Editors never even see the screenplay. Most screenplays get re-written by more /writers./

> And even movies that are adapted from novels go through this process: usually, some Writer's Guild screenwriter buys the rights to the novel, and then writes a screen adaptation, and then sells /that/ to a studio

No.

Generally a studio or a producer buys rights and hires a writer - eg Warner bought Harry Potter from JKR. If a producer has rights he'll often pitch a studio with a treatment and try to get development money to pay for a script. In fact, most remotely suitable novels aren't available to script writers because a studio has already optioned the rights. Another example is Amazon - not a scriptwriter - buying the rights to Iain Banks' Culture series. Or Gone With The Wind got made when Selznick International bought the rights, partnered with another production company, and hired multiple writers.
