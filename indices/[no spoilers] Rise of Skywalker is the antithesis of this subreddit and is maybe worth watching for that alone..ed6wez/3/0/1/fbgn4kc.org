"Having a visionary writer/director on staff" is just not something that [live-action] film producers are trained to /seek out/, I think. (Unlike television producers, who at least /know of/ the job-role of "creative director", if only as "that asshole from franchise corporate who's breathing down our necks about portraying the toys correctly as characters.")

The "way movies get done" 99% of the time in the big Hollywood studios, is that a producer will /buy/ a screenplay from a Writer's Guild screenwriter on the open market; and then they'll set up a new production staff (director et al) to make that screenplay into a movie. The screenplay might get rewritten several times by the director, editor, etc. of the movie, but the seed of it always came from a screenwriter who was more-than-likely entirely unaffiliated with the production staff of any previous movie in the series thus-far.

And even movies that are adapted from novels go through this process: usually, some Writer's Guild screenwriter buys the rights to the novel, and then writes a screen adaptation, and then sells /that/ to a studio.

Even if this is not the way Disney makes their live-action movies (and I'm suspicious that it might still be), it's industry culture, in a way that makes long-term planning /not/ industry culture.
