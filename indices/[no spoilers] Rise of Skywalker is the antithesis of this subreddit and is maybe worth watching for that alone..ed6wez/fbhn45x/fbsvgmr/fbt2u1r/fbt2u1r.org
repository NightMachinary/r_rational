The thing is, Star Wars /doesn't/ have a rare setting. Lucas originally wanted to write /Flash Gordon,/ but he couldn't get the license, so he made his own mashup knock-off, combining elements of /Flash Gordon/, /Buck Rogers/, /Dune/, and /John Carter of Mars/. A lot of the success of /Star Wars/ was repackaging and synthesizing for a new era a lot of the old serials that Lucas had grown up with, and it's /highly/ derivative in a way that proves that being derivative doesn't matter so long as you execute well. Most of what was novel about /Star Wars/ was in the ground-breaking special effects and the way that it revived a genre that was close to dead.
