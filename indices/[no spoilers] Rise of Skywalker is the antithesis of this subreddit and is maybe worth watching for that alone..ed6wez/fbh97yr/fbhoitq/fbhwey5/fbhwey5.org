I think that "On the nature of 'irrational' fiction (through the lens of the Star Wars sequel series)" would make for a good essay, especially if kept brief and to the point rather than delving into plot holes and minutia. Here, it's kind of left as an exercise for the reader, and I don't think any of the comments thus far have provided illumination on (or defense of) the thesis statement.

I haven't seen the final film yet, so I can't say whether it would be a better choice, but if I were going to write that kind of essay, my lens would be a work of allegory or magical realism where the object-level plot and character motivation is essentially non-existent or unimportant because the focus is entirely lifted from the object level, and the characters are meant by the artist to be understood as not being actual realistic (or even surrealistic) characters, but rather, as symbols for other concepts or tools for expression of an idea. /Mother!/ might be a good choice, or possibly /A Ghost Story/, to select recent films, though you'd probably want to pick a film that critics and audience members widely agree on as good, as much as is possible for that kind of film.
