My point was that you shouldn't listen to the fans when deciding what to put in a new movie. This has nothing to do with what you're saying. Yes, if they say they hated a movie, then you can assume they did. But that doesn't mean listening to the details of what they say will help you fix the next one. Especially as many of them seem to be just plain creepy incels.
