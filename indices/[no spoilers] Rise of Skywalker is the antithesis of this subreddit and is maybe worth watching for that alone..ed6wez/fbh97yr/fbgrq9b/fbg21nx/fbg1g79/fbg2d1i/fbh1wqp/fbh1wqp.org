  I think it all comes down to greed.

I'm sure Disney is greedy, but I don't think Disney is more greedy than Disney. If they can refrain from letting greed ruin their IPs for the MCU, for Disney classics, as well as the live-action remakes (which are blatant money grabs, but done pretty well for the most parts), then why can't they do it for Star Wars.

There's no rule that says you can't make good movies if you're greedy. There's certainly no rule saying that greed forbids you from having a consistent plot.

If it had been purely greed, they would have made a series of boring, paint-by-numbers sequels that took no risks. Which is what they did with TFA, but not for the next two.
