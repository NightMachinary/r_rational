/I don't think that's true anymore due to the changes in technology. The fans are the ones talking about the series and spreading word about it, and when the fans embrace or reject something they have the ability to make themselves heard now and have a real effect./

Maybe. But what fans think they will like and what they will actually like are two different things. And they're hardly the only people who will comment on a successful film. Once again, Teen Titans Go is a big success, and the Retarded Nerd Club hates it.

/I wouldn't say that fans sulked over Jar Jar either./

I remember the reaction to the film. And for that matter Simon Pegg based an entire episode of Spaced around the adult fans' hatred of Jar Jar...

And if you say that fans reacted to Jar Jar because they can't articulate their real problems with a movie, then what exactly is the point in listening to them???

Which is RoS tried to do anyway - it's just a bad idea. The more someone obsesses over one of these silly franchises, the less likely they are to be creative. If you take the average of the opinion of millions of obsessed, unimaginative people, the results are going to be awful.
