  This isn't exactly a fresh take, but I'm astounded that they didn't even plot out the broad strokes of the trilogy before they started sinking money into it.

To me this is even more baffling if we consider it's the same company that managed to somehow handle a decade-long franchise with dozens of movies and an overarching plot and all in all pulled it off pretty decently, without it completely coming apart at the seams.
