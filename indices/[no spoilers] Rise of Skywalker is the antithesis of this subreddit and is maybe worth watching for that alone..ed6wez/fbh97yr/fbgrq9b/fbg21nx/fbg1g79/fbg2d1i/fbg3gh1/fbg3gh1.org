I know, it's so weird when you consider how many thousands of people worked on these films, and the billion dollar production and marketing budgets.

You can probably pin that on a failure of leadership. They gave the films to two different directors and apparently cut them loose to do whatever they wanted. This whole mess could have been avoided with just basic oversight; an executive producer with the power to rein them in, and another screenwriter to organize their ideas and nail down a beginning, middle and end to work towards.
