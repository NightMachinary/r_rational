The Thrawn trilogy and Hand of Thrawn duology, and the X-Wing novels, being head-and-shoulders above the rest (in my opinion).

The rest of the Legends books I've read are readable and enjoyable (excepting a few real stinkers like /Planet of Twilight/ and /The Crystal Star/), but not remarkably so.
