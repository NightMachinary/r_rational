the (now no longer canon) extended universe actually goes into a lot of this. everything below is drawn from extended universe sources.

part of it is that the jedi rely on propaganda and that their fear of the darkside is a little overblown sometimes. there are a bunch of different force traditions scattered throughout the galaxy that are more neutral. the jedi are simply the most public and evangelical of force traditions.

there isn't actually any sort of precedent for our mary sue protagonist being able to use force mind powers without training... so that one is just terrible writing. the lightsaber combat mastery could conceivably be justified because lightsaber martial arts are written into a sort of jedi akashic record, just floating out there for force users to telepathically stumble onto. I assume (charitably) this is what they were going for when rey switches to a more aggressive stance when she was training in the second movie. if only this scene had happened before the end of the first movie, it might have made a reasonable amount of sense. this phenomenon also accounts for darth vader. he was the most deadly lightsaber duelist in a thousand years primarily because of his strong force connection, not his dedication and practice (though that helps as well).

regarding genetics and clones - secret programs of this sort to create super assassins from force users do exist, but are generally not scalable as the clones themselves are either mentally or physically unstable (clones of unusually powerful force users at least) or difficult to control (all your minions have their own super powers...) so they tend not to go anywhere. also, in the common races the genetically linked super powers only show up on their own around adulthood (individual is already at or past reproductive age) and even if you have the trait the powers show up very rarely and weakly in the untrained, thus survival of the fittest will in almost all cases fail to take this trait into account. there are some races that use the force for everyday things, and in these races they have basically 100% chance to be a force user. there is actually an empire that existed in prehistory that was like this, and a gradually increasing number of individuals being born without force sensitivity eventually led to a total collapse.

EDIT: also I haven't seen the 3rd new movie, so I am not in a position to make any sort of comment on anything that happens there.
