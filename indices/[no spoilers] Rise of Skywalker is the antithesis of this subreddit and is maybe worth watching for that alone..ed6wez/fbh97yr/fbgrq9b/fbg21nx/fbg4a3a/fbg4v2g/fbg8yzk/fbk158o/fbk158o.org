I was always under the impression that midichlorians are a symptom of Force sensitivity, not the cause. Force sensitivity is supposed to arise randomly among the general population, rather than follow bloodlines. So there aren't actually any "Force genes" that you can select for.

The Skywalker lineage notwithstanding - that feels more like hack writers thinking "well if this guy is a badass space wizard, clearly his children should be too!". Because nothing makes me connect to a hero more than knowing he was literally born superior to everyone else in the story, right?
