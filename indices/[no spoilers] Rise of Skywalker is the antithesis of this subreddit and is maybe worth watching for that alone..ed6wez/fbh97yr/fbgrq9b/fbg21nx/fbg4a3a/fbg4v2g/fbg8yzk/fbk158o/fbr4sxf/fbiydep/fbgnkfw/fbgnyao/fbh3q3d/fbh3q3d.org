  I always read

  Star Wars

  as following conventional Xianxia rules (even though those hadn't nearly been established when the first ones came out):

??? Xianxia is an old genre. The first modern xix novel was written in the 30s and the related traits that Star Wars used were extremely well known from martial arts movies - chi as the force, the ancient master. "Xian" just means Taoism. This is the whole point of Pai Mei in Kill Bill: the immortal master character is shot in a 60s/70s way because he's a character from the films of that era.
