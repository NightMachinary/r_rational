yeah, but not all animals do. some species lack the ability to use it instinctively, and thus it would never be selected for. hence why sandworms never use the force. others do possess compatible instincts and thus it becomes ubiquitous among their species. hence why there are no vornskr which lack force sensitivity. however, if either force sensitivity or the instincts to use it are not initially present, there would be no selection pressure to generate either of them, so the odds of a species transitioning to force sensitive like your examples is rare to the point of being a fluke, or require some other external pressure (vornskr hunt another force sensitive creature as their main food source, they needed force sensitivity to hunt effectively).

oh, the mention of non-biological entities accessing the force wasn't connected to any sort of idea about biological origins of the force itself. my head-canon is that the force is some sort of energy field that is both untethered from space and from the flow of time (enabling access to visions of distant places, the past, and possible futures without requiring computation) and mutable/impressionable (enabling seeming intelligent action from traditions which have primed it to act that way). I've always thought of force sensitivity as a holistic evaluation of the total state of an organism with many factors to determine strength, rather than something specific that you have or don't have. honestly, you are probably dead on with the force having some sort of mystical tag that has its own inheritance method, though I am not convinced that your suggested means of transmission fits everything that can be observed in the extended universe.
