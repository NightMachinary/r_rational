Thrawn is a rational character, or at least as close as one gets in Star Wars. He learns from his mistakes, only punishes his subordinates for actual incompetence rather than simple bad luck, and almost always out-thinks his opponents to win. I will grant, though, that his ability to guess his opponents' next moves by studying their cultures' art is just magic by a different name - but at least it's /consistent/ magic that, at least in principle, any other character in the story could learn with enough effort. It's quite notable that, before his final defeat, which is due to behind-the-scenes political maneuvering by Leia, /every single time/ that Thrawn loses is due to coincidence and bad luck rather than anything under Thrawn's control.
