from a purely genetic standpoint, why would the trait show up if a species lacks the machinery to make use of it? if an animal species lacks whatever mindset is necessary to make use of the force, then any random mutation which causes an individual to become force sensitive would not produce any reproductive advantage, likely causing the gene to not spread far if at all. the fact that force sensitivity tends to provide functionally no benefit on its own is reason enough that evolution fails to seed it everywhere.

while it is true that the force appears sentient some of the time, this is most likely an impression left by force users from traditions which expect the force to be sentient. there are a number of traditions that use the force as they would any other tool (or in some cases, an extension of their body), and I can't think of any instances in any of the books where that has backfired on them.

that said, there are also non-biological species which are force sensitive. two crystal species which I know of, which exist independent of traditional genetics. there are also machines built by a specific ancient empire which interact with the force and require it in order to operate, so the ultimate answer (if we throw out author fiat) is most likely that the force has a bunch of entry points, and that at least some of them are genetically linked, and that some of those gene variants confer enough of an advantage to make the force ubiquitous in a species, and some variants do not.
