OK why not. But why are jedi rare?

In the first trilogy, well most were previously killed by a targeted offensive of the dark side. Fair enough.

In the prequel, we learn that finding people with a strong aptitude must be done early, in order to stir them away from the dark side and train them. Fair enough.

In the last trilogy, we have yet another spontaneous force user, who gets no training and still manage to beat trained jedi. Ahem. I mean if people with strong force aptitude can manage miracles without training, wouldn't jedi be more frequent?

And here I'm only talking about internal consistency. Let's not get started on how an aptitude that is obviously genetically conditioned and gives you super powers should evolutionary be selected for and become the norm in a few 100ish generations. And please, please, let's not talk about the fact that they have access to CLONING TECHNOLOGY. please.
