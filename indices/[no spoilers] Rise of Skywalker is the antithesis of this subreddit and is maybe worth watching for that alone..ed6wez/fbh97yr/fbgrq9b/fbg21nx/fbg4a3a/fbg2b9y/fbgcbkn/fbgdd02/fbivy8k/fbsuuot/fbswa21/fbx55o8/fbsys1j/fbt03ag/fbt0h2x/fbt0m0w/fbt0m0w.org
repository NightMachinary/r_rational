So, I notice that /neither/ of us is actually providing citations, and that my prior is /still/ that I've read more Star Wars than either you or LogicDragon, and I have not updated away from my claim that Han has been written about in multiple places as having zero Force sensitivity. Y'all's perception of what it means to "have Force sensitivity" doesn't match the way the term is used in several dozen books (I'm not relying on the unfinished video game).

I don't really mind if this fails to update /you./ I just didn't want to leave LogicDragon's false statement left unchallenged. Mission accomplished.
