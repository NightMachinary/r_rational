Except you /can/ do stuff with the force below the amount of force sensitivity required to pull off all the Jedi shenanigans. As an example of the force used by someone not considered force sensitive, Chirrut Imwe from Rogue One uses the force despite his official character bio saying he "lacks force abilities". Furthermore, we know from the Matukai that some training can increase force sensitivity from levels below what would be required for traditional force sensitivity to that level, so it's clearly not a hard cutoff.

Cite your sources, "I've read more than you" is not adequate.
