  Dude. "Detecting something via a sixth sense" is not a magnitude. Telekineting a grain of sand is meaningfully easier for most people than telekineting a spaceship, despite the fact that Yoda's training can eventually change that. It's not my fault if you're unable to envision a range for any of the abilities I mentioned, stretching from "barely a glimmer" to "full-on Jedi master."

Jedi /do/ have varying degrees of sensing. In the movies, even, Anakin gets future visions that most others don't seem to. I'm not... actually sure what your criticism is here? I mean, /I/ said that there is meaningful force sensitivity below the level you seem to be describing as "force sensitive", if you're saying that even a glimmer of force sensitivity is enough then we're back to everyone being force sensitive by even your definition.

  As for "link those threads," I'm talking about other subthreads IN THIS POST.

If you mean [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ed6wez/no_spoilers_rise_of_skywalker_is_the_antithesis/fbtd70t/][this]], well A) just listing books without quoting specific lines is a completely unreasonable way to cite sources, and B) you weren't explicit but it seems like you were responding to the claim that pilots use force sensitivity to dodge automated defenses rather than the subject of 0 force sensitivity. That's the only place you even give a name of a source, so I assume it's what you mean.

  I'm not interested in reading anything further that you have to say; if you reply, it's for the rest of the world.

I've learned that the angrier someone gets over being asked to source a claim, the more likely what they're trying to sell you is bullshit.
