It's a calculated risk; I've read over 100 Star Wars books (most of them more than twice) and seen a lot of the visual media, so even though I will be predictably wrong once in a while it's the right prior.

I think there's actually no disagreement here, except in what the term "Force sensitivity" means. Like, if we replace the word with long sentences, describing what we think is actually going on, I suspect we don't disagree.

I *do* think it's dumb/wrong to use the term "Force sensitivity" to mean "alive" or "present in the Force;" that's why we have the phrases "alive" and "present in the Force." I've only ever seen the term "Force sensitivity" to mean "can detect things via a 'sixth sense'; can telekinete or predict the future or feel the disturbance of mass death and so forth."

As I noted elsewhere, saying "everyone is at least a little Force sensitive" when you just mean "everyone's alive or influenced by the Force" is a little like saying "everyone knows at least a little Jiujitsu" when you just mean "well, everyone knows how to grab somebody and rassle."
