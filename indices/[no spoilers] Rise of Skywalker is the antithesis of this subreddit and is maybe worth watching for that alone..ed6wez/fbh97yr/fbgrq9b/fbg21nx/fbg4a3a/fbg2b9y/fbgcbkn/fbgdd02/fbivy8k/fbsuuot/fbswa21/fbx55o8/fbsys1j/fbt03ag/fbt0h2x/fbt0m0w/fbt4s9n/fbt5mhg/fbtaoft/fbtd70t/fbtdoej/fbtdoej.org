I'm referring to force sensitivity as literally being alive and not the exile that one time. High levels of force sensitivity means you have good reflexes and precognition which presents itself as gut feelings which often turn out to be right ("I have a bad feeling about this"). Extremely high levels of force sensitivity means you're capable of becoming a force user. The best pilots /who aren't jedi/ are very force sensitive, just not to the degree of shooting lightning.

To paraphrase Yoda, the force connects us all, binds us, there is no life without the force.

Also, work on your self-restraint. That was /way/ too easy to provoke you. I had like 6 more posts lined up.
