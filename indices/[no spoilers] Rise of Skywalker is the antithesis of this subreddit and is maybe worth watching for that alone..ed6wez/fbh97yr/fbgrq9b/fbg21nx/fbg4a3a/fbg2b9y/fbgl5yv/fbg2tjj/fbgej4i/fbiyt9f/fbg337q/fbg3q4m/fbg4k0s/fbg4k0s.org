What I remember about the attack on the big ship at the beginning was that Poe felt vindicated because they succeeded in taking it down, but the film went out of its way to acknowledge that the good guys lost a substantial chunk of their limited forces in the process and that continuing to pull high-risk high-reward maneuvers like that presented a real risk of dooming them by attrition. I liked that; it grounded the story. As for the hyperspace tracker, I don't remember the exact details; I recall it being set up as one of those things where the good guys are going to have to eat some kind of loss or concession to prevent an even worse outcome, but the main characters are morally outraged by the idea of accepting that loss and instead gamble on an approach that's riskier but has the slim possibility of delivering a complete win. When I see that kind of setup in an action movie, I know with the certainty of natural law that it's going to be touch-and-go for a while, but ultimately the heroes will thread the needle on that one-in-a-million chance and prove they were right not to take the initial L. Except this time it not only didn't work, it also screwed up a different plan and resulted in a lot of unnecessary deaths.

It's not as important, in my mind, whether they failed purely because they made tactical mistakes or whether it was truly impossible for them to have succeeded. The point is that they took a big risk that, in just about any other action movie, would have paid off no matter how much the universe had to twist itself in knots to make that happen--and for once, it /didn't./ There were shades of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] in that the choices that felt noble or brave or righteous weren't always the consequentially best choices.

(It reminded me a bit of those thought experiments where you imagine a population threatened by a plague and have to decide between a treatment that will definitely save only X% of them, or a treatment with a Y% chance of saving everyone and a 100-Y% chance that everyone dies. In most movie universes you can pretty much assume that Y = 100% no matter how low the characters say it is.)
