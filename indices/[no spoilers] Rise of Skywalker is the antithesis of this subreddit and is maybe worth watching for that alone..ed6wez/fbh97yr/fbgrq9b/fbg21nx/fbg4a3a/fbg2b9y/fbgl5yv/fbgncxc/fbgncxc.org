Don't take my ranting for a careful analysis, it is not! I actually liked the original trilogy and the prequel (maybe nostalgia, maybe I never expected much of star wars than a nice adventure in space). As others pointed out as well, the money and greed ruined any chance of making something palatable out of the sequel.

To rant a bit more about my second point. The entirety of the previous movie stands on the completely artificial deadline of the convoy of ships getting picked up one by one. At no point any of those condemned ship has the brilliant idea to make their sacrifice actually worth something for the others but turning around and attempting a face jump. It has to be the very last ship and the single most important character on board that does this. Not a single line to explain this EVEN IF IT WAS EASY! They could have said it is a very difficult jump and only the best pilot could reach its target. They could have said that it required a very large ship like the commanding one to do any damage. They could have said such a move is prohibited by Galactic Law of The Orange Bible and the commander took it on herself to go to hell for this.

ANYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER than that deafening silence.
