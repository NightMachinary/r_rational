That's a fair opinion, but the movie isn't really consistent in that matter, as basically all other gambles are rewarded with little to no cost. Poe's decision to blow up Deadnaught was validated later on, Rey's attempt to enter Supremacy on her own and let herself get captured didn't cause any setbacks either, while Rose ramming into Finn's speeder not only didn't kill them both outright, but also somehow didn't cause gorilla walkers to just shot them down.

One swallow does not make a spring. The movie doesn't treat risks as /actual risks/ unless characters go out of their way to maximize said risks with their misguided actions. And even then they often get a free pass.
