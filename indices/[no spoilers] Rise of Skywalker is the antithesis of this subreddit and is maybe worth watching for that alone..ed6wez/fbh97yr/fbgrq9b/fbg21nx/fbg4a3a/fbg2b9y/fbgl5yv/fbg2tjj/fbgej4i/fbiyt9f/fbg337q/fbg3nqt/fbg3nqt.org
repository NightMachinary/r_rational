I wasn't referring to the good guys experiencing major setbacks in general, so much as the brutal deconstruction of tropes that are normally taken for granted in action movies like these. The hail-mary Macguffin quest backfires, the hotshot railing against his commanding officer's inaction is wrong, sacrificing nameless soldiers to take down a powerful foe actually weakens the good guys instead of just making the hotshot look cool...It was like for once the main characters had to survive in a world where the hand of God wasn't tipping the scales in their favor.
