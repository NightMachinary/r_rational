Yeah I guess. But it's not like it's so new. The very first star wars trilogy had all these things : planets get destroyed, resistance get mostly crushed, most plans faced unforeseen drawbacks or straight up "it was all in my master plan" from the evil emperor...

I don't say it's bad to use these plot devices but it is not very original either.
