I reimagined that part, where it's the act of trying to have only one part of a thing go to lightspeed and not the whole, that disperses it in very high velocity shrapnel. And so Holdo actually would have to initiate jump while her ship is in sufficient contact, as in physically being rammed into, another large ship positioned in front of all the others. Which means a suicidal dash into the opposing fleet's full firepower.

It would have then made sense, not broken canon or even base consistency, allowed for proper heroics-sacrifice, and also explained why it wouldn't be viable in any kind of practice but the rarest circumstances.

And you can keep the cool visuals.
