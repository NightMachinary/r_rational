"Deafening silence" is the sequel trilogy to a T. Where did the first order come from? How the hell are they so well equipped? Why is the "resistance" a thing instead of the new republic? Why isn't the emperor dead?

The directors wanted to play with all these toys but didn't want to sit down for ten fucking minutes and come up with a way to make their actions /compatible/ with what had already happened. No respect for existing boundaries, just throwing shit in a blender and using what came out.
