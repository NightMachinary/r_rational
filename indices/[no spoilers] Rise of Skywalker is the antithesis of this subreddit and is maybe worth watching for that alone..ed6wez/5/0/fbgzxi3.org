  the Space Opera ideal
#+end_quote

...Doesn't work that way at all. The ur Space Operas were Lensman and Skylark Of Space, and the wars there were VERY hard fought indeed. Ditto for recent literary space operas like Revelation Space and Vernor Vinge's work. And even more so for the major Japanese entrant, Gurren Lagann - something like 99.99% of the population of the Galaxy is destroyed. And the Xeelee series is (imo) unreadable, but I think the conflict is pretty damn bloody again.

You'd probably enjoy Blake's 7 - it's the complete opposite of the traits you outline. (And probably the most influential TV space opera - B5, Buffy and Angel owed a lot to it, and Andromeda and Farscape were almost reboots..)

In fact, I can't think of ANY space opera fitting your description. Even Scientology has the thing about all the Good Guys being brought to Earth in DC10's and sacrificed in nuclear volcanoes, come to think of it.
