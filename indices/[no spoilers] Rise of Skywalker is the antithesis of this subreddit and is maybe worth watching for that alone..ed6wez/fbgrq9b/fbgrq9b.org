  Li Yao coughed slightly. Glancing at the two big shots of the government-in-exile next to him, he asked Cui Lingfeng secretly through the private talking technique, “Sir Speaker, what exactly is this ‘Dark Star that has been destroyed dozens of times?”

  Cui Lingfeng was sitting solemnly and wearing a grave expression, as if he had not heard Li Yao's question at all. His lips did not shiver at all, yet Li Yao somehow received his reply.

  “It is a series of movies that we shot intermittently over the past hundreds of years to boost morale. They tell the stories of how we defeated the Imperium of True Human Beings. The official title is ‘Universal War'!

  “In the movies, the evil Imperium of True Human Beings, in order to reign over the entire universe, built the strongest, evilest, and most horrible man-made planet, known as the ‘Dark Star', with all the crucial resources in the Sectors under their control. They then moved all the important government agencies, key technical personnel, and files about the valuable techniques onto the planet.

  “Eventually, Firefly took the enemy unprepared by marching into the ‘Dark Star'. The ‘brain' and ‘heart' of the Imperium of True Human Beings was destroyed immediately, and the Imperium was defeated just like that!”

  “... Fine. Although the Imperium of True Human Beings can't be that stupid, it is all understandable since it is just a movie. Then what does he mean by ‘destroyed dozens of times'?”

  “The movie was very popular after it was aired,” Cui Lingfeng said. “Soon, it was a hit on the entire Firefly and won countless enthusiastic supporters. Naturally, a sequel was shot. In the sequel, the Imperium of True Human Beings got even more ruthless and rose again. They came up with an even more evil approach to cope with the whole universe and the Star Ocean Republic!”

  “What's the approach?”

  “To build a bigger, stronger, and more terrifying ‘Dark Star II' by continuing to concentrate all the resources!”

  “Then what? The Dark Star II did not happen to be sabotaged by Firefly again after you crawled inside it, right?”

  “Yes, it was,” Cui Lingfeng replied matter-of-factly.

  “Then,” Li Yao said, “you shot dozens of sequels of ‘Universal War', and a greater ‘Dark Star' was built in each and every one of them, only to be crawled into and destroyed by Firefly in the end?”

  “You're wrong,” Cui Lingfeng countered. “Later, the Imperium of True Human Beings stopped constructing man-made planets but simply went to hollow out an existent planet and modify it into a more powerful Dark Star. After the audience grew tired of planets, we also tried white dwarves, red giants, and suns in their prime years.”

  “... Sir Speaker, I suddenly understand the anger and embarrassment that Chief Mate Ding must've had after he saw through the lies. What should I do?”

  “What choice did we have?” Cui Lingfeng asked. “If the Imperium had adopted a less stupid strategy, how could a tiny Firefly have reversed the situation on its way and secured a glorious victory in the end?”
