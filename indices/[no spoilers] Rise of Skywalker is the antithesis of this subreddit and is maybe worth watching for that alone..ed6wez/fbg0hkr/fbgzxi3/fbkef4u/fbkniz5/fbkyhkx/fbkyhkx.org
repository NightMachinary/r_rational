Wow. Seriously? I'm watching the currently airing remake, and sure, the military tactics are sometime somewhat naive. Also pretty two-dimensional because apparently the author is a Napoleonic wars geek, and drew inspiration from those. But the politics and the characters are definitely far more nuanced than in Star Wars.

And I love TTGL, don't get me wrong, and sure, as you say, the body count is immense if you consider basically everything that happened before the series proper begins. The series itself, however, and its mood, are mostly affected by the way the war the protagonists fight goes, which has relatively few casualties. But I just can't see it as space opera. It doesn't have the hallmarks of the genre. It's a super robot show, through and through, and has the tropes of that genre.
