  Wow. Seriously? I'm watching the currently airing remake, and sure, the military tactics are sometime somewhat naive. Also pretty two-dimensional because apparently the author is a Napoleonic wars geek, and drew inspiration from those. But the politics and the characters are definitely far more nuanced than in Star Wars.

Which is better: pig swill or cow fodder? I have no urge to compare.

But from I know about LOGH, no, the politics are even stupider than the rest of the show:

Gurren Lagann otoh is pretty smart about politics: Simon and most of the heroes are shown to be lousy at running the world after they save it. Rossiu is the one who keeps thing together and the other smart one is Yoko, who has no interest in politics, but saves Simon after his political fall and imprisonment.

Blake's 7, of course, is /the/ political SF show. A truly effective Machiavelian villain in Servalan - one whose plans actually are cunning, a "hero" in Blake who is equal parts hypocrite and idealist, who actually knows this about himself and distrusts himself with ultimate power - to the extent he'd rather murder millions of people than trust himself with. And a realist who knows that rationally the good guys are doomed, but that there is no point selling out to the Bad Guys "Because I wouldn't last a week."

And then there's Kill La Kill, which does the Lagrian dialectical thing with fascism. Which I suppose could just count as space opera, because there's certainly classical music, and the final battle takes place in space.

Going back to Lensman, the cannonical space opera, it's profoundly distrustful of democracy - but for very interesting reasons. It was written at a time when American democracy was extremely corrupt, with a lot of politicians beholden to corporate interests or criminals, and the author seems to have had some especially "interesting" experiences working as a scientist for a corrupt munitions company that knowingly shipped faulty artillery shells during WW2. (This was adapted into a story included in "First Lensman".)

Another weird but amusing thing about Lensman was that the author and his wife actually looked like a space opera hero and heroines and behaved with similar whackiness . From wikipedia:

  Robert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein dedicated his 1958 novel Methuselah's Children "To Edward E. Smith, PhD".[68]) Heinlein reported that E. E. Smith perhaps took his "unrealistic" heroes from life, citing as an example the extreme competence of the hero of Spacehounds of IPC. He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein's essay, he reports that he began to suspect Smith might be a sort of "superman" when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it on a back road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the roof columns to listen for chassis squeaks by bone conduction---a process apparently improvised on the spot.

"Spacehounds" and some of his other works are here -

But "Galactic Patrol" and "Grey Lensman" are much better, in an ultra-pulp way, and cheap on kindle. Smith also made major contributions to human happiness as a chemist when he worked on donuts: I've heard that he may have been the man who perfected the coating process that led to Krispy Kremes. If so, he really should have been given the Nobel for something - just probably not literature.
