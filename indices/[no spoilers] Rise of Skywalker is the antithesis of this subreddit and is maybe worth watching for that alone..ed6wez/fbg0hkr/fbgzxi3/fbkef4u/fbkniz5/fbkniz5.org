  First, in TTGL no such thing happens in the show's timeframe.

No, that's not a "strange thing to say" - you learn to need to read. The question was whether the winning side had an easy victory. No, the human population was whittled down to a million before the start of the main series, the co-protagonist dies, a lot (most?) of Team Gurren dies, Nia dies, the remaining million of the human race almost dies, the human race's apparent oppressor was actually it's greatest hero and trying to save it...

And the show's timeframe as a whole /does/ include the destruction of most of the human race - one the shorts is dedicated to it. Not that it even matters to the point at issue.

  Third, to mention Japanese space opera and not consider the most straightforward take of the genre, namely, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, just feels weird.

Not to anyone with adult tastes: LGH is unwatchable idiot fodder. It starts with an episode where the hero is lauded as a genius for doing the most obvious thing possible when the enemy does something a 12 year old with some experience of playing RTS games wouldn't do. It's more man baby fodder. In a show which pompously claims to be realistic. And I have no idea what happens in the franchise as a whole because every episode I tried to watch was that very, very bad. However, the fact that there are so many episodes indicates that neither side scored an easy victory, yes?

For anyone interested in why Legend is so bad: Side A outnumbers Side B - badly. They brilliantly decide to launch two separate attacks each of which would be outnumbered by B, who will see what is happening. Astoundingly, instead of cooperating by staying where they are, B counterattacks the two sub-fleets one at a time. This is presented as awe inspiring genius - what happens for the rest of 15,000 episodes is driven by the military reputation created by this. Yes, it really is possible to have a plot dumber than Star Trek WOK's "We'll defeat the enemy by moving in 3 dimensions, because a genetically engineered superman won't realise that's something you can do in space!"

Oh - and the version of the I saw show also has the most hilariously bad credits ever: a man and a woman in military uniform walking away dramatically through the stars... with hilariously wriggling asses, like they're twerking. Probably the only part worth watching - for about 15 seconds.
