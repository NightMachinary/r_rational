  And even more so for the major Japanese entrant, Gurren Lagann - something like 99.99% of the population of the Galaxy is destroyed.

That's a strange statement to me for three reasons. First, in TTGL no such thing happens in the show's timeframe. Maybe you refer to the past actions of the anti-Spirals? Second, TTGL is mecha more than space opera, as the conflict is driven only by a handful of individuals in a cockpit, like the crew of a single ship (even though their mecha gets really big). Third, to mention Japanese space opera and not consider the most straightforward take of the genre, namely, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, just feels weird.
