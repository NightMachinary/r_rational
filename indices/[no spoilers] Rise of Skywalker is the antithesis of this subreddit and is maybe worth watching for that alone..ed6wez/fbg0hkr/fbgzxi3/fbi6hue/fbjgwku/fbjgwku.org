And the show really sticks to its logic. The heroes never get an easy win and there are false resolutions to moral dilemmas. It's also got very nice plot arcing - basically the structure Joss Whedon copied for Buffy and Angel. There are continuing themes but you can watch virtually any episode out of order and skip those 10% of bad ones. (Although Harvest Of Kairos is so good-bad that you should watch it at least once: "You madam, are no lady!")
