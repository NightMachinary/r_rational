Huh, I actually rather enjoyed it. I mean, sure it wasn't rational and the entire trilogy is basically fighting itself with no overarching themes. But TLJ completely lost me, and I went in expecting more of that. There were a lot of fun moments and ideas in skywalker, felt like a decent fanfiction.
