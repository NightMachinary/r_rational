I thought The Last Jedi was atrocious, but still (legit, not snarking, seriously) fascinating to watch because I simply could not fathom the creative choices made. It wasn't like The Phantom Menace--you can say trade disputes are awful dry for Star Wars, but some people might find them interesting (or more forgivable), and while Jar Jar was never remotely funny, you can see how somebody with a very weird sense of humor might think otherwise.

With TLJ, it was almost like an intercultural communication problem--like there was some missing subtext that would have made these strange behaviors comprehensible. Why does everything get ruined by the heroes getting a parking ticket? He went to some trouble to set that scene up, but it's such a stupid and meaningless way to fail. And why did he hype, then discard, the Plom-bloom guy? It feels like an enormous middle finger to the audience, that he was wasting our time. Why does Holdo refuse to let any of her subordinates know that she has a plan and they're not all going to die? Bits of dialogue, e.g. "you've gambled everything and lost," make no sense in context. Is it supposed to be exciting that the Resistance fleet spends eighteen hours awkwardly fleeing from the FO fleet, which is reduced to taking ineffectual potshots at its ass? It seems really un-exciting, plus it makes the villains seem less impressive. Why did he bother inventing a Dr. Seuss-looking alien so Luke could spend five seconds milking it?

That's just scratching the surface. And, most compelling of all: why did it receive such good reviews? Yes, it was subversive, but the subversions were less interesting than the thing subverted and didn't appear to mean anything. They added up to a story where characters said and did things for no clear reason. Almost nothing in the movie made any sense. I feel like there's some lesson in there, about American culture, or modern cinema, or something.
