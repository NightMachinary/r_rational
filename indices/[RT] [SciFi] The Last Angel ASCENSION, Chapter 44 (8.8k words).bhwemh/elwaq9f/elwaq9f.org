No one seems to have linked this.

Last Angel Ascension is an excellent sequel to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The last Angel]], holds its own [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastAngel][TV tropes]] page, is based upon a rogue AI, scheming and plotting after earth was destroyed some years back.

Well worth the read, one of the better pieces of fiction out there in my narrow and limited opinion.

Ascension is coming to an end of its arc, with 6? Chapters to go.

Goes without saying, I am not the author and do not know their reddit handle.

[[/u/Proximal_Flame][u/Proximal_Flame]] perchance?
