  Well worth the read, one of the better pieces of fiction out there in my narrow and limited opinion.

My one major criticism of it, along with the work it's a sequel to, is that the author doesn't seem to often stray very far from their comfort zone. Despite having several alien POV characters, I don't usually feel like I'm in an alien mind. Aliens think in terms of "sows," of "apes;" species are classified using earth-based taxonomies that should not be useful in describing alien races; the species feature distinctly human features (most species are humanoid and are bipedal with eyes and ears and shoulder blades; Tribunes sweat when nervous, and bite the insides of their lips when frustrated, and have adrenaline when they fight); alien ships are named using human concepts (e.g. "Gilded Antler"); an alien religion has a Hell and demons.

And even when the author talks about pre-genocide humans, most of the references are to Western history, Western literature, Western mythology. "I possess the only remaining records of millennia of Earth's knowledge. I remember the Roman Empire, the Dark Ages, the Renaissance. I remember every name of every scientist, soldier, philosopher and artist who shaped the course of human civilization."

That is to say, there's nothing wrong with it that isn't also wrong with, say, /Star Trek/ in its various incarnations, but it's a little disappointing that someone who didn't have to figure out how to put any of this on camera didn't go farther afield to make the reader feel like they're looking at unfamiliar things through unfamiliar eyes.

It /is/ getting better; where the three initial dreadnaughts were all named after Greek deities (there is /no way/ that China, India, and the Islamic countries would have let that go without protest), Red One's children are starting to go a bit farther afield for their names, and the Naiads feel truly alien in a way that the other races don't. But, to use the latest chapter as an example: this chapter has POV segments from a Prolocutor, a Judiciary, a Worker, a Builder, a Prelate, two Tribunes, and an AI, and apart from little details like having a second pair of hands, I can't tell any of them from human by the way they perceive the world.
