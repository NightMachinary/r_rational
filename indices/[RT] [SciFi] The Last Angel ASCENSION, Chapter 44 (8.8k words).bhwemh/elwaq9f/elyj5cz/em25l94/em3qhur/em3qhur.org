  That's an artefact of writing; a reader can understand reptilian, mammalian or therapsid - but describing alien species by completely alien taxonomies and phylogenies is going to require explanation, and bring the story to halt.
#+end_quote

I guess the point I was trying to make there was not that they /were/ described using such terms, but that they /could accurately be/ described using such terms. What does "mammalian" or "reptilian" even /mean/ when applied to an extraterrestrial life-form? They're classifications designed to divide uniquely terrestrial life forms from other uniquely terrestrial life forms, and I'd have to think that any species that originated extraterrestrially would have enough /other/ differences to deserve their own taxonomic category, to the point where "mammalian" or "reptilian" would mislead more than it would accurately inform.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm not asking you to take use Traviss method, but rather to describe what you are trying to describe, rather than using terms that don't quite fit. Mammals are distinguished from other terrestrial animal species by being (largely) warm-blooded, quadrupedal, with mammary glands, fur, and a specific ear structure, and young who are born rather than hatched. "Mammal" also implies "vertebrate," so this creature has a spinal cord, lungs, a blood-pumping heart, and other such organs. And "vertebrate" implies "animal," so your alien's cells are required to have a specific structure that distinguishes it from etc. etc....

Do you really mean to convey /all/ of that? If you just mean "furry and warm-blooded," the descriptor "mammalian" serves to confuse rather than to enlighten, and you'd be better off just describing it as "furry and warm-blooded." If you /are/ trying to convey all of that... that raises a lot of questions about the convergent evolution of this species, on a planet with a presumably dissimilar history to ours, and starts to disrupt my suspension of disbelief.

I'm certainly not asking you to make the text more obtuse; I'm asking you to make it more /explicit/.

  I've been trying to work on that, adding more foreign species types and variation in forms. Conjoiners, Kobolds, Hesitants, Mules for example.

I did say I'd noticed improvement lately.

  why would aliens not have a concept of gilding, or antlers (or comparable ideas)
#+end_quote

Antlers, sure. A single point of convergent evolution, doesn't really strain credulity, even one that has only developed once on Earth. Gilding, though... It implies valuing things for their rarity; it implies a certain concept of beauty; it implies coming up with the idea of finding a shiny, rare, soft rock and pounding it so flat that it becomes gold foil, and then painstakingly wrapping the foil around an object. Which comes back to "why are all of these aliens so /human/?" Why are their values so similar to ours?

And a species which both values gilding, and /has/ (or knows a species that has) antlers? That's getting weird: antlers, again, are a pretty rare feature on our world.

/Deathdealer/, by contrast, makes use of a concept common to all living beings (life's end), and implies delivery of that concept to other living beings. It's a concept that's pretty much /universally/ translatable.

  Why wouldn't a religion, even an alien one, have a concept of a 'bad place' with 'bad things'?
#+end_quote

Okay, let me be clear: I'm referring to "Interlude: Encounter 163" at the end of Chapter 23 of /The Last Angel./ I'd provide a link, but Spacebattles is being a dick right now and I have to access it through a proxy service that doesn't give me a clear URL.

Anyway.

The character literally describes /Nemesis/ "[rising] through an inferno" of burning oil and fuel atop a sea as "[rising] from Hell."

Sure, it /could/ be coincidental that another religion on another planet has a "bad place" /just happens/ to contain such vivid fire imagery, or, alternately that the experience of a "bad thing" from a "bad place" that evoked the religious one /just happens/ to involve fire even though their religion's "bad place" doesn't feature it...

Either way, the use of the word "Hell" with /that/ imagery is just /way/ too on the nose to be coincidental.

And it frankly just feels to me like a missed opportunity. What unique ideas would a species of genius philosophers, who pursue science at the expense of all else, have about death and the afterlife? Why, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_of_fire][lake of fire]], of course!

...

Now, maybe that's not a reference that you intended. But it's just one more example of an alien mind not /feeling alien/. If I pull back and look at that segment as a whole, the Thoughtful doesn't feel, well, thoughtful. She doesn't think of the world in terms of what she can learn from it. Or in terms of creating something. Or in terms of a puzzle to be solved. She thinks of the world largely like I do when I, as a human technician, am forced to assume a management role.

Contrast with your own Naiads.

That's distinctive. That's memorable. That's /alien/. And I'd like to see much more like it.
