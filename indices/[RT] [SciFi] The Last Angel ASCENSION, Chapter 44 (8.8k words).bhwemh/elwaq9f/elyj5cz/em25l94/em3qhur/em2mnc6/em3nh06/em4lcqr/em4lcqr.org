  'why wouldn't they?'
#+end_quote

Because they wouldn't have evolved to.

Why wouldn't they have legs and mouths? Because they evolved in an ocean so move by jet propulsion, and descended from a species that learned to eat through skin.

Why wouldn't they have eyesight and temperature-sense? Because they originally lived in an extensive cavern network with no natural sources of light and abnormally stable temperatures; instead they perceive magnetic fields.

Why wouldn't they have a sense of personal identity? Because they follow a reproductive strategy in which they "combine" with another member of their species on the cellular level, and then "de-combine", with a small chance of de-combining into three specimen; they do it once per day^{1}, and each combination/de-combination cycle mixes their "identities" up.

Why wouldn't they be able to classify abstract concepts? Intelligence arises when species end up needing to quickly adapt to changes in their environment. Human intelligence evolved to better respond to the environment of tribal politics ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence#Models][probably]]). /Their/ intelligence evolved because some kind of evolutionary shtick caused the autotrophs in their environment to change at a much faster speed than they used to, spreading according to strange rules and changing their properties, behaviours, and eatability at a breakneck pace. The aliens had to become smarter and smarter in order to follow the resulting complexity, and so they became adept at modelling and manipulating the outside world, but didn't develop most of the tools for the manipulation of /ideas/ --- they're superintelligent engineers but bird-level philosophers and schemers.

Evolutionary environments differ extremely, and would give rise to wildly different minds. "Humans" are just a small area in the space of all possible minds; the probability that aliens would resemble us as closely as you're suggesting is vanishingly small.

  Furthermore, the kind of story you describe is best served by things like /Blindsight/ or C.J. Cherrnyh's works, where the issue of grappling with alien intelligences is a focal point of the narrative, and that still requires communication and translation for the reader

Oh, yes, I agree. Writing alien aliens is extremely hard; any story which features them in a prominent role would need to spend a lot of time on exploring them. If your story mainly focuses on other questions, it makes sense to cheat in order to make aliens easier to write. I'm just arguing against the idea that it isn't wildly implausible. (Unless there are some other factors at work, like "the universe is a simulation", or "we and aliens were originally from the same species, but ended up scattered across different planets for reasons".)
