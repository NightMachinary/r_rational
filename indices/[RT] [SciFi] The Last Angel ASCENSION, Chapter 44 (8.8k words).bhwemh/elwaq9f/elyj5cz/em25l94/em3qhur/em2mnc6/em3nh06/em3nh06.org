But all of that just brings us back around to 'why wouldn't they?'

Furthermore, the kind of story you describe is best served by things like /Blindsight/ or C.J. Cherrnyh's works, where the issue of grappling with alien intelligences is a focal point of the narrative, and that still requires communication and translation for the reader. In a military sci-fi epic with a dozen or more 'on-screen' species, it would completely destroy any story or plot momentum to have to engage with each species in that manner. And it gets worse if two non-human species are interacting with no humans present, since their dealings, mannerisms and perspectives with each other are going to be even further outside a human narrative.

I can understand the issue, and I do try to give the alien races as much of a foreign outlook as I can, but at the core of it, the kind of story where the aliens are as utterly removed from the human perspective as you describe isn't compatible with the kind of story I want to tell.
