- The first person who sees your nickels will decide to start a discussion regarding whether these nickels-looking objects are /really/ nickels.

  - In hours, someone will reply with a small article analysing all recorded information about your "nickels". Conclusion: "probably nickels, though the shine seems a bit off; we'll need to continue observations".
  - A different person will use Bayes' Rule to calculate exactly how likely it is that you "just /happened/" to have all these nickels. The resultant probability will be too low. "Not nickels," they'll say.
  - A lengthy, wordy, and surprisingly polite argument between the two sides will ensue. A firm grasp of metallurgy, math, economics, history, D&D lore, programming, tropology, psychology, philosophy, science fiction, theoretical physics, and a few more niche subjects like timeless decision theory and Moloch's religion will be required to fully follow it. In the end it'll be determined that people are using a few different definitions of "nickel", and that at least X% of your nickels are "nickels" according to most of them.

- A surprising amount of people will feel that it's vitally important to know why Nickel-like Object #5 has this strange scratch along the side. 250 theories will be generated. Of them, three will be widely accepted as obviously correct; the rest will be our brand of shitposting.

- Someone will suggest that the best way to use these nickels is to donate them to charity. It'll lead to a Deontology vs. Utilitarianism Debate â„–571365.

- Someone will float the possibility that these nickels are only a /perfect simulation/ of nickels --- at the same time admitting that it doesn't matter either way. (But the possibility!)

- Someone will float the possibility that these nickels were made by an unfriendly artificial superintelligence whose goal is to turn all matter in the universe into nickels --- and that we're playing exactly into its hands by discussing them.

- Someone will list two hundred and sixty four ways in which these nickels could be used to murder omnipotent gods. That post will be universally recognized as great.

- At least one plan for taking over the world using /only/ nickels will be proposed. It'll be more evil that you'd expect --- even after taking this warning into account.
