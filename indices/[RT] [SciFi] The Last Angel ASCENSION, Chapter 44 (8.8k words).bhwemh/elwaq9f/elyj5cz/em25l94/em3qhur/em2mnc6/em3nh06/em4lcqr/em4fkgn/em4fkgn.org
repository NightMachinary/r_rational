I appreciate this view, perspectives that are too alien in nature require a lot of effort and skillful writing to pull off without being jarring. There's a reason why I'm not a big fan of hsf Would rate your works in a similar vein to deathworlders, perhaps a tier above and added degree of realism but still easy to jump into.

This sub is also much better for constructive criticism than [[/r/hfy][r/hfy]], audience is a lot more mature, but also difficult to please. I might lack the focus to participate but I agree with both sentiments.
