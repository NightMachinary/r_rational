/> species are classified using earth-based taxonomies that should not be useful in describing alien races;/

That's an artefact of writing; a reader can understand reptilian, mammalian or therapsid - but describing alien species by completely alien taxonomies and phylogenies is going to require explanation, and bring the story to halt. "Roughly mammalian" versus "Henagheit, which had such traits as [insert roughly mammalian characteristics]. It's the long way around to get a concept across, aka the Karen Traviss method, where she would put in a Mandalorian concept or phrase, then add the actual description for it, over and over and over.

I've had questions about using actual terms such as "fractal cracking" and "pedipalps" in appropriate contexts previously, so I'm not certain that making the text even more obtuse is going to bring any particular benefit to the story.

/>the species feature distinctly human features (most species are humanoid and are bipedal with eyes and ears and shoulder blades; Tribunes sweat when nervous, and bite the insides of their lips when frustrated, and have adrenaline when they fight);/

I've been trying to work on that, adding more foreign species types and variation in forms. Conjoiners, Kobolds, Hesitants, Mules for example.

​

/>alien ships are named using human concepts (e.g. "Gilded Antler")/

...why would aliens /not/ have a concept of gilding, or antlers (or comparable ideas) and want to reference/venerate certain ideals, concepts or cultural icons in their ships? Many alien ship names /do/ reference the latter as well.

There's a scene in /The Armageddon Inheritance/, where the humans are examining the wreckage of an alien fleet and they see one ship in particular. The translation of its name is /Deathdealer/. The vessel was named in an alien language according to alien ideals, but the concept can still be communicated to a human audience.

​

/> an alien religion has a Hell and demons./

...yes? It's not the same as the human concept of hell. Why wouldn't a religion, even an alien one, have a concept of a 'bad place' with 'bad things'?
