  What does "mammalian" or "reptilian" even mean when applied to an extraterrestrial life-form?
#+end_quote

That's something I considered too in the usage, but I didn't want to go too far down the rabbit hole of taxonomy and phylogenetics.

#+begin_quote
  Do you really mean to convey all of that?
#+end_quote

More or less, or at least enough of it so the reader does have a framework to understand the species in question.

#+begin_quote
  I'm certainly not asking you to make the text more obtuse; I'm asking you to make it more explicit.
#+end_quote

Understandable; I do appreciate your feedback.

  Okay, let me be clear: I'm referring to "Interlude: Encounter 163" at the end of Chapter 23 of The Last Angel.
#+end_quote

That makes things clearer. I do remember that; the scene isn't quite what you've described.

/"I know what Hell sounds like. That was the first cogent thought that Ashl'eua had had for several long minutes as she stood on the bluff, watching the ocean burn. She had been an avowed atheist until this moment. Perhaps she still was; there were no gods. No god could have allowed this to happen./

/No, there were no gods... but there was a Hell. She knew this because she'd seen one of its demons. She'd heard it speak./

.....

/Ignoring all sense of reason, she had walked up to a small cliff overlooking the bay, standing on the edge and watched a demon's birth./

........

/It had risen from the inferno, sheets of blazing water spilling from its hull, patches of burning oil and fuel clinging to its baroque armour, flickering like the torches lining the walls of some ancient fortress..../

....

/There were no gods, but there were demons. She'd seen one rise from Hell."/

At no point is fire associated with the character's version of hell; she associates the burning water and fuel with /torches along battlements/, not the underworld. Moreover, she's obviously being hyperbolic (and with good cause, given what happened). For example, in /The Doomsday Machine/, Commodore Decker refers to the Planet Killer as "a demon right out of Hell!" (tum te tum tum....). By the logic here, Decker associates deep space with hell, because the PK came from there. That's not true, of course. He's traumatized and thinking/describing it emotionally in that scene, just as the character in the interlude is after watching hundreds of people die. We're not actually given any substantive information on the Thoughtful (or at least the culture that Ashl'eua has the most familiarity with) version of hell.

The lake of fire isn't a reference that I intended, because it's not actually there....

  That's alien. And I'd like to see much more like it.
#+end_quote

That's also why Naiads can be hard to write. Making them comprehensible, yet still foreign in thought and concept. But they are fun to write, and I hope to add more from in, especially when we get to [FRAGMENTED DELETED].

Thanks for the input!
