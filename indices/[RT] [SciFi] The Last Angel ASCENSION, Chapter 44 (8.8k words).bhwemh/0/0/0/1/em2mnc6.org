  ...why would aliens not have a concept of gilding, or antlers (or comparable ideas) and want to reference/venerate certain ideals, concepts or cultural icons in their ships?
#+end_quote

I would ask this question differently: why /would/ they?

"References", "veneration", "ideals", "concepts", "culture", "icons" --- all of these are human concepts, arising from the subtleties of human psychology and human minds, development of which in turn heavily depended on our evolutionary history and environment. A tradition of giving ships deeply meaningful names implies some or all of the below:

- A conscious ability to construct abstract mental representations of vaguely-defined categories of objects (E. g., "[antlers] are certain strictly-defined bone growths found in members of the [Cervidae] animal family".)

- A tendency/ability to classify said abstractions using other abstractions. (E. g., "[gilded] implies [high-status] + [wealthy] + [yellow] because of historical, economical, and physical properties of gold".)

- A tendency/ability to misuse the abstractions to refer to objects /resembling/ the objects from the original category in some way, even when they're clearly outside of it. (E. g., "this ship is [yellow] and is a [defensive weapon], therefore it resembles a [gilded] [antler], even though it's neither made of gold nor an antler".)

- A desire to assign personal descriptors to inanimate objects/tools in order to give them an appearance of individuality and/or in order to elevate them above other objects in their category. (E. g., "our ship will be named 'Gilded Antler', because there is no other ship under that name and because [glided] implies [high-status]".)

- A desire/tendency to generate descriptors with certain properties: short, simple, and based on abstractions which usually refer to static physical objects. (I. e., we prefer names of animal parts or certain metals of historical significance to abstract mathematical constructs, quotes, or gibberish. "Gilded Antler", not "37 1221", not "x^{n>2}+y^{n>2}=z^{n>2}", not "(entire text of /Moby Dick/)", not "AAAgrgeAAB".)

Aliens wouldn't necessarily have any of this. They could recognized "gold" as "/this/ kind of metal", but lack any emotional response to [gold] as a concept. They could see [gold] as [positive], but consider unfathomable to refer to objects that /don't/ contain gold as [gilded]. They could be able to give objects poetic descriptors, but lack the desire to do so because they have no concept of a stable identity. They could give objects poetic descriptors, but use mathematically elegant strings of symbols for that, or follow some other naming tradition.

And so on. Why would they have a religion, a concept of death, an afterlife, the concept of "badness", the concept of a "place"..? Is the human way /really/ the only way a sentient creature could look upon the world?
