Oh, interesting. I'll move /The Last Angel/ higher on my to-read list, then.

(Yes, I'm an impostor here, in that I didn't finish the story. I've read a few first chapters, but while the plot seemed compelling, I ended up turned off by the humanlike aliens --- as you may have gathered, they're a pet peeve of mine.)
