Some of these are things I've already incorporated; i.e. Steersmen don't have eyes, but sense organs that work on different stimuli. Conjoiners have fluid nervous systems and physically link together to form more complex neural networks, so I am (and have been - the ideas for those two species have been developed since TLA itself, I've just never had an opportunity to bring them out) exploring those concepts throughout the work when and where I can. I do appreciate the feedback, though.
