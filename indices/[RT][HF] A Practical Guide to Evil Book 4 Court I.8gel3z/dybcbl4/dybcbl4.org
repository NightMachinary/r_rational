Goblin Conspiracy Plot #1

The Empire got their second Red Letter in Book 1, due to goblins' research. What if this was intentional?

By forcing the second letter, the goblins wield an incredible amount of influence. If they sit on designs which are particularly advanced (this seems likely) releasing them would mean the Empire is fucked. They have the nuke Malicia was dreaming of - only it's contained to Praes. Conspiracy #1 is based on the idea that the Tribe near Marchford will foolishly create and plant some designs in the old settlements, leading to all of the old goblins and the Tower getting bombed.
