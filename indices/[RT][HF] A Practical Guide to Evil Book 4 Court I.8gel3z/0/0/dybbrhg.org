No need to focus on aristocrats, competence is a feminine trait in the Guideverse. Pick a male character whose name isn't Hakram Deadhand, Brandon Talbot or Amadeus of the Green Stretch, chances are that the guy is either 1/ a morally bankrupt moron, 2/ somewhere on the autism spectrum or 3/ competent in one particular domain and an in-universe joke in every other matters.

This is one of the problem with book 2 IMHO, where the question "wait, where are the guys?" actually distracted me from the plot at some points.

Edit: thinking about it, it's less the men being depicted in a bad light and more the women being generally competent. It's actually hard to remember a female character that got a decent amount of description and turned out lacking in redeeming traits.
