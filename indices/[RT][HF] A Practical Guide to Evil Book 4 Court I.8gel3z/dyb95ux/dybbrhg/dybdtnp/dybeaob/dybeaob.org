To be clear, I don't have a problem with it either. It only mattered when it got distracting (when Cordelia was introduced and it felt like there wasn't a single male ruler in Calernia), like when you notice a plot hole and it makes it harder to focus on the plot. It's like how, at some point, it felt like every hero was a braindead idiot and you would wonder why anyone would want their help.

As for the nobles... Amadis might surprise us but the others are basically plot devices to make other characters look better (Brandon Talbot and Princess Rozala, here). Those two chapters were a bit too on the nose on that front, EE is usually better at making characters stand out.
