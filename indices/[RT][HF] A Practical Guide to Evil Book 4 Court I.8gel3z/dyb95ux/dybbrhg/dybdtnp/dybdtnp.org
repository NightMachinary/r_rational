My problem is less with the gender roles, and more with the fact that a lot of characters are sticking to their archetype in a way that makes them interchangeable. At some point, I feel the both the "ambitious but pragmatic lady" characters and the "arrogant and overconfident lord" characters blend together.

Like, is there any difference between the characterization so far of Samuel Farron, Baron Darlington, Prince Arnaud and Prince Amadis?
