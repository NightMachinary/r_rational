Klaus Pappenheim, like Masego, Ratface or Wekesa is described as "pretty good at what he does but don't let him do anything else". Half his screentime is Cordelia thinking about ways to sideline him before her grumpy old grandfather runs his mouth when he shouldn't.

Hanno is a weird case, half his characterization is he doesn't have one. Outside of his extra chapters, he's just not developped beyond "he's the White Knight".

I'll withold my judgement on the Grey Pilgrim for now (William also looked promising until he never delivered) but I'll admit I missed Kairos and Anaraxes. But as I said in my edit, it's not the male characters being weak, it's the female characters being strong. I can't remember a female equivalent to Mazus or Afolabi, someone who's just there as a roadkill yet still received enough characterization to matter in the plot. Maybe Barika and even then she was Akua's foil.
