Fair enough. I'd seems I'd forgotten him because he's only mentioned once, and is never relevant to the story. But I'll give you that.

Although the possibility exist that while the Title is male, it's bearer could be a woman, just like the First Prince of the Principate. I don't think EE would use the same quirk twice, but the possibility exists.
