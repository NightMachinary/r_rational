The author had enough backlog built up during the month off for that pace not cath up with him, and some said that the initial chapters where the story was stil speeding up to its usual pace could easily have been condensed ino fewer without the narration losing its consistency. But yeah, given that the progression suggests that this book will last for a hundred or so chapters, I'm a little bit worried.
