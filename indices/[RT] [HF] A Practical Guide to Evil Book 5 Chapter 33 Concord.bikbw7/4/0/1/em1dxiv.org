She never committed murder (she's only ever killed in self-defense or as punishment for a suitable crime) or swore allegiance to the Gods Below, turning an entire realm's story towards villainy is abstract and counts as being branded "evil". She broke her allegiance to the Empress the moment she could feasibly do so and only ever swore it in the first place to free her country. She also never broke a truce, and the Pilgrim shouldn't know that she was involved in Sve Noc's Apotheosis, which is dark because, again, the Heavens said so. The soul desecration is fair, though.
