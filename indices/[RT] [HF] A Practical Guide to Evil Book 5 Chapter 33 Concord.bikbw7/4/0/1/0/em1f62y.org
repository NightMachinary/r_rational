Catherine never murdered anyone?

That's a... bold position to take.

How about the Praesi noble whose soul she ripped out out at the end of Book 2, purely to make a point? And he wasn't a mage, so he had no part in summoning anything. He just happened to be on the wrong side.

Or the smuggler who Catherine forced to kill herself around the start of Book 3, for the grave crime of talking back?

Or the countless people who have died due to her actions or inaction throughout the story?

Letting the Lone Swordsman go at Summerholm, giving Akua governorship of Liesse for political expediency, enslaving the drow and using them to force even more of them into her service...

The list goes on.

Catherine is a sympathetic character and our protagonist, but it's not exactly hard to see why someone would be appalled by her.
