For Pilgrim, She's the Arch Heretic of the East, her being Evil is important in that she is slowly pulling Callow toward being an Evil nation. The whole Battle of the Camps (including the death of a newbie hero he was mentoring) does exactly make friends. And the whole point of his mid-battle introspection was that he wasn't acting against the Cat that was, but the Eldritch Abomination finished apotheosis Cat that could be.

For Saint, she just reenforced that for her being Evil is not only matters, but to her is the ONLY thing that matters.
