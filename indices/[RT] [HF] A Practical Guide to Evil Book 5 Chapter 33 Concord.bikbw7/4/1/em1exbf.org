She rose to power through putting down a literally Heroic rebellion of her own countrymen on the Tower's behalf (doesn't matter her intentions, she squashed the last spark of Good in Callow), maintained her rule through tyrannical means (doesn't matter what crimes they committed, crucifying people is bad), she's currently on the SECOND terrible and vast dark power that is a literal incarnation of murder and treachery that she has bound herself to (and apparently Sve Noc is even more horrifying to Tariq than Winter was), her mere existence (supposedly) pulls her entire country towards Evil, and to top it all off the battle they just fought was her defending the Legions that laid waste to half of Procer. Don't get me wrong, I think the Grand Alliance definitely has a warped view of Cat, but I think some readers are a bit too quick to label it all lies and slander. Cat has truly done some nasty things. Now, whether or not those nasty deeds were justified is another matter entirely, but either way it's perfectly reasonable for people to have serious reservations about the Black Queen.
