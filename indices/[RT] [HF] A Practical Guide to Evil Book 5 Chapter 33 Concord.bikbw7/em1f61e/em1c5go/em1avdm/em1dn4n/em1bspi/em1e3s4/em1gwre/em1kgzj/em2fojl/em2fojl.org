I get the feeling that Saint is going to end up betraying the band. Cat's putting way too much faith into Saint always listening to Pilgrim when we know that Saint, with the Bard's prodding, has already gone behind Pilgrim's back when dealing with Cordelia. Pilgrim wants the Grand Alliance to succeed, while Saint is making it fall apart.

This last compromise with Catherine will probably push Saint over the edge and she'll turn on Pilgrim at the worst moment. The fact that Tyrant will also be there is just a giant red herring and a huge bit of irony.
