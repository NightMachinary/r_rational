So, I take it nobody managed to take and spread the recipes of the Salutary Alchemist when he was put down for extorting people with his monopoly?

How do you tell which Names are non-Chosen? Has every Salutary Alchemist been doing the work of Below (in the same sort of way or not, and if in the same way then why didn'r the Chosen have records of what to be on guard against?), or was just this one not a Chosen without being able to switch over for some reason?

(The solution to an operating system monopoly is not 'smash all computers', the solution to a tea monopoly is not 'dump all tea into the sea', the solution to a medicine monopoly is not 'burn all the medicine'... Tariq especially seems alarmingly unruffled by the fate of the medicines' recipes and the Saint's presumed culpability, given the extreme relevance for unnecessary suffering.)

((I also find myself wondering /why/ all those non-Chosen went against their own interests instead of even one being a bit more cowardly/cautious. Compulsion from their Name/Role, from Below, from the Story? Or the inflexibility of each Named being the frozen moment of when they took on that name, Vivienne's Name-loss notwithstanding? What does this say for Cat, who has the power of a Named without a concrete Name? A rare free agent while the other pieces are on tracks..?))
