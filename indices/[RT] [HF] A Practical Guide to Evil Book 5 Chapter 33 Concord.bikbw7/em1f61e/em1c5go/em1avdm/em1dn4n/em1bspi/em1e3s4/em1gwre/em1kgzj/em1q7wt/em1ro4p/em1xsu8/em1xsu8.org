It sure is funny how the Saint of Swords is so very old and yet in such perfect health, isn't it?

She was willing to kill the King, what makes you think that killing the Alchemist would be past her? People remember the first, and as far as she's concerned, that's probably a good thing. The second's stockpile had to go /somewhere/, after all.
