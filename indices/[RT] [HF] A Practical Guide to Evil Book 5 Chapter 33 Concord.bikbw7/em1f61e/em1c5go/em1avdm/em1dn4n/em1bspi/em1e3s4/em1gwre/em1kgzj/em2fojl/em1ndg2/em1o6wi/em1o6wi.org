Fatalism III. Cordelia Hasenbach and the Saint have a chat. The Saint lays out that what Cordelia's doing isn't enough, so the Saint set things up as a two front war with political problems to ensure the Principate burned in the aftermath of the crusade and rose as something new on the tide of the story. But not as Procer. It still might go down, given what Cat says elsewhere about the political problems the conclave raises and the hints of instability from the crusade in general. All on the back of 'NO TRUCE WITH THE ENEMY'.

Tariq took the hard path so many times for his vision of one Procer, it'll break his heart when he discovers that his oldest and closest friend has been discreetly fanning the flames. Even if her attempt fails with the breaking of Procer's blaze of glory story.
