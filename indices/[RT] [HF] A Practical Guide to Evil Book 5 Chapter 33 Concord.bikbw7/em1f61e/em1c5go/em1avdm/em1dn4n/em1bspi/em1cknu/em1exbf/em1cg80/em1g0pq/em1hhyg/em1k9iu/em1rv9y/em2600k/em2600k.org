I'm not sure how much of it Tariq knew. From his PoV in "Queen's gambit: declined" we only know that he figured out Black would force the heroes to expect him in Iserre, concluded that the only way the Legions could keep running around were the ships left in Saudant, and came up with a killing stroke that would work /no matter what Amadeus would do after entering the city/.

He may not have known how many legionaries Black Knight would take with him. He couldn't be sure whether they would just raze the place, quietly steal the boats in the night or subdue the locals. He barely was able to estimate when they would even come, because that would depend on the amount of juice left in Amadeus and his willingness to spend it. All Grey Pilgrim was certain of was that the Black Knight would come to that one town while the rest of his forces "sieged" Iserre, and he figured out a way to capitalize on that certainty.

A plague to ensure that they would die no matter the next step of the plan, even if the ship trick itself was another bait. A ten days incubation period, to account for the timeframe for the legions' arrival and to prevent Amadeus from noticing it. A small town, one where the sickness would have the minimal chance to spread and one the heroes would be actually able to purge afterwards. An ugly solution, sure, but with the information availiable to Tariq it made more sense than, say, charging a Black Knight with unknown tricks up his sleeves.
