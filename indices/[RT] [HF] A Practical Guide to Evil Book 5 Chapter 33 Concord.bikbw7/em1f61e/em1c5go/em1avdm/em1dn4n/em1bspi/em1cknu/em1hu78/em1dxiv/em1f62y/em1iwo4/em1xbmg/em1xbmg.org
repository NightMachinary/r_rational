I can see the case that many of this those murders would fall under the category of "executions."

I can't seem to remember any trials to accompany them, though, so, yes. Murder.

I personally disagree with the supposition that there's a moral distinction between the State killing someone who has been given due process, and a fair trial, and then convicted of heinous crimes, and any other flavour of non-defensive intentional killing. But in that case, I can acknowledge there's an argument to be made that I'm wrong.

On the other hand, I can't see any real argument that Judge Dredd style, on-the-spot execution, where the only legal opinion that matters is the executioner's, can be considered anything but murder. And Catherine's done a fair amount of that.

For truce-breaking, didn't she take out the Exiled Prince under flag of truce?

I'll grant you that the apotheosis is something they don't know about.

If she hadn't given her allegiance to Below, Below wouldn't have Named her.

And while I agree that Cat was left with little choice /but/ to serve the Empress, I'm not sure that the Pilgrim and Saint would see it the same way.
