Assuming that Cat still has a trick to pull... Would Black be a possible candidate for the one? Conveniently, the Rogue Sorceror is carrying his soul (I assume he's keeping it on his person, since hiding it is too dangerous), and it seems like the sort of surprise Cat would pull.

Black effectively ruled Callow for a while, to the extent that Catherine was able to use that to pull the sword out of the stone in Liesse.

It depends a bit on how literal the sacrifice needs to be though; Cat probably wouldn't like to lose Black completely. The wording doesn't specify anyone needs to die, so it could be okay (the fact that Cat let the seven listen in suggests she expects them to live).
