I'm really looking forward to Tariq finding out about the Saint dealing Procer that deathblow that Cordelia perceives through the conclave.

If the Tyrant manages to pull off the Pilgrim's death instead of Hanno's or the entire choir of Judgement, which seems like a final sacrifice story for good, that might be the thing that pushes him over the edge and do it willingly - learning about Laurence betraying the one thing he set out to build.
