/"So..."/, says Cat, in her slow drawl, /"I'd like the peanut gallery that's been standing here the whole time to realize what */I** have been willing to give up for you. That I was willing to kill off the leader of my own band of evil Fae, to create and then challenge a god and slay--at great risk to me and mine--all so that *you* could have a magical highway and avoid getting turned into the Dead King's minions. When it came down to it, I was *not* the one establishing terms or conditions, merely trying to save all your asses."*

/"You're welcome."/
