So just a thought here.

The motley band of Five Heroes who come together to defeat the villain is a strong story. However there is one common fail case. It fails when the motley band of Five Heroes is betrayed by one of their own in the moment of their victory.

Is Saint going to betray everyone at the worst possible moment?
