It occurs to me that Saint's plan for Procer is a similar plan to that which was offered to Cat by the Hashmallim way back in book 1. A grand victory for Good at the expense of an entire country. Cat refused because Callow would become a "graveyard with an army". If Saint reveals her plan while they are allied like this, Cat might reveal the Hashmallim's offer. This would put the Pilgrim in quite the pickle. Does he side with the hero who is willing to sacrifice a country of people to win a victory for the Greater Good, or the villain who /explicitly shares his primary motive of minimizing suffering/?
