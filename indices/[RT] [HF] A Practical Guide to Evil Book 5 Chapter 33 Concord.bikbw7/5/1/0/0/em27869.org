Not sure where you guys take "one last time" from. For the record, the conversation you're referring to (the end of [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/05/25/interlude-kaleidoscope-ii/][Kaleidoscope II]]) doesn't have anything on the amount of times a party can lead a war - only that it's not yet the time to assemble one and that someone would have to die for Evil to retreat for good.

I don't think the party can assemble only for one mission: both villainious examples we have took part in multiple conflict, and the current one can't be declared over until the Dead King calls back his troops anyway. the narrative weight, so far, was more of a rough measurement of what did it take for a given Named to get to the current stage of their story, rather than some expression of "audience's boredom".
