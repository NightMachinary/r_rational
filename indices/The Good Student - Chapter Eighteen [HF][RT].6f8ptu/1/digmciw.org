Oh boy what do we have here.

A surprising chapter to be sure, especially the end. I just have hope that simole doesnt die, she was a nice character and although her death could lead to character plot progression it wont have as much of an impact.

On the other hand things are kicking into full gear. I wonder when simoles father shows up.
