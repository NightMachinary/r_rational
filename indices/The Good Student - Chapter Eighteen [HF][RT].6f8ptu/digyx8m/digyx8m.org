Well, I "started" reading. Although this is interesting, I must say I'd have enjoyed a story line where Nic left Dizzy in the dust, and had her crawling back after realizing that he really was over her. But this is probably just leftover vindictiveness from reading so much Worm fanfiction, as worm canon features a brutal betrayal and shunning between former best friends. At school.

Anyway, while this is all very suspenseful, I have to agree with one reviewer who remarked that the pacing and plot seem to have become rather chaotic in this latest chapter. I hope it'll look more ordered as part of the bigger picture.
