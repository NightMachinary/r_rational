i wasnt a fan of his previous work either. It has an interesting subversion on the isekai genre with an interesting protagonist at the begining but you could tell it was his first attempt. He wrote a lot and now he is simply a better writer.

I would say that the good student (for now) is on the level of MoL or slightly behind it because of pacing.

I stopped reading his previous novel pretty quickly because of the previously mentioned flaws which annoyed me to the high heavens but its nice to see his evolution as a writer. I think he improved a lot with this one.
