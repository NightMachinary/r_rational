So apparently this is really good, but I just haven't managed to bring myself to read this yet. The synopsis on royalroad just isn't doing it for me. At all. Not that anything off-putting is there, it just doesn't capture my imagination.

Would an enthusiast mind selling me on this? I'd like an excuse to move this towards the top of my to read pile, if only to have something I can join the comment threads on.
