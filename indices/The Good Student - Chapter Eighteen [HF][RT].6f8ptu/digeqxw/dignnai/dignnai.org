So if you liked the authors previous work "How to Avoid Death on a Daily Basis" then i would say that this one is even better.

Characters that have simple and clear motivations from the start. They are extremaly relatable too. And ofcourse they are intelligent and competent, i would say too competent but thats rather my personnal opinion and bias.

The setting is interesting to say the least, its fleshed out rather well considered the wordcount.

And its a magic academy, if you are a fan of those you will like this one... I think

To sumarize its a well crafted piece of fantasy with a relatable protagonist that is competent, an interesting world in it and political intrigue thrown in.

In terms of how it compares to the authors previous work. As i said its better. His characters always followed simple motivations that were established pretty early which is a good thing. But in this one we have a more thightly knit world with none of the weird tone shifts, annoying accents and a comedy that works atleast for me. Another problem with his previous work for was that it wasnt that well thought out. The pragmatic mc was interesting but the group of idiots that sometimes was suddenly smart didnt hold up. Instead of the group of missfits that work well together we have the smart mc that is hateful oh himself and other people and some other bunch of losers that he is the leader of. In this one we havent had enough time yet to apreciate the whole group working together but they play off each other really well. The banter between them serves for better comedic relief. The plot makes more sense(better planned story). Even the world makes more sense and is netter presented.

In the end, yes its good i recommend it although i dont know ur reading queue. Its centaurlu easier to get into than other things because of its format.

Sorry for the messy comment, i am on mobile
