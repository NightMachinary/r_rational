Another idea for QI becomming aware they're targeting him..

  I think I have something that might help you take down Quatach-Ichl," she said, pulling out a weathered old scroll out of her bag.

  "Oh?" Zach said eagerly. "Do tell."

  "It's a trap field that prevents souls from escaping out of the area," Silverlake said, throwing the scroll in his direction. Zach caught it, fumbling slightly with the catch due to not expecting the move. "For undead like Quatach-Ichl, it stops them from leaving until they shut down the ward. If you can lure him into the field, it should give him trouble for a time at the very least.

QI could have made a number of scrolls like this, with spells usefull in battle against liches, added a listening spell to them, then scattered them around. Maybe even getting this one to Silverlake intentionally (without her knowing he sent it), because he considers her a threat.

If someone preparing to battle him is doing research on how to defeat him, they would come across a scroll with a spell perfect to use against him - then discuss battling him near the scroll.

QI just has gets an alert when they move, then listens to stuff happening near them. He could also track the scroll's location to find them.
