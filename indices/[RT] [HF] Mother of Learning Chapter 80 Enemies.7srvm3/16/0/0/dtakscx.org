Yeah, I was somewhat reminded of Lady Alustrial from the Forgotten Realms books. IIRC she heards the next seven words whenever somebody mentions her name.

Granted QI hasn't been shown to be /that/ powerful, but then again, it's a genius idea. And considering in some ways QI is basically what Voldemort wishes he could be, and that even Voldy had a similar idea with attaching the Taboo to spoken mention of his name, I can totally see QI doing something like this if it's within the limits of his abilities...
