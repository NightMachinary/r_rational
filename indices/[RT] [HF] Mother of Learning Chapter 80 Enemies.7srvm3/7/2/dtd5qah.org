  I feel like QI completely overshadowed the sulrothum, but they are very much worth talking about.

I really liked them as well. A bit like with the Aranea its cool seeing a truly alien sentient species, especially one thats not part of the standard fantasy set. I hope they get more development.

They did kinda suck at the diplomacy attempt though. Would have been trivially easy for them to talk to humans who trade with them in advance rather than just going in blind.
