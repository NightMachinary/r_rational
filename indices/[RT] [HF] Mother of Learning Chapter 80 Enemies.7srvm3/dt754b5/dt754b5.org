The end is especially interesting because of his lack of scruples. Even if Zorian and Zach perfectly avoid giving anything about the time loop away, he can just force it out of Kael or take some other people hostage. Remember that soul magic has a permanent effect in this loop, so he has the power to effectively remove anybody from the loop even if they can be reset when the loop ends.

They need to effectively string him along without giving him control regardless of whether they let him in on the loop.
