That isn't how I remember it? Yeah, soul magic is dangerous as fuck to Zorian specifically, because any alterations to his soul risk fucking up his soul marker, but everyone else is destroyed and reconstructed back again in the start of the loop no matter what the damage is, and Zach is basically immune to someone with no prior knowledge of the Sovereign's Gate self-defense mechanism barring a lot of bad luck.

I think the most dangerous thing is the fact that apparently Quatach-Ichl just apparated from fucking Eldemar or whatever to the Xiotic region in a very small time-frame, after getting information that Z n' Z were asking about him on the other side of the continent. Like holy fuck how.
