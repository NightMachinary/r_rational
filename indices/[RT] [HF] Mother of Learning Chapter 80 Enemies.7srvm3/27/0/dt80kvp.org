Well, QI is one of the few people in the world that can permanently destroy them. Zach ostensibly was knocked out for many restarts when QI did the initial soul merge. Zorian doesn't even have Zach's "auto-restart on soul tampering" protections, so QI could still permanently maim him.

I do think Zach should be okay with Zorian poking around in his head at this point. Personally, I'm guessing RR put a deep-seated aversion in Zach's head to avert that sort of thing.
