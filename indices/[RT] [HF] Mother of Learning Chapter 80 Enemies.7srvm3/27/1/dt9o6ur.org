  How have you not tried talking to this fellow before?

Perhaps because QI is a reasonable, fair, far-sighted, ridiculously competent leader who has apparently decided that he has sufficient cause to burn their city to the ground and unleash an eldritch abomination to kill as much of their continent as possible?

How can they negotiate with that, when he's already thought things through? What positive /or/ negative incentives can they hold out, when he's more powerful than the two of them combined despite the loop? Why take the risk of even trying, when he has mastered one of the few skill sets that can pose a real danger to them?

I don't expect them to walk away from this "negotiation" without a loop reset. Let's just hope QI doesn't whip out a diabolus ex machina and block that ability.
