Sure, but he hasn't been publicly on the continent since Eldemar chased them to that island. Which was over a century ago, I think? I'm pretty sure there's no trade between Ulquan Ibasa and the mainland either. No one is going to have information locally, certainly not anything they don't already know from fighting him.
