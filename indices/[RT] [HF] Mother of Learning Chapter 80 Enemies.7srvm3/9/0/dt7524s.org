Silverlake has a lot to gain from cooperating with Zorian and Zach (Youth potion ingredients, at the least), and nothing really to gain from Ulquan Ibasa. She's already immortal--why would she risk losing her avenue to eternal youth by pissing the protagonists off?

I definitely wouldn't be surprised if she screwed them over by escaping the time loop on her own (she's definately leaving coded info in her notes about that), but I don't see how cooperating with Quatach-Ichl would help her do that.

...Unless she's giving Quatach info in exchange for access to the primordial's prison, so she can experiment on it each loop. Sounds incredibly risky for her though. She'd have to hide the fact that she's going there from Z&Z, and risk that Quatach would use the info and thus expose her, as well as risking that she'd be betrayed by her new "ally." I guess shes dying at the end of each loop anyway, but it still seems rather pointless.

She /can't/ find the ancient Salamander or get the grey hunter eggs on her own. Her best hope there is to make nice with Z&Z and not give away the recipe, so they gather enough ingredients for a potion for the three of them after the loop ends. She doesn't get that by siding with Quatach.
