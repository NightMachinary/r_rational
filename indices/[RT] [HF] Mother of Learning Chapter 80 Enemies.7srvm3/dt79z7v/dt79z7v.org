I can't be the only one who thinks there's a chance, albeit slim, that Quatach-Iclh is going to be friendly? Every time they've interacted with him so far it's been on opposite ends of a battlefield. The Lich is absolutely an evil character but he's probably rational. He's safe now, he just wants to know what's going on with Zach and Zorian. They both have information on the cult of the dragon that he'd be interested in.
