I do think seeing Zorian up close and intentionally looking for how to get into the loop might be successful for QI. However, would QI really be willing to do some potentially highly experimental modifications to his own soul? It depends on the difficulty of the procedure for him, but . . . I'm not sure it's entirely worth it given there isn't /much/ time left in the loop. However, I do feel if anyone could make use of that limited time, QI definitely could.
