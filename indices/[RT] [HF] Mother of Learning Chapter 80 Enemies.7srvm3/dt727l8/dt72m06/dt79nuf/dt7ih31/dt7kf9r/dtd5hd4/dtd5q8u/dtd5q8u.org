the point is based on everything we've been told in the story so far, NO ONE except the gods who created the thing should be able to do it. It's not a matter of training a few hundred years, because if it was, then the person using the time loop to train coudl just practice for a few hundred years and then start modifying the marker.

You're logic is analagous to zorian thinking red robe could actually destroy souls because hes been stuck in the time loop for a few hundred years and thus if anyone could red robe must be able to.
