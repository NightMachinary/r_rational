So now that I have had a chance to calm down and think about it. Quatach-Ichl just casually tracked down Zorian and Zach to a tavern, with only about a 3 week timeframe. That effort included the time it took to realize someone was inquiring about him, and the time to track them. Not only that he did it without tipping off Zach and Zorian that anything was weird about the loop.
