While I'm sorta joking, I've been hoping for this for a while.

  Similarly, it seems odd that they haven't tried to use diplomancy on QI at all. They know it can be done since RR did it, and it would open up huge capabilities for backstabbing QI. Yes, he is very very very scary, but talking to him is not much more risky than the Aranea mindbreaking Zorian before he learned mind magic or how they're trusting Silverlake right now.

  As the Ghost Serpent and Silverlake and the Aranea and literally everyone else they've ever opened up to has mentioned, it is a literally unbeatable tactic. And unlike the Ghost Serpent who wants nothing they have to offer, QI is making a very desperate and expensive gambit right now and could use all the help he can get.

  Quatach-Ichl is also a highly respected, rational, heavily competent leader of a country who has already been shown to treat his subordinates fairly, work with timetravelers, and balance diplomatic concerns.

  QI is a big risk, but since they can now reset the time loop instantly or even negotiate via simulacra, he's not much more of a risk. It's probably less of a risk in absolute terms to try to talk to him than to face him in battle.

I agree with you that diplomacy with QI is the best route to take. And not just for immediately getting the crown, but for long term success after they escape the sovereign gate too.
