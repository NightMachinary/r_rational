I find it unlikely that QI would tutor adversarial mages . . .

BUT I can imagine it. Maybe for all his vileness, he's still a scholar and gentlelich. Having lived for nearly a millennium, unique individuals like ZZ are actually a delight in his eyes.

Maybe he used mind magic on one of ZZ's allies and learned about the loop and that the end is nearing. Rather than try to get into the loop by doing experimental stuff with his all-important soul (or maybe to give him time to do such experimenting), he attempts to convince ZZ that he'd find it really entertaining to help them and teach them. Maybe one of his hobbies is teaching precocious young necromancers---private tutoring can be incredibly rewarding for the teacher. :D

After all, he did let RR hang out with him.
