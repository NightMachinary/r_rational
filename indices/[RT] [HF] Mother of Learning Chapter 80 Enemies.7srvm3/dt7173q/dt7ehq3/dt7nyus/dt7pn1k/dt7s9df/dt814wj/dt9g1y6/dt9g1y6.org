I think it only requires you to be able to cast simulacrum and to anchor your soul to an object. Simulacrum was explicitly mentioned as being already halfway there.

The story so far with Zorian creating simulacrums and then linking them to golems seems like he's basically building a lich body. Combine that with the soul trap (for just yourself, not millions of souls), and you've got 99% of what makes up a lich without ever doing anything immoral.
