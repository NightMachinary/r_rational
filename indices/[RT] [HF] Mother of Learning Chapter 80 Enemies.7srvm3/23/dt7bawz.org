Thinking about this chapter, why do Z&Z need to have the Crown? Yes, the Crown needs to be present when they interact with the Gate, but why do they need to have it? Could they possibly convince QI to help them get the other Keys, and then have him tag along while they go into the Gate, promising all the other Keys as payment once they have unbarred the Gate? It's not like they actually care what happens to the Keys after they've used them for unbarring the Gate, and QI seems smart and selfish. Since Z&Z's goals don't actually directly conflict with QI's, it's possible that they could get him on board to help. Letting him know about the time loop is of course out of the question, but I think it's plausible for QI to get enough benefit that he won't care about the secrets.
