I know everyone is terrified, but bear with me, I think this is probably the best case scenario for a contact between the dynamic duo and QI.

First of all, QI started this conversation in a public place instead of, say, ambushing ZZ in a quiet place outside of Cyoria. This means two things:first, he can find them (as evidenced by him finding them) and second, he would prefer to not fight them. This is probably the least advantageous situation for QI to start fighting:

- he can't realistically prepare a battlefield in advance-I doubt ZZ picked some specific tavern instead of a random one, and new massive wards within a populated city full of mages would have been noticed.
- if he does fight, he loses the invasion-it seems doubtful he could keep his disguise up in a fight, and all it would take is for ZZ to scream about the invasion, or damage his disguise, or teleport to the police station to ruin everything. At best he could try to portray this as a barfight gone bad between three powerful mages, but that still means police investigation /and/ would prevent him from using any really powerful magic since that would still point at him.
- he can't rely on support-QI doesn't trust his mage force much and thus probably wouldn't have told them he is meeting with a powerful third party that those mages could use to one-up QI. He can't use his army either, see previous point. And he can't use his subordinates from the island either, since those would definitely prompt an investigation to see what they were doing in Cyoria.

On the other hand, ZZ would be just fine to fight here:

- Zorian constantly keeps anywhere from 3 to 6 simulacra in different parts of the world that he can instantly communicate with through his soul. Those simulacra, in turn, can do everything zorian can, including teleporting to his allies and making Gates between themselves. This means that all Zorian has to do to get a pretty significant number of allies on the scene in if not moments then minutes is to tell his simulacrums where he is.
- With their newfound soul defences it seems unlikely that QI could take them down in moments. At the very least it will get to a fight, which already benefits ZZ more than QI. Furthermore, magic such as what QI could use to turn ZZ into his slaves is likely very involved and takes a long time, meaning their allies will arrive on the scene.
- Any complicated soul magic used on Zach will trigger a loop reset, wherever QI knows it or not. This means that Zach is safe from soul magic while Zorian is probably safe from mental tampering (and can do a Mind Blank himself if push comes to shove). Since it seems doubtful QI would have access to that information, he is at least 50% likely to use a wrong permadeath spell on the wrong person and get either mindraped back (can't use mind magic while your mind blank is up, can you) or just die because the loop reset.
- ZZ still likely have the orb on them, and using it means getting an instant golem army on the spot, plus possibly other allies they have in there.

This means that QI is more or less screwed either way. Don't use soul magic-ZZ reset the loop after the conversation. Use soul magic-either reset the loop immediately or get into a fight where ZZ might escape and reset the loop. Try to disable them first before analysing them and using soul magic later-get into an even bigger fight and definitely lose the invasion.

Because of that, his only venue is diplomacy, which he is trying to do. There are actually some avenues for progress here you might not suspect:

- QI likely doesn't know that his mages are attempting to control the primordial, or that it is not summoned and as such will not go back to it's cage. Giving him this information might cause him to reconsider the whole invasion plan, as that is a key point in it.
- QI likely doesn't actually want to invade Cyoria as a terminal goal-war is a continuation of diplomacy by other means, after all. As such, giving him an avenue for diplomacy with the Eldemar other than literally directly invading them will probably serve his goals just as well as the invasion itself, if not better. Eldemar doesn't seem eager to invade his island either, meaning they would also prefer not to fight, wherever church says undead are abominations upon creation or not. That means that some common ground already exists between the two, and some diplomacy might be possible (most likely for the purposes of trading magical research). ZZ can make that significantly easier too, by trading political secrets about Eldemar nobility that would possibly make it easier to convince Eldemar that bringing their whole army down on the undead is a bad idea.

As such, while I think it'd have been better to not meet QI, this is probably the best case scenario for how it would have happened. Certainly beats him showing up and opening with a soul magic salvo.
