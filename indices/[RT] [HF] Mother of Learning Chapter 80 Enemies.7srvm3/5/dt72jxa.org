I wonder if telling Quatach the truth about Primordials (they aren't actually summoned, and thus won't eventually disappear after a certain amount of time) would get him to change his mind about the ritual?

Given that he's such an ancient and powerful mage though, I doubt it. He likely already knows. He likely knows (and approves of) the wraith bombs as well.

Maybe cutting a deal with him (they're both going to be very influential in Eldemar after the time loop) and making necromancy legal would help things out? Opening up trade, perhaps?

Edit: Then again, knowledge of primordials is more of a church thing, if you aren't specifically interested in them like Silverlake, and he doesn't get along with them. Plus, he didn't know about the ritual's true purpose (dominating the primorial), and I feel that he's too smart to deliberately unleash a godlike monster that won't simply vanish after a while, even if it can't get to his island.

Really looking forward to their conversation though.
