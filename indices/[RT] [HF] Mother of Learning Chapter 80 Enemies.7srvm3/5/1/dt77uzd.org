  Maybe cutting a deal with him (they're both going to be very influential in Eldemar after the time loop) and making necromancy legal would help things out? Opening up trade, perhaps?

I think diplomacy is the only thing that will get them out of this encounter without resetting the loop. With a prepared battlefield, they're unsure that they can get the Crown from QI. Here, QI knew in advance that he was going to talk to two powerful mages, and Z&Z didn't expect or preprare for him at all. Fighting will not end well for either the bar or Z&Z.

Well, ok, it might end in a fight and without resetting the loop, but not in a positive way.
