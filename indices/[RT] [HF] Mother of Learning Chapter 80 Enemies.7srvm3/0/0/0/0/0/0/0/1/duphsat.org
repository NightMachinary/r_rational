  I'm asking what's "utterly fascinating" about him so far, as he's been a pretty generic lich so far with what little we've seen of him. I like his portrayal so far but it's not like we know much of his character other than that he's patient and non-omnicidal like a stereotypical lich.

Mysteriousness+importance+competence is pretty cool when it's done right. The three biggest things that audiences like in characters are being proactive, being competent, and being good. Many villains do two out of three and people end up liking them.

Mysteriousness without payoff sucks but I'd be shocked if that happened given how excellent the story is.
