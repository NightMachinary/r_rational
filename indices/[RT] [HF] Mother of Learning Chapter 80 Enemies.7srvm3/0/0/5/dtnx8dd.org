I personally think it isn't all unlikely. For the last twenty-something chapters I have a feeling Zorian is on a good way to become a necromancer out of the pure practicality of the thing if not in the story itself then probably once it's over. And with every new chapter I am more and more sure of it. While I think Zorian wouldn't like the thought in the beginning and no idea how lich “apprenticeship” works, it still is something Zorian should (and I think he will) consider. After all, Quatach-Ichl is old and experienced, he had a lot of time to learn something aside from necromancy as well.

(Plus no one heard from Kel'thuzad from World of Warcraft for quite some time, and I would really appreciate a snarky lich in my life with a direct approach and a possible cat. So I am entirely opened to having Quatach-Ichl around.)
