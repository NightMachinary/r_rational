Sure, but again generally those disciplines /do/ involve questionable practices. How many scruples do you think QI had when finding souls to practice soul magic on? Zorian has soul sight and knows enough soul magic to defend and examine his own soul, but offensive soul magic is an entirely different bag of tricks.

QI is a master soul mage. What kind of practice do you think attaining that level of skill entails? I can envision capturing people just to pick apart their souls slowly to better understand how souls work. How did Zorian get so good at kind magic? Unfortunately, a portion of his skill comes from a few months of pulling apart the minds of countless aranea, yes to steal their knowable but also afaik for practice.

And then we're also talking about QI who starts wars willy nilly. I'm not saying he's /completely/ deranged---he clearly has his own thoughts on morality---but I doubt he took the "do no harm" pathway to mastery.

But who knows . . . ? Well, I can think of one person who might . . . :P
