  without ever doing anything immoral?

Where, pray tell, did Zorian learn most of what he knows about necromancy? By thoroughly and forcibly (and illegally) ransacking the mind of Sudomir, who has performed all manner of horrifying experiments.

And how did he get the skill to do that? Well, it included mind dives that reduced Ibasans to mindless husks, cheating at card games, large-scale unprovoked assaults on aranean webs...

Zorian bypassed the usual path of highly illegal and immoral soul magic experimentation, by pursuing illegal and arguably immoral mind magic practice.
