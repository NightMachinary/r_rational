I think perhaps more relevant is that the story starts with the lich casting soul meld on Zorian and Zach. Considering how spells seem to generally need a fair bit of practice to work properly, it's not a stretch to assume he's been involved in some pretty awful experimentation.

edit: though I've just realised that animals have souls as well, so this isn't really an issue. However, when the murder based soul sight route was mentioned before, no-one seemed to even consider that animals could be used, so there may be some fundamental difference that precludes their use as experimentation subjects.
