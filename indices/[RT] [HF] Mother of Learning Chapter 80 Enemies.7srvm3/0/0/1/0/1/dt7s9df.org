What do we know of him that's genuinely vile? I'm really asking, my recollection is kinda weak (time for a re-read!).

Alanic clearly finds lichdom vile in general, but he's likely very biased.

Now, I would find it unlikely for QI to turn out to be an ethical soul mage of some description, but he might be an "evil" soul mage without being actively malicious.
