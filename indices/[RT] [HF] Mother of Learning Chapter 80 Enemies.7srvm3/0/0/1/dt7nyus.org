I am aware that you are joking, but it would actually be a really good (and more importantly, reliable) way to short circuit what would otherwise be an ungodly amount of effort and which isn't even guaranteed to work every time even once they do get it right. it would also be the ultimate capstone to the whole "unreasonable teachers" theme, the only thing I can think of which could top Silverlake. it also might be the only way for Zorian to actually survive. I fully expect him to effectively be a lich given what sorts of soul jumping and body snatching abilities he will need to steal the original's body, if that ends up being what is waiting for him on the outside.
