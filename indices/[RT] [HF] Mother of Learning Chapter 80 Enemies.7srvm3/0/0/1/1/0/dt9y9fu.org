A lot of what yu've written forgets that QI is a soul mage. Soul modification, damage and death is permanent, doesn't reset through restarts. He could also easily add himself to the time loop, the same way he added Zorian. And all he needs to do to get all the information necessary to do this is to rip open Zack, Zorian, Kael, or Alanics mind, and he's a competent mind mage.

And now he knows about them. Who knows /how much/ he already knows, he could've easily broken into Kael or Alanic's mind /before/ this little meeting. The safest move is probably to kill Zach asap and restart the loop.
