It's not necessary for true names to be a thing, he could guess the area they were from by appearance and ask around or use library divinations to find people with their names by going through a census. It'd take some effort, though you have a fairly narrow search considering you have 2 names with one being fairly rare and also a way to confirm via appearance.

Not sure if I like the idea of true names, but names as they are already hold some significant information.
