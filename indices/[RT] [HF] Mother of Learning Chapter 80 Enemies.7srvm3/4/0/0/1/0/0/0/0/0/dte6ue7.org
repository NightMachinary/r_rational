Not necessarily - the very fact he's the one actively making contact with them inherently puts them on the back foot, no? As in, they're the ones reacting would naturally put them on the defensive.

I see him openly approaching them and offering his name as a way to (unsuccessfully) de-escalate, show that he's here to talk/negotiate in good faith instead of killing them in their sleep as he very easily could have.

Definitely wouldn't rule out Silverlake as the leak.
