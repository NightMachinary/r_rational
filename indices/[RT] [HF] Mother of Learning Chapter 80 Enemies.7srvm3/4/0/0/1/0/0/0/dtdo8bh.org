Yeah, that's a valid point for sure.

I'm reaching here, but it may be his attempt to defuse their extremely alarmed reaction? Kind of a "I have the upper hand, so I'll give this piece of info as a freebie to slightly equalive things as a show of good faith to hopefully allow better negotiations"?

It's still ambiguous where the leak is - silverlake, the wasps, the mercenaries, etc. I suspect it's the wasps given the Doylist literary appropriateness of the true name coming up after being foreshadowed by them, but that's not good enough Watsonian/in universe evidence
