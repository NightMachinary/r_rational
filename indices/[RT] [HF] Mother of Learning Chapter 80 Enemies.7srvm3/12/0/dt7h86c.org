FTFY

Okay, putting aside my new favorite pairing (Quatorian), I am very curious to learn about QI's motivations.

He has led armies several times before so he's possibly a bit of a warhawk. On the other hand, Eldemar has essentially imposed extremely longterm sanctions on QI's area of residence, so military campaigns may be perfectly reasonable.

So, QI finds a small group of extremely well-funded mages are poking into his affairs and movements and now wants to meet them. He's powerful enough and has probably watched them form afar for a few days, so he feels safe walking up to them like it's nbd.

Let's be real though: Under normal circumstances, he might expect to talk work them and learn what's up, end them in an overkill opening salvo leveling the building, then teleport away to have judo afternoon tea. You don't throw a bunch of resources investigating a powerful lich if you want to play patty cakes; he knows these people are probably enemies.

Given that they're bold enough to investigate QI in the first place---given that they even /know/ to investigate QI when the invasion should still be secret---this group may well have ideas on how to defeat a powerful lich. This means that QI may very well regard ZZ and Co. as a serious existential threat. Yes, he may feel safe approaching them in this way by surprise, but QI probably didn't get to be a lich by underestimating possible threats. (The soul coin thing let's admit was a fluke. Who would expect a 16-year-old to have access to such an item?)

Or he could string them along
