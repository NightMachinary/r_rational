Now that Red Robe is out of the narrative, it's about time for another loop twist.

Quatach-Ichl is old enough to have been around during the last time someone was sent into one of these time loops. Like the serpent spirit he may have been able to identify one is, or was, about to happen.

I think we're about to find out that Quatach-Ichl is trying to escape the loop even though he's not a time traveler. Maybe in order to duplicate his soul or something.
