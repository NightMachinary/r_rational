You're overthinking it. In any universe without a time loop, QI is basically invincible and can do basically whatever he wants.

If he hears about someone who wants to mess him up, he drops off his crown (so he won't lose it on the .00001% chance if he dies), then rolls up to them and has a talk. Why? Because it's the fastest way to get information and they can't do anything to him.

He doesn't have to look at any other info or check out their associates or anything. He's 100% assured that they can't hurt him and that he can kill them if he wants, so he just does the obvious thing and goes to see them as soon as he finds out about them.

And it would work out 100% of the time, if it weren't for the time loop (which he has no reason to suspect).

Also, he uses mind blank because he's a purely mental/soul entity, so the only thing that can mess him up other than soul magic is mental magic. He might not even know if Zorian is a mind mage; it's just standard when he has prep-time.
