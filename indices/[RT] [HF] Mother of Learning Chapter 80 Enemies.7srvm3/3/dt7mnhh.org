I feel that many people here are /still/ underestimating Quatach-Ichl.

/First/, consider ending of [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/46/Mother-of-Learning][chapter 45]]. Sudomir is, I would expect, a much worse soul mage than Quatach-Ichl, but even he was able to notice that Zorian was activating the restart switch fast enough to react. Sudomir's reaction constituted asking a pointless question; Quatach-Ichl could reflexively mangle their souls or something, as soon as he realizes that Zorian is doing something unexpected.

They're under an immediate threat of multiple-restart or permanent damage.

/Second/, he accurately determined that Z^{Z} are working against him. Information-gathering capabilities implied by that would make it trivially easy for him to further identify their associates --- such as Alanic, Kael, Taiven. He came to this meeting under a Mind Blank, which may or may not mean that he knows about Zorian's mind magic, but which definitely means that he regards them (two apparent teenagers) as possible archmage-level threats.

We can expect him to have accurate intel on Z^{Z}'s abilities and associates, and likely associates' abilities as well. Why /wouldn't/ he mind-read or torture someone else from their time-loop conspiracy before approaching Zach and Zorian, someone who couldn't protect against him?

There's a significant possibility that he already knows everything about their plans and about the time loop. Their operation security was laughably lax, in hindsight.

*tl;dr:* Z^{Z} are really screwed.
