Yes, so much is right here. If QI found Z^{Z,} then he may very well have found someone else in the group first and now their plan is utterly open---/including all the information they shared about the time loop/.

If QI now knows of the loop (or at least seriously thinks it's a possibility), I think there are two approaches he might take:

1. Feign diplomacy while examining their souls closely for any hint as to how he can piggyback into the loop.
2. Offer token support in return for cross-loop notebook-style continuity of some sort.

Assuming he knows, what other options might QI be considering?
