Try diplomacy. If it's not as successful as he would prefer, subdue and capture them, then spend the rest of restart figuring out the marker and/or modifying their minds to be subservient to him in future restarts. He would probably be able to at least put Zorian into coma (see [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/35/Mother-of-Learning][the incident with the Sword Divers]]) and plant a suggestion on Zach to teleport to next-restart!Quatach-Ichl's location as soon as this restart is over, if given a day of work, and then he would have a whole month to himself.

If he knows about the time loop, the only reason for him to /not/ do that is uncertainty regarding the speed at which they could initiate a restart, and possibly regarding their passive defences. Zach's marker already resets the loop automatically if his soul is tampered with. Quatach-Ichl may be worried that Z^{Z} set up similar active defences against mind magic, especially given the discussion about liches' preferences for those in this chapter.

But as soon as Quatach-Ichl figures out their exact capabilities /OR/ realizes they're not going to cooperate /OR/ figures out the marker, that would become the best available strategy to him, I think.

(This is all under the assumption that he is a perfectly selfish agent, mind you. He may be a nice, trustworthy guy, right?)
