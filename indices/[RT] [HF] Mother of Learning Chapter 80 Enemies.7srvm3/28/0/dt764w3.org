  Remember that soul magic has a permanent effect in this loop

I don't think that's actually true. The "Soul-Kill" spell Red mage used is something that just removes people from the Sovereign gate's list of things to remake each loop.

It was mentioned somewhere in story that if souls were actually being brought back, people's reserves and control would increase immensely over time, and would be very noticeable. People who ran into soul-magic using mages or monsters would show up dead/insane at the beginning of the loop, and that would accumulate over time with all the butterflies the protagonists brought up.

Hell, the invasion of Cyoria likely has at least a few soul-magic spells thrown around each loop, given that Ulquan Ibasa is a haven for necromancers. Even if it was just one per loop, that would build up over the decades Zach has been around.

Zach has traveled around finding and beating up necromancers and Liches over the time loop. Many of those are infamous for experimenting on people with soul magic. If people were perma-killed or driven insane through the loop, they would have to find new victims to work on each month.

  "I doubt he can," Zorian said. "I don't think the spell actually kills souls. I think it simply marks them in some way, letting the time loop mechanism know it should not recreate them at the beginning of the new restart. If the time loop is, as the Ghost Serpent believes, some kind of training mechanism, then it makes sense to include a function like that into it. It allows the Branded One to get rid of impassable obstacles by removing them from the loop entirely."

TL;DR: Soul magic likely doesn't transfer over for anyone who isn't a time traveler.
