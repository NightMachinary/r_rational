Just had the thought: was QI around during the last time loop? If so, could he have been the person who got looped, or added and escaped like Zorian?

Also, the loop now was supposed to be a month later. What if QI kept thinking the loop was about to happen, and wanted to start out from a position of strength? He could know that he might not like whoever's looping, and needs to make sure he'll be ok, but instead kinda got caught with his pants down.
