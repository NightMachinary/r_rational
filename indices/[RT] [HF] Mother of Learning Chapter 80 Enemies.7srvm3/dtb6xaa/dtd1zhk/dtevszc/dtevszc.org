I've been thinking about it- if QI was aware of the loop and might think to look for a potential looper, that would probably have been his first hypothesis when encountering a young person with abilities beyond his years, who happens to not care about dying. Even when he actually did resort to using soul magic on Zach/Zorian as a means of harming him permanently, he didn't think of checking for soul markers, despite having spent the better part of a month coordinating with RR.

I don't think QI knows about the loop, which seems surprisingly ignorant for an entity that has been around as long as he has. There's even a legend about it associated with the artifact he carries...

I notice that I am confused.
