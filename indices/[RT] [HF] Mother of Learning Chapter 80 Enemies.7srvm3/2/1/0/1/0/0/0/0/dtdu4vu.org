I'm not overestimating anything. I mentioned another instance of him using a spell based on soul magic. That was all. And as far as the cast being easy or hard, consider that Zorian is an extremely novice necromancer, and yet he was able to send a soul magic attack as part of his threefold attack against that mercenary on the airship. Quatach had hundreds of years to develop his craft, so I fully believe that that area of effect spell wasn't so difficult or improbable for him to use when you compare it to the ease with which Zorian used a weaker version on a single person.

Otherwise, I completely fail to see your point when you said that Zorian memorized the lich's spell. I don't see the relevance. And I don't recall Alanic saying anything about Quatach being able to use soul magic on others in a fight. If there was anything there, then it was probably simply a mention that it was more efficient for him to generally use different spells on his targets to kill them instead of trying to interact with their souls.
