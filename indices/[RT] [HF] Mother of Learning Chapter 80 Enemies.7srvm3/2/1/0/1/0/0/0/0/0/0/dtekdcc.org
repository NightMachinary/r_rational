Which does not contradict that he sometimes uses soul magic spells, or that he has the ability to use them, or that the reason he generally doesn't use them is because he prefers more efficient methods. It contradicts nothing whatsoever from anything I said.

And I'll reiterate that the first reply you made was to a comment that simply mentioned another occurrence of Quatach using soul magic during a battle other than the one that threw Zorian into the loop. This literally happened, and this is all that I mentioned. I completely fail to see what point you're trying to make here.
