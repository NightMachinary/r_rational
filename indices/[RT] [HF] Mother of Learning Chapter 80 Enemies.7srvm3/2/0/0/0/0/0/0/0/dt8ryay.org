I may not have made some things clear. For one, don't tell him about the time loop at all. Say they want the Crown and the rest of the Ikosian Artifacts that are also the Keys, and that they need them in the secure research facility, but never why. Tell QI that he will get all the Keys as soon as they are finished. Since they already have one, and generally know where the rest are, they have some credibility.

Also, he never has to give up his crown. Bring QI in his human guise along with them to the research facility, and use the Crown for unbarring the Gate, and QI never has to give up possession of it.

If QI already knows about the time loop, then my plan doesn't work at all. But if he doesn't, it might make getting most of the Keys, and especially the Crown and Dagger, much easier.
