Your hypothetical lives and dies on the premise that they somehow get QI to agree to this, though:\\
How do they convince QI that they'll give him his crown back, let alone the other artifacts (most of which they don't yet possess)?\\
QI is probably smart enough to not let himself be fooled so easily, so you'd have to entrust a lot of information to him, as well as a guarantee that Z&Z will uphold their end of the bargain /after they leave the time-loop./ This is all kinds of messy and dangerous, given just whom they're dealing with.
