It wouldn't work, I think. Zorian is too much of an accomplished mind mage for that to be feasible. Any signals that she sends would first need to get past Zorian's mind shield. And really, he's not even 'remembering' the content. Rather, he's storing the location of every drop of ink relative to the paper they're written on, no? I think enchants wouldn't work as they're not 'formed' in his head.
