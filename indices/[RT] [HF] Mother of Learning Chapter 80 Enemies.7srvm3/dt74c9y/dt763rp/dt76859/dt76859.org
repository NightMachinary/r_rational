HA that is an interesting way to put it. I wonder if she is putting magic in her books that could cause damage to Zorian for having memorized her books, even though the he cant read them.

Imagine Silverlake putting enchantments inside the book that Zorian memorizes but cant read, and because he memorized them, Silverlake can activate them... But I don't know if that could work or if I am being to paranoid about Silverlake.
