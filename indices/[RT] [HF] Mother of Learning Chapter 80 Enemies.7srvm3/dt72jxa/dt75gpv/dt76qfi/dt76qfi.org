  And as gentlemanly as he seems, diplomacy is probably not an option for someone who'd start a war of choice that'd immiserate half the continent.

Depends on whether he was pressured into the attack by his fellows. He had to protect the vampire girl, despite his dislike of her, after all.

Maybe his people are starving and desperate, cut off from trade by Eldemar? They live on a Northern Island that is likely very cold (bad farming conditions?) and Eldemar had a naval base watching/blockading them. It's certainly possible this is an attack he's personally behind in order to get revenge on the people who exiled him and made necromancy illegal, but there are other possible motivations.

He's called off the invasion before, after all.

  That's probably a nonstarter, especially since it's unpopular and the church is still influential.

They've waned greatly in power, and when Zorian assaulted the manor in the Sarokian Highlands, it was pretty explicitly said that Eldemar would keep the soul-trap around so they could experiment.

It would be a tough sell, but it's possible Zorian could eventually try to open up trade with Ulquan Ibasa. The war was never actually ended between the two countries.

Bottom line, we don't know what caused the war. Desperation, or simple pride and revenge? I assume we'll find out next chapter.
