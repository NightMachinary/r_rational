  The thing is, any visualization that fails to admit a teleporter ought to also fail to admit sleep or coma as valid continuations.

I don't buy this. The teleporter annihilates your brain. Sleep and coma do not.

The premise may be that creating a perfectly identical mind pattern will somehow cause my same consciousness/sense of self to survive as the new "me", but I wouldn't stake my life on it. What happens in the teleporter doesn't have to impact what happens at the destination in order to kill me. It just has to impact my body, in the teleporter, being disintegrated.
