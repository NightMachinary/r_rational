I get that that's the /premise,/ but why would I stake my life on that premise being true? I remain unconvinced that the instant of my disintegration by teleporter would not be, subjectively, the end of my life. I would need to be /certain/ that my subjective experience would continue on the other end of the teleporter before I would agree to enter one, and I'm not. My expectation is that my life will end, and an identical person will be created with false memories of being me.

  Would you die if we destroyed and recreated every single particle in the universe, from one instant to the next?

Yes, subjectively. The new me wouldn't know, but I'd be dead.
