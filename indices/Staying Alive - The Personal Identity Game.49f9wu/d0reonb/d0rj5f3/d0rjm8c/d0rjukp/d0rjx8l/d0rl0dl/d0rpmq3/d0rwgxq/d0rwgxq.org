No, the premise is you /are/ the mind pattern. By definition, "you" get to experience being that mind pattern, since the thing that is the mind pattern /is/ "you".

I think people who fail this mostly /fail to visualize/ themselves as still being alive, and the naive view where only one version of you can exist at the same time of course falls down completely once we permit teleporters. The thing that helped me get past this is "locality"; what happens in one part of the cosmos should have no impact on what happens in another part separated by lightspeed, so if I simultaneously transmit myself in two directions, and each direction admits a valid continuation, then this /forces/ me to conclude that "two versions of myself exist at once" /must/ be a coherent perspective. The thing is, any visualization that fails to admit a teleporter ought to also fail to admit sleep or coma as valid continuations.
