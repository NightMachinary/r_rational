I also picked the spaceship. If you are destroyed and perfectly reconstituted on Mars, that is destruction. Sure, the entity that wakes up on Mars has memories similar to falling asleep for a short time. However, the entity that enters the transporter on Earth experiences total and permanent cessation of mental activity.*

If I die to be replaced by a perfect copy, that's only "surviving" from everyone else's point of view. The me that experiences dying is still dead.

*Unless it's a perfect quantum teleportation; I'm not sure about all the implications of the No-Cloning theorem, but it suggests the result might be more like relocation, rather than deconstruction and reconstitution. Knowing what I know, though, I still think I'd pick the spaceship.
