That's true. Depending on the specific details of operation, the two transporters could be indistinguishable to the person who arrives at the other end. I would be pretty pissed if someone I trusted told me it was a wormhole transporter when it wasn't, though. Just because I didn't know I was dying doesn't mean it didn't happen.

You could disprove it if they say you died, though; just open up the transporter to see how it works. If it's a wormhole transporter, you have your disproof.

The thing is, after using the transporter a million times without noticing bad effects, I discovered it was actually a deconstructing transporter, I would be just as adamant about not using it the million-and-first time. Assuming my philosophy regarding death and the nature of self hadn't changed in the intervening time.
