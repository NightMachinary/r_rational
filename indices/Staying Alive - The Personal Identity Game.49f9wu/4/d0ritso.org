I don't like the silicon-brain question, honestly. For me, it's not a binary alive/dead choice, but rather a spectrum. Depending on how he brain transfer procedure and the virus work, each one could fall on different places on that spectrum, and my choice would hinge on which one keeps me most-alive.

The freezing problem would be similar, but it doesn't sound like the "soul" has anything to do with what I define as "me" in this case, so freezing is the clear option regardless of how it's implemented.
