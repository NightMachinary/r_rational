(<nods> Best would be if you could be scanned as a backup, then that used for teleportation if you didn't survive. I got criticised at the end for choosing both Spaceship and Silicon, but Silicon preserves (or at least stands to preserve) a lot more bodily continuity than Teleporter does, assuming that bits could be swapped out one by one while maintaining a continuous existence. Then again, through 'sleep=death' or the nature of brain organisation it could be that the idea of continuity was a doomed fantasy from the start, in which case Teleporter would be no worse than normal life (and thus better than Spaceship). For now, with Spaceship trying to leave myself hope on the off-chance that I do have a meaningfully continuous consciousness that I stand to lose.)

--Hmm, I just noticed I can separate my impulses there into 'altruistic' and 'hedonistic'. Altruistically, I'm fine with dying if copies of me can do the things I would have done in my place. Hedonistically, I personally want to eat delicious things much more, play many more computer games that haven't been released yet, and read entertaining fiction that hasn't be written yet even if it weren't intellectually stimulating at all--and those things (unlike learning things, preserving my memories, or doing good in the universe) are things I don't care at all about copies of myself doing, as they're things that I personally want to enjoy doing under the assumption that I'm a continuous experience that is going to get to do again things that I remember doing... hmm.
