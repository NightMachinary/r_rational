I'm kinda conflicted. Disregarding for a moment the fact that I would be dead, I think I'd see it as positive if it were clear that it was a replacement that would continue to act roughly identical to me - a little like a supercharged version of leaving your legacy through friends, children, and ideological descendants. I worry however about the moral hazard of such a technology becoming widespread and people believing that it really would be them on the other side.
