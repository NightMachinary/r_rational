Hm...

To see if I'm understanding your point correctly then, let me propose an additional scenario.

Teleporters have recently been invented. The method of FTL has a starkly limited volume capacity for each discrete jump, so those who travel through are disassembled, sent, and reassembled (fortunately, computers that utilize physical phenomena that also lead to FTL make the process of perfect reassembly well within reason).

A long-cycle comet, previously unobserved, is on a collision course with Earth. Its mass and velocity are sufficient to, using current impact models, sterilize the Earth down to around 9 miles below the surface, making survival via bunker unlikely. Given its high velocity, escape via physical craft seems impossible, due to construction time.

Am I correct in assuming you would prefer to send a 'copy' of you, to whatever safe destination has been chosen, through a teleporter?
