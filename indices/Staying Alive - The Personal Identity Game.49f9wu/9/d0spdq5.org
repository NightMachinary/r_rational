I chose based on preservation of personality. Reincarnation is a terrible bargain, but a 70% chance of True Death followed by inevitable True Death a few decades later is no bargain at all.

  Perhaps you made these choices because all along you thought that the continuity of the soul is what counts? If so, there is still a puzzle. How could teletransportation or replacing your organic body with synthetic parts ensure that your soul continues to exist? After all, the teletransporter transmits information about body states. Why would the soul follow this information?

Why wouldn't it? It's a soul! It's literally a magic extradimensional me-marker! Of /course/ anyone who believes in souls is going to believe they'll follow whatever they view as "me".

(Although admittedly, a soul that's killed by freezing a strange soul indeed. But I didn't know about that!)

In general, I think these sorts of test assume far too much; they basically only test for a handful of specific positions the author already kind of agrees with, leaving the majority of the population irritated rather than persuaded.
