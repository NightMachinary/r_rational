So here's my question: how do you know you aren't already a clone?

Imagine that every night an alien force disassembles you in your bed to analyse your brain and body. Then it puts you back with some nebulous memories of dreams.

For the purposes of the hypothetical, assume that any people who might be able to contradict that version of events are /also/ abducted and disassembled.

How could you possibly know? By definition, it is impossible for you to experience a discontinuity of consciousness.

If the universe had been created wholesale 5 seconds ago with your exact pattern of thoughts and memories in progress, you would never know. If time was travelling "two seconds forward, one second back" at all times, you would never know.

Continuity of identity and consciousness is an assumption. A reasonable one, certainly; even if my hypotheticals /were/ true, they have no practical consequences, so there is no reason to dispute it.

The point, however, is that it only makes a difference to your decision-making because you were given the word of god that it's happening. If you were told that it wasn't a "disassemble -> reassemble" teleporter but a genuine "wormholes or whatever" teleporter, you would have absolutely no way of telling the difference from your own experience.

You would probably assume, in the absence of external evidence, that you /weren't/ being disassembled and reassembled when teleporting.

You cannot experience a discontinuity of consciousness, only be told about it. So if that continuity is what determines your identity, you must be /told/ whether you are the original you or not. You would have literally no way of working it out for yourself.

This isn't an argument to convince you or anything, merely more food for thought.
