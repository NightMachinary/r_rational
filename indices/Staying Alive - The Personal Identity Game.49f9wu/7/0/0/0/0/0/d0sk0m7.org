Do you suffer any loss of conciousness?

If you step into a pod, stare at a blank wall, and then step out of the pod, you can posit anecdotally that nothing happened to interrupt your consciousness, and that the You prime who left is the You prime who arrived. If you step into a pod, some stuff happens, a brief period of darkness, and then the pod opens, then you can posit logically that You prime just went poof, and You+1 just appeared in the new location.
