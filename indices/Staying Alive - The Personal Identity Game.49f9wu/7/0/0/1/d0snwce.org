It's a good question, but from my point of view, it doesn't matter if I'm a clone, or if I were created wholesale five seconds ago. Given that I exist, and that I experience the world, I would like to continue experiencing the world.

So I don't have to be told that I'm the original, because if I'm there to be told, I have an identity that merits preserving. Post-transporter me is just as real and interested in continued existence as pre-transporter me.

Suppose aliens had a plan to kill you and replace you with a perfect clone. That clone would have all your mannerisms and memories, up to and including the moment of your death. The clone, therefore, would not have experienced a discontinuity of consciousness.

To my mind, the only difference between using the transporter and agreeing to die and be replaced by the clone is that the transporter spawns the clone on Mars instead of in my living room.

So it's not about "Was I killed as a result of going through the transporter?" As you say, the person who arrives at the destination will not remember anything amiss. It's about "Will I be killed as a result of going through the transporter?" Because persons who have been molecularly deconstructed are not capable of further experience.

As Arizth says, a wormhole transporter would not pose any difficulties. The person who departs can expect their own future to contain the experience of arrival. The person who takes the deconstructing transporter, meanwhile, expects that experience to be in somebody else's future. Just somebody else with the same memories.

Incidentally, this is also why I am not bothered by sleep. I expect that my own future will contain the experience of waking up tomorrow. From the inside, there is no way I can distinguish this from the alien disassembly. But the evidence I have from the world suggests that the alien option is unlikely.
