  As Arizth says, a wormhole transporter would not pose any difficulties. The person who departs can expect their own future to contain the experience of arrival. The person who takes the deconstructing transporter, meanwhile, expects that experience to be in somebody else's future. Just somebody else with the same memories.

If somebody told you it was a wormhole transporter but it was actually a deconstructing transporter, you wouldn't have that expectation. Even after using it a million times, you would never have a memory of being deconstructed.

The only way to know that you had died at all would be if somebody told you. And, by extension, you could never disprove it if somebody told you that you had died.
