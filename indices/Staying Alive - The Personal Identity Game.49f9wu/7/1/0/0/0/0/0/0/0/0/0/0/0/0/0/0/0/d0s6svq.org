Even then there's a difference.

With teleportation the question is, "Do I have myself disintegrated in the prime of life for the chance that I might survive in an identical body on the other side?"

With cryonics the question is "Do I have my body preserved after I die for the chance that either I, or at least a version of me, can be resurrected as a functionally immortal upload?"

While persistence of identity would be the ideal, I'd be willing to settle for the immortality of a copy of myself if that was the best I could get. But risking immediate death by teleporter for no benefit except traveling a long way to be in the same squishy organic body? No thanks.
