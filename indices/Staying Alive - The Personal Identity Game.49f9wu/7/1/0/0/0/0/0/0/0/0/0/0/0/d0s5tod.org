Looking at this, there seems to be a lot of debate in the comments, and I'm unable to evaluate whose position is more convincing because quantum physics is not my field.

Let me put it this way. My priority is to have my subjective experience continue. /If/ I can be confident that my subjective experience continues on the other end of the teleporter, I am willing to use the teleporter. If I'm /not/ confident of that, I am not willing to use the teleporter. Whether I can be confident of that or not is a question I will address when the actual technology, and information about the actual technology, are available.
