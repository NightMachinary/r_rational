Maybe "continuity" wasn't the right word. I meant it in the sense of "there's no continuity of my consciousness between my original and newly created selves."

Disintegration by the teleporter is the end of my experience. Subjectively, it's where my life ends.

If I'm unconscious for a while, my experience was only interrupted. It continues when I wake up.
