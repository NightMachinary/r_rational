I'm not convinced that you suddenly learn you have an immortal soul in any meaningful sense. The "soul" as described in the example seems to be devoid of ontological content. The "soul" they talk about, which might slightly influence personality but basically does nothing, sounds essentially like persistent qualia, a metaphysical epiphenomenal dead-end.

Once you come back from being frozen, you're literally soulless, but as far as we can tell this has no actual consequences. You yourself are unable to determine that you are now a p-zombie. Based on the information given, there's seems to be no justification for labeling whatever psychic effluvia flows from dying people(?) to embryos "the soul".
