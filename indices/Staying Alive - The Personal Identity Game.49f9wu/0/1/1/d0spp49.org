  Also come to think of it the game is kind of inconsistent - if souls existed wouldnt we have noticed amid all that teleporting and silicon-ing? They already said the teleported version was identical, which given their claims that souls have real effects and apparently arent teleprted is false.

I /think/ the idea is that you've already teleported, so you only "win" if you already believed in souls. The aim is technically to /not die/, not be philosophically consistent.

If you care about souls, and you discover they're real, then you've already lost.
