Yup...a proof that the universe has souls /should/ cause massive re-evaluations. The psychological-reductionist view is /premised/ on no souls. What if the soul has some unknown purpose? Which traits, exactly, are soul related? Am i messing up a delicate balance involving a finite number of souls by taking mine out of the cycle? What happens to the person who would otherwise get my soul? You can't just drop the "there are magical souls" bomb on me so casually!

Also, even though I did choose the same one we probably all chose for conceit of the philosophy game, it occurs to me that when probabilities are not held constant between options it /should/ distort consistency. If i value the soul component at n = (n-1)*chance_of_cryo_revival_success it becomes even.

Also come to think of it the game is kind of inconsistent - if souls existed wouldnt we have noticed amid all that teleporting and silicon-ing? They already said the teleported version was identical, which given their claims that souls have real effects and apparently arent teleprted is false.
