  I mostly agree with that, but the answer that would make me pause is "your soul is what makes you experience what's going on with you and not what's going on with anyone else"

Answer? Was that in the game for you? I wasn't shown that.

If not, I'm confused. There was /no/ evidence to suggest this in the scenario. For all we knew these soul things could have been some kind of extra-dimensional parasite that goes from brain to brain, feeding on excess voltage.

It's actually kind of amazing that anyone would assume that the strange ghosty thing that was described here was The Real You, with so little to go on.
