I mostly agree with that, but the answer that would make me pause is "your soul is what makes you experience what's going on with you and not what's going on with anyone else". If that were really the case, I'd find it hard to argue with the claim that my soul is me.

I don't /think/ that's how it can work; I'm not even sure that this is a coherent claim about souls. But I'm not 100% sure how personal identity works, so I should be willing to assume this kind of soul for the sake of the thought experiment.

Then again, I also can't imagine how we'd establish that that's how the soul works. So even if that's what a soul is, hypothetical me wouldn't be convinced of it.
