That's fair, but it's an immortal soul that has no impact on your personality, can't form memories, hold emotions, have skills, or make decisions, but exists. Question 3 is mostly there for people who already think an immortal soul exists. I'm not a soul, though-- I'm a pattern of memories, thoughts, and actions. If a soul has no impact on that, it's not important to who I am. I suspect the question is in part there to make me admit that.
