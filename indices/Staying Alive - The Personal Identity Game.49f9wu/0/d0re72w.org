The game does not reward changing your mind based on new evidence. If you suddenly learn that you have an immortal soul, isn't it expected that you make different decisions than before, when you assumed that you did not?

(Incidentally, I still /prefer/ the Freezing outcome to the Reincarnation outcome. But I think my reasoning is less "my memories are the thing that's really me" and more "I care more about keeping my memories and personality alive than about keeping me alive", suggesting that by the rules of the game, I should ignore that reasoning and go with reincarnation.)

Also, obviously my soul survived teleportation in question 1, if it's still around to get reincarnated in question 3. But maybe, if we allow that reasoning, we also have to allow "I take the spaceship, because the game has three parts, so I know I'm not going to die in part 1."
