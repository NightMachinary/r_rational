I feel like the choice to call it 'a soul' makes it difficult for people to follow the directive 'Consider the situation at face value' that it gives you before you start, just based on how some people are responding.

Following it, you should stop considering what-if scenarios, such as positing that 'the soul' is of unstated but great importance.

I can't really blame anyone for that though, since I know it can be hard to divorce the word 'soul' from familiar concepts and marry it to new ones.
