The soul question tripped me up. If we discovered souls, like other have mentioned, I'd be a fool not to take that into consideration. Yes, I want to go into deep freeze and 'continue living', but shit, if my suddenly-important soul dies? I dunno. It's a weird question. It basically says 'hey you have this really important thing that does nothing'.

I chose tele->silicon->death the first time, then back-tracked to see what tele->silicon->freeze had to say.
