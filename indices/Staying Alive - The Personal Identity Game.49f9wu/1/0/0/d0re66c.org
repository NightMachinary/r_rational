Yeah, this subreddit has an unusual number of people who think a certain way. When I was younger, I was somewhat uncertain about the Silicon decision. I thought that even if the output of a pattern was the same, the internals are more important, and felt there was no good answer to "keep the meatbrain and be replaced by someone else" and "cyborgize your brain and potentially be no longer the same".

Basically, it's like, imagine if my brain is =f(x) = 2x= , and if I cyborgize my brain it becomes =f(x) = x^2=, and the only test I have to run to see if things are the same is evaluating =f(2)= to check that it is =4=. Sure, the cyborgized brain has a similar output, but who knows if it is actually the same on the inside? Still, better to take a risk there than to 100% die by keeping the meatbrain and becoming not-me.

I'm less concerned about that now, since I think a pattern basically IS DEFINED BY the outputs it produces, and I imagine any such technology has a lot of data points, but it was something that made me hesitate.
