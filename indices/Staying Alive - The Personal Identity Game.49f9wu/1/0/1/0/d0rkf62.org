Hmm, probably? I assume that there are a lot of people here who are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism][transhumanists]] and are interested in things like mind uploads. Turning your mind into a computer seems more extreme to using destructive teleportation. Although I am not personally a transhumanist, I assume that those who are would find destructive teleportation much less invasive than uploading themselves into a computer.
