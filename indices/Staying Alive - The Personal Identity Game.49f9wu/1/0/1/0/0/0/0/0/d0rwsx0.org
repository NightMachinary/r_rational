I always find myself torn on that question - I'm pretty sure I would be psychologically comforted by the gradual approach to neuron replacement, especially since it doesn't leave any copies of me (which might be the /actual/ me) hanging around dying of natural causes or being blatantly destroyed in the process of uploading, but I'm not convinced it actually changes the truth about what's happened compared to a one-time 100% replacement.

That feels like treating consciousness as a "magical fluid" that has to be very carefully and slowly poured between vessels, lest it be spilled and not transfer properly. If you ask my intellect I don't believe I'm made of anything other than atoms so a process that arrives at the same arrangement of atoms (just /faster/) should be effectively the same ... but still my gut says there's a difference between the two.

So then I go back and forth between "There's no difference; clearly if a gradual replacement is fine then so is a one-off", "There's no difference; clearly if a one-off replacement means death then a gradual replacement means a gradual death, it's just that gradual deaths didn't exist before so I don't have good intuitions about where to draw the line" and "Maybe gut is right after all and there's a magical fluid involved".
