Anesthesia is a difficult thing, but sleep most certainly isn't a break in consciousness.

I think a lot of people who make this assertion, that sleep is an interruption of consciousness, are just using the pre-packaged sleep 1.0. Sleep 1.0 is a cut-off of sensory input, followed by a rest state in the mind where sensory input is analyzed by binary yes-no wake functions while the consciousness moves to higher wavelengths (delta, up from alpha and beta), and while the brain implements a file/sort function, the consciousness prances around in a memory-space constructed by a uncontrolled procedural generator using data files linked to short and long term sensory data storage. Once a yes-function is called by the wake subroutine, either after a pre-programmed amount of time has passed, a strong sensory input is detected, or something else, the consciousness descends to lower wavelengths and returns to real-time processing.

The problem with sleep 1.0 is that, during the file/sort function, it sometimes dumps files. Basically, during sleep 1.0, memory files aren't stored in long or short term storage, but rather in a temp directory. A book I read years ago referred to these as "Shadow Memories", and I like that term, so I'll be using it here. These shadow memories occupy some limited space in the memory buffer, and are dumped if you don't commit them to short, then long, term storage. Shadow memories are typically the contents of actions taken while not fully awake (sleep walking, sleep talking, or those conversations you grunt through when people try to disturb a deep sleep), and dreams (the afore mentioned frolic through procedural generation gone mad).

If you take the time to learn meditation, you can actually open up the config menu of Sleep and start making your own distro. For example, if you clear your mind, enter a trance, and issue a command to your brain of "I will remember my dreams in detail" before going to sleep, you will, with practice, begin to recall your entire sleep cycle. Do so continuously, and commit the dreams to physical storage (for example, keep a written journal), and you will begin to recall hours of dream content. Practice sleeping and meditating properly, and you will develop the ability to regain lucidity during sleep, and alter your dreamscape. Most people have actually done this reflexively a few times in their lives, typically when the dream was highly sexual. Hell, I had a reflexive LD recently, where someone propositioned me for sex and I declined because I wanted to be faithful to my girlfriend (wasn't fully lucid because I wasn't able, at the time, to determine that I wasn't in objective reality, but still).

Or, you can issue the command of "remain aware", and slowly train yourself to be asleep, but aware of things around you. I don't recommend it, since it can get really boring to listen to your computer fans hum or a clock tick instead of dreaming, but you can do it.

Anesthesia is really weird, though. I've had surgery a few times, and while I can sort of remember some hazy memories, I cannot be sure that those are real and not just fake "fill in the gap" memories my brain generated. Unfortunately, I wasn't in the right state of mind right after the anesthesia wore off to grab pen and paper and record everything I remembered.
