Did the site say silicon was wrong? And also why do you assume it was immediate replacement?

  Medics can get around the virus by replacing pieces of the brain with advanced forms of silicon chip

Nothing about the time scale

  The operation was successful! What's more, a few years later, advances in technology enabled scientists to perform a similar operation which gave you back an organic brain and body, so now you're fully human again.

Nothing about the timescale of the operation--it could've taken hundreds of years and then a few years after that a way to get you your squishy organic stuff was discovered. Further, there was a piece of your original brain left so assuming stem cell magic to get one one's organic brain back, I think consciousness was preserved through organic matter even if replacing one's brain entirely with silicone would've been death.
