I was reminded of this by some recent posts on this sub. This is a classic little web-game that tests your concepts of identity and consciousness.

I remember "playing" this game as a kid and making choices similar to what I made this time around. I went for Teletransport, Silicon, and Freezing. It seems I still primarily identify with having a consistent pattern of memories, preferences, and personality that changes in a contiguous way, rather than a particular body, physical brain, or immortal soul.

Good to share with friends. You may be surprised what choices they make!
