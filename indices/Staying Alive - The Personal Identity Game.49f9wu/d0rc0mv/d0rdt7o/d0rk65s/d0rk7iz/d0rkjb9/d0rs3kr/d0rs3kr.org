Depends on the odds.

In almost all cases not involving physical laws, there is going to be at least some uncertainty in the odds of anything.

You can't ever really do more than estimating the odds of something, and you can only estimate based on the information you have.

In my mind, the basic premise of consequentialist utilitarianism is that if your estimate, based on all of your information, leads you to think one thing has better odds multiplied by expected utility than something else, then you should choose the option that maximizes that value.

This is the lesson behind the phrase 'shut up and multiply'.
