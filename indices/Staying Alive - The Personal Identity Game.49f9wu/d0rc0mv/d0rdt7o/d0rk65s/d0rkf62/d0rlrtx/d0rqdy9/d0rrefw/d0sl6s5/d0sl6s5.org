A hypothetical:

I offer you a million dollars to have your mind uploaded to a server. "You" won't experience anything besides sitting under a machine for a few hours under sedatives, then walking out much richer.

The upload, meanwhile, will be copied and placed into robot bodies as a slave labor force in a factory.

Would you accept it?

(For practical purposes, imagine this process is 100% legal and that you have no qualms about someone else having to be a slave robot, so long as it isn't you)
