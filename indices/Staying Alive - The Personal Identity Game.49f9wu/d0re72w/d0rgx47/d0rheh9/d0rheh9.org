What justification for labeling it the soul /would/ be acceptable?

I can't actually think of scientific experiments that could have been listed on that page that would convince me of souls. If angels trumpeted from the heavens "souls exist and here is how they work", then that would be moderately convincing, but less in an "oh, now I understand" way and more in a "well, all these theologians have a philosophy that explains what just happened way better than I can, so maybe they're onto something" way.
