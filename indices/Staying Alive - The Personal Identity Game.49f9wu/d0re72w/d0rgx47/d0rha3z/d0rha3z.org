Exactly. Contrast with the following: We have developed a procedure by which we can extract one of your kidneys and implant it in a womb so that the fetus winds up using it as one of its kidneys (growing only one). The procedure is perfectly safe for the fetus, but carries a 5% chance of death for you. You have cancer and have a 70% chance of dying in the next year (of cancer). The procedure must be done before you learn if the cancer will kill you-do you want the procedure done?
