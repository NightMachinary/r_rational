Say I told you there was a being in a higher plane, reading your memories, and that you couldn't stop it from doing so even if you wanted to. When your heart gives out, it moves onto another human and starts copying their memories as well. Eventually, it will take all of those memories and do something with them. Let's say it decides what the truth of the world is, and generates some kind of goal function by combining approximations of all of the goal functions of the humans it has known, and it lives according to the result.

This is equivalent to the ghosty thing you've just described. Or, even closer to being an immortal soul than the ghostly thing you've described.

It is almost certain that the goal function it compiles is going to end up to some extent in conflict with the goal function you currently operate under, it is not going to be exactly the same, it will want different things, however subtle, it will disagree with you. You do not know what that being is going to be like, or how it's going to desire to live.

You say.

I suppose they could be. But do you really have much of a reason to consider that being to be you?
