Ehh, although it's probably the case that humans arn't born with their goal function fully specified, that they're made by their culture (it seems obvious, but there are a lot of objections that can be raised), I don't think the goal function necessarily has to change in any way after the age of 20. You can get more information and dramatically change your behavior accordingly without any of it necessarily changing the formulation of your aspirations.

Racism for instance is often integral to the racist's identity, but it could often be said that it's only a consequence of a more reductive goal function, 'defend your family' → 'keep the gene pool clean' → 'subjugate blacks'. They may later learn that A: subjugating blacks is not really going to help their cause, or B: Many blacks have good genes. The consequent goals will fall away. They will seem to be very different people. They aren't. The core of their being, their purpose and aspiration, 'defend your family', hasn't been touched by the information they've received.

But sure a person's goals /can/ change over time as a natural process. That doesn't preclude using your temporal advantage to sabotage your future self's plans :P
