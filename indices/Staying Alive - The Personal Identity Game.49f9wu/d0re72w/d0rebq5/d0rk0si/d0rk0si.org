Well, we don't have a lot of information about this supposed soul. Knowing it has just been discovered and we can be almost sure there is still a lot unknown about it (considering it must be very difficult to study) and we would be silly to assume something which such a strange mechanism of action definitely has so little use/meaning. It could well be that whatever they have managed to study is just one piece of the puzzle and the soul actually does retain memory somehow, just not in a way that can be expressed in the body it is reborn into.

It may, then, be possible in the future a soul that survives its many reincarnations could be somehow freed from the restrictions of body and remember all of its instances. In that case avoiding freezing is not just about saving myself it is about saving a near infinite multitude (all of which could be considered myself and are linked inextricably to it in some way).
