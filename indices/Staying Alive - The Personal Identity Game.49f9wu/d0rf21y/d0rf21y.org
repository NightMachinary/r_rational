One of the frustrating things about this is that since it establishes the existence of a soul, but you still don't /know/ that before the last question so if you did it again you would /maybe/ give different answers. For the record I chose spaceship, silicon, death. If I knew about the last question before the fact, I don't actually think I would have answered differently, since I don't think there is actually good reason to think the transporter necessarily means you reincarnate into your new body, as opposed to it creating a clone. The second question is also tricky in light of the last question as well since the silicon might force you to be reincarnated whereas that seems less likely with the virus. I think that because if the soul can't survive a bit of cold I suspect it wouldn't survive me turning to silicon. If I somehow knew the silicon would force reincarnation I would pick the virus since I would retain more identity than if I was wiped and shoved in a new baby body. But as it stands I don't know enough.

The second question is somewhat problematic because wouldn't actually think /either/ result would mean death(assuming I don't know the soul thing before the fact), I generally care more about continuity of experience than about retaining personal identity but since I think neither would result in death I would take the option that keeps me with more of my identity. Of course whether I would pick that option in reality would depend on the details of the silicon replacement tech, also once I was replaced with silicon I probably wouldn't have chose to change back to a biological brain, so that it /assumes/ I would that bugs me.
