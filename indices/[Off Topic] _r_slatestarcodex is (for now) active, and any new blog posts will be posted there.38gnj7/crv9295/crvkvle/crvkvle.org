I don't see why you're making this comment now. The subject line /says/ "and any new blog posts will be posted there".

Or are you talking about flooding [[/r/slatestarcodex]] with every new blog post on SSC? In which case I have to second the confusion of [[/u/coderman9]] because that subreddit is literally /all about/ Slate Star Codex. That's like telling people on [[/r/hpmor]] not to flood the subreddit with every new chapter of HPMOR.
