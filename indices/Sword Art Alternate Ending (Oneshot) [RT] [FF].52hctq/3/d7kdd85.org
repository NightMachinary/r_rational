I saw this, didn't believe it at first, and I'm still not sure what to think.

To start with, I'm really confused as to why Asuna acted as she did. I heard her stated justifications, but I still find myself confused. Her stated reasons, to be frank, don't seem very compelling, and while she's able to at least admit to a few of her mistakes she still made them, and they are pretty big ones. Asuna, and to a lesser extent Kayaba, don't act like really real people, or at least sympathetic ones. This chapter might work as a conclusion for a longer work, but as far as actual content wen't it seemed rather subpar- realizations that might have been explainable with context, but are all-but unbelievable without it, be they Asuna's relationship with Heathcliff or Kayaba's ability to stream every moment of the game- the personal life of 10,000 people for 2 years, with little to no breaks, and get it published somewhere.

That's not to say there weren't plenty of good parts, such as Asuna's thought process as she lies to Kayaba, or Heathcliff and his decision not to actually kill those who died ingame, but this could definitally have used a once-over at least.
