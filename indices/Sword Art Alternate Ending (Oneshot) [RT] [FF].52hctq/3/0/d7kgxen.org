I don't think finding a place to publish it would be an issue; Kayaba's more than capable of establishing his own streaming site. Especially as he's already going through the trouble of generating the game itself anyway; adding in cameras would be nothing. As far as covering 10,000 people simultaneously? Again, I don't think it's farfetched to assume he could stream that. What's farfetched is his assumption of the public's interest. 10,000 people aren't going to attract an equal spread of viewers; they're going to gravitate to exciting, attractive, successful people such as Asuna. Most of those players will go unwatched.
