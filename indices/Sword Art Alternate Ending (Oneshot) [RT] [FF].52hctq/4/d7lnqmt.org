Interesting. That was a really good oneshot, but outside of that, I think I saw it differently once I realized it was written by EY.

I noticed that some tropes I identified as rational on the first read were closer to "EZ's style", like the "what do you think you know" quote, or the way the main character thinks about the realism of other fiction describing the situation they're in.
