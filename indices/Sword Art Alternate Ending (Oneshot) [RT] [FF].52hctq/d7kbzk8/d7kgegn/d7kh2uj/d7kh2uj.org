Yeah, I agree that it's a fundamental problem with death world MMOs. I haven't seen any story that addresses it to my satisfaction yet, which is why I tend to prefer MMO stories that go a completely different direction (e.g. Log Horizon).

I completely agree that this wouldn't be easily fixable in a one-shot; my rant was more about SAO in general.

I work in the gaming industry and I /want/ to like stories like SAO, but there tend to be too many of these implausible scenarios for my tastes.
