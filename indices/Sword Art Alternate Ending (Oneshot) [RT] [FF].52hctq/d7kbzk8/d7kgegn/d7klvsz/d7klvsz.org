Honestly, when I first watched SAO, I was just cheering the fact that Kayaba designed the microwave emitters in deliberately for a reason, instead of having the "game death = real death" aspect be a /side effect/ like in all previous Death Game setups e.g. the Matrix and a hundred others. Like YES YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT ON PURPOSE. Give the author credit for incremental improvement there.
