All of the issues you bring up are legitimate, but they're part of the main conceit of the story; there's no way to alter them while preserving the premise of Sword Art Online. In other words, this isn't a problem with the oneshot so much as it is a problem with SAO itself, and you can't remove it without making it /not/ SAO. There are probably ways to explain away the fact that the NerveGear was launched (perhaps the microwave transmitters are the same method that allows interfacing with the brain in the first place--they'd have to be pretty powerful to be able to penetrate your skull, and they might also be powerful enough to fry your brain), but there's no way to address that to a satisfactory extent in a oneshot, and it also doesn't change the fact that those would be after-the-fact explanations; in real life something like a VRMMORPG death game simply /wouldn't happen/. You have to suspend disbelief in order to consume any form of fiction; rationalist fiction tends to try and make the required level of suspension as low as possible. That being said, if you're writing /fanfiction/, there are certain things you just have to accept, because if you didn't accept them it wouldn't be recognizably the same universe. (Think mecha anime, for instance--I don't care what rationalizations you present; there's no way that's the optimal shape for fighting machines. Or how about the fact that the Entities from Worm, for all their computational ability, can't figure out a better method to improve themselves than /giving away parts of themselves to other species with way less computational capacity in the hope that something new happens/.)

I suppose the point I'm really trying to make here is that your complaints, while valid, don't really seem to be about the /oneshot/. They're about the universe the oneshot is set /in/. The charitable interpretation of that would be that you're complaining that the oneshot, if it were actually rational, would /fix/ those underlying issues, but my point is that there's a limit to what you can fix while writing fanfiction. HPMoR didn't explain why magic existed, because in a lawful universe, it /wouldn't/; it took the idea of magic existing as a base assumption and ran from there. Worm (which isn't fanfiction, but the same point applies) didn't /start/ from the idea of aliens that wanted to reverse entropy, because if it did, the aliens would never have come to Earth in the first place; instead, it took the premise (people with superpowers) and devised a clever way of justifying that premise (alien space whales)--a premise that doesn't quite hold up under scrutiny, but that readers accept anyway because it's necessary for the main conceit of the story.

I mean, these are problems, yes. Asking someone to fix those problems in fanfiction, especially in a /oneshot/ (of all things) seems like a bit much to ask, though.

*EDIT:* I just saw your reply to [[/u/alexanderwales]], which makes your complaint make a lot more sense in context. Yes, if I take your complaint as a general criticism of the genre, then I completely agree with you.
