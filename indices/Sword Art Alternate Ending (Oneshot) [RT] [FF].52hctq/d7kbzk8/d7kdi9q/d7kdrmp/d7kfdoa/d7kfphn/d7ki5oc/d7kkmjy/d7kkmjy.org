You're absolutely right, the complaints were more about SAO and the death game genre than about the fanfic. The fanfic itself was an improvement over the original, and I should have made it clearer from the outset that my complaints are more about the genre itself.

I appreciate your commentary, though. Thanks for the detailed and thoughtful reply!
