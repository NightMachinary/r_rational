This is the problem with basically all death world MMOs. There's no plausible way that a huge MMO with untested technology A) goes off flawlessly and B) manages to launch with complicated hidden systems that introduce extra functionality.

I don't expect a fanfic author to fix those problems in a one-shot, but it always irks me to no end because I've been on massive software/hardware projects before and seen both the internal problems and the many, many failure states.
