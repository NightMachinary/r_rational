Certainly an improvement over the original SAO's ending, but Kayaba himself still stretches credulity as a character, as does the game itself.

You'd have to have a tremendous number of points of failure for the lead developer of a new type of hardware to "sneak" potential killing devices into a headset that no one finds prior to the game launch.

Even if /somehow/ the hardware managed to make it through QA - extraordinarily unlikely in itself - the moment the first press kits were sent out, someone would crack it open. If the press kits lacked the additional devices, fine - some GameStop employee takes one home pre-launch and cracks it open, finding death devices.

Of course, this is all assuming you could somehow get to that point in the first place. Kayaba appears to be a /game designer/, not a hardware architect. There are certainly people who have both skill sets, but it's extremely unlikely that someone working for a large company would have sufficient time to be heavily involved in both the software and hardware sides of the product.

On the software side, numerous changes would have had to go in prior to launch. Things like disabling the logout function, for example. QA, code reviews from other coders, etc. would be very likely to catch these. It's possible Kayaba could have put them in much earlier with an event script to start them at a certain date, but without testing, he'd have no guarantee those things would work.

And that gets into the game itself - how plausible is it that a new MMO launches on new hardware and doesn't experience server outages or major game-breaking bugs?

Not very likely at all.

Sorry about the rant, I just have a tough time with stories like SAO that ignore the game design process and attribute too much to a single person. In reality, even if the game got to launch with that hardware, someone more familiar with the administration side of the game Kayaba would be removing his GM privileges and disabling the death devices within hours.

Maybe someday I'll write a fanfic about a QA tester who finds some suspicious devices inside his new test hardware.
