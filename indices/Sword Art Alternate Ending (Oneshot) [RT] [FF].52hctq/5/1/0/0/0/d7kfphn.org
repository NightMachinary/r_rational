Sorry, I wasn't clear about this - I mean that I think the microwave devices (or other death devices) would most likely be found and publicized before the device could be distributed to thousands of people.

As for after the game launches, I don't see how Kayaba could detect and punish opening additional devices that aren't even turned on in order to figure out how they work. But post-launch isn't even my main issue; I'm saying I don't think it's very likely that the hardware would make it to market without someone figuring out they have killing devices in them.

That isn't even the least likely part of the story, though. A new MMO having perfectly stable servers? Good luck with that.
