Even if we somehow assume that Kayaba is simultaneously the lead designer, project director, lead hardware designer, and lead programmer for this title, he's /still/ not likely to be the one who is determining how many servers they have to run the game.

Even if somehow they vastly over-purchase for server farms, though, there are going to be other things that can cause server crashes that you're not going to find in beta testing - /especially/ since they made significant gameplay changes between beta and launch.

In a game with raid bosses on every floor with virtually none of them having public testing, you're very likely to have at least one with an ability that crashes the server - or at, a bare minimum, a /client/.

You're also very likely to run into player abilities that don't work as intended and have a good chance of hurting server stability. Like a [[http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Reckoning_Bomb][Reckoning Bomb]], for example. WoW had a long beta period with a vastly larger community than SAO and it still took ages for people to figure that exploit out.

And considering the game is supposed to be running for /years/, there's no chance they tested running the hardware for that long in advance - you're eventually going to get problems like memory leaks in both the servers and the client hardware.

Blizzard - probably the best example of a company in the industry with MMO hardware experience - still got hit by server outages for the launches of Diablo 3 and Warlords of Draenor. Doing something on new hardware would be even more challenging, and doing it with no downtime at all? Implausible, imo.
