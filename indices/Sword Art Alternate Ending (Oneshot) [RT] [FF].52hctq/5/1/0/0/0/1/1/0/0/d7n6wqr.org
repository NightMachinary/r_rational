It might be possible, but I don't find it very likely.

Developers often have little control over when products launch - the production company often mandates a date, pressuring the developer to put out something that hasn't been properly tested.

Even in the best cases, though, with companies that rely on quality as a part of their reputation - like Blizzard, for example - can't test everything. Blizzard has a /colossal/ QA department by industry standards, with dedicated test engineers to assist with automating functions and providing tools to increase their efficiency. They're probably better prepared than anyone in the industry for a clean product launch - and they're still running into launch problems.

As the scale of these games increases, the complexity to test them also increases. QA departments for these large-scale projects have to be constantly improving to keep up.

Modern companies already stress test with bots. Yes, that will be more sophisticated in the future, but it's not going to cover everything - someone needs to write those test suites, and those test suites will never be exhaustive. Highly sophisticated AI could help cover for this, but I don't think we can presume that they have sophisticated test AI without any mention of it in canon.

Beta testers will probably be less useful, rather than more useful, in the future - simply because they won't have the testing tools that internal testers have access to, and the gulf between an individual player and a professional tester with the access to proprietary software, cheats, etc. is going to increase.

Also, SAO itself appeared to have a very small Beta in canon. The # of people stuck in the game itself was small by modern MMO standards (something like 10k, IRRC, which is too small to possibly constitute a profit, but I digress). Only a fraction of those people appeared to have prior experience with the Beta test (which is plot relevant, with Kirito developing the term "Beater", etc.)

Overall? It's not impossible we'll have more stable MMO launches in the future, but I don't think the setting itself of SAO supports that being likely. The gaming industry wasn't a major part of the author's focus. It would absolutely be possible to write a sci fi story with a speculative 22nd Century gaming industry that justifies some of the things in the story, but in my opinion, SAO is not that story.
