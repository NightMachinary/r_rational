I had a similar idea for a possible story in which a person decides to start broadcasting their life 24/7 as a sort of live manifesto in favour of completely revamping the bureaucratic and political systems to make them much more transparent. His argument would be that it is impossible to stop complete worldwide mass surveillance from eventually happening (especially considering how technological advancement will only give individuals increasingly more destructive means for mass killings and terrorism), so human right activists should concentrate their efforts on making the watchers and enforcers more accountable for their actions instead of uselessly trying to stop the phenomenon completely.

This story also reminded me of the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv--V1yc2QDJi6hFNhur3iAsyFpXRtB8w][/Power Corrupts/ series]] by [[https://www.youtube.com/user/DarkMatter2525][Youtube/u/DarkMatter2525.]]
