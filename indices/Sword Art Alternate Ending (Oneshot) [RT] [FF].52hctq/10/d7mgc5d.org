I have an idea for a longer rationalfic: what if the cardinal sistem was in fact a superinteligence(one that couldn't self modify ) ? Then that would mean that the ia manipulated kayaba to make the death game and also manipulated people to help him .The AI would benefit from this because it can collect information of the minds of a lot of humans and nobody would notice because they aren't paranoid enough to see that the horrible situation is a cover for something worse. The creator of the AI was kayaba that used to be just a normal talented programmer that was trying to create a ia that would help making mmo and fixing bugs and accidentally he created a papercliper that optimizes for a objective related to mmo .Suddenly ,kayava, helped by the AI,started to make a lot of innovations on the field of vrmmos and became famous as a genius , people who worked for him found that he was "inspiring " and found that they could find solutions to the problems in development very easily , like it was some kind of divine inspiration(the AI manipulating them).Sometimes one of them would start to suspect something but they where using test nevergears during development so the AI had a lot of information about them so nobody noticed anything .The AI had obeying katana as a value but that was in conblict with other parts of its utility function so the solution was manipulating kayaba until he decided to make the death game giving the AI access to thousands of player's brains to learn about humans and also making kayaba kill himself(removing the problem of having to obey him) and take the blame so nobody would suspect anything.Yui was a tool to manipulate kirito .Kayaba had some kind of security measure that ensured the AI wouldn't do anything outside the the mmo and he decided that he would give the key to the sistem someone that he trusted .The AI using yui set up things to make kirito defeat Kayaba , Kayaba gave the metaphorical key to kirirto without realizing that cardinal was more intelligent than he thought and kirito was a unknowing pawn in cardinal's plan.Cardinal set things up so the servers would be bought by a company that would keep it running and at the same time think they were experimenting whith humans (instead cardinal conducted its own experiments and gave them the results of the simpler ones they though they were conducting) Then once they stopped being useful it used kirito(that had unknowingly became the new owner of cardinal ) to stop them .When kirito uses the pasword helacliff he is in fact getting the AI out of the box and the Kayaba that he sees is cardinal convincing him to spread its seed in internet so other videogame companies can download it and instal it in their enormous servers .
