To everyone complaining about server stability and game balance;

Am I the only one who remembers the Cardinal system?

The system was essentially an advanced dumb AI whose entire function was radiant quest generation and server stability. Can we not hand-wave it away with "The Cardinal System fixed [bug] / resolved [issue]"?

Also, even if the client crashed, it's not impossible that the hardware and software were set to auto-reboot and force last known login. This may have even happened off-screen, but because it wasn't relevant to the story, it was never displayed on-screen.
