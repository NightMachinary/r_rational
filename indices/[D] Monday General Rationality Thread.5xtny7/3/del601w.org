Weekly Monday Update

--------------

Story is still plugging along, and the Pokemon Renegades Engine's feature list is still being worked out. I mentioned this before I think, but the story will be about 20 chapters, with a goal of about 8-10k words per chapter. Of course, this is only a goal, so some will float in the 6k-8k range because there's only so much to do per chapter which covers the progression I'm going for.

The first chapter is being finished up, and I have about four chapters total that have been mostly written up to this point. Once the first three have been finished up, the first ch. will be posted. I'm looking at about a 3 week release schedule per chapter after that point. At this rate, the first chapter will be posted late April to mid may. At a 3 week release schedule, the planned 20 chapters will take approximately 60 weeks to post, or about a year. I'll go ahead and add 50% and say a year and a half lol.

AI discussion. I learned of a programming concept called Goal-Oriented Action Programming.

It's a means for telling your ai what goals they are to accomplish, and then they are to take the action most relevant to that goal.

As we work on Renegades one of the largest hurdles will be a modestly competent ai. I plan on prototyping its behaviors and actions just to wrap my head around it within my own scratch game. One of the things I'm consistently impressed with is how much depth there is to the ai in Dwarf Fortress. Each Dworf in the game has their own back story, their own state of feeling, and things which make them happy/unhappy. This level of depth is something which helps make the story incredibly interesting and dynamic, as each character in the games have their own objectives and whatnot.

As I learn more, I'll post more details on the subject.
