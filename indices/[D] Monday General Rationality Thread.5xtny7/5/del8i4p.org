Hypothetical: If someone wished upon a wish granting device of sufficient literalness, asking for a "youth of everlasting bliss and wonder," what would be some of the psychological ramifications of an immortal child that was locked into being happy all the time? I was thinking that they would normalize into someone who would chase bigger and better emotional rushes of all types, not being satisfied with just being happy and always striving for happier, sadder, or angrier, but I'm open to different interpretations.
