The biggest danger I think would be some sort of nihilism. If they're happy regardless of what they do or what happens to them, they have no incentive to do anything. If the happiness is completely constant and they ignore other feelings, they might just lie down and do absolutely nothing and appear to be in a vegetative state because they see absolutely no need to get up or do anything.

If they can still feel hunger and pain and other stuff on top of their happiness, they would probably go about doing normal stuff like eating and having a job, but would possibly lose ambition to become rich or find love in order to improve their life, since they're already happy. On the other hand, they might be able to succeed at difficult tasks and become important since they would be able to do things like work/study 16 hours every single day without burning out.

If they were sufficiently idealistic they might go about earning lots of money and using it to improve society or using their time to serve in some other way, since they would be freed from the need to look out for their own happiness and could focus on others instead.

Really, it depends on the person's personality and how the endless happiness interacted with or overwrote other emotions.
