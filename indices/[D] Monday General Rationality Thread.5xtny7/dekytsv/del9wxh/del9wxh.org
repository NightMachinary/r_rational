What's your experience with polyamory? How much better would a poly- relationship be for you than a mono- relationship, and how confident are you in that assessment? How confident are you that you'd be able to reach the neighborhood of that "global maximum" (obviously you're incredibly unlikely to ever hit it, given the giant and constantly shifting available state-space) within a "reasonable" amount of time. How much do you value happiness, ultimately (e.g. would you prefer a year of bliss over ten of joy or a hundred of contentment? but more fundamentally, how would you even quantify happiness, in this case?). How healthy are you -- how long do you reckon you have left to live, that you can spend searching for ~global maxima instead of occupying and experiencing some "local" maximum. Does your happiness with a partner vary dramatically as a relationship progresses (e.g. if love is built through [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gaid72fqzNE][the ongoing drama of shared experience]], it might be better to spend less time searching for a better start to a relationship and instead work on improving a "less optimal" start; conversely, if you get a lot more satisfaction out of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_relationship_energy][NRE]] and quickly grow bored, serial monogamy might be better in that, depending on your location, you'd have a much, much larger dating pool).

It might be useful to write up some simple models and vary their underlying assumptions to help build your intuitions regarding relationship stuff (I [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/05/23/modeling-monogamous-commitment/][did that]] in my teens and think it helped clarify my thoughts, though in a monogamous framework, since I didn't think [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/02/23/what-is-love/][polyamory was for me]]).
