Consider the opportunity costs. Poly relationships seem like they'd consume a ton of time and emotional energy.

So, I don't think the choice is, "Extra Partners: Good?"

Instead, it would be better to think, "Extra Partners? Or extra time on hobbies and friendships?"

I can see how people could go for either option there. But it doesn't seem obviously one-sided to me. It would come down to your preferences.
