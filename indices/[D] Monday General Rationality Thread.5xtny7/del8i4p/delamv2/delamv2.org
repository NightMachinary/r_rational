See I'm not sure the hedonic treadmill applies the way you think here. People search out more and more potent stimuli for inducing happiness because old stimuli stops working as well, not because they are no longer able to be satisfied by /mere/ happiness.\\
If anything someone perpetually happy may do next to nothing except to avoid displeasure since any further gains to happiness they could make may not be worth the effort.
