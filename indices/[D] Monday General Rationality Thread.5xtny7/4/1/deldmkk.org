As a member of the "poly 5+ years club" there's one harsh truth about the community: if you are a woman (especially if you are moderately attractive: 6/10 or better), it can be very easy for you to find new poly partners. It can be a lot harder for men for some reason - likely the same reason in general women get bombarded by messages on dating sites and men have to send the messages. So if you're a man, there's a high risk of you getting in a poly relationship and having "only" one partner (that said: you might still prefer the idea of a poly relationship because it's more in line with your personal ethics, rather than because it means you will be able to kiss more people). That said: I have two (male) partners (husband of 9 years, boyfriend of 4 years) and my husband has three (female) partners (me, girlfriend of 4 years, girlfriend of ~6 months) so...

(edit: the above refers to heterosexual relationships only. If you are pursuing same-sex relationships, I don't have any personal experience on that front. The stereotype is that gay males tend to be more non-monogamous than anyone, but anecdotally I've seen more queer women than queer men at the poly meetup I attend, FWIW)

Another risk: if you've never been in a poly relationship before, you might just not be able to do it even if you are all Rational and Know This Is Optimal. Or it might be possible but it'd take you a lot of effort and heartbreak. This is not to be understated: I had a thing with a friend of mine, and he said he was way down with polyamory because it was so Rational, but he /really couldn't handle it/. Like, when we were snuggled, I couldn't mention my now-husband in passing because it weirded him out. I don't know how other poly people operate but during the course of normal "snuggle warm in bed" talk is a perfectly acceptable time to talk about your other partners IMO. But this guy just couldn't handle it at all. So that might be you. (Happy ending: he's married now and very happy).

Another thing that people don't mention: where do you live? I live in a city of ~1.5 million people, and dating is not too bad. I can only imagine what living in say Portland (which has a reputation as a poly mecca) would be like. But for a year we lived in a city of ~300k people. It was pretty much impossible. I had a short term relationship with a guy I met there, but that was only because I was moving away after a year because he didn't want to be poly long term. So if you live in a smaller town, your poly dating pool might be low enough that you're going to have a tough time. (Then again: being poly means long distance relationships are a lot better in many ways, so that could be something to pursue).

Honest advice? If you don't feel any /intense, innate/ draw to polyamory, I'd date the best available person you had available regardless of their mono/poly status and then branch out from there.

If I were in that situation? After 5 years, polyamory is kind of non-negotiable for me since I don't feel like I could close that part of myself off anymore.
