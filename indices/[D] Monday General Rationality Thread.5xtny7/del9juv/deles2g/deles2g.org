It would have to be a lot of money, which probably isn't that big of a deal for them.

My life has very high (though non-infinite) value to me, but the important feature here is that I can use the money they pay me to buy /more life/, either through directly getting more time (better health, more safety, etc.) or getting rid of the useless parts like commuting and replacing them with good parts, like socializing or reading.

So yes, even if you ignore the altruistic motivation of improving the world (which you shouldn't do, but it is purely positive and harder to calculate), I would still go into the machine.
