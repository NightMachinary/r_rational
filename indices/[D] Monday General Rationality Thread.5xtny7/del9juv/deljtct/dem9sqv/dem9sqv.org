The cost-benefit analysis would have to be ridiculous for me to even consider putting them into a death machine. For the simple fact that in any sort of scenario that could at all be applied to real life me would necessitate that my entire world-view is completely invalidated at least once. At which point I wouldn't trust my loved ones to a death machine that could kill them if my entire world-view gets invalidated for the second time.

Basically, it would come down to the same cost-benefit analysis you would do in any sort of scenario in which you risk loved one's lives for some sort of benefit or reward. At which point I value my loved ones at about the same level as I value my own life. So if someone could convince me that risking my own life is worth it, then I would consider asking loved ones to do it, depending on individual capability etc. With a bias towards preferring me to personal undertake the risk because of my monkey brain.
