Ok so here's another question, since so many people intuitively feel that nobody could ever actually put a loved on in the previously described death machine.\\
*Would you be /willing/ to put a loved one in the death machine? And do you think you could actually /do/ it?*

Of course as I said in another comment you aren't locking them in some machine for the rest of their lives, just occasionally putting them in it. Also note that at least based on anecdotal evidence in the comments it shouldn't be impossible to find people willing to get in (though they need to be a loved one which may or may not make it harder to find people willing to do that).\\
Also also note that you are like the person in my original comment, in that you are assumed to already be extraordinarily rich and powerful, due to weaker uses of your probability manipulation.
