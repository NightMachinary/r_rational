You don't need to be in the death machine 24/7 just whenever they're using it to manipulate world events. It doesn't need to be small either, it could be a fairly comfy bunker filled with a million different death machines behind the walls.

The inconvenient specifics of the machine isn't supposed to be the point here, it's whether you would be willing to get in a death machine in a scenario like this period.
