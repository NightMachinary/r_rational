Someone you trust a great deal who had previously demonstrated blatantly supernatural abilities, including significant probability manipulation gives you a proposition:

Their abilities will guarantee with absolute certainty that none of their loved one's will die (let's assume you count as one in this scenario), but doesn't protect them from death to anywhere near the same extent. They've built a extremely reliable fail-deadly death machine in order to exploit this, designed such that it won't deactivate unless a certain event takes place. This will thus allow them to leverage this loved-one-protection ability into probability manipulation vastly more impressive than what they could achieve before (they are already the richest most influential person on the planet and the world /has/ been seemingly getting better somewhat faster than it was previously), with the limiting factor being the likelihood of the machine failing in a way that spares the person inside it.

Given the person will use the machine's power to significantly improve the world, and will also pay you quite well for your participation are you willing to get in the death machine?
