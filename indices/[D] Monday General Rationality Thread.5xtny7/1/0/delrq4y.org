It might have been just a coincidence.

Friends will almost unanimously give you the "make a change" advice. For the most part, there is one main reason that people ask their friends for advice: to have them confirm their already decided course of action. Your friends know this (instinctively, at least), and will support your already decided course of action. Doing the opposite loses friend points, and serves no real purpose (except in extreme situations).

If staying at your job had been the better decision, your friends would have been worse at optimizing your life.
