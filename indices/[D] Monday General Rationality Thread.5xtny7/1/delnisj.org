Something weird: My friends are better at optimizing my life than I am.

Lately, I've had to make some moderately big life choices. I was unhappy in a job, and having a hard time deciding if I should change.

I asked my friends. They were way less conflicted. "Nope. You're unhappy. Leave." I ended up leaving. And they were right.

I don't think that I'm especially bad at planning things, either. Instead, there seems to be a weird effect where being too close to a decision throws off people's judgement.

Friends have just enough distance to give the obvious-seeming advice that's hard to take when you're the one making a decision.

Have other people noticed this effect? If so, what's going on? And can we exploit it?

I'm starting to suspect that there'd be a ton of benefit in having something like a "life coaching circle." It would be like a writing-critique group, except for career and personal advice.
