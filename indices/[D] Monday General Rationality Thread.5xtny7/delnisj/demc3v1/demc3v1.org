  Have other people noticed this effect? If so, what's going on? And can we exploit it?

I sometimes hangout on [[/r/relationships][r/relationships]], and I've definitely seen something like this. Most frequently people asking "Am I overreacting?" after explaining how they're fed up with their boyfriend insulting them / making them doubt their sanity / consistently stealing their money, etc.

It's probably about perspective.
