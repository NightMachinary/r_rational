[[https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/][Rationality from AI to Zombies]] is sort of the go-to. It covers the nature of semantics, arguments, optimization, consciousness, AI, among other things. Probably fits what you're looking for, and I'd be happy to chat more about it if you'd like.

Aside from that, there are a bunch of other [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences][Sequences of articles on LessWrong]] that focus on interesting ideas.

There's also [[http://conceptually.org/][Conceptually]] which sends you some rationality-oriented brain food every week.

Two blogs that I enjoy are: [[http://mindingourway.com/guilt/][Minding our Way]] by Nate Soares, on how to source motivation and understand ourselves. [[http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/][Compass Rose]] by Benjamin Hoffman that's about EA / rationality things.

If for some reason you really want to learn about the planning fallacy and three techniques to counter it, I wrote [[https://medium.com/@owenshen/planning-101-techniques-and-research-9bfff1a01abd#.wt7bplfv0][this primer]] which seemed to be quite well-received a little while back.

There's probably more things, and I'd be happy to give more things if you'd like (via PM or here.)
