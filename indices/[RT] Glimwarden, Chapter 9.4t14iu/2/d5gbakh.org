I am very, very surprised that no one in all of these threads has mentioned The Painted Man by Peter Brett (also titled The Warded Man). I get /serious/ rhyming vibes between these two stories, which share many strengths in common.

I just read all nine chapters for the first time and have some thoughts on writing style, but I don't know if you're actually interested in them? i.e. they're things I think could be improved, but arguably the "improvements" would be a lateral move and not an actual increase in quality, depending on what sort of feel you're going for. I jotted down a few from earlier chapters; two are below (plus a third that was just awesome) to give you a sense of whether this is the sort of critique you'd like to hear more of.

  He decided that he wasn't really hungry, only nervous and trying to delay himself from doing something he'd already committed to.

I think this moment would be better expanded (shown instead of told), so that we hear Sander's “voice” reaching that conclusion, rather than the narrator's.

  There was a disorder here, but it was an ordered disorder, chaos constrained by complex rules too deep for any person to understand, try as they might. It was explicable in theory, not in practice, and so held a deeper allure than what passed for beauty back in town.

There's a thing going on here where the narrator is ... dignifying? ... the character's thought, I think---where Sander's thoughts are this complex and interesting, but he doesn't quiiite think them in these specific words so much as through feelings and impressions and simple grammar. I'd love for that to be highlighted, somehow? To point out that Sander doesn't use these words, but his thoughts are nevertheless this nuanced (because if he does use these words, he becomes an unrealistically high falutin' character, but if he doesn't, then he's just perceptive and the narrator's doing us a Real Service).

  It wasn't even doing that much to pretend to be.

Awesome.
