Thanks for the comment. I do find it useful. I'm still trying to find the balance on conveying characters' thoughts; italics are literal and everything else is paraphrased. I'm also struggling a bit with how much to leave unsaid. I like to have motivations and thought processes be implicit, but then sometimes people don't understand or pick up on what I was trying to convey, so it's hard to know whether that was a failure of showing or a case where telling was actually appropriate.

Writing is hard.
