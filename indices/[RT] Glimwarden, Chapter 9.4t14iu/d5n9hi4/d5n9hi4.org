You're portraying Sander's voice very distinctly here:

"“Why are you here?” asked Sander."

-super blunt, not overly concerned with social niceties.

But I fear you went a little over the top with the vulnerability Sander is displaying when he talks about equations to Philip. He is revealing what amounts to part of his life story to Philip-- should be just do so that easily?

I'm a bit confused here:

"But that wasn't quite the right way to put it, because the increase in bind was now a part of him, forever. At least, until the next time he ran ahead of his recharge rate."

Does this mean that as you get more hearts, you get permanently stronger, but you still need to fill up on a certain # of hearts?

I'm also really confused by how his teleportation works, but I'm assuming we'll get a little more explanation later.

Overall, I like the Philip and Sander interaction, though I think Sander is a little over the top in his vulnerability in this chapter.
