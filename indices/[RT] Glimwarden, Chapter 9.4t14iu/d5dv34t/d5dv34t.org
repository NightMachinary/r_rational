... did... what... why... DID YOU JUST RISK FALLING TO YOUR DEATH JUST TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE TOWN'S SURROUNDINGS?

- I like that Sander's thought process waking up is "Hey, what did I miss while I was unconscious?" Then, "Wait, I was unconscious?"

- I wonder what Philip thought of Sander's digression about people being a bunch of stories and narratives that disappear when both you and the people who knew you die.

- "Experimentation couldn't hurt." It totally can! Stop thinking that way!

- Wow... Sander sounds a lot less badass when your realize how much effort the Glimwardens had to make to keep him alive. Though I wouldn't say his contribution to the fight was actually negative, since he saved Philip's live, therefore preserving one of the town's protagonists, but still.

- One the one hand, it's kind of heartwarming to see Sander apologize to his dad and promises to be a coward next time... but on the other hand, the way /The Reckoning/ put it, an idiot cannot actually promise to not be an idiot anymore. And Sander does risk his life pointlessly in the next hour.

- I feel like Sander is slowly getting a better understanding of Philip, and noticing how socially optimized he is. That might be me projecting, though.

- The engineer is funny "Yeah, so your father and Linwell just called me an idiot. Well, not literally, but it's the thought that counts". I hope we'll get to see more of him.

- Okay, so the logistics make some sense, but it seems like a bit of a failure from Light's Hollow that no one has seriously considered non-glimwarden defenses before. Even if bullets are too expensive for a minigun, you can have single-shot rifles, or even bows, crossbows, ballistae and other long-range defenses, that can double as apparatus for safe-ish hunting. Also, Sander should not have been the first person trying to figure out a way to mine sulfur.

- I like how Philip implies that the only reason he is letting Sander in on the secret is that he expects it will probably be out anyway before Sander inevitably says something he shouldn't. Kind of a Prisoner's Dilemma defection, though.

- Falling with style really isn't something Sander should have improvised. At the very least, he should have double-checked his equation on paper, asked Meryl how high a fall someone with his bind could take without injury, and probably do a test run at a lesser height. And then he wonders why Philip isn't impressed with him.

- The whole thing might have looked pretty weird to Philip, by the way. You have a guy who disappears, reappear in the sky, falls increasingly fast towards the ground, and when you think he's going to impact the ground, blinks out twice and falls safely.
