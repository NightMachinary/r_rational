You wonder what Phillip was thinking as Sander talked about people being amalgamations of stories, and I do too, but what really amuses me is thinking of what he thought when Sander was disappearing up, then falling to his death. Probably something like:

/Where is he now? Is he going to reappear sometime soon? I still don't see him... oh, maybe he went up. Yes, there he is. He's falling rather fast. Did he mean to do that? Should I try to catch him? No, it would just kill me too, or seriously maim me, and he'd probably die anyway. I wonder what I'll say if he dies. "There was no reasoning with him" works, but I might still be blamed by his father. Maybe I should step back in case he splatters.../
