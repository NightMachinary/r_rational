  Also, Sander should not have been the first person trying to figure out a way to mine sulfur.

For what it's worth, what Sander describes here is (part of) the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasch_process][Frasch process]]. Prior to that, the major source of sulfur was from from Sicily, where it was mined in mostly terrible conditions. The history of that method of sulfur extraction is basically:

- 1867: Sulfur deposits are discovered in Louisiana during a survey of the state's oil and mineral wealth.
- 1870: A company is formed to lease the rights to mine sulfur.
- Through the 70s and 80s, people try to dig shafts to get at the sulfur, all of which fail due to the hazardous terrain.
- 1890: One last attempt at digging a shaft results in the deaths of five men. Frasch comes along and declares that he's got this new method of sulfur extraction, which he'll share for a fifty-fifty split. The American Sulphur Company agrees.
- 1894: After four years of working out the kinks, Frasch finally gets his process working and the sulfur starts flowing.
- 1903: The process becomes economical due to an influx of oil to the region.

In the real world, it took about twenty years of people trying to mine the sulfur before a master of chemical and industrial engineering came along to innovate things (more, if we consider that other sulfur deposits which had been mined for centuries also benefited from the process).

(In the modern day, most sulfur comes from refinement of petroleum byproducts.)
