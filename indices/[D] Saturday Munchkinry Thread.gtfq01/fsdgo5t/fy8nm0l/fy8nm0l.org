When the first astronauts go to Mars, I would befriend all of them before they go, and then set up a system in which different insults about me code to different information, say:

Freev is a dick - > we have a CO sequestrator failureQ

Freev is a moron -> we found trace of surface water

​

Freev is a motherfucker -. team member injured

Freev is a goddamn motherfucker -> team member decased

​

etc.

Then I would say my "psychic" information to NASA, and also win the Randi Award.
