So unless you can control which portions of your body interact, you wouldn't be able to walk through walls.

But assuming you could... then you can walk through walls, open safes. Hm, you'd probably be both deaf and blind in neutrino form without expending "serious" levels of effort.

Given the neutrino flux on earth is about 10^{11} per m^{2,} you're looking at ~300,000 years to recharge, you'd want to treat this as a non-renewable resource.

You could probably leap kilometers at a time with your much lower mass and lack of air resistance. That would probably be fun. Do your clothes come with you? Or small items? You could do shrapnel removal from people without surgery if so.
