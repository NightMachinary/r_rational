The stockmarket is bad with yes/no questions. You know if something is going to go up or down, but you don't know by how much and if you want to get full information on a single stock it will take multiple questions. On the other hand win/lose bets with a fixed rate of return (eg. sports matches) are much better.

Bets on things that have a 50-50% chance and return ~double your money if you win should enable you to get a return of 1024 times your initial capital. Even a more realistic return of 1.95 still ends up with you having 794 times your initial investment.

Even if you start with no savings if you properly leverage your assets and take on large amounts of otherwise crippling debt beforehand you should be able to gather a significant amount of money, which when multiplied by a thousand becomes a massive amount which will significantly change your quality of life.

Is it as spiritually or emotionally fulfilling as unlocking the mysteries of the universe? No.

Is the fact that you and your kids won't ever have to worry about being working for "the man" for 50 years of your life or living in poverty or losing your house because you get sick and can't work (hello fellow Americans) worth it? Billions of people worldwide would probably say yes.
