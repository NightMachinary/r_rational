  Given the neutrino flux on earth is about 1011 per m2, you're looking at ~300,000 years to recharge, you'd want to treat this as a non-renewable resource.

This is an excellent observation, and something that I was kind of worried about.

What would be a good recharge rate, do you think? One-tenth the maximum rate at which neutrinos are expended from the pool? The Electron character's electron pool-filling rate is limited by the rate at which electrons are made available, and the Graviton character's pool-filling is limited to the amount of gravitons they encounter naturally. Perhaps Neutrino gets a multiplier to the background rate?
