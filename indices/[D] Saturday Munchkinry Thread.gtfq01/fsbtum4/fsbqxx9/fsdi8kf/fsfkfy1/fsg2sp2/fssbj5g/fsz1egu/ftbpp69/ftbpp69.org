With Graviton and Electron, the limits on pool usage are hard limits, with a warning sensation as the power-wielder approaches that limit but no barrier to approaching the limit. Graviton's power's pool size, if overflowed, causes a rather traumatic gravitational catastrophe.

Electron's power is limited by the duration that Electron holds electrons in the pool.

I wanted Neutrino's power to be analogously based with something regarding the pool, and I do like how your daily recharge idea gets around the neutron flux problem, but that seems kind of limiting. Graviton can dump their pool by touching something. Electron can refill their pool by touching something. Neutrino ... waits 24h? It doesn't fit the pattern.
