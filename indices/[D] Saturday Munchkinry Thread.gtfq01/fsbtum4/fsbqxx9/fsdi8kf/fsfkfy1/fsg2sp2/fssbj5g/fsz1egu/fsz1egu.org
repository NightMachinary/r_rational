Honestly I think once you get away from some natural constant you might as well use some story based reasoning that sounds good.

Instead of saying the neutrinos get destroyed, maybe introduce a tiredness or contamination or entropy mechanic. "You've used up 100% of the pool, it takes 24 hours to reorganize the neutrinos from their diffuse state..." or if you want it to fail at a properly intense moment go with "each 10% of the pool used makes it twice as mentally hard to use the power", maybe.
