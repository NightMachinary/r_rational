Now: *Neutrino*

You have the ability to shift into a form entirely made out of neutrinos.

You can control how weakly or strongly your neutrino body interacts with the ambient world. With a minimum level of effort, your neutrino body interacts with the world enough to allow you to push off against hard surfaces. However, this level of interaction means that you become somewhat visible, much like a neutrino in a neutrino detector emits a flash of light. Except you're not a single neutrino: you're on the order of 7^{27} neutrinos (by some estimates, that's how many atoms are in the human body).

When you perform these sorts of interactions, you lose the interacting neutrinos. These lost neutrinos are deducted from your power's pool. When you run out of neutrinos in the pool, you revert to the non-neutrino form. Converting to the neutrino form takes one body-atom-count of neutrinos.

The number of neutrinos in your pool is 10 times the number of atoms in your body. The pool replenishes at the rate that naturally-occurring neutrinos intersect your body. While you choose to absorb neutrinos, you cast a neutrino shadow in all directions.
