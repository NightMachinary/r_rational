Assuming that I'm not promptly deafened by people saying negative things about categories that include me (such as the ever-popular "all other drivers are idiots"), and assuming that I can sleep through it should it happen at night, then there are a number of things I can do.

- I know what are the negative things that are /most often/ said about me; I can try to fix those shortcomings.
- I have a one-way, untraceable means of communication that requires no equipment on the other person's end, merely that the message be phrased in a way derogratory to myself. I can probably exploit this somehow...
