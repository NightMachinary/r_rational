"Whenever someone says something negative about you, you are able to hear it regardless of distance, volume or language. How would you exploit this?" Do they have to use my name? If so, is it any time someone says something negative about <My Name> whether it's actually about me or not? If so, change my name to different things to learn popular opinions about the thing. Offer services for a hefty price doing this.

If not, and it's just anytime someone says something negative that happens to be about me (no name needed) then probably high-stakes competitive gambling where the outcome is know to an audience but not the players. I should be able to hear things like "his thinks he'll win with 3 aces, but Gamblin' Joe's royal flush is going to give him a nasty surprise".

Also you say I can hear it regardless of language, or do you mean I can understand it regardless of language? Because there's some good exploits right there.
