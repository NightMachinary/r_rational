Become an inspector, in a small enough domain that your targets will know you as a person rather than a faceless bureaucracy. Some people will talk negatively about you in the context of trying to hide their illegal activities from you.

(Might also work for a spy as long as their cover job is sufficiently inspector-like. That seems harder to set up and less likely to pay off; but a success could be much more valuable.)

Become the face of an organisation or product. You will have a finger on the pulse of public opinion / customer satisfaction and advance warning of enemies / competitors. Drawback: you will never get a single moment of quiet.
