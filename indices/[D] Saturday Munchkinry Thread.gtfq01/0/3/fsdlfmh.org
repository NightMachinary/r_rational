The easy money-making question is whether a certain volatile stock will go up or down. Though this is proportional to how much money you already have. And also I don't know if there are stocks that we know are /guaranteed/ to either go /far/ up or /far/ down; if there aren't, you may need multiple questions to ensure a good return.
