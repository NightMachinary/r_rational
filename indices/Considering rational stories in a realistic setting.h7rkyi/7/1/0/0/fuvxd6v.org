I researched hundreds of sruvival and wilderness death cases, and there seem to be a common theme: you cannot half-ass survival, not for longer than a week or two at best.

Most people who were lost in wilderness and were found dead did not die from something sudden and dramatic like an animal attack, acute poisoning or fall, but rather from all kinds of problems piling up. They made great effort to save themselves, and utilised the best knowledge they had, and it was not enough. Days upon days of (almost) getting enough water. Managing to create fire only every once in a while. Weeks of (almost) enough food. Nearly good enough shelter, that almost protects from exposure. Thousands of tiny scrapes, bruises and insect bites that seem innocuous, but never heal properly. Repeated cases of mild diarrhoea from contaminated water and improper food.

Because of that, a longer rationalist survival story would either require the protagonist to be a Prim-Tech Mary Sue, or extremely lucky, or (the route I took) a lucky combination of protagonists each of whom have some kind of useful skill, but each one of them would be dead without the others.
