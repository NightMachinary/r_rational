Im in the middle of writing one, and boy, aint that difficult ;)

The main issue is, the more research and knowledge I cram in, the more narrow is the point of balance between "the protagonist will /definitely/ not survive" and "the protagonist becomes a Primitive Technology God".

Survival techniques and the primitive tech behind them are very ON/OFF. You either get things wrong and die, or you get them so right it removes a problem permanently from the writer's repertoire.
