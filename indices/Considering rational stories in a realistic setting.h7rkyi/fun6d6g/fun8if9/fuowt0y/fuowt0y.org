  People in control like to stay in control, and sometimes that means squashing rational, capable threats to the status quo.

By saying people I think you do a disservice. A tendency to stay in control is naturally promoted versus a tendency to lose control or be overthrown. It's a systemic issue that the structure that maintains itself will rise above the structure that replaces itself. It's not like there is an evil cabal running the FDA or avoiding solution to world hunger because they want to stay on top. It's because all of the actions of millions of people contribute collectively to that kind of situation.

Though for sure there are some rich people who like classism and poverty existing.
