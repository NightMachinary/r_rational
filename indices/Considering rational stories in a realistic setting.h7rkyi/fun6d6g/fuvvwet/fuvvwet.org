I could not agree more. Im saddened for all the potential wasted when amateur rationalists write fanfic rather than original fiction from scratch, on the mistaken idea that it would be easier.

WIth the possible exceptions of HPMOR and ABSoW, which are written by experienced professionals, the rest of the rational fanfics fall far below ration OC, in writing quality and rationality, due to the constraints of the original medium.
