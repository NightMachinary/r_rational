  To explore the character and their circumstances but NOT seek to optimize their outcomes is just uninteresting, to me. Stories with characters that don't change for the better after enough opportunities... I just stop caring about them.

I think I'm sort of the same way in my own writing, to a point. I usually try to find ways for my protagonists to learn and grow, so they aren't making the same mistakes over and over. I do like a happy ending, even if it's bittersweet.

However, there does need to be something said for the fact that change isn't easy. It's not as simple as saying "This isn't rational, let me try something else" and then immediately making the change and sticking with it. People can also work really hard to change and only make partial progress. (Not saying your characters are like this, just saying I've seen some writers fail to take this into account.)

Growth doesn't always seem to be linear, either. Sometimes we grow, sometimes we fall back. People can change in ways we don't expect. I like to write this process as faithfully as I can because I find it interesting, and I feel like it makes for great fiction. Other writers might prefer to put their characters on a self-improvement trajectory and not worry too much about exploring the moments.

What I love to see in slice of life stories is people helping each other, because in the end nobody lives in a vacuum. Self-improvement is often a collaborative effort. Plus it's heartwarming and sweet to see broken people find healing in each other. :) I suppose it's not exactly rational, but it's beautiful.

I like that you mentioned humility, since that's a big part of what it takes to be a well-adjusted person. So I suppose I might have misinterpreted your version of "rational character." It's not just about rational intelligence, but maybe right thinking?

By the way, I don't think I've ever read your slice of life stories. Are they posted anywhere on the sub? I'd be curious to take a look if you want to share.
