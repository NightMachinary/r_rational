Ha ha, I want to write a response to this but I kind of already did. :) Sorry if anything's repeated.

Writing a character centered story does not mean "how could this have been done better?" but "how can I relate their story faithfully?" Humans are messy and never as rational as a computer system. We have to explore them in their own environment in order to understand them. (And yes, to consider how to avoid their mistakes.)

Take Elon Musk for example. He's probably as rational of a subject as you're going to find. He still has crippling issues with his personal life because of a lack of empathy and narcissistic tendencies. If you took those out of him he wouldn't be Elon, he'd be a computer with Elon's face on it. He'll need probably some kind of therapy to be a normal functioning human, not more rationality. But writing a character like Elon might help you understand his perspective or be a wake up call to someone with those flaws.

I agree with the idea of keeping the scope of a story small. Not every problem a character faces must have world ending consequences if they fail. It simply must be world ending for the character. They have to have stakes in it that motivate them to act.

If you ever do write a romantic slice-of-life rational fiction, I'd recommend those two guidelines. 1) Focus on exploration, not optimization 2) keep the problem local but meaningful to the main character
