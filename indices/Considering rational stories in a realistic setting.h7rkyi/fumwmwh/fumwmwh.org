I'd read a story like this too. One thing that comes to mind occasionally is similar to what you noted: "what would a rational-fic of Elon Musk's life be like?" He certainly wouldn't be calling strangers pedophiles on twitter, so one of his challenges might be struggling with the part of him that wants to use drugs and rant online, maybe solved by setting up some system to ensure he doesn't say anything damaging, like a delayed tweet that trusted friends can vet.

The same way you can read a story and think "This could be written better," you can look at a person's life and think "They could have acted better." With the benefits of an outside view, hindsight, and a different (maybe not necessarily better, but sometimes) set of biases, the pitfalls people walk into are often very easy to spot. This creates opportunities for more "rational" contemporary stories.

It can also help to keep the scope of a rational contemporary story small. The Martian does this, even if it dips into Sci-Fi a bit to do so. So does Hatchet, without the sci-fi. If you want it to be higher stakes, a short story with Stanislav Petrov as the main character might be interesting to read, even if it risks misrepresenting his character or actual thought process, in which case just use it as inspiration for a similar circumstance.

I would probably write slice-of-life romantic rational fiction if I wasn't already committed to other projects, though I would struggle not to include some fantastic element. I just enjoy speculative fiction too much not to include it. But small scale stories can benefit a lot from rational characters showing the hard work of solving problems faced in modern settings.
