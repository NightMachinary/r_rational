Honestly, I think the real world is sci-fi enough that you can go off the rails a little and still have it feel grounded. We've had, IRL, robots designed to scare off homeless people. We have a hole in Russia so deep and so wide that it affects the latent air pressure and sucks helicopters out of the sky. We've had people biohack themselves on livestreams. I write a lot of sci-fi, but most of it's just taking the scariest things from real life and pushing them a little. My last major villain was based on Peter Thiel, and the rumors of him (again, rumors about a real person) trying to buy up the blood of teenagers to extend his own life. Another villain was based on Joel Osteen. Currently, the insane power that police unions have IRL is what has my sci-fi wheels turning.

You can have your character that's a wizard or a cyberpunk hacker or a mutant also have to deal with anxiety, and capitalism, and police brutality, and the way the media manipulates the public and all those other real world problems. You can still tell a very relatable story where a protagonist (a rational one, with powers) still struggles and even fails against the modern systems in place, simply because those systems are so ubiquitous, so vast, and entrenched so deep that just throwing a fireball at a dictator or whatever won't solve anything. You can engage people with over the top car chases and explosions AND sociopolitical concepts relevant to our times, especially if you assume the politicians/capitalists/investors/whoever else that's really pulling the strings are ALSO in a prime position to try and access, exploit, or duplicate whatever your protagonist's power source or special skill is.

You're the best hacker in the world? There are people invested in the status quo that can put the second, third, and fourth best hackers in the world on the same payroll against you.

Could a wizard solve all our real world problems? Sure. Will the FBI, in a world that has magic, kick your door in when they find out you know one whole spell (which you probably found on the deep web), enforcing a system that keeps the poor and underprivileged from ever reaching OP wizard status (while the wealthy are secretly doing dark rituals on their private islands)? I mean, that's how /I'm/ writing it. Sci-fi and fantasy can still be very heavily, very strongly intertangled with the real world and its real problems.
