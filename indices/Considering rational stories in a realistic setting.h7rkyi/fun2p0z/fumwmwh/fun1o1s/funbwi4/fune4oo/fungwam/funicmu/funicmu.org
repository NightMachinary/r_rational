The difference between our ability to recognize rationality in Elon and our ability to recognize rationality in others might be one of publicity collecting around conditioned social bias towards the definition of success.

If you define success as "looks up to see the stars every night, lives a minimal ecological.impact life, eats good home cooked barbecue, has a close family they love, and plenty of free time while still doing something meaningful" then a bartender in Arizona or Uluru might be more successful than Elon.
