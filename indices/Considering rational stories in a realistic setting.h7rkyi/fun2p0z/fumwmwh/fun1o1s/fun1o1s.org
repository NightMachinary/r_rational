Yes, I think the prevalence of sci-fi and fantasy here is likely due to highly correlated inclinations based on personality. People who like rational fiction also just really like fantasy and sci-fi, and are probably also disproportionately programmers, engineers, and scientists. This kind of correlation matters even if it doesn't apply for you, as if you want to write for this community it would make sense to take into account the preferences of others. People here, whatever they are (INTJs? high in trait openness?) seem highly tolerant of counterfactuals and don't care that much about the loss of cachet that comes with writing sci-fi and fantasy genre fiction, though that stigma has lessened a lot over the past decade anyway. So there's a further explanation for a lack of fiction set in a realistic setting here.

Origin of Species is very slice of life, and the level of scope you address could be managed in a purely contemporary setting. You also seem more interested in organizational dynamics and coordination. So you're sort of the exception for this thread...
