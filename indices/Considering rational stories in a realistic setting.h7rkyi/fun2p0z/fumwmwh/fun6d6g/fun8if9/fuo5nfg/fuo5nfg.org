  In the real world you are probably spending most of your time working around issues with current tools because that's what you're paid to do.

Not to mention spending most of your non-work time on all the things that suck up hours day to day. Commuting. Maintaining all the things you own. Interpersonal relationships.

Someone who wants to actually achieve something either needs to have the bills paid with no day job, or be able to do their normal job AND the thing they want to achieve at the same time, or be the kind of person who robotically squeezes every minute from every day (and never has any setbacks like getting sick or injured or having something damaged or getting into family arguments or finding out they researched the wrong thing or a million other things). Or have some kind of setting hack which literally gives them more time (the time-turners in HPMOR qualify, as do things like Apparition to cut travel time and magic in general to get some complex thing achieved in minutes instead of years).
