I disagree with this part; more adult versions of the things we enjoyed as kids have been around forever (see: Sonic the Hedgehog OCs, the more serious Power Ranger comics and fanvideos, anything that darkly satirizes childrens' shows like Don't Hug Me I'm Scared or Happy Tree Friends) and are, I think, a natural byproduct of nostalgia, hindsight, and everybody becoming writers. Making more rational versions of those stories is just another way of "aging them up."

That said, I completely agree with the rest of your point. In real life, a perfectly rational human being--even a very gifted one--can still be screwed over or restrained entirely by the whims of fate and the nature of society. You could invent a cure for cancer, but you still have to get it past the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry. You could solve world hunger, but you know someone with authority and capital isn't going to make it easy to implement. Most wish fulfillment stories (if not all of them) are about making major changes, and the world as we know it by and large does not like change. People in control like to stay in control, and sometimes that means squashing rational, capable threats to the status quo.
