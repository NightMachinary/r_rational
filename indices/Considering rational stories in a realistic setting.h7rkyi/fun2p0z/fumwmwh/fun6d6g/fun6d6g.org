It's an unfortunate second artist effect that a huge proportion of “rational” fiction consists of fanfic about children's entertainment franchises.

This is largely down to mindless imitation of HPMOR, but it's also because it's much easier to write about smart, “rational” characters in a dumb fantasy setting aimed at kids.

If you want to write a rational character living in the real world, you need to do a lot of research and have some life experience, which raises the bar to entry a lot.

In the real world, you can be perfectly rational, and even really really good at programming, but it doesn't mean you're going to invent a whole new programming paradigm. In the real world you are probably spending most of your time working around issues with current tools because that's what you're paid to do. Even if you invent a whole new paradigm in your spare time, you may not have the social capital to get other people to buy into it. Say you do a PhD exploring and describing the new paradigm - best case scenario is that it's ignored for 20 years and then someone commercialises it without involving you or crediting you at all.

This doesn't mean that rational fiction set in the real world isn't possible, it's just that simplistic wish-fulfilment tropes about exponential growth are hard to make plausible in the real world. The microgenre discussed on this sub is a tiny and stunted offshoot of what truly rational would be like
