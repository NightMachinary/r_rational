  Everything changes when they find an amazing new way to do programming, a whole new programming paradigm. Let's call it Fringle Oriented Programming. Holy jumping algorithms, they can do certain kinds of computation 30% faster, and certain new thorny areas are now tractable.

  OK, now we've already hit our head on a major story problem. To anyone who knows programming, this is going to read as pretty stupid. Really, this protagonist of yours is smarter than Donald Knuth?

There's an easy way around this: set your story in a realistic world where Donald Knuth, Margaret Hamilton, Linus Torvalds, etc. never existed, and one or more of OOP, formal complexity analysis, software testing, open source or other CS breakthroughs just never happened. Then you get to indulge a bit of speculative writing about what life looks like in 2020 with modern hardware running drastically less efficient algorithms, and all the work of defining your main character(s')'s "superpower" is already done.
