I've seen this tradition in a lot of libertarian writings, a lot of it is often done badly (looking at you Ayn Rand). I think a lot of the more realistic ones are focused around real fields of study (for example the short stories on the gnu website, like [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html][this one]]).

Honestly this is a super interesting genre to me that I only ever see communicated well in art. I can't actually think of a textual story that portrays this well. A modern society, maybe with a few "sci-fi" technologies here and there (usually around renewable tech or things like routed physical infrastructure; like switched vacuum tube systems, more monorails and trains, and so on) that we could have today if we went slightly different directions.

For examples of what I mean I would point to the background world building of (off the top of my head): Hilda, B the Beginning, Big hero 6. Each of which is a sort of representative example of common places to find this (e.g. anime and children animated movies; I would count Zootopia, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, A Certain Scientific Railgun, as well for example). The Culture series actually kinda does this by cheating: very little of the story is actually set in The Culture properly, utopia is boring.

I have no idea how to write that. What I really want to make is a game set in it so someone could explore it as a pedagogical utopian society as a system.
