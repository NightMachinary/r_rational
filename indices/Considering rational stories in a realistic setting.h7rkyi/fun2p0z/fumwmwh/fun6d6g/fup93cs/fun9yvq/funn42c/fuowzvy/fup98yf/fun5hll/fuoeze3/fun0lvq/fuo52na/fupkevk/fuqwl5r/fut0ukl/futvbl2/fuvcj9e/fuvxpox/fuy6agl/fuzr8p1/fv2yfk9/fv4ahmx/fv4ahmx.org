I cannot say I understand the entirety of your and Yudkowsky's argument, but I feel like it kinda veers into s subtle strawman.

The point of Atlas Shrugged (which I think is reflected in reality to a degree) is that winning within the system is not really a win, neither ethically or logically. Its like trying to break out of prison by being promoted to one of the Guards or maybe a Warden, rather than simply digging a tunnel to escape.

The "villains" in AS derived their system from faulty ideology, but otherwise acted rationally within it, and they could have been promoted to "real rationalists" the way we want them. Similarly, the heroes could be promoted to full rationalists and still wish to win by abandoning the system.

Probably the easiest way to make AS more realistic is simply to update it to modern times, because the socio-economic prediction Rand accidentally made is coming true, and the only reason we do not have Randian heroes "going Galt" is that there is nowhere to escape.
