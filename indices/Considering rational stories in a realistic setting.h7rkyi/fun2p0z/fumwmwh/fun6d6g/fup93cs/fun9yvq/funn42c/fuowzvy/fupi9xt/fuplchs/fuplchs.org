The number of people who know enough about the history to find it unrealistic will be small, and those that do can help you improve your story.

If you look at AlternateHistory.com I would say very few people go angrily commenting in timelines about a lack of realism.

You have stories from an alchemist becoming King of Corsica, a neonazi waking up as Hitler, an anti-Nazi waking up as Hitler, London sent back to 1700s, the Roman Empire not falling, the complications a single loose nut can cause, etc. And unlike many stories that rationalists dislike they are often sociological and not psychological.
