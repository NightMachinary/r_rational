I think I didn't see the world addressed but the is some room to be explored in the fact that the world we live in now is highly rational.

Completely amoral but highly rational. When you think about the normative negatice bias people have for Rationalism it makes sense. When you average person thinks about people making rational choices it is about someone outsourcing their job or the like.

So I think any intresting rational-realism story would have to end with the protagonist facing off with people entirely as rational as them.
