Yes, I do think the masquerade is fundamentally a cheat. You want the modern setting but want to include magic or weird science? Plop a masquerade in there. I think the point here (if I have one, ha) is that we're capable of doing something that isn't sci-fi or fantasy, if we choose to do it. The scope will just have to be smaller, and we'll have to be more realistic about what rationality can accomplish.

In real life Fringle Oriented Programming would totally be as you describe. Lisp and metaprogramming are, arguably, what you're talking about, but for a variety of reasons, from path dependence to a disinterest in boring infrastructure and marketing, it's unlikely to be more than a niche thing.
