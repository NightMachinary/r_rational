  From rat-fic fans perspective, it would not be hard to swallow either. HPMOR Harry and MoL Zorian are both basically Randian heroes, and nobody bats an eye, so taking actual Randian hero and "rationalising" them would probably work.

The issue isn't the hero. The issue is the rest of the characters. In HPMOR for example Voldemort is also made rationalist. Further, all of the characters were given understandable narratives, there were rational explanations of characters behaviors all the way from Dumbledore to Malfoy. But more importantly was the rational explanation of the system with which these characters interacted that caused them to behave this way.

And that is the crux of it. If we turn to Rand's work, we would need a rational explanation of a number of structural forces, that would cause a number of rationally labeled characters to actually act the way they do. To say nothing of the system of government. And I'm not sure that is possible.

Yudkowsky talks about this in one of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rg7vPTtyLMfT6Qqud/whining-based-communities][his posts on Winning]]. The story wouldn't survive because these characters would have just won from the beginning. Instead of organizing a strike of the mind, they would have turned around and won instead.

And the evidence of that assertion is all the successful innovators in society who do exactly that. And yea some of them bribe politicians - but they win. Others innovate so hard that it doesn't matter (and maybe commit some securities fraud in the process) - but they still win.

And the other related issue of the rational systems comes back. These rationalist innovators are competitive in the real world. And they will go and win, they would be the strike breakers. Much the same way that the government/takers group would have it's own set of defectors long before things get as bad as shown (whether they win or not is a different question).

So yea, not sure how a rationalist story is possible here without making it not a story. But it has been a while since I read it, and I'm not claiming to be the arbiter of these things. I just can't see the shape of it unlike with other rationalist story ideas (because those often deal with under specified worlds, where as Rand's appears over specified to it's detriment).
