I discussed this with a friend after this post and we had the same thought. If you have fixed drinking water it usually stays fixed unless there is a very dramatic event changing that and so on. It all depends on the scope of the survival as well. Are they aiming to survive two nights or indefinitely? They could take a number from primitive technology on youtube and just build ovens and such if they were trying to survive indefinitely.. if they had the energy and time to conserve for it.
