Rational people irl given enough time / age to optimize, tend to be in shape, well off humans. Capacity and ambition vary but that's basically it.

​

A very capable individual with high ambition is likely to be a millionaire, who's fit and has a great relationship with their partner. A very capable low ambition one likely earns 6 figures, is in reasonable shape and content with their situation. A low capacity with high ambition is likely to be depressed and having high expectations of themselves while being unable to achieve them.

​

The main factor is capacity, rationality isn't that uncommon, it's capacity that's rare. Ambition just boosts the achievements of capable people further..

​

IRL rational fiction likely would annoy most people because it shows that the limiting factor is production capacity, rather than whatever excuse they tell themselves. Everyone knows that exercising is a good idea. Everyone knows that learning useful information is beneficial.. Most people just aren't capable enough to make use of that knowledge.

​

PS. Being a reader of non fiction, it doesn't bother or interest me much that there are few fictional stories focused on teaching people how to live better lives. Non fiction exists, the information is available if you're humble and interested enough to take it. There's little need to package it in a 50k works book just so people that are too proud or uninterested in said information may be more easily convinced to consume it. If they don't want help or aren't bothered enough to seek it let them be.
