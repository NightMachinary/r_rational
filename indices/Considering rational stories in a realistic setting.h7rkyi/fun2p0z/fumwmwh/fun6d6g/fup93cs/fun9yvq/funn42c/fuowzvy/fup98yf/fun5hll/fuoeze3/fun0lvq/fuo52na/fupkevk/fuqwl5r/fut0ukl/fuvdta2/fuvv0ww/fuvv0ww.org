I would read the everlovin' shit out of this.

IMHO, the best kind of a rational story that fits your criteria would be a *rational capitalist fic*.

Think /The Wolf Of Wall Street,/ but the protagonist is not a junkie idiot. Or a sexied-up, rationally optimised biography of Elon Musk. A Nobody to Billionaire story, in which a rational capitalist battles corporate cronies, crooked bureaucrats, greedy socialists, and the almighty IRS.

Better yet if set in the past (say, early 19th century) so that mundane and known technologies and ideas could be the game changers that make the story feel sci-fi'ish, without actually being speculative fiction.

The Current War (2019 movie) is an excellent example: a battle between a rational inventor-turned-capitalist (Edison) vs a rational capitalist-turned-inventor (Westinghouse), with a naive rational inventor (Tesla) spannering the works.\\
The movie works great because all 3 co-protagonists are rational, and act 100% rationally with the information and understanding they have. If/when they act wrong, its because they simply lack some crucial knowledge that the viewer has. This allows them to make interesting mistakes and create drama, without ever acting irrationally.

I think there is a potential here, because rational stories in a realistic setting must, sooner or later, involve money and technology in some way, because money and tech are the only absolute rational optimisers available in this reality.
