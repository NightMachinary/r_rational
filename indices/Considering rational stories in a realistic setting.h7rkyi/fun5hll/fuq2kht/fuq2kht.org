Took a look at that and, yep, dry as dust. Kind of funny how every story on that site has only names like Ted, Joe, Rick, and so on. They feel like they're set in 2017 and 1951 at the same time, somehow. The story is also very much Frodo with a lightsaber in search of a death star. If you're going to give someone an ability like that, Skynet better already have taken over and death drones be circling your bunker. Inventing perpetual motion, having a beer, then driving over to get a lawyer on retainer...I bet this person also plays games with all the cheats turned on.
