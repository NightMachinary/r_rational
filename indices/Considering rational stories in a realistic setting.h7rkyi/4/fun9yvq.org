This post is pretty great, and gave me some stuff to think about. I wanted to add one more thing. Rational characters don't have to optimize, they can simply explore.

The first section of this essay was about a character having a problem, finding a tool to solve it, and then deciding how to maximize the use of this tool. The issue is that in real life there's a lot of other factors to consider besides one tool, so radical optimization isn't always possible.

But is that really necessary?

I find that when I'm writing about characters, my thought process isn't "how can I make them the best version of themselves?" but more like "how can I relate this character's experiences in a faithful and compelling way?" It's fascinating and *interesting* to write a character having a breakdown, or struggling with feelings of inadequacy in their job, or trying to find a lost relative. Even if the story is fiction, these things are real and need to be explored so they can be understood.

I wonder if writing about rational characters doesn't need to necessarily be about solving a serious problem. It can be simply exploring science, magic, crime, or real life dilemmas. How would the rational character deal with this problem, and how would it affect society? How would it affect the character? What can we learn from that?

The book The Martian is trying to solve a problem, but it is also in love with the science of space exploration. You can tell the author just loves describing all the technology and what it does, how carefully he's considered what the people on Earth would react to the problem. The joy is infectious and carries you through the story, even if you aren't a space geek. It faithfully explores the scenario of being lost at space, and you learn a little something along the way too.

Just my two cents on the topic. I wouldn't read a story that tried to use rationality to optimize a real-life scenario, because it rings false to me. To explore, though? Definitely.
