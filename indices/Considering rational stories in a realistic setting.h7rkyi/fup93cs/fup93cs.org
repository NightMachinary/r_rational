I think that the main problem with writing something realistic in a current-day context is that whatever impressive things the MC can think of, the author has to think those things beforehand. Most stories get out of this conundrum with "this one weird new tech", but I see another workaround: hindsight.

Have your story set, say, 50 years in the past. The MC isn't a time traveler, but just someone "ahead of their time". Many choices taken in the past were, in retrospect, mistakes and/or non-optimal. Well, the MC figures this out before everybody else.
