  The "villains" in AS derived their system from faulty ideology, but otherwise acted rationally within it, and they could have been promoted to "real rationalists" the way we want them.
#+end_quote

Acting rationally within the ideology wasn't the point. They would need to act rationally /within their observed experiences/.

The majority of religious folks get this one: Most Christian and Jewish people don't end up like the Amish. Sure, they pay homage to these ideas with things like automatic elevators and so on, but not in any way that truly hampers them.

  Similarly, the heroes could be promoted to full rationalists and still wish to win by abandoning the system.

Yea but the issue is that everyone would have to follow the idea down that path. But there are plenty of people who can go be scientists, they may not be as brilliant, but they could do it. Ditto for engineers, inventors, entrepreneurs and so on. More so today than ever before making progress is a tiny step at the time, built on the shoulders of the previous thinkers.

These are the so-called strike breakers I mentioned. And I guess the issue is it's really never explained why these people don't exist.

As a rationalist looking to win it seems obvious that if these people don't exist then I can be the savior of the government, take it over, and dismantle it. The classic "compromise my morality to win for my morality" example we see from stuff like Practical Guide to Evil. If I become a Warden, then I can corrupt and dismantle the prison.

These would be the defectors, mixed from the above people who act rationally from within their observed experiences. And there would need to be a reason why they don't exist either.

  Probably the easiest way to make AS more realistic is simply to update it to modern times, because the socio-economic prediction Rand accidentally made is coming true, and the only reason we do not have Randian heroes "going Galt" is that there is nowhere to escape.

But there are plenty of places to escape. Space as most of the rich are trying. And sea-steading as mentioned by the Transhumanist Wager. The issue of course is that these people already benefit quite well from the system. I'll note the funds they put to these ideas (with a notable exception of Elon) are not in line with people trying to escape (sea-steading especially). I'm not sure I see the socio-economic prediction you reference.

But further, most of these people, despite also being well compensated, were inevitable. Someone was going to come up with an operating system that was usable, someone was going to make an online marketplace, someone was going to make an online payment processor. They just got there first, building on the shoulders of what already came. And plenty of people are willing to execute these ideas for a thousandth of what these people have been rewarded with.

A strike of the mind would require everyone who possibly has these ideas to join the strike, for years. Not everyone is going to agree with the strike. And it also doesn't work from a game theory perspective when someone is trying to win, which in turn forces the behavior of competition from any other rational actors. I'd almost say that's fundamental to human nature.
