I don't think it would be THAT difficult, after all, a lot of modern rationalists build upon Rand's Objectivism. Objectivism could be considered a crude precursor to the modern rationalist movement, there is no obvious contradiction between these two.

From rat-fic fans perspective, it would not be hard to swallow either. HPMOR Harry and MoL Zorian are both basically Randian heroes, and nobody bats an eye, so taking actual Randian hero and "rationalising" them would probably work.

Further clue: have you read "Transhumanist Wager"? For all means and purposes its a combination of Objectivism and rationalist fiction, and it works pretty neatly.
