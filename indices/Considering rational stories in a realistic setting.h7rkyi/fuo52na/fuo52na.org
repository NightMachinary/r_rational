(Somewhat-skimmed thoughts: Where rational(?) writing stands out is in the contrast between the fictional character-mind/s and the reader's familiarity with the fictional world. Starting from default in-sync cases, one can have for instance modern people in modern settings, magical people in magical settings, science-fiction people in science-fiction settings. One can get intriguing newness by altering the entire thing in unfamiliar interesting ways--'dark, gritty' versions of familiar campy stories, for instance. (Superhero story remakes, or Madoka Magica/Sailor Nothing for magical girl stories...) One can also have the 'big fish in a small pond' effect--a high-level mind in a low-level world with low-level side-characters, for instance either a familiar modern mind in a lower-level world or an advanced science-fiction mind in a modern world. One can have a similar interest-from-contrast effect from power alone, such as a time traveller or magic-user in surroundings whether others cannot use the same abilities... and I was actually going somewhere with this rambling, but am out of time and have to go. Sorry. >.<)
