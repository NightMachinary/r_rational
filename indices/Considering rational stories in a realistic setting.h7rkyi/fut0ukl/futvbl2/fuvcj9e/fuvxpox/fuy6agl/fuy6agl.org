The problem I see with that is that I don't think the story of the book would survive a rational take.

To be clear we are venturing dangerously close to violating the spirit of the "politics is the mindkiller" rule.

While I generally appreciate the libertarian utopian writings, and they make effective rhetoric, I generally find they lack certain structural understandings. And applying these structural forces to (and extra levels of thinking to a stochastic distribution of people throughout) the world of these books would often reverse the point they were making. And get you something closer to the real world.

This issue is that I don't think that one could "show their work" with the rationalism and maintain the story. Because there is a difference between saying that someone is rational and demonstrating it (e.g. tell vs. show).

That's my view on it at least.
