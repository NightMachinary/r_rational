I think this community should consider time travel/history as a more "realistic" setting that can still have a single or small group of characters enact major changes.

You do need to frame a goal otherwise I think the story would be side tracked, but something like 5 people are given a week to prepare to be sent to Tenochtitlan in 1492 with the goal to save the Aztec Empire, or to London in 1750 and told to bring about a one world government.
