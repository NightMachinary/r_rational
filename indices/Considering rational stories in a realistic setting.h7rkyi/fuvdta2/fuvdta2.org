The first half of your post is kinda where I have been at on my thoughts of it.

As a quick aside from the rest of my points, I would also add that there very might well be a "Fringle Oriented Programming" out there right now. But with no empirical way to actually tell the benefits of one programming system over the other it's actually really difficult to know, to say nothing of the not invented here syndrome and sunk cost fallacies.

Silicon Valley plays this aspect up for humor. The main character invents a compression algorithm that is fundamentally better than anything else in the world, this could be objectively valued at billions of dollars a year of potential revenue. From a certain perspective it's a rational story about why the silicon valley startup mindset is fundamentally bad at what claims to be good at (e.g. promoting new ideas to change the world). But in regards to your point, that makes for a dark comedy and nobody wants to read that (a visual comedy allows for most of the jokes to be timing and situational).

It also doesn't work from a computer science perspective as a premise due to computational universality, which can be summed up in the simple answer of: why can't I call it as a library. And the fundamental physics of computation means beating any interesting problem in an empirical way runs up against the math about boiling the oceans and turning the atmosphere into plasma being a physical requirement (unless we are talking, [[https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/npcomplete.pdf][we are like gods fantasy, a P=NP hack is the end of the world]] as we know it). Better to do what silicon valley did and solve an open question like compression at the theoretical limit or the hard problem of consciousness, or perhaps a hardware hack like quantum computation or mem-ristors the issue of course is that these quickly dissolve into sci-fi. Or if your 'power' ignores our understanding of physicals, a sort of simulation escape which might as well be fantasy.

But I digress (this is what I get for having a masters; I can't even enjoy the conceptual example without finding a hundred things wrong with it).

What I wanted to say was that my solution is to have a hidden organization. It's an old trope, but make it a spy thriller of hidden organizations fighting over barely advanced technology. My specific formulation is that a Bill Gates like figure /did do a rationalism/ 30 years ago and now has technology 5 years ahead of the curve in secret. I think there is a lot of potential from that sort of backdrop.

A variant of this is that what that secret technology is can then be kinda sci-fi (or fantasy like psionics or aliens), I almost view this as the "The Stargate" solution. But it is kind of cheating by simply allowing access to a modern backdrop while still being sci-fi or fantasy. So I list it only as a variant. I think this comes back to the idea of that good sci-fi uses as few caveats as it has to, and I think this would be a good way to make better rational sci-fi. (For example the caveat in The Expanse is the aliens, where as the ship drives that are at the limit of theoretical propulsive capability are not a caveat)

The correct way to do this in my opinion is the "5 years ahead of human technology", it's more fun if you are doing sci-fi and guessing what stuff looks like in 5 years based on what exists today as a prototype. But it's also not terrible to re-wind 5 years. This allows one to focus on real world rationalism undertaken by things like spy agencies and governments. Fun stuff like [[https://web.archive.org/web/20170717045616/https://petertodd.org/2016/cypherpunk-desert-bus-zcash-trusted-setup-ceremony][cryptography]] and stenography, what a tear-down protocol for a development site for this "future tech" looks like, and how they do networking (e.g. see the cartels). What sort of culture an organization like this might use, how do they solve the man power and loyalty issues (especially without raising eyebrows). Bonus points if you can give them a realistic end goal that changes the world.

In my story I come back to the addage that no security system is perfect, even the most paranoid and rational one. Sometimes the FBI just gets lucky and all hell breaks loose. Of course the "super-rational" character is 30 years ago, and the protagonist is now. Flashbacks can get you some of that rational awesome goodness, while the main character can work through and learn the lessons. I think I have a good end goal too and if anyone is curious for my current writing on it they could DM me, but it's not meant to be published yet and is very rough (on the one hand I don't mind sharing the details if someone wants them, on the other I don't want to spoil it if I do end up publishing it).
