This is a good post. I think that sociology courses on entertainment, art and writing which delve into why people indulge in fiction would support or resolve some of the options you presented.

"I want to identify with the characters." "I want to delve into an impossible fantasy world." "I want to make an impact on the whole world and read about the challenges along the way." "I want to read about dynamic, meaningful relationships between characters I know inside and out." Any one of these /can/ be fulfilled in tandem with a Rational story. But you can't fulfill all of these at once in a realistic setting.

On top of that fantasy, sci-fi, adventure, even as specific as Isekai... These genres and subgenres have a reputation for fulfilling some of the above desires, in specific combinations. Thus people go searching for stories that reliably fulfill their desires.\\
Here on this subreddit people have access to a wealth of Rational and Rationalist fics, so they'll look for stories that combo well with those.
