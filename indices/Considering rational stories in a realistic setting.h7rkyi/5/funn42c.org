I think that there is quite a bit of space for rational stories in historic fiction and crime stories (about committing crime, not solving it). But I specifically mean rational, not rational/ist/. So just stories where smart people do coherent things to further their goals, encounter problems that don't come out of nowhere, and live with the consequences of their actions.
