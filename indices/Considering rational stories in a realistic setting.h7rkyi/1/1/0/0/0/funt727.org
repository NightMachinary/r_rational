  However, there does need to be something said for the fact that change isn't easy.

Well sure, but that's just a matter of writing conflict well :) Especially in a slice-of-life story, where the conflict is entirely born of personal or interpersonal difficulties. If the path from conflict to resolution is too straight then it hardly feels more real than someone who succeeds at everything right away.

It does come down to taste at some level, though. On one end you have people who enjoy stories that are essentially just full of feel-good fluff, on the other end you have people who enjoy stories about people failing and suffering constantly. On another axis you have people who enjoy a constant upward trajectory, the opposite extreme of which are people who enjoy stories that will spend 50 chapters just exploring the trials and tribulations of alcoholism without any real growth or progress.

Personally I'm not a fan of any of the extremes, but I do find myself more on the end of "growth and change are more interesting," so I only have so much patience for a character that spends 3 books or 1000 comic pages or a dozen serial arcs struggling with the exact same problem.

  What I love to see in slice of life stories is people helping each other, because in the end nobody lives in a vacuum. Self-improvement is often a collaborative effort. Plus it's heartwarming and sweet to see broken people find healing in each other. :) I suppose it's not exactly rational, but it's beautiful.

Yeah, I definitely agree that characters helping each other grow is great. More than great, it is in fact realistic :P I'm a therapist after all, if I didn't believe people could help each other improve I'd find a different job. That said, I guess it depends on what you mean by "broken people."

  By the way, I don't think I've ever read your slice of life stories. Are they posted anywhere on the sub? I'd be curious to take a look if you want to share.

They are not, basically they're a set of 7-8 novels that I've been cowriting with a close friend since high school :) She's pretty private about her writing, so while someday maybe we'd try to publish them so far we've kept them basically just between us.
