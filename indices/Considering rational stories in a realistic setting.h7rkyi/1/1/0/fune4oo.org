I actually already write romantic slice-of-life, and while it's not as "rational" as it could be because I co-write it and my co-writer isn't a fan of the genre, to me optimization and exploration are two sides of the same coin for a rational protagonist. To explore the character and their circumstances but NOT seek to optimize their outcomes is just uninteresting, to me. Stories with characters that don't change for the better after enough opportunities... I just stop caring about them.

To me it doesn't really make sense to call Elon "as rational of a subject as you're going to find," because rationality means a lot more to me than an always optimal computer (and even if it did mean that, Elon is clearly not). For example, a rational Elon doesn't mean he never makes mistakes, but it does mean he recognizes his mistakes and makes real, non-trivial effort not to repeat them. He might fail a few times before he succeeds, but the failure modes shouldn't repeat too often.

Rational behavior doesn't just require intelligence and agency; it also requires humility, a value of truthful beliefs, a goal of self-improvement, etc. The character and story is only /interesting/ to me if I see them learn; if they just act perfectly all the time from the very start, they're just a Mary Sue.
