just a thought, rational courtroom fic could work as well. TO make it more relatable, write the fic from the perspective of an average guy, not a lawyer.

Example: a guy is going through a rough divorce, in which his soon-to-be ex wife is likely to take away the kids, the money and the house. Typical slice of life story, right? Now imagine the guy is also an optimisation-obsessed, paranoid rationalist (a person likely to be divorced...) who comes to the legal battle prepared.
