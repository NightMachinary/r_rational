Oh, it's also worth mentioning Set in Stone. The overall context of the story is Sci-Fi, but the setting and challenges are scaled down to not be. A similar sort of thing can be done for people who enjoy the "what-if"ness of speculative fiction but don't want to include any magic or sci-fi technology as problem solving levers.
