From the first study's abstract:

#+begin_quote
  The risk was persistent even after taking into account maternal history of depression (29 exposed infants; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.03-2.97).

From the second study's abstract:

#+begin_quote
  In models adjusted for sociodemographic features, antidepressant exposure prior to and during pregnancy was associated with ASD risk, but risk associated with exposure during pregnancy was no longer significant after controlling for maternal major depression (odds ratio (OR) 1.10 (0.70-1.70)).

The difference there seems to be whether they're adjusting for *maternal depression* or *severity of maternal depression*. This would explain the two different results. I don't know whether this is actually the case though, since the articles are behind paywalls - that's just a guess based on what I can see.

(The argument would basically be that "pregnant women with depression" and "pregnant women with depression /and on medication/" are substantially different populations because the ones on medication are more likely to be /severely/ depressed, so you don't just need to correct for depression, you need to correct for severity of depression.)
