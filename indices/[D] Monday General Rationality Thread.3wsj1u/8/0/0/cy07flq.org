It's that circle that I care about. This is (predictably) for something that I'm writing. (Maybe I should have led with that, but I like keeping things under wraps. Sorry for any confusion.)

Imagine that the emitter is a cell tower. Now imagine that if you ever have less than a certain amount of cell signal, you die. In that case, you probably build your entire civilization around these cell towers and what you're really interested in is the circle that's formed on the surface of the earth, because that's what defines total livable space.

If you double the radius of the circle, you have to quadruple the source strength, but that doesn't matter because you also get to quadruple the livable area (and you don't really care about volume).

But if the emitter is emitting in four dimensions, then the relationship between surface area of the two-dimensional slice of a four-dimensional sphere (the slice which defines your livable land) shares this different relationship with signal intensity.

Edit: I think I have it figured out. If you want to increase area by /x/ that means increasing signal strength by /x/^{3/2} which gives 2.82 as a result when I feed in 2 (for doubling the area).
