The study seems to single out SSRIs in particular, but the fact that taking /any/ antidepressants had a negative effect makes me suspicious.

They have a large number of different mechanisms, some acting on entirely different neurotransmitters (e.g. NRIs, tricyclics, MAOIs), and if they all have a similar result then perhaps it is the condition being treated that causes the result (or, alternatively, it applies to a larger class of psychoactive drugs than just antidepressants).

That said, I have no medical background and can't critique it from that perspective. I just get suspicious when somebody finds an effect which is at an unusual level of specificity (in this case, singling out antidepressants vs. all psychoactive drugs vs. specific classes of antidepressant).
