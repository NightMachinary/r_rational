I'm a software engineer, which has been my job for about six years now. I'm planning to be a stay-at-home dad in the near future, probably with some software/web contract work on the side and downtime devoted to writing and editing (more of the latter than the former). I'm 29 years old, white, and male, if you want demographics. I live in the northern half of the Midwest.
