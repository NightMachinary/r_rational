My degrees are in EE / robotics, but I graduated during the dawn of the WWW and followed the money (engineering is the art of converting knowledge into cash) so I do software as a job. I'm a named inventor on several smart phone patents (predating the iPhone by nearly a decade, no product was released. .. too expensive at the time) I've also done physical and computer security, now I'm mainly dealing with scaling non-technical problems. Then again, aren't we all?
