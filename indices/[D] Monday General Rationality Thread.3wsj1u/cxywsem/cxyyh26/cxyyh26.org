I'm a data analyst for a large software company. Ideally this job is very close to rationality. In practice it's closer to debate club in that you're preparing arguments to sway, not engaging in a dialectic.

It's scary how bad at knowledge and uncertainty large organizations are. And willfully so. But that means there's lots of room for improvement and that responsible data analysts can do some good.
