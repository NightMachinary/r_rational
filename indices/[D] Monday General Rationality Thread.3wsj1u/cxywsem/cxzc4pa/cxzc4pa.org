I'm a 26 year old software engineer in silicon valley. I work for a living and live comfortably, but I don't do anything in a field related to rationality or writing. I'd recommend this sort of living to anyone who is comfortable doing it. The hours and pay are good, and we need programmers for the foreseeable future.

I'm definitely a nerd by most measures, but compared to my peers and friends in this area, I'm one of the less nerdy people I know. People are pretty nerdy around here, it's really great.
