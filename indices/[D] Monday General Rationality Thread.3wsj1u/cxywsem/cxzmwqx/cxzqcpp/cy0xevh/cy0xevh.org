Check out my oldest Powerpoint on the subject. Metacognition: Tricks and Traps in Differential Diagnosis.

[[http://www.slideshare.net/notmy2ndopinion/differential-diagnosis-16351069]]

slide 13 and 25 are about the Dual-Process Model and slide 28 is about the realities of trying to balance Intuition and Intellect in the hospital.

Slide 37 illuminates some of the current strategies that master clinicians employ, but there's further research into things like cognitive debiasing.

I also advocate for avoiding "Analysis Paralysis" which is really about being an efficient third year clerkship student. This means taking only 5-10 minutes to think intensely hard on a problem, finding an evidence based solution quickly (using information mastery) and then moving on.
