40 years old in Seattle. Fairly new dad of a 10 month old. I'm currently CMO of a private equity backed company. Worked ridiculously hard to get here in my life (and got lucky a few times - including being born with a natural talent at stuff other humans find valuable)

Discovered Tyler Cowen a few years ago. Then Bryan Caplan last year. Then SlateStarCodex earlier this year. Scott somehow introduced me to HPATMOR and the Sequences. Then I found this Reddit in the last six months-ish. You all introduced me to Worm, Metropolitan Man, and the fantastic challenges. Only disappointment is when you all went to 2-week challenges. I miss reading your stuff every Wednesday...

My goal next year is to write two books. First priority is a non fiction about situations where "good enough" should be the goal (Malcolm Gladwell style with better science). The second is fiction about children superheroes and the conflict between two in particular. One with the ability to move her consciousness back in time into her younger body and the other an effective super human intelligent "AI" (to use terminology from this Reddit)

If anyone wants to be early readers of either one let me know. My website is MarketingIsEasy.com
