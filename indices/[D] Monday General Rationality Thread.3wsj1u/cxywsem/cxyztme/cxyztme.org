Early 30s, live in the midwest, engineering professor working in a branch of applied math.

One might expect this to be a job that trains rationality skills, but, largely due to the publish-or-perish pressures of the job, I'm finding that not to be the case at all; if anything, my job trains you to make superficially plausible arguments which pass sanity checks from reviewers skimming your work.
