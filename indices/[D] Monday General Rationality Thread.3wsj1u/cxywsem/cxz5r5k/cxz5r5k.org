Twenty year-old college student double-majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I'm planning on going to graduate school for cognitive science research since I'm more interested in studying brains than trying to recreate a brain out of silicon.

Shockingly, cognitive science is helping me to learn more about AI related stuff than actual computer science classes on AI. It's probably due to the fact that I'm taking specialized classes which overlaps my two majors, but /still/.

Hopefully cognitive science will allow me to better practice rationality skills, but with the publish-or-perish problems in academia, I kinda doubt it.

I don't really have any interest in being a full-time writer, but I still want to try writing a book at some point.
