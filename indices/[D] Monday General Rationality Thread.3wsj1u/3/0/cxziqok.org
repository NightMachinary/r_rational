In theoretical computer science there is a big difference between mostly solving a problem and always solving it. There's less of a difference between solving a problem with high probability over your own random coins and solving it deterministically always but still some. What they do is present a way to compute a heuristic for the halting problem which is usually right for a given distribution of inputs.
