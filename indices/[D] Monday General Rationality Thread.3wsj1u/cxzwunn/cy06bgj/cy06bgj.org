The circle is an abstraction, a two-dimensional slice of a four dimensional hyperspace. The surface area of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere][glome]] is proportional to the cube of the radius (everything else is a constant), necessitating an inverse cube law. The area of the imaginary circle has nothing to do with it.

Assuming emissions strength /s/ and tester distance /r/ from a 3 dimensional source, the measured intensity will be determined by s/r^{2} . If the distance becomes 2r, that's what gets squared which means that in order to keep the intensity constant, it requires a /quadrupling/ of the source strength: (2r)^{2} = 4r^{2.}

In four dimensions, the inverse cube law requires an /octupling/ of source strength in order to double the radius of the imaginary circle if you want to keep measured intensity constant: (2r)^{3} = 8r^{3}

Don't let the imaginary circle get in the way of your calculations.
