What do people here do? From what I remember of the last time we had a survey, the average age of [[/r/rational]] was somewhere in the twenties. And of course we're all nerds even by the standards of Reddit.

So are you a student? Do you work for a living? In either case, is it in a field related to rationality or writing? Are there any full-time authors in the subreddit (living the dream)?
