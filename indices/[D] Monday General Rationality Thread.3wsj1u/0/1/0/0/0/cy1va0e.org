Admittedly, I've seen some papers in modern probabilistic AI or probabilistic models of cognition where they basically say, "Here we start with some model that seemed really natural in GOFAI days, but was also really shitty because GOFAI, and then we make it stochastic in a natural-seeming way, /and now it's actually useful./"
