I know right?!? Cognitive science's where I first learned about neural nets and Bayes nets, and how to actually program them. In AI classes, we keep spending time on how to represent logical systems and do inference and deductive algorithms which nearly anyone can tell, after a few months, are mostly useless for real-world tasks. Stuff which uses probabilities in some way to represent uncertainty, such as mixture models, are the way to go.

What are they doing spending an entire /year/ on AI methodology from the 1990s or earlier? That's a fourth of my college years and I want to just freaking skip ahead to the cutting-edge research already!!! And no, I don't think I actually need that much of a grounding in the basics to get the more relevant stuff. My teacher basically admitted the same thing.

For all I know it might be different in the really advanced classes, but it's taking so long to get there and I'm finding cognitive science research to be so fascinating that I've decided to not continue with computer science research in grad school.
