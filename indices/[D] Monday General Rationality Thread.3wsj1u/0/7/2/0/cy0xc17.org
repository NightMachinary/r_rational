Check out my oldest Powerpoint on the subject. Metacognition: Tricks and Traps in Differential Diagnosis.

[[http://www.slideshare.net/notmy2ndopinion/differential-diagnosis-16351069]]

Slide 34 is the best: the debate between Gary Klein (System I, Intuition) and Daniel Kahneman (System II, Intellect). They co-wrote a great paper together that's in my references.

I also have another series on the specific biases relevant to medicine (check out the Croskerry references for the citations) that's geared towards undergrad students... maybe I should upload those presentations too.
