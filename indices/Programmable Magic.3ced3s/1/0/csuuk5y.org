Not to mention that he's slightly pushed into it by /not being a wizard/, and then discovering that this means "not able to cast big high-energy spells, but tiny micro-spells that do sod-all can be cast by anyone". And spells can /cast other spells/.

I particularly like how he doesn't register as a wizard to magic-detection spells, even when he's throwing around citybuster-level magic, because technically it's not him casting/controlling the high-level stuff, whereas with 'real' wizards they have direct control.
