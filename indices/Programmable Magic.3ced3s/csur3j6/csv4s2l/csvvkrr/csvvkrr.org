The anime adaptation is still enormous fun to watch, despite the lost opportunities for munchkinry. Not rationalfic by any means, but it does have some interesting points. For example, the protagonist lacks the ability to feel almost all intense emotion, but is very far from a Straw Vulcan.

....I think someone needs to write rationalfic for that universe now.
