Should clarify though, in that setting not all wizards are programmers writing code -- it's just the protagonist. Other wizards do the equivalent of writing machine code directly, with all the ridiculous effort that implies. Also, unlike most settings, magic is devastatingly easy to do in this universe. It's just so hard to coordinate everything that people studiously avoid it, out of fear for the horrific consequences that inevitably follow the most minor spells without intensive training.

The programmer guy finds this ludicrous complexity impossible to deal with and builds several layers of abstraction, allowing him to ultimately run spells more massive than any standard wizard could comprehend.
