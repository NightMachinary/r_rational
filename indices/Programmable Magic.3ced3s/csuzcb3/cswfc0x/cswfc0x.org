I tried reading it... but, well, the /style/. It's off by small degrees in grammar and large degrees in technical proficiency. Just read this sentence:

#+begin_quote
  James' vision was blurred by the sudden light of a noonday sun, which he found startling and disturbing, as he was quite certain it had been dimming towards twilight only a moment before.
#+end_quote

Not /unreadable/, but /annoying/.

I skipped to the last chapter and read a few lines. He gets better, but not to the point that it's fun to read.

On the plus side, the issues are mostly with phrasing, so a good editor would be able to fix it.

Bah humbug.
