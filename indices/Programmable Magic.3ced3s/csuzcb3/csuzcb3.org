There is an original fiction which is a precursor to a Worm crossover where a SI is investigating an original magic system which functions like this. I was considering posting it as its own post, but I'll toss it here.

I'd tag it [WIP][MK][RT][HF] for now. Knowing (a little) where it's going from the later Worm crossover, I suspect [TH] is in the works.

One of the really interesting parts to me is the way spells have an exponential magic cost dependant on degrees of freedom. So, for example, a spell which is specified to an incredible degree, and cannot or does not need to interpret or guess at any other things (the spell formula has taken into account all variables) has its cost in 'willpower' or 'mana' significantly reduced. On the other hand, a common language wish, while possible to do, has absolutely insane energy requirements as the spell itself has to determine all of the thousands of variables needed to make it happen.

The main character is abducted with a backpack filled with basic science books to the world where he learns magic. He uses his knowledge of physics to fit in variables that, he suspects, people in other medieval fantasy realms would have always left open, and by doing so turns what might normally be high level magic into cantrips in terms of cost - which he is then able to cast with his mediocre reserves.

The title and Word of God have implicitly said he's out to break the magic system like an unruly horse, so I expect more of the same.

The OP has it all written but is posting at a glacial pace, and the index is not complete.
