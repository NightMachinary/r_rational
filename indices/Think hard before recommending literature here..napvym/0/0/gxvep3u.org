This is a good point. Any degree of exposure and readership is going to bring in new eyes and new critics. Especially from a place like [[/r/rational]], which is rather prone to nitpicking, but hopefully not more toxic forms of criticism. Nonetheless, I can definitely understand the pain of a budding author who feels like their work is being torn to shreds with criticism.

I'm not sure what specific examples the OP is referring to, but if the stories are being posted on Royal Road, [[/r/rational]] might not be entirely to blame. Getting a rapid influx of ratings and reviews on the platform will put you on the Trending page, which means a lot of potential readers will be reviewing your work. And yes, usually that means your ratings will go down, at least momentarily. (On the other hand maybe [[/r/rational]] does lead to more critiques, I wouldn't have any first-hand experience here)

In general, I agree with the sentiment here. It's always good to think before posting, especially when you are introducing someone else's work. Another thing that can help is to explain your recommendation a bit more, so that you perhaps turn away some of the readers who never would have enjoyed the story in the first place (I don't think anyone here reads something just to give it a bad rating).
