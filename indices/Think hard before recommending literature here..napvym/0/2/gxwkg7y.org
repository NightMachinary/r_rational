Some constructive criticism: The index...

I really liked the story and wanted to finish it, but I have balked at trying to find where I left it about 3 times since then. For context I left it shortly after Zilla was introduced. I am struggling to think of a worse index. Preventer 9:3? So, this is chapter three from the ninth arc, with a note at the start of the PoV character? No, next chapter is Indulger 8:1...

With love
