I feel like, hmm, I agree with you on the object level of what happens when you post here, disagree on the recommendation at the end?

Like, posting here gets a bunch of argumentative nerds to read the thing and then, being a bunch of argumentative nerds, we tear it down disproportionate to how much we boost it up. Cop to that, guilty as charged, officer. We have a bad habit of being all 'prove why you are worthy of providing us free content!'.

But, like, the thing of it is that most fics out there aren't, like, cruising on hundreds of readers and just need a few more. Most of them have basically zero readers and zero discussion. Their comment sections are huge wastelands broken up by the occasional, treasured 'good story, thanks for writing' post.

Authors in that boat need engagement above all else. The readers on this board, whatever other flaws we may have, do read the stuff we review. (Obviously, this is a generalization, but a substantial percentage of blah blah blah..)

In conclusion, I agree that advertising a story here has a greater than average chance of getting some negative reviews, but I think that's offset (in most cases) by the fact that it will get reviews/posts at all. No bad attention, etc.

Money where my mouth is and all that, I wrote 'The Fifth Defiance' ([[https://thefifthdefiance.com/2015/11/02/introduction/]]) , if y'all want to tear me down, come on by!
