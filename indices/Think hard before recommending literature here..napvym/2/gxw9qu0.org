Hmm. I can see where you're coming from, but your experience on this sub has been markedly different from my own.

I've written one novel-length work so far, but I didn't post it to Royal Road, instead building my own little website so I could have more freedom and control. I wrote it with this audience in mind, specifically because my taste in fiction overlaps extremely heavily with what gets posted here.

I didn't post it here until it was complete, and it didn't get a huge amount of attention. It did generate a bit of lively discussion, which helped me fix a few technical and literary glitches.

Funny enough, my story was discussed on one of the /r/r adjacent Discord servers lately, and some of the criticism was much harsher. Even so, I never felt that criticism was unfair, and one piece of negative feedback just about sent me into giggling fits because it was actually such a huge backhanded compliment.

This hasn't come out as coherently as I intended, so I'll try to say what I'm thinking plainly. I think your concern is valid if you're optimizing for the metric of fewest negative reviews. In my case, I knew out the gate that my story would have an extremely limited readership, and I expected some amount of negative feedback, but it was worth it to me to share my creative output with this community. It takes a /lot/ of writing to become an AW or a qntm or an EY, and /those/ writers are /far/ from immune to criticism even on this sub. But other communities don't have the same kind of discussion this one does, and that's worth the candle to me on its own.
