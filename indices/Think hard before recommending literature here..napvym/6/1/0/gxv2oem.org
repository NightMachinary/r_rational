  Second, how does one come to understand the tastes of this place without dumpster fires being started for the authors they enjoy?

Lurk before posting, read all of the things which get highly upvoted, go back through 'Top' of 'Submissions' with 'All Time' selected. If you're not part of this community, I don't think you should be posting here. Dumpster fires are entirely unnecessary and I would hazard unwelcome.

*Edit:*

Based upon other comments, notably [[/u/RMcD94]]'s below, I think that a lot of us pushing back are on the same page about an influx of works getting top-level posts to [[/r/rational]] recently, perhaps partly as pandemic-era time and stimulus has seen a large expansion webserials and donations made to them, coinciding with [[/r/rational]]'s continued growth. But it looks like at least some of what is motivating [[/u/Brell4Evar]] may be in the general recommendation threads rather than front-page posts, and those certainly are held to a different standard for more than one reason.
