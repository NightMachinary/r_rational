I agree with your understanding in the edit. Almost anything goes in the recommendation thread while the front page should be limited to those works that align more closely with the definitions in the sidebar, as difficult and subjective that may be

I don't see much harm in author's being aware that sharing their work whether on the subreddit or in the recommendation thread exposes them to a group that is willing to critique works but I also think that it'd be quite difficult to implement some sort of warning

Is it up to author's to tell their readers not to share their works with communities that might come across as mean or up to those communities to tell its members to only share works when they're sure the author is okay with criticism? Whatever the answer is I see no practical solution
