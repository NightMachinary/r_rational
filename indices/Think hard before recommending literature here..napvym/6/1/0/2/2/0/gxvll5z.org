I can't see the kind of exclusivity you're advocating being in any way reasonable. Also, while I don't think it's your intention to level an attack against me, this:

#+begin_quote
  probably aren't enough a part of this community yet
#+end_quote

... seems to be labeling me as an outsider despite years of participation on this forum.

To which, I suppose I can say, I think you're unwittingly making an interesting point.

Anyone making recommendations in this subreddit runs a large risk not only of leading others to damage the author's standing on their platform, /but also of being ostracized for a simple act of sharing./
