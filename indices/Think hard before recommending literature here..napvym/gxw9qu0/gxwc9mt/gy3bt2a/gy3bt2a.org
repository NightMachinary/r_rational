I don't spend much time in the RR community, I just read stuff there and maybe join an author's Discord, but I can't imagine that the rating system isn't being treated differently by casual RR users versus serious users. If you enjoy a story, you know that good ratings will get more eyes on the thing you enjoy, so you might as well give it a perfect score to help out the author and help them keep their income going. If you're someone from a non-RR space who is just reviewing it since you're the type to write reviews, even if you enjoy thw work, you don't have the same goals in giving a rating. You could also say something about how someone looking for popcorn wish fulfilment would give that popcorn wish fulfilment story a 5/5, regardless of how good its grammar, prose, plot, etc. is. Trying to boil down ratings to a number has a host of issues, especially when there's no understood standard for how you should be scoring something (ie. Is getting bored of a story and dropping it after 3 entire books of content a 1 star because you don't want to read it, a 5 star because it kept you entertained for several books, or anything in between?)

Anyway number ratings are dumb but the system is easy enough to make functional, and a system that encourages big numbers looks good to new eyes joining the site.
