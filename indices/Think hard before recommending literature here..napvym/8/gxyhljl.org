There are many more people reading this subreddit than making recs in it, and it's the former, not the latter, who are responsible for the effect.

IMO the proper takeaway is: if you don't think a rec belongs here, downvote the post with rec - not the fiction itself. Don't downvote fiction recommended here just because you don't think it should have been recommended here (assuming the author didn't explicitly write it for this community). Web fiction has a wider audience than this community and it's unfair to judge it on narrow criteria. If the writing isn't deliberately aimed at us, that's knowledge useful to us, not to the general public; it's churlish to publically punish the author for not doing our particular thing. Perhaps something to this effect could be stated in the side bar?

If it's generally terrible then fair play, of course, but that sort of thing doesn't tend to get recommended here in the first place, by and large.

If we can't convice the readers to take greater care with downvotes, of course, then I agree with OP - we do need to take much more thought when making recs to avoid punishing unsuspecting authors for no reason. But fewer recs would be a sad thing for me to see - I've come away with many a fun read from here of things that were not, strictly, rational; the community's tastes tend to align along more parameters than that.
