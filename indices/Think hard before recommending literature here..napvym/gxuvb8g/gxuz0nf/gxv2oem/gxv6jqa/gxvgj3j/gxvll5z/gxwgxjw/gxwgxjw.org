So, it looks like a lot of what you and I have said has failed to connect well and I apologize for my part in that. I actually had looked at your post history at that point and seen that you've contributed discussion which I've upvoted in months past, so I wasn't targeting what I was saying at you-as-a-poster, specifically - I think the kind of poster I had in mind was the caricature of top-level posts which come from outside of [[/r/rational]] and are spammed across multiple subreddits without reading the sidebars, while what you are actually referring to is (at least in some instances, perhaps entirely) not that at all.
