Hello!

A few things to say about this:

First, you're clearly right, at least in part. The pitfall I've come across isn't rationalism, however. I'm not reading criticisms about rationality so much as style. There's what I'd call an ambivalence in this community. Some redditors will enjoy a recommendation, while others will not. It's /rare/ for a new work with the quality of HPMoR. If we only recommend high-grade gems of pure rationality, this place will be a lot less interesting.

Second, how does one come to understand the tastes of this place without dumpster fires being started for the authors they enjoy? I'll agree with your solution, but I'd add the caveat that nobody should feel confident enough to recommend anything here that is present on RR or other sites where ratings can significantly impact an author's readership. The risk vs payoff for the author simply isn't there.

Finally, I note this topic has already scored at least one down-vote. I expect more to come. It strikes me as being entirely ironic that voting be used in this manner, rather than discussion as [[/u/catern/]] has chosen to do. The same downvoting absolutely illustrates the problem I'm posting about.
