I don't mind discussing the post you produced. The discussion wasn't bad for me - productive, in fact.

What we're discussing now is close to, but not quite what my original post is about. The post you copied started by getting downvoted into the negative range. Note this bit:

  Edit: Hey, just to be clear, it's okay if you don't like it, but useful criticism rather than quiet downvotes would be appreciated. Not much I can learn from, otherwise!
#+end_quote

Readers responded well to that, and I got some fairly useful feedback.

At the same time, I saw a couple of <=1 star ratings pop up in RR following the link, dropping the rating close to 3. Looks like it recovered nicely from then.

Hearing from other authors who experienced the same drop in rating after I recommended them made me feel kind of ill. I want to share what I enjoy with others, but not at the authors' expense.
