Ah, I see.

"Work like you don't need the money" was not meant as anything other than part of a meme. The original goes:/"Work like you don't need the money. Love like you've never been hurt. Dance like nobody's watching."/

The discussion was neither money nor dancing; I was making a comment about the joys of living without regard to consequences. I'm a bit flabbergasted that you read that the way you did.
