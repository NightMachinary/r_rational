As an amateur author on RR, I feel like I should respond to this with a logical and reasonable answer that might induce you rethink your position.

Something like using myself as an example and saying how I am more than happy to leave my story up on royal road for readers to keep reading if the number of patrons I got through patreon were sufficient to support that. How my story has only gathered little more than 100 patrons at $3/month even though it held the top of trending for a week.

That the temptation of moving it to kindle unlimited wasn't truly a consideration until I realized just how much I wanted to be a full time author and that the patreon to rr business model has limitations on how successful it can be. Limitations that appear to be applying to me because my story hasn't yet reached the 1000th chapter mark.

But I won't do that, that'd just be silly.
