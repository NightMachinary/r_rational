I think this is a fair caution, and not something I would have thought of if I hadn't gotten the author perspective. There's risk involved in bringing a lot of critical attention to something, and this sub explicitly prides itself for being exclusive and critical. It's a reasonable warning to people to think twice before posting a new fic here.
