And, this is hardly the result of a controlled experiment or any kind of tracking. This is OP feeling that they've 'noticed' an effect. For the sake of discussion we're all treating their observation as entirely accurate, but since we're most definitely all rational here, we should recognize that confirmation bias is real.

*Edit*:

Alright so, [[/u/Brell4Evar]] has sent me an example of pretty blatant transfer of criticism from [[/r/rational]] to an outside author's work. I can't say that [[/r/rational]] is having a large impact on author's ratings based on this, or that the rating criticism was unfair since I haven't read the work myself, but I do see where Brell4Evar is coming from here. I feel pretty strongly that intense, unconstructive, negative criticism of authors and their works should not occur in spaces the authors frequent (though it too often does), and am on-board with Brell4Evar's decrying taking negativity from this subreddit out into the wider world.
