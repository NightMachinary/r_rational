I want to let you know that this sort of behavior is enough to get me to boycott an author's works, even if I really liked their writing, on the grounds that it is burning the commons via a bait and switch tactic. I go onto Royal Road and the like with the expectation that I'm going to get basically the thing that Royal Road pitches itself as: a bunch of free stories that I get to read at my own pace in exchange for being advertised at by Royal Road and possibly the author's Patreon. This feels like a worthwhile deal to me and one I'm happy to take in most cases. Authors who use Royal Road like you do change that dynamic into one in which the readers are providing unpaid editorial services in exchange for a book that is likely to disappear behind a paywall half way through reading it.

It is annoying enough that this exact sort of let-down has made me cut down on the number of Royal Road stories that I read, comment and recommend to people and if it ever gets to the point where more than one story in ten is based on this sort of dynamic, I'd probably just stop bothering with Royal Road entirely. Very plausibly, you do not give a shit about any of that. After all, your current method gets you what you want as an author, and there's nothing in the rules (on Royal Road or otherwise) saying that you can't. I'm not going to try to shame you for doing what makes you money.

But on the off chance that you care about Royal Road continuing to attract people interested in its stated premise as a website or about not alienating potential readers who (like me) get refuse to read anything by authors who use your current business model, please consider this one point of evidence in favour of there being externalities that you might not have been aware of. Also please consider making it clear up front that the story might be vanishing due to Kindle agreements instead of (like certain authors I could name) swearing up and down that you'd never do that and then taking the check from Amazon and doing it regardless.
