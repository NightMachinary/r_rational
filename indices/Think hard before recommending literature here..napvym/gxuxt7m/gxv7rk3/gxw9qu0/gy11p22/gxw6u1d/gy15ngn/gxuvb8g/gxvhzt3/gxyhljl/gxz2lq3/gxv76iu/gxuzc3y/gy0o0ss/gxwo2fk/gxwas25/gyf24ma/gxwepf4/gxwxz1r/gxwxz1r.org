So, here's my weird answer.

I'm actually not raging about people who pop over to RR and provide low stars or negative reviews. I considered and discarded that idea when I wrote the original post, above.

What I was searching for was a way forward to sharing what we enjoy without encountering a scenario I've seen happen more than a few times, now.

Let's look at the following:

- An author creates a harem fantasy piece - a werewolf litRPG that somehow ends up tone deaf on Judaism, gender, abledness, and race. Still, RR readers enjoy the cover art and the combat sequences, and it scores a solid 3.9.
- A separate author writes something some people here would enjoy, but a handful of unspecified others would *hate*. It has some good reviews and a starting rating of 4.5.

I think it's reasonable to expect a storm of negative reviews and downvotes for the second example, while the first probably wouldn't see the light of day here - and thus avoid the righteous wrath of every single reader here.

When I originally posted, I didn't see a way to avoid wrecking the poor person writing that second story. I still won't condemn someone for writing a bad review. That's just me whining about someone else doing something they think is right.

At the same time, I recognize that I could have prevented an author whose work I enjoy from getting a metaphorical gut punch. I think it's a good talk to have. I can see a win both for those who enjoy some works as well as those who don't - if we're a bit more careful.
