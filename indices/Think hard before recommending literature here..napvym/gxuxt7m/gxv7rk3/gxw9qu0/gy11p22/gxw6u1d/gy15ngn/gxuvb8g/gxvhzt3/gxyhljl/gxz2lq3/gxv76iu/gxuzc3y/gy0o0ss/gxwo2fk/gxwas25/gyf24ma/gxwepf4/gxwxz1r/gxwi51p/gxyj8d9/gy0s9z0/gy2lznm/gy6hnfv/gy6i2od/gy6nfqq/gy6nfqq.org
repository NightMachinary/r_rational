My objection isn't to Kindle itself, or even necessarily to the business model where a story draft is temporarily made public and then removed once the finished version goes up on Kindle. That's basically fine, and if people want to engage with fiction on those terms, more power to them. I'll even read a story like that on occasion, if it's from an author that I trust to handle the switch well.

My objection is instead to a growing group of authors who, having realized that the Royal Road -> Kindle pipeline business model is unpopular with certain readers, decide to mislead their readers into thinking that the story is being Patreon-funded and will stay up indefinitely in order to get the people who would not willingly read the story on those terms to read it regardless, hoping that the desire to hear the ending will bait their hoodwinked readers into buying the book on Kindle.This includes one case that I'm familiar with where the author /actively lied/, swearing up and down that the story was going to stay up forever, only to release the Kindle version and delete everything but an advertising stub within the week.

My ire is especially reserved for the small handful of authors who double dip like this, starting up a new Patreon account and a new Royal Road account, start charging for advance chapters and then looks for the maximally cliffhanger-y chapter on which to replace their story with a link to their Amazon page after revealing that they're actually a well known Kindle author who has done this several times before. Often while continuing to charge monthly payments on Patreon, if the reader doesn't manually unsubscribe. It's incredibly infuriating and is the main driver of my unwillingness to engage with stories by authors who monetize their stories via Kindle. At this point, my default assumption is that they're probably a scammer pseudonym.

I make a few exceptions for authors like, eg. Sarah Lin who always make it a point to announce the plan in chapter one of their book and to give a month long period during which current readers can finish the story before taking down. That's the golden standard, since it makes it clear from the outset what the reader is getting themselves into. Someone who wants to monetize via Kindle, or who wants to switch from Patreon to Kindle and who does something along those lines (announce the plan as soon as practical and give a long enough period relative to the story length for current readers to finish) is fine by me. It generally isn't enough to get me to /read/ their story (after all, a scam artist can make the same claims), but if they do as they promised once and then start up a second story on the same terms, I might consider reading their second instead of rejecting it outright as a probably scam.
