As one point on the graph, I'll note that a rec on this sub is what brought /The Two Year Emperor/ out of complete obscurity. Had it continued to languish, would I have continued writing and publishing? Perhaps, maybe even probably. Still, I might not have and I'm sure there are others who would get discouraged at echoing silence and change to some other hobby.

tl;dr There's a chance that this sub is the only reason for the existence of 2YE, Team Anko, Squiring the Phoenix, The Tinker's Daughter, The Change Storms, The Patchwork Realms, Marked for Death, and a bunch of other fiction that's been moderately popular here.
