By popular novel standards, WTC has quite the low rating on RR. There is a disconnect between what the readers on this subreddit consider good as opposed to the preferences of the general populace roaming RR (and understandably so).

I don't write my fiction to be rational in the way this subreddit enjoys, so whenever my work was recommended here, my ratings took a dive. A lot of my writer friends experienced the same---many of whom are the cream of the crop when it comes to producing free fiction for the internet. In some (not always light-hearted) ways, the reader-base of this subreddit has become a meme amongst us.

But that's not to say you guys aren't awesome. Personally, I appreciate all the feedback I get, and even if it isn't all praise, I have received a lot of kind words from [[/r/rational][r/rational]].
