Haha, I wasn't intending to critique the post to the point of not being worth sharing. Did I fall into the very trap the OP is warning about? Wouldn't that be poetic?

I think it's a good post actually, thought provoking, not necessarily something I immediately agreed with. And I wasn't being completely rhetorical, authors can choose sites that have no review features, though no one can stop people commenting elsewhere like on this subreddit
