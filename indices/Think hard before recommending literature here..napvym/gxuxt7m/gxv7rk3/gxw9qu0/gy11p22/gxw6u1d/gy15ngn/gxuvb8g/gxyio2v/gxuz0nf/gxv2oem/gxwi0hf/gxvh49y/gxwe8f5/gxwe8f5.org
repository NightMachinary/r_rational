Considering that the community hardly agrees with the definition then the only way to get a feel for what rational is, is by the consensus of consumption which requires at least passive participation on the subreddit.

I'm not seeing much benefit to author's posting here just cause they saw the subreddit name and realised it was a place to harvest readers and advertise.

If it's good members of this community will share it, either posting it if they're confident in its rationality or in the recommendation thread which no one expects to be full of rational gemstones and yet is still the most active thread on this subreddit
