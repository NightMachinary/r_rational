Regardless of all else, the two things I'd emphasize are qualifying your recs and being aware of risks.

If you're going to make a rec here it should be qualified. You should be able to say "so, this story focused on X and Y, if you don't like those things, you probably won't enjoy it" or "I admit this story has weaknesses in its writing, like A and B, but if you look past those I think you'll enjoy it." Basically, if you want to make a "good" rec here, you should be objective enough to moderate people's expectations. If you make a rec without any qualifiers I will immediately assume you think it doesn't /need/ any qualifiers, and if it's not good enough for that to be true, I will be disappointed.

As other people have said, I think each author can make the cost/benefit analysis for themselves. Yes, if you post a rec here, you will attract some degree of negative attention, which may very well outweigh the positive attention. But different people will feel differently about how much of a risk that is, or how worth it it is. So I wouldn't make a general de-rec of posting recs here, I'd just say "be informed about what you're doing."

Basically, inform people and be informed yourself. Easy.
