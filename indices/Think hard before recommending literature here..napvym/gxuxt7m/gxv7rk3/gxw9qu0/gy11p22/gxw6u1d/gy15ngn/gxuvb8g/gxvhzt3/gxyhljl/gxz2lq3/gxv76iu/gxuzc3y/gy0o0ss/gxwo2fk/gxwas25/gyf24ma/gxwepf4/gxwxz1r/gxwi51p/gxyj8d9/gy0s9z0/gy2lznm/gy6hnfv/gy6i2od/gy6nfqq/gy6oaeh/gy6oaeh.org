Ah, yeah, well, actively lying as a business model does strike me as a bit blatantly opportunistic and morally/ethically questionable.

I hadn't made claims either way, and wouldn't consider such a course of action.

I can also see why it would make you incredibly angry to be victim of a bait-n-switch. Seems like that you're anger is justified towards that individual or set of individuals. I know I would be cursing mad.

I just don't want to be unintentionally included in that group if I'm forced to make the switch. Which it's looking more and more likely I will be at some point.

I'm reasonably sure that the majority of authors on royal road are more likely to be a similar set of circumstances to me than the one you described.
