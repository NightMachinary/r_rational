While this is true, if nobody posted works that go against the grain of this sub the quality of the sub would quickly deteriorate. We would drown in a deluge of near identical wish-fulfilment isekai and generic cultivator stories.

One one end, this sub wants to promote rational good writing and rationalist stories. On the other, it is enamoured with silly litRPG escapism. As we see again and again, these two roads are usually NOT convergent. Probably the closest to a story that is BOTH decently rational AND rpg-escapist is Mother Of Learning, and 99% of content here is not as good as MoL (which itself is just good-ish).

If people like op are not here to go against the grain, we will soon be "rational" only in name. And that would be damn shame.
