My reason for posting above is not to lash out at anyone rating a story as they see fit. Please take it as a caveat for those sharing stories they enjoy that want to avoid an author taking a hit in ratings or negative reviews.

The bulleted advice at the bottom of my post is what I'm hoping people take away from this - especially the final point.

As an example, if someone recommends a cultivation story with a warning that it's a cultivation story, readers who dislike cultivation stories are less likely to click the link and downvote because it's a category they consider bad.
