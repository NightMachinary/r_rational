Then you are the type of reader I like to have! Out-of-character decisions that force plot, usually in the form of an idiot ball, are my biggest fiction pet peeve (right next to characters that rely on plot-armor and deus ex machina to survive). Rational (heh) feedback is infinitely more helpful to an author than rage because he didn't spend two thousand words navel-gazing every possible outcome of a character decision or complaints that the MC acted on his emotions instead of being a robot operating on cold logic at all times.
