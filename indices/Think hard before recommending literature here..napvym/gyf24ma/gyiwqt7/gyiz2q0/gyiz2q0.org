WTC has 2 million views when it was more of an AOOO fic to start (where it has 700k). It didn't really have the normal RR trending>growth explosion which I think probably influenced the rating somewhat.

If something isn't rational, it's against the rules to post here at all, so I guess I don't get that part.

I think the readers on this sub may be a little more critical, but I doubt the reviews are '1/5, not rational!!!11'.

I tend to give constructive critical feedback in my reviews (usually end up as a top review because I take some time with it). I don't think I've ever reviewed based on rationality. There's also a difference between 'this character is acting in a way that doesn't make any sense' and 'every character has to be a giga nerd like HPMOR or I'm going to mald!! 1 star!'
