I would like to disagree with you, but, as a recent member, I don't have the background to construct a statistical analysis of the pros and cons of posting a new fiction here. Nor do I have the motivation to engage in statistical analysis of anything even if I did.

What I do have is self-promo posting experience as a new royal road author to this subreddit. So, I believe I can post from personal experience (famous last words, I know).

What I personally experienced here was a good selection of people, both who enjoyed and didn't enjoy my work. I'm super happy about those who enjoy it. Those who didn't make me a little sad, like seeing a puppy not getting adopted but having neither the time or money to do anything about it.

In the middle of those two, I got some really good criticism that will allow me to better my story. While it's hard to determine if they came from here, the timelines coincide enough for me to make a general guess.

So, while I can personally see your argument, my unfact-checked opinion is that the conclusion is off. Rather than not recommend works at all, I would argue that works should be recommended after a certain posting time. For example, if I was hit by possible negative critics within the first few days, it might have tanked my work. After 1-2 months? I either was already successful or already tanking. Harsh criticism wouldn't derail my project any more than I had or hadn't already done so myself.

I guess that's my long-winded way of saying I'm glad I was recommended here. Then again, that recommendation was also what allowed me to discover this sub, so I am partially biased.

To other members: If you've gone through the effort of reading this almost filibuster, you might as well check out my story! =)
