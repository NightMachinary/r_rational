I understand this is a question for him, but hopefully an answer from me would be somewhat acceptable.

If my first criticism was a 2/5, and it took weeks before I got the next one, two, however many... then yeah. That initial 2 score would be emotional devastating.

Devastating enough to stop writing that story, anyway. I wouldn't go out sniping kittens over it.

Even if later reviews brought it up weeks later, the initial... rejection?... would have been enough to significantly alter my opinion.

The cost/benefit analysis for continuing to write would have showed me in the red for long enough to call it a wash and chuck it. And if I loved writing and dreamed of being a writer (which I do and do), then that negative would be an even bigger injury.

That's just my personal internet stranger viewpoint, for whatever it's worth.
