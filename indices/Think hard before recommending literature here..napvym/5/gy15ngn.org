Yes and no.

I think rat-readers are more /outspoken/ readers. The normal readers read and then move on with their lives. Rat-readers are more likely to engage with the story and other readers. Among that demographic, it's always going to be outweighed by the people who have a bone to pick vs the ones who don't.

So yes, you're going to get more negative reviews. I posted my story up, and the first few comments were negative. While that sucks to read, it's not the end of the world either. Some of it was useful feedback, and I implemented it happily because I saw value in that.

On the other hand, my fic gained a steady 20-30 readers whereas on Royal Road, the type of story I had written would not have gained any traction on recently updated (The demographics on recently updated *heavily* favor cultivation, gamelit, or isekai.)

Currently my fic is now #5 on trending. I don't think it would have eeked out into the #50 at all unless I had posted it up on reddit. I'll post hard data to back up my claim: [[https://i.imgur.com/paf2oEo.png]]

It wasn't a huge boost - (trending overshadows everything) but it was significant enough to overcome the disadvantages I started with - namely being a complete unknown with 0 previous following, and writing the wrong genre.

Once it hit #50 on trending, now my fic was visible to others who would have actually liked to read it. At that point, it was all up to how good the fic actually was to stay up there. But I don't think I would have eeked onto there without that post on reddit.
