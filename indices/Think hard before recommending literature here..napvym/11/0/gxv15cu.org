Work like you don't need the money, dance like nobody's watching, rec like the author doesn't need the ratings?

The issue is admittedly systemic. Still, I want good things (or at least a lack of bad things) for people who work to make things I like. Anyone looking to post a rec here should do so with the knowledge that it can and often does backfire against the author.
