depends on the purpose of posting your story. Me, I use sites similar to RR to Beta-test my writing before trying to pitch it to a commercial ebook publisher. I delete my story off these sites the moment some publisher decides to give my draft a chance of making $. Becasue of that, I WANT negative reviews, the pickier the better. Critics are free editors!

But some people post solely on RR-like sites, and for them the ratings are life's blood of their relationship with the readers.
