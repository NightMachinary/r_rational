A bit late to the party, but I think my opinion is a bit of a hot take here:

Well Duh, the audience which a community attracts that advertises itself as 'for smart people' will obviously correlate with entitled pricks. And going to the site to downvote a rec you don't like, rationalized with "giving meaningful criticism" to "put it in its place" is absolutely something an entitled prick would do?

I think the recent Delve drama is a clear example off this: What kind of person wants to ban a story from being rec'd here because they don't like it? An entitled prick who rationalizes their position with "it doesn't belong here! I'm actually doing everyone a favor, totally not just getting constantly annoyed at seeing people enjoy something I don't think they should!" that's who.\\
(To be fair the argument was mostly about the top level weekly post, but the point here is that individuals who fit the above stereotype would absolutely be correlated with this sub's community)

This community has a bad reputation, and for good reason. This sort of reaction should be expected IMHO.
