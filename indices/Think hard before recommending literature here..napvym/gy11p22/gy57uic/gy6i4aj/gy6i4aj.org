Not OP, but I remember HPMOR and its fans got a lot of sneering over on the DarkLordPotter HP-fanfic community back in the day. The rational(ist) fanfic readers also get a fairly mixed reception on Worm's Cauldron discord.

There's a bit of a perception that rationalist fics are written as attacks on the work they're based on, putting obnoxious minmaxers and science-cultists as protagonists, with prose that nitpicks and laughs at inconsistencies, etc. Natural, then, for fans of the original work and normal fanfic of it to get a bit defensive and lash out.
