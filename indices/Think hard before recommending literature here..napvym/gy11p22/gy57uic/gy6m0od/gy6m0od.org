Every community has bad actors, different ones correlate with different types of people including people with traits you would call unsavory. [[/r/rational][r/rational]] has a disproportionate amount of entitled pricks, that doesn't mean it ALSO doesn't have a disproportionate amount of individuals who are very skilled in dialectic, reasoning and rational thinking.

I personally prefer this community to most others I've seen because I appreciate the above traits, that does not mean that it doesn't have individuals with behaviors I don't like, just like in every community, and IMO it so happens that the correlation of these traits would inevitably lead to the phenomenon described in this post.

[[/r/GeeJo]] addressed some examples, and to be honest, I haven't actually seen personally much vitriol against [[/r/rational]], mostly from hearsay (but there have been top level post in the past along the lines of "why does everyone hate [[/r/rational]]?" which I could dig up for you if you like.) but as mentioned, a community advertising itself as "for smart people" would obviously attract displeasure for both good and bad reasons.

"For good reason" Includes people just feeling insecure because the fact they don't enjoy rational fiction may make them feel insecure in their intelligence, to people pissed at situations like this where [[/r/rational]] tends to gatekeep and look down on work which doesn't reach its "standard".
