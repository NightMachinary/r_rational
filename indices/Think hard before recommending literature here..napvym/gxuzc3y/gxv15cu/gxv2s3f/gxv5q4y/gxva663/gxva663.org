I think that's true of recommendations anywhere. It is impossible to share the gospel of your favorite story without the possibility that people will dislike it. Even if you recommend a thing in private conversations, to people you are sure will like the thing, it remains possible that you will be wrong and they will dislike it and review accordingly.
