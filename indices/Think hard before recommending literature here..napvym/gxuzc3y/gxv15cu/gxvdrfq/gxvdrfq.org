  Still, I want good things (or at least a lack of bad things) for people who work to make things I like.

Checking your post history, your last recommendation was pretty blank. Not even a mention that stories are young and short at the time of posting.

My advice is to identify and mention major flaws/sacrifices that author allowed. Writing something that helps readers to check if they are in the target audience is good as well. In other words, filter people with negative reviews early.

Complaining that recommendation brings risks feels like thinking about "traffic and ratings" first, readers second.
