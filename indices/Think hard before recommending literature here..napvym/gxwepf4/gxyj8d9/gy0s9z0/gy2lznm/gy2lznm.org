Thanks for your feedback. As I mentioned, im using a site LIKE RR not RR itself (due to writing in my mother's tongue not English). Of the 5 novellas I managed to pitch this way, all had a countdown up front (X days until it goes off-site!) So that the readers would know id advance that the story might disappear, and why. Second, I only ever posted finished stories all at once, not in instalments or chapters, so my readers could read the whole thing in one sitting, and if they liked it, maybe buy it at a later date.

Other than that, I fully agree with what you wrote. Authors should always be transparent with their intent, and most importantly, should not post stories in chunks - which I think is a cancer that damages both the author-reader relationship (the dreaded hiatus!) and the quality of writing (spaghettification of the plot).
