I was just debating to debate, because it seemed like a fun argument to make, btw. I hoped that came across, as when I reread it, I could see it being taken under a different tone.

Edit to add: Which isn't to say there wasn't a good bit of honesty I included above. There definitely is. The amount of money I've made via the Royal Road to Patreon model is enough to maybe--maybe--pay my water bill. Not nearly sufficient to become a full-time writer.

What that means for readers following my work is that, for those writers like me, the only way for me to continue to provide the story they're enjoying would be to make the switch at some point in the future.

It's unfortunate, as I would love to continue to write as you described above.
