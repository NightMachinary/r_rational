I apologize; I misread some of your comments on one of the Elemental Arena posts and thought that you were replying as the author.

That said, I looked at [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fg2u2s/a_convenient_fiction/][the post]] on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] for your story, and it's sitting at +29, with 88% upvotes (I can't get the math to work out to a whole number; 33 up and 4 down is 89% up, where 34 up and 5 down is 87% up). At a glance, most of the criticism in the comments looks constructive. And the RR rating is >4.5 stars, from 8 ratings. So I'm still left wondering what "annihilation" you're referring to. Is this story an outlier from the effect you're describing, or are 5 downvotes and what I calculate to be at most one two-star review (if the other seven are all five stars) really the kind of negative effect of posting here that would lead you to discourage people from doing it?
