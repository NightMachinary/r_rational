  Months later, I tried my own hand at writing something, posted it here, saw my post get downvoted, then saw my own stars rating get annihilated.

  This has happened at least two more times since then.

This comes as a surprise to me. Looking up your posting history, you seem to be the author of The Elemental Arena, which, as I recall, was pretty well-received here, and seems to have a high rating on RoyalRoad.

Was that an exception to the above noted annihilation, or was the negative impact from readers in this sub overwhelmed by others?
