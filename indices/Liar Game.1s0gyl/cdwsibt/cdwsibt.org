I highly reccomend this. In most games, I've been able to predict moves before they're revealed to the audience, but rarely able to catch the full gambits being worked. None of Akiyama or Nao's opponents are stupid.

Part of what I love about the Liar Game is that there's strategy and tactics. The tactics are how you win in the individual games; the strategy is how you achieve your goals and acquire allies throughout the rounds of the Game.
