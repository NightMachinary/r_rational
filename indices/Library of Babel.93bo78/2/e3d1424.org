Checkout [[https://libraryofbabel.info]]

It's a virtual and searchable library that contains every combination of 3200 characters (lower case letters, commas, periods, and spaces) and has 10^{4677} virtual books!

And before you say this site is fake (you're right, it's impossible to store all that data, much less search through it) I can guarantee there's a way to do this without remembering your searches and giving back fake results.
