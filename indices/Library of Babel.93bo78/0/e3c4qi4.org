I also enjoyed it. I was introduced to it in the context of combinatorial problems. It's easy to feel frustrated when one imagines living in such a universe. I wonder how likely it is that, out of all that countless multitude of men trapped in the library, one of them found themselves in a room full of coherent near-misses of comprehensible books. That person might wonder why the library is full of misspellings instead of full of nonsense.

What did you like about it so much?
