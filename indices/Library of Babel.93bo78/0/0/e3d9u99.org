Assuming that there's infinite people to populate the infinite library, the likelihood is 100%. :)

I liked it specifically for its explorations of infinities. The fact that a word could be defined correctly in our language, and that exact same sequence of letters defines the same word correctly in a different language, even those the same word points to two different things *because the words in the definitions mean different things, and correct in context, and just happen to be spelled exactly right in the two language to make this work* was incredibly neat. But then the following "Are you sure you're reading what I meant to write?" was the best follow-up mind-fuck ever. :)

I also really like the fact that this appears to be a book found within the library itself, and may not have been actually penned by anyone at all. It makes sense of references to the world/past we know in a universe with no place for them.
