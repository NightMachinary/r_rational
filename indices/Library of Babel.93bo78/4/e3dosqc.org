In the Rational!Library fanfiction, the rational librarian uses statistics and compression on books to predict the likelihood of the next symbol based on the previous symbol, taking book location into account. We learn a lot about mathematical formulations of complexity and prediction on the way, with asides about the metaphysical implications.

The protagonist starts will the null hypothesis that it's totally random. It turns out it's not, the compression algorithms actually work, and there's a discernable effect by location. The protagonist eventually becomes able to predict what sort of book will be found where, and constructs a high-dimensional book-space which describes where various books can be found.

In the story, the protagonist would probably at first conclude the books were meaningless and ignores them, having the philosophy that's easier to just write your own books and live your life. It would infuriate the establishment powers when she gets closer than anyone else to actually solving the mystery.

In the end, the axis of the book space don't actually correspond to anything meaningful. At one extreme is simply volumes containing only the letter "A", at another is volumes containing only ".". Discovering the location a meaningful book within this dimensional space requires basically writing the book.

Effectively, thanks to the protagonist and her algorithm, if you really want, you can write a book, and get the location of that book in the library. But that's useless, of course. The people who ignored the books on the shelves were right all along.
