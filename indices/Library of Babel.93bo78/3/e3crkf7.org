Sometimes this story makes me sad. There is a sense of longing for TRUTH. As if any truth was more or less random than any other. What this story makes me think of too, that is way more interesting, is the lore that developed around The Button or around the Place. People develop secret societies, there is writing that takes place, arbitrary stands, battles for what feels like a good cause. It feels so real until you step back and look from the outside.
