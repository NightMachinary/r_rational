It depresses me that they are all so obsessed with finding Truth in the books. Even if it was there, they'd never find it. They couldn't trust it to be truth without independent verification, which makes anything they do find worthless. But books are such potent cultural artifacts of Truth that they hijack everyone's truth-seeking into searching for the Right Book rather than doing the hard work of experimentation or creation. :(
