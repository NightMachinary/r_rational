Borges is all very much like that. He wrote a lot about math-inspired concepts like this. Heck, I should re-read some of his stuff, I don't remember well what I read.

BTW since we're talking surreal short stories with a science-inspired topic, may I suggest something else? Italo Calvino's "Cosmicomics" take inspiration from various ideas in astrophysics and turn them into short stories. They tend to be more humorous than Borges - like the one about a bunch of people living very uncomfortably squashed together inside the primordial egg before the Big Bang - but they have a lot of wit and creativity in how they bring abstract or mind-blowing physics concepts down to Earth.
