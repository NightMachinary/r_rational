This is by the same author who wrote Crystal Society, the first of the [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][Crystal Trilogy]].

I haven't actually read that work myself, but this short story is just as thoughtful and well-written as I expected based on the very positive reception of Crystal Society here.

Or, to sell it another way, it's a DS9 Star Trek fanfic looking at Ferengi in their element.
