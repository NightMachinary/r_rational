Just out of curiosity, has anyone else read [[http://www.amazon.com/Balance-Power-Star-Trek-Generation/dp/0671520032][Star Trek: Balance of Power]]? I don't think by any stretch it's rational, but it's clever and made good use of the Ferengi... If anyone's looking for a laugh it's a short, entertaining book.
