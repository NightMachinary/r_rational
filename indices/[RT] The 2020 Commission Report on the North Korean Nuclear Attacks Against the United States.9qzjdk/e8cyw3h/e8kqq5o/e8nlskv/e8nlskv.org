  I'm kind of wondering how a book by a random author would contribute meaningfully to reducing a risk that could be incurred by an organization with more resources, intel, and institutional knowledge than said author could ever hope to have. Rest assured, no country acts on information controlled and distributed by its own privately-owned civilian media companies, despite what social media comments might say.

I might be remembering wrong here, but wasn't there something about how "Dr. Strangelove" actually highlighted some major flaws in the US nuclear defence system? I seem to remember there even was something like people freaked out because they thought Kubrick and the author of the original book had some whistleblower who passed them classified information about certain authorisation procedures whereas they had just guessed them and figured them out with logic.

Anyway I think they key issue is something that E.Y. discusses a lot in "Inadequate Equilibria". It's not that the experts don't know - they surely do - but that the system they're part of may be set in a way that discourages following the most rational course of action (for example, there are political factions which mean criticising someone on your side will be perceived as a slight, cost efficiency in the short term is rewarded over long term security, etc.). Just because a system is /supposedly/ about maximising US nuclear safety doesn't mean it will /actually/ maximise that before everything else. People be peoplein'.
