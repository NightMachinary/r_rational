I'm kind of wondering how a book by a random author would contribute meaningfully to reducing a risk that could be incurred by an organization with more resources, intel, and institutional knowledge than said author could ever hope to have. Rest assured, no country acts on information controlled and distributed by its own privately-owned civilian media companies, despite what social media comments might say.

There hasn't been any accidental nuclear war yet, and that is mostly due to the high levels of responsibility and rationality demonstrated by the nuclear-capable superpowers. Mutually Assured Destruction is a thing, a sort of extremely cold, lethal rationality cranked up to 11.

According to another reply in this thread by the OP, the conflict uses tactical nuclear attacks by the North on South Korea. This would /never/ happen in reality due to the cultures involved--neither Korea wants to /destroy/ the other, they both have the desire to re-unite as one Korea (though obviously under their own government, not the other's). While one side *MIGHT* consider retaliating if the other started it, neither would strike first with such weapons. North Korea nuking South Korea out of nowhere would be for them like Arizona nuking California by surprise would be for us.

These little details are probably why it's a *LOT* easier to go all Rational on a piece of well-known fiction than reality. If one overrides reality too much, one's work might as well start as fantasy anyway.
