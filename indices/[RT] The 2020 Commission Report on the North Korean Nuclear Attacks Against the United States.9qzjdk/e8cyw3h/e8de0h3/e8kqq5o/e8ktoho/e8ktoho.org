"I'm kind of wondering how a book by a random author would contribute meaningfully to reducing a risk that could be incurred by an organization with more resources, intel, and institutional knowledge than said author could ever hope to have. Rest assured, no country acts on information controlled and distributed by its own privately-owned civilian media companies, despite what social media comments might say."

There have been lots of reports that the current President doesn't read the briefings prepared for him, and he certainly seems to respond to whatever issues are on Fox News with Tweets and sometimes policy pronouncements. See also how Reagan reacted to the TV movie "The Day After": he said it was "very effective" and left him "depressed", even though he should already have known the consequences of nuclear war from briefings he received.

The US President has complete nuclear launch authority with no formal checks or balances, by design. In the few minutes where a launch/don't launch decision would be made, the available resources, intel, knowledge could not be brought to bear.

There have been incidents where a nuclear war almost happened and was averted by individual judgement. You've heard of Stanislav Petrov, right?

In the book, the North comes to wrongly believe that a US invasion is under way, so it strikes the South to disrupt that. So it believes that it is retaliating. The scenario for how this happens seems very plausible and well-researched.
