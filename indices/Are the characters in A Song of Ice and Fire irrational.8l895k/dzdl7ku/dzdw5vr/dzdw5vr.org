A lot of the characters' decisions make sense when you know where those decisions are coming from.

For instance, honour makes a lot of sense when you're in a large power imbalance: think of it as an iterated prisoner's dilemma. A Lord gets very little by defecting (acting dishonorably), but doesn't risk much by doing so (see: most of the mad Targaryens). A vassal can get a lot by defecting, but risks getting crushed entirely (see: House Marmont, House Rayne). And if /both/ sides defect, you get full-scale rebellion, and everybody loses (see: Robert's Rebellion, The War of Five Kings). Now, consider that defection in one round raises the risk of the other side defecting in the /next/ round, and it should be clear why people are hesitant to act dishonorably.

Now, take the Starks, who have spent their lives living in that paradigm, and transport them to King's Landing, where betrayal is less risky and more rewarding, and make it clear to everyone that they're /never/ going to defect, and they're going to be thoroughly outclassed by everyone else playing the game of thrones. Which is why Ned didn't want to go in the first place.

In the books, at least, Robb married Jeyne Westerling for honour's sake, which explains that choice as well. They were expecting a reprisal from Walder Frey, but it never occurred to them that it might happen while guests in his home (because the gods wreak terrible vengeance upon those who kill guests).

Dany was in a no-win scenario as soon as she decided to set up in Meereen. Flying away on Drogon might not have been the best choice, but I can't see many better ones.

Tyrion has been in a mutual-hate relationship with his father since the day that he was born and, at the same time, trying to prove that he is worthy to become Lord of Casterly Rock. Every achievement he accomplishes is spit upon, and every finger he has to step upon for those achievements makes him more universally loathed. Small wonder he has become cynical and sarcastic.

Cersei has been living her life waiting for three prophecies to come true: that each of her children will be crowned and die early, tragic deaths; that another queen, younger and more beautiful, will take the throne from her; and that she will die with the hands of the /valonqar/ (little brother) around her throat. Is it any wonder that she's protective of her children, and hostile to Tyrion, Sansa, and Margaery, to the exclusion of all other character traits?

Catelyn's choice was explained pretty clearly: she thought the death of Jaime would also be the death of Sansa and Arya, and the whole camp was spoiling to kill the Kingslayer. She could let him free, or watch him die, and her daughters with him.

Balon... Yeah, he was stupid. One rebellion cost him two sons and a third as hostage; trying again, even in a time of turmoil... Even if it worked, it would only last for as long as it took for the Seven Kingdoms to sort themselves out again and come back to crush them in force. His only real chance was to ally with the North, and that bridge was burnt when Theon came back to him having forgotten what it meant to be Ironborn.

As for negative consequences... Harry himself, in HPMOR, points out that people tend to be optimistic beyond what reality would justify. You can't really blame them for a quintessential human failing.
