The characters in A song of ice and fire all act according to flawed human interests. one of the strengths of the book is that every characters is a flawed protagonist of their own story.

That doesn't mean ASOIAF is actually irrational. Rational fiction allows characters to act according to emotion, it doesn't require everyone to go full Spock.
