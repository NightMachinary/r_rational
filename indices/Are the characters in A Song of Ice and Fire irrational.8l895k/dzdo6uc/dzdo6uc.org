It bothers me, not that they make flawed choices, but they seem spectacularly unaware of the potential downsides in their choices. The characters tend to take very little action that might mitigate the side effects.

It is like all the idealism that can be used to create interesting characters, but little to none of the self preservation instinct that keeps such people alive in the real world.

GoT still manages to make interesting characters. It is just tough to maintain suspension of disbelief on some of their more boneheaded decisions.
