Okay, I know of no convenient ways to transport significant quantities of water to another plane.

The only spell that actually makes a portal to another plane is Gate, which is a 9th level spell that lasts for 1 minute.

I guess Demiplane sort of qualifies. Demiplane is an 8th level spell which gives access to an extraplanar 30 foot cubic room for 1 hour. Also not a great option.

I suppose Magnificent Mansion might be usable for the disposal of more convenient waste, but it's a 7th level spell.
