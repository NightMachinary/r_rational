Well, the Wishbound World has a very long history. Most Decanters are quite old. Imagine that the formula for crafting Decanters is public, and all one needs is a vial from a whirlpool from the Elemental Plane of Water (as suggested in Xanathar's.) Now imagine that a major city produces 1 Decanter per year. There are 100 major cities. 100*2000 = a whole lot of decanters that have accumulated over the ages.

This is a gross simplification of course, as the rate of Decanter production is somewhere between linear increasing and slow exponential over time. But you get the idea, and in the modern Wishbound World there exist something like 1-10 Decanters per 1000 people.
