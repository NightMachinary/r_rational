If you have one Decanter for a village of 100 people, I feel like people might go with the belt-and-suspenders approach-- having a Decanter is handy, but having at least one or two cleric or druid trained in farming-useful spells is even better, because they can do other things, and you're not doomed if some bandits take the village treasures.

Anyway, great thread, I'm enjoying this take on productionizing D&D spells and items.
