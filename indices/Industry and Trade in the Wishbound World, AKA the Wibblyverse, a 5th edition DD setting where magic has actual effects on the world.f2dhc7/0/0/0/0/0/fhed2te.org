The question isn't whether it's permanent, the question is whether the cost to transport water to another plane is less than what you gain from using Endless Water, gallon for gallon. If you get an X gp gain from using 100 million gallons of water, and it costs X-1 gp to get rid of 100 million gallons of water, then it's fine to use temporary portals to get rid of it.
