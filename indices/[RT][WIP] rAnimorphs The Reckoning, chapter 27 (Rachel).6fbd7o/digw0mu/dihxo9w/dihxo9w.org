Honestly, just seeing Rachel respond to several pressing crises is kind of fun, even if all she ultimately does is talk to people and slowly go insane.

It's like how one of ME2's best missions was about tracking down and talking to a serial killer, with no combat gameplay at all; when you're the GM, if you want your players to be excited, you need them to have a clear goal and be worried and make important choices under pressure; but you don't need people to shoot things at all.
