Whoa boy. Lots of stuff being set up...

The David situation was entirely predictable, of course. I wonder when one of the Animorphs will decide to check his mind again just in case?

I'd like to take this opportunity to ask some questions about technology in this universe.

1. In this chapter, Ax says: "Your momentum coming out of Z-space is effectively arbitrary." This seems like too powerful of a technology. Could you create infinite energy by pushing mini-hyperdrives into Z-space, popping them out at large speeds, and harnessing the resulting kinetic energy? Why not use such weapons all the time in space battles, since not even an absorption field protects against such energies? (As the Ellimist [?] says earlier, the pool's absorption field would not have withstood even Visser Three's asteroid. Relevant quote: "The shield was destroyed, on Visser Three's orders, but it wouldn't have saved you anyway. The word â€˜indestructible' is a little misleading---Seerow's engineering is impressive, but it can't compete with an explosion the size of a million atomic bombs.").

2. The morphing technology, like magic in HPMOR, seems like it should be /arbitrarily/ powerful. Even setting aside the question of extending the technology to create mass out of nothing or to create things that aren't biological (all of which might be explained by the techno-babble we got from V3's first chapter), morphing still apparently relies on /brain emulation/, which begs the question of why the Andalites aren't a post-singularity species yet. I'm just going to speculate that due to intervention from the Gods, Seerow stumbled upon a piece of biotechnology from a far more ancient and powerful race (such as the Ellimist's original species) and, unable to unravel its full capabilities, hacked it into a version of the morphing tech. I'll also speculate that artificial intelligence is just very difficult in this universe, and somewhat limited in its capabilities. (It's clearly possible, since the Chee exist).

3. I believe this question was asked a very long time ago, but if you acquire multiple people and construct a hybrid morph from them, and then activate the brain of this morph, whose mind wakes up? Are the minds of the components all blended together, or is there just no mind at all?
