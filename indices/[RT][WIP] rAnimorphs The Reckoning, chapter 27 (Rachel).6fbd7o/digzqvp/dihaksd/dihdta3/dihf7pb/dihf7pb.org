    Based on what Rachel was thinking, they will do a check
  #+end_quote

  Wait, where in the text was this?
#+end_quote

This part of Rachel's inner monologue after the David thing:

#+begin_quote
  It could have happened like that. Happened just wrong, been perfectly timed for the worst possible outcome. I didn't know. *Couldn't know, not until a day or two had passed, and the memory had coded itself and we could do a morph check.* And in the meantime---
#+end_quote

Emphasis added.

#+begin_quote
  Well, there is some travel time in Z-space, but I assumed that most of the 7 cycles were just the Andalites giving Ax time to carry out his orders.
#+end_quote

I don't recall anything in the story mentioning what the real-space equivalent of Z-space travel speed is. Travel time could be anything from a few seconds to almost three weeks, but if it's on the shorter end of that scale then there's not much point in saying they need to time it.

Compare "I've timed my letter to arrive in three weeks" to "I've timed my email to arrive in three weeks". Emails have such a short travel time that you may as well say "I'm sending my email in three weeks". This is weak textual evidence, however (it could just as well mean that the Andalites are very precise).

  Couldn't you strap a small hyperdrive on a boulder and launch it at a nearby enemy spaceship?
#+end_quote

Assuming acceleration was virtually instant and travel time was very low, yes.

There may be an in-story explanation (e.g. some sort of shield that could work at ship scales but not planet-wide), it may be handwaved away, or it may be that the setting is about to be broken wide open.
