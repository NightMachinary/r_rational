  Based on what Rachel was thinking, they will do a check

Wait, where in the text was this?

#+begin_quote
  "We will time it to arrive in seven cycles" makes it sound like there's non-negligible travel time involved.
#+end_quote

Well, there is some travel time in Z-space, but I assumed that most of the 7 cycles were just the Andalites giving Ax time to carry out his orders.

  Same principle as not using nukes all the time, I think.
#+end_quote

Maybe, but this seems like potentially a more precise weapon than a Nuke. Couldn't you strap a small hyperdrive on a boulder and launch it at a nearby enemy spaceship? Presumably you intend to totally destroy the enemy spaceship anyway. Perhaps there are just more efficient weapons.
