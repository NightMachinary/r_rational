It's kind of a throwaway plot point in Ellimist Chronicles.

Ellimist starts voyaging from planet to planet and help the natives in subtle undetectable godly ways; then Crayak shows up and starts killing everyone Ellimist helped because he's the bad guy. They keep this up for a while, Ellimist tries to save people but Crayak is just better at killing them. Ellimist starts being depressed because apparently even when he's a god he's a loser.

Short story shorter, after spending some time with Andalite cavemen, he decides that he can just start seeding life on as many planets as he can, faster than Crayak can destroy them. It works, and he creates the Pemalites for that purpose (also fun and pacifism, in the image of his lost people).
