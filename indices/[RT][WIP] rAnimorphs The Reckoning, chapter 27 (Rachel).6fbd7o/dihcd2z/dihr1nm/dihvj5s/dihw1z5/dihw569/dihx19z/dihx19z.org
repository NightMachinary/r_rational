I kind of thought that was the whole Yeerk MO. Even without the creativity to invent new strategies, they probably understand "Hide from a scary superior enemy, infest new hosts while out of sight" pretty well since they're not the dominant species on their homeworld.

So their default MO when faced with an enemy with more resources and technology would be to hide and try to infest planets faster than the Andalites can find them; if they infest 10 planets and the Andalites only find and purge 9 of them, they're good!

Which is a nice parallel to canon!Ellimist's strategy against Crayak, probably one of my favorite ideas from original Animorphs.
