  If there is even one survivor of that planet with a Z-space capable ship, they could retaliate in kind

So if the Earth has a couple of hyperdrives lying about, can't they make the counter threat of "if you destroy our planet, we'll destroy yours?".

Admittedly it would involve Ax agreeing to levy the threat, as he's the only one with key info such as "how do we use this thing" and "where do we threaten to throw our rock", which I don't think he'd be all too happy with. (And I'm suspecting that there might be other issues or impracticalities I'm not considering. Maybe the hyperdrives they have are too small, or it takes maths and physics that humanity+Ax just don't have).

But even just saying "by the way, we've got starfighters here" and raising the possibility would be one hell of a deterrent. If the Andalites think that there's an actual chance of a retaliation genocide, well, that's the sort of thing that makes you think twice.
