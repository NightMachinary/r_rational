Nuclear bombs are very difficult to manufacture, requiring resources only available to nation-states to mine, purify, and breed the radioactive materials. Plus a lot of technical knowledge to construct the bomb itself.

Individuals in this story pilot ships with hyperdrives by themselves all the time. This isn't a nuke, it's a car bomb...and those happen all the time. But neither car bombs nor suicide vests have the lethality of a planet-busting nuke.

You've run into [[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/prelimnotes.php#johnslaw][Jon's Law]]. In particular:

  So one of the logical ramification is that if drives are too powerful, there won't be any colorful tramp freighters or similar vessels. As a matter of fact, civilian spacecraft will probably by law be required to have a remote control self-destruct device that the Patrol can use to eliminate any ship that looks like it is behaving erratically or suspiciously.

One other defense might be as follows: My understandingâ€‹ is that you can put nearby matter into Z-space by hijacking. There's no "parking brake", just put your ship near (or around) the other and make the jump. So one defense mechanism would be to have a few Z-space capable ships in orbit, and a monitoring system that watched space near the planet for fast-approaching objects coming out of Z-space. If you see an object, you FTL jump to it (13/14ths light speed is nothing compared to FTL travel), come out of hyperspace, grab it, and jump back to hyperspace with it in tow. Hopefully you pass through the planet in Z-space.

Now, I am not familiar with the mechanics of Animorph Z-space. Perhaps you can just come out of warp at the center of the planet, which makes this defense impossible. Or there is a hyperspace jammer they can turn on, or the planet itself has a hard limit on how close to the gravity field you can jump and the bomb crosses that line in microseconds.

But it seems ridiculous that this universe has no terrorists.
