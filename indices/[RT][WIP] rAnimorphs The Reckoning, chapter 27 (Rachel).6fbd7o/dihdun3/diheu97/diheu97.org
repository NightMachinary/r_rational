It has happened, in history unknown to Ax, in other parts of the galaxy, and it resulted in the predictable total mutual annihilation. I think I might manage to squeeze in somewhere that this is why the Skrit Na are itinerant nomads. But while it /has happened,/ with a 'd' at the end, it's not something that /happens,/ with an 's.'

Sort of like how nuclear bombs /have been/ used in war on Earth, but (at least so far; fingers crossed) they /are not/ used in war on Earth.
