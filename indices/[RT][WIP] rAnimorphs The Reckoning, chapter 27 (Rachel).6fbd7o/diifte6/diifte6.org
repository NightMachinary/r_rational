Rachel is wonderful. Perhaps a bit less smart than some of the others, or intelligent in a different way, but that and her recklessness and ruthlessness give her a unique insight into certain situations. In that way she can easily step into the shoes Cassie often wore in canon, as one of the grounded team members. The fact she knows Cassie well /and/ can be critical of how /she/ would have done things is just icing on the cake.
