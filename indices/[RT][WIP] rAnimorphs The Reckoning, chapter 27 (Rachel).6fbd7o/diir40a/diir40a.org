So... my office has blocked AoOO for "violence". Very few pages are blocked. At least FF works. Time to get stuck into it. So exciting!

Another wonderful chapter - after having a hard time following the previous one, I found this one really straight forward, the /in media res/ part was easy to pick up, and everything got explained pretty well, only now I'm wondering what David is up to and how we can stop him...
