  Tyagi probably doesn't want to bring that up.

It would be nice if one of the Animorphs /did/ bring it up.

Rachel: So what happened to that shard we gave you last month? We got it from Ventura, so it was probably Aftran, right?

Tyagi: /awkward silence/

TemrAx: For that matter, what happened to that shard that was in the cylinder Prince Jake offered to Illim?

Rachel: /awkward silence/

  Remember, Lirem asked for both Earth's current position, and for the shape and rate of its orbit
