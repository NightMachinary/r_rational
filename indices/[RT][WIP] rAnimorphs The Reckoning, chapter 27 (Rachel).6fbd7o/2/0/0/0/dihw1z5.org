It's only been two years. I think Alloran's the only Controller who'd really make the connection (the Naharans could figure it out technically, but not strategically) and Alloran /very much wants the Andalite people alive and under his thumb if at all possible./

In general, he's strongly life-conserving/life-preserving, Ventura being a notable outlier but not /really/ relevant given Yeerk fungibility and seven billion humans.

Also, Andalites are spread across multiple planets, so even if he takes out the home world, they can then retaliate against every known Yeerk-occupied world.
