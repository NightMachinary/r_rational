"Hey Lirem! It's me again. Okay, the thing is, I've talked with the humans, and they talked with the yeerk fleet, and we agreed that, if Earth happened to blow up /for any reason/, they would send a rock to blow up the Andalites"

"You're bluffing."

"Oh, by the way, I'm not actually Aximili. I'm the yeerk controlling Aximili. We know how to bypass earplugs now. So don't blow up our new planet or else."

"... Shit."

Seriously though, it would be kind of strange if yeerks had the technology to blow up the homeworld of their sworn enemy (and with it, their supply lines and reserve troops) and had just sat on it.

Maybe the yeerks only use stolen hyperdrives? Like, the technology is too advanced for Naharans to reproduce, so their only option is to steal hyperdrive from Andalite civilian ships and those are hardcoded to align to the average velocity of the star closest to the exit point?
