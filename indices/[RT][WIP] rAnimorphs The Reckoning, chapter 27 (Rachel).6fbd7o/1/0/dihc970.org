Ax used the word "effectively" because he didn't want to take the time to explain that yes, there's still a moderately large energy drain and yes, you can only push so close to the lightspeed limit (not .99 or even .9c). You /could/ use this process to harvest kinetic energy, though. It wouldn't be infinite, but it would be efficient.

Morphing tech has a wrinkle that hasn't yet been fully explained, only foreshadowed.

If you make a hybrid, there's no underlying mind at all. It's a "feral" brain.

I considered having 4. be true, and having that be a ... disposal method ... that Rachel or David could use, but I decided against it. Note that if you /eat/ something, you can destroy it, so there's clearly some wiggle room there.

For 5. I sort of assumed it got destroyed, but given the circumstances of the fight in the pool and the teleportation and whatnot, it's possible she has it on her. Thanks for the reminder.
