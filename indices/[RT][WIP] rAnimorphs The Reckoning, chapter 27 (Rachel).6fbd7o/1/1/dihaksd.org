  The David situation was entirely predictable, of course. I wonder when one of the Animorphs will decide to check his mind again just in case?

Based on what Rachel was thinking, they will do a check as soon as the memories have had time to be fully encoded (1-2 days, apparently).

  Why not use [Z-space projectiles] all the time in space battles, since not even an absorption field protects against such energies?
#+end_quote

Same principle as not using nukes all the time, I think. If you create a precedent for using that technology, you start the escalation that ends with it being used to destroy your homeworld (although that's basically the slippery slope fallacy, non-rational people may buy into it anyway).

It's also possible that they require a lot of setup. Just because you can target an asteroid across the galaxy with arbitrary momentum doesn't mean you can do so instantly. See this quote from the previous chapter:

  A sudden instinct told us not to answer, but it was no use. ‹Then all it takes is a simple rock,› he continued. ‹We will time it to arrive in seven cycles---if you have further business with these Earth-people, conclude it by then.›

"We will time it to arrive in seven cycles" makes it sound like there's non-negligible travel time involved.
