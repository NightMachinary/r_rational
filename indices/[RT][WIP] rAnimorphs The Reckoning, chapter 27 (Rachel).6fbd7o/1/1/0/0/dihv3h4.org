  Maybe, but this seems like potentially a more precise weapon than a Nuke. Couldn't you strap a small hyperdrive on a boulder and launch it at a nearby enemy spaceship? Presumably you intend to totally destroy the enemy spaceship anyway. Perhaps there are just more efficient weapons.

Maybe its max accuracy is a few hundred kilometers. Handy for orbital bombing, useless for space battles that don't take place in Star Wars movies.
