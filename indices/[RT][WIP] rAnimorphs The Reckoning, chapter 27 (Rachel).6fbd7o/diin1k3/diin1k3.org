  If I may offer a bit of constructive criticism, I'm having a hard time following the conversations and would really appreciate a few more dialogue tags to mark speakers. Especially in conversations with more than 2 people.

Seconding this.

Additionally, the thing about Rachel being confused or messed with and having intrusive thoughts is.. confusing. I don't know what's going on and I feel like I've missed something. Can we have an interlude where we see what ellimist and crayak are up to that also functions as a little bit of an exposition dump? I'm getting lost and I don't want to be lost.
