Too far this time, unfortunately. It's just hard to get a frame of reference and grounding for Rachel's thoughts --- we don't have an established baseline?

I liked marco's bit with david: a single definitive intervention, clearly showing the contrast. Obviously rachel is of interest to ellimist/crayak --- I remember "The Return" --- but this tug of war (?) is just confusing. Mystery is not confusion! Confusion is not mystery! These unreliable narrators are too unreliable! I'm going crazy!!
