Remember, Lirem asked for /both/ Earth's current position, /and/ for the shape and rate of its orbit. Presumably nailing that to the Sun (and being able to extrapolate the Sun's movements from simple observation) is enough.

I was treating the shard Tobias gave Poznanski as being dead by now, thanks to the fact that humans almost /certainly/ wanted to dissect and study it. Tyagi probably doesn't want to bring that up.

If I were the Animorphs, I'd probably give them Essak, but /not/ Temrash. Ax seems to have a good thing going, all told, even if people other than Rachel react negatively to his ET-call-home decision. But yeah, there's not really any way to guard against that sort of treachery. You could try getting a Leeran, or agree to have the Yeerk drain out after 24 hours before getting back in, or have the oatmeal providers do a werewolf contract thing, but all of that is risky.
