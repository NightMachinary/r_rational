Hold on just a second - how does Z space coordinate-setting work? The Andalites dun goofed and that rock isn't going to be there in 23 days like everyone's assuming. By the time it actually arrives, the Earth will be in another part of its orbit and nowhere close to the rock coming out of Z space.

...hopefully no other planet/moon is in its path when it comes out either. But space is vast, thankfully.

There's still that extra single shard of Aftran that Tobias gave away in a stasis cylinder. He hasn't remembered about that one yet?

After joining with Telor, are Temrash and Essak going to be returned like they were? How will they prevent Telor from putting highly modified shards/completely different ones back into Ax and Peter?

This chapter came out quickly! Glad to see that you're back in the writing groove.
