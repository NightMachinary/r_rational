Good summary lol. I'mâ€‹ trying to base my assumptions on the text, with some slight extensions based on comparable real science and comparable sci-fi. I'm sorry if I've misunderstood some of the text, but I like to think I'm a relatively careful reader.

  Note that Visser Three's got a giant fleet, but among his thirteen Star Destroyer equivalents and starfighter complement, there are fewer than 200 hyperdrives. And he's the MAIN military antagonist active in the galaxy at present.

Wow, that's shocking. I guess I forget that Ax and Elfangor are exceptional. I would have guessed the Andelites, with a population of one billion, would have at least a few thousand hyperdrives, if not a million! Humanity, with a population of seven billion, have on the order of 20,000 commercial jet aircraft. How do these many species and their huge galaxy-spanning societies function in an interstellar context with so few hyperdrives?

  There are terrorists in the galaxy, but note that most successful races have stronger-than-human social pressures and hive-minding.

That is an interesting note. A sort of resolution to the Fermi paradox: it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself, unless it has strong self-preserving social pressures?
