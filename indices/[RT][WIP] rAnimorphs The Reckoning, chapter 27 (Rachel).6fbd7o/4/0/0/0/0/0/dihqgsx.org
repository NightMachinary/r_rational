Hearts.

The Andalites probably do have a few thousand hyperdrives in total, including all military, non-military government, scientific, and civilian ships. But they're not all that galaxy-spanning ... a few dozen worlds, and that's it, and also most of them are homebodies and don't really have wanderlust. Elfangor was the Andalites' premier war hero after Alloran's fall, and one of /very/ few warriors with a ship under his complete and unquestioned control (i.e. no officers' consensus needed).

The Yeerks probably have nearly the same amount of interstellar capability as the Andalites, by now, but that's after harvesting /several/ other races and booting up manufacturing capability as quickly as they could.

The Skrit-Na probably have the /most/ Z-space capable ships, given their nomadic nature. But yeah, what I wanted to show was something like, think of how expensive a real-life X-wing would be, given near-future technology. We might make a hundred, as the world's largest military power, and it would cost tens of billions (if not trillions) of dollars.

I always thought it was silly in e.g. Star Wars, when ships were treated as throwaway, and you could afford to lose hundreds in any given battle. If /I/ had an X-wing, I wouldn't let it just get potshot out of the sky ... I would be /extremely/ cautious in how I used it.

That's where I got "hyperdrives rare and expensive," and from that, I got "people don't really use them as bombs," which seemed sane from the perspective of retaliation. Sort of how Ender's Game got retconned such that the Buggers /always/ had Little Doctor tech, but they never dreamed of actually using it.

Note that Earth probably /could/ produce millions of hyperdrives. In canon and this AU, Earth is oddly unique in that humans are super prolific given their relative intelligence, and also the ground and biosphere are rich with resources. That's why V3's bothering to mess with us instead of just saying, /too hard, screw this/ and going elsewhere.

re: Fermi paradox, I haven't thought about it /too/ much, because in the end I can always fall back on "the gods did it" (though I want to avoid doing that too often). But yeah, the fact that most of the species we've seen thus far are either hive-mind-ish (Yeerks, Andalites, Howlers, Leerans), deontologically cooperative (Chee), or hanging by a thread/low-tech (Hork-Bajir, Taxxons) could give clues to the Great Filter in this universe.
