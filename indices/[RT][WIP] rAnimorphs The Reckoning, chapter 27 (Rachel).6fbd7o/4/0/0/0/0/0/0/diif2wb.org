So, I'm now wondering why Elfangor, who came to earth in the first place with the intention of exterminating humans to prevent them from falling into enemy hands, used whatever experimental method he tried instead of firing a few of these hyperspace bombs you guys are discussing.

Especially since he knows about the godlike aliens meddling. Especially if he knows about their balanced move rules. Even if the enemy stops those relativistic projectiles from hitting, it seems like it gives the guy in your corner quite a bit of future wiggle room to use on your behalf.
