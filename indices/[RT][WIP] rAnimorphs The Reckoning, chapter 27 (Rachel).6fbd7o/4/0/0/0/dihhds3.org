Hyperdrives are very difficult to manufacture, requiring resources only available to nation states or large manufacturing powers, plus a lot of technical knowledge. Note that Visser Three's got a giant fleet, but among his thirteen Star Ddestroyed equivalents and starfighter complement, there are fewer than 200 hyperdrives. And he's the MAIN military antagonist active in the galaxy at present.

I like your descriptions of various defenses, most of which would technically work, against inept or halfhearted attacks (so, like 90% of them). But yeah, a clever enemy would e.g. have the thing pop out of Z-space half a light second out and moving at .6c. And entering and exiting Z-space isn't the sort of thing you can do in a tenth of a second, or multiple times per second.

There are terrorists in the galaxy, but note that most successful races have stronger-than-human social pressures and hive-minding.
