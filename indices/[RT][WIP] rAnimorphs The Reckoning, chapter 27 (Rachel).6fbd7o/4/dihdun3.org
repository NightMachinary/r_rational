Why has no individual ever wiped out a planet? Are z-space capable ships particularly hard to come by (maybe like, aircraft-carrier level), or do the species with access to them not produce members with that kind of mentality? (I can come up with plausible reasons why no Yeerk or Andalite, or team of rogue Yeerks or Andalites, would ever do it, but is there a separate argument for all species with z-space capabilities?)

If it's the latter... what happens when humanity gets their hands on them?

(Are bug fighters z-space capable?)
