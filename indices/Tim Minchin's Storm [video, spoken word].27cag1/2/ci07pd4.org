  What I thought more important, and valuable to the debate, was his monologue at the end about the size of the universe, our relative insignificance, and how this, as well as advances in modern science, somehow inspire him. This is, I assume, his "vision" for life, his "meaning of life," his great manifesto for how an atheist worldview shapes someone's being.

  Which reveals how utterly empty his philosophy is. The fact that you're going to live twice as long as your ancestors is inspiring? Really? Modern medicine is what gives your (twice as long) life meaning? What hope does that offer the sick? The dying? The victims of failed medicine? Those without access to medicine? Minchin paints a vision of a world enlightened by science--but what good is all that science if your life still sucks? If you're too poor to eat, if you have no family, and no wine to enjoy while tossing around cliches? That dying infant, made up only of carbon, just like you and me, won't be able to do any of the things that Minchin thinks give his life meaning. Is the baby's life meaningless, then? A pointless speck in the universe whose existence is no more important than his nonexistence? And even if you do have a "good" life with a job and a wife--what advice can science offer you about how to treat her, or your children, or even worse, your enemies, or those who impede the march of almighty science?

  Atheist philosophy about the "meaning of life," which I assume Minchin is talking about, is utterly materialistic. It can't be anything else. And because it is, it's cruel, because no matter how bad your material world may seem, as a Christian, you are a child of God, and have a soul. It offers no hope and places no ultimate value on human life...which is comprised merely of carbons anyway. A viewpoint which, in my opinion, is far more ripe for criticism than the positions Minchin ridicules.

I'm an atheist, but I find myself agreeing with this (about this particular form of atheist philosophy). When I'm in great discomfort, thinking about the size of the universe and the advances of the modern science doesn't really comfort me all that much. Of course, once you've rejected religion on a sound basis, it's not really an option anymore, but there's a wide range of worldviews compatible with atheism. Personally I think something like extropianism or other forms of "secular religion" are far preferable to me. Sceptics and typical atheists sneer at this for its resemblance to religion. They think their particular kind of worldview is the baseline, not being aware of their own mental models with which they process the reality. This lack of self-awareness leads them to mistakenly believe they don't have such mental models and they just objectively process the world as it is, which couldn't be further from the truth.

Like fashion that's invisible to people living during that time but looks ridiculous later on, I think time will show that this particular form of secularism will just be a whim of time and future atheists will have radically different worldviews. Of course, so will extropianism, but at least it's more fun imo. Once you realize you will always have mental filters, why not just use those that make the life most fun?
