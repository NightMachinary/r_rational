Appreciating the advances we've already gotten through identifying reality for what it is, is not necessarily exclusive to working or hoping for more advances further on though.

I don't really see Storm as advocating simply accepting the current state of affairs or not hoping or wanting more, but simply focusing our observational efforts on the testable reality instead of non-provable what-ifs.

The rest honestly just seems to me as noise, "I can't see how someone can have hope thinking X, therefore X is an hopeless worldview and cruel and any other objectives which are equivalent to horrible".
