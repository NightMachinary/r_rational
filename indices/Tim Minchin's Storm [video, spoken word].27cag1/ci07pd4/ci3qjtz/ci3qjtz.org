1) Taking solace in "living twice as long" /is/ fundamentally extropian in outlook, as it refers to the ability to improve the human condition.

2) It's not the /size/ of the universe per se that gives comfort. It's more the hindu-buddhist-ish attitude concerning our non-privileged position in the universe. It's easier to detach when you don't see yourself as separate and centered. "Guilding the lily" here is putting up fake dualist stuff like gods and souls, rather than appreciating your unity with the actual, real universe.
