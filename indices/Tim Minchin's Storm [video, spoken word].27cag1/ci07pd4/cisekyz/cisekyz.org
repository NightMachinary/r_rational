  Once you realize you will always have mental filters, why not just use those that make the life most fun?

I agree with everything except this bit. You should not only /notice/ that the universe just sits there being lawful, you should /give thanks/ for it. From a certain extropian point of view, the fundamental unoptimized lawfulness of the universe is what makes the whole thing a fair game: we're not trapped, we make our own decisions, and our choices have real consequences.

Of course, Minchin's "Isn't all this... enough?" tends to result in my screaming "NO YOU FUCKING APOLOGIST!", but that's just because I went directly from moderate belief-in-belief-in-religion to hotblooded-maniac extropianism with no intermediate stage of "regular" disbelief.
