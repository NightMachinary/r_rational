Caught up and it's surprisingly enjoyable, but I agree with the others that the implants do all the work for him and everything gets overexposed.

Additionally, I think you introduced way too many characters early on that don't actually matter, at least by the current chapter. I can see Aylin being more important later, but every other Polarii viewpoint feels like a waste of screentime.

I think you have some great ideas, and the story has been improving with time (I particularly like when we get a look at the character's thought process as he designs a spell or course of action) but yeah there are a lot of parts that need to be polished before I consider this rational.

I'd highly recommend rewriting the fluff out when you get the time, and maybe making the implant worthless as anything other than raw processing power, because right now it really is too powerful. He's already got endless buffs from his class abilities and a bunch of blessings from the gods, he really doesn't need more help. Not even just that, the parts that the implants skip are the parts I would find enjoyable to read.
