#+begin_quote
  The Magineer is a web serial about programmable magic. A scientist/engineer from Earth's future is transported to a different world in a scientific accident.

  Caught in a war between two enemy nations, one of which is trying to enslave the other, it all comes to a choice: what will Ethan West do?

  But first, he has to answer an important question: in a world of magic, is science still relevant?
