Wow, this general thread made me want to give this story a read, and your comment is making me doubt a little about it. One sure thing : I found your post quite interesting, really.

Now, I didn't read the story, but from what I can pick in what you quote, about the "years worth of knowledge" make me think it's talking an average amount of time to learn a rough amount of knowledge. In other words : "without those implants, it would have taken him hundreds of years to learn everything he knows"

Also, while modern SF&F readers don't need to be explained what cerebral implants are or do, there's this possibility that author's intended target is wider in scope, or younger, or something like that that would explain the need to explain :) (maybe ?)
