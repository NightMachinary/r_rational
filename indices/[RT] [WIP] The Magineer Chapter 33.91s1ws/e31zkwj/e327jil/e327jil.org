  Ultimately, the prose itself is pretty good. Enough so that I'm not knowledgeable enough about writing to notice any negative parts that may exist.
#+end_quote

I would say it's meh. Exposition is clumsy and things are explained that don't need to be. Here's a section from the start of chapter one:

#+begin_quote
  While his field of study was applied quantum physics -- a field which had appeared not too long ago, he strongly disliked pure theory and liked to “get his hands dirty”, thus, he was also an excellent mechatronics engineer and computer programmer.
#+end_quote

First, the punctuation is off: "a field which had appeared not too long ago" is an appositive clause, so it should be surrounded either by commas or emdashes, but not one of each.

Second, "show, don't tell". Instead of asserting that he's excellent at his job, just show him being excellent as the story develops. Check out Rick Cook's "Wizard Bane" for a good example of how to do that. (It's available for free from the Baen Free Library.)

Third: None of this is necessary. The scene it's contained in is him doing experiments with the quantum field, so we can figure out that he's a quantum scientist. Add in a sentence like "The robotic arm was freezing up again and he'd had to reboot it twice tonight; he made a note to check the code in the morning." Boom, we know he's a programmer.

The next paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  With help from his cerebral implants, he had managed to study multiple fields of science like so many of his peers. The implants granted one eidetic memory, and could hold hundreds of years' worth of knowledge. Many scientists naturally used them to further their research.
#+end_quote

First, modern SF&F readers don't need you to explain what cerebral implants do.

Second, "hundreds of years of knowledge" is a weird phrasing. Information is typically measured in quantities like 'petabytes', not in temporal units. (Sidebar: Also "information" and "knowledge" are subtly different, and I don't think "knowledge" is the right choice here. "Knowledge" is generally used to mean information that is stored in the human brain, and it carries implications of understanding and experience as opposed to pure facts. That's very much a subtlety, and the author's bio says that he isn't a native English speaker, so it's not a big thing.)

Finally, why is that last sentence there? Isn't it obvious that something which enhances cognition would be popular with scientists? Unless this was intended to be a bit of worldbuilding referencing the fact that these implants were so cheap and so safe that they are available to a broad swath of society. If so, I think there would have been smoother ways.

All in all, this is clearly a first novel. It's an above-average first novel in that spag is generally solid, but it's definitely a first novel.
