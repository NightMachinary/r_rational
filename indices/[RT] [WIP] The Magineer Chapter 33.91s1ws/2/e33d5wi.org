Ugh the story Its fine I guess but I don't like how little science there is in it. like I mean the mc seems to just effortlessly discovering things all the time. well its more that the AI is the one doing the researching. when I saw the title and premise and the fact that its in this subreddit I imagined someone figuring how magic works and munchkining it . But the mc doesn't really seem actually that competent .

That doesn't mean that its necessarily bad . But its just not really the kind of thing I expected or like. Basically I was expecting something like a hero's war , but so far this is more about how op the mc is , and how he magically figures everything out and how much of an outside of context problem he is.

I guess I could still end up liking the story but so far it doen't seem interesting to me. I don't think its bad , just meh.
