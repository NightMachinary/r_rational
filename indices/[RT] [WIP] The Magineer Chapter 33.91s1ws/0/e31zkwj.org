I've been reading through this for the past few hours; I'm about to start Chapter 27, but I just wanted to share this quick tidbit about my thoughts so far.

I really like the premise. I love people using science on magic, even if I don't like the LitRPG aspect as much. But there is one big thing to point out.

*This fic is not rational.*

I haven't been following the new definition discussion that's been going on, but this is clearly not rational. Multiple characters end up holding idiot balls, there are multiple deus ex machinas, and the protagonist is clearly OP to the point of me not being worried about him at all. Gods are almost cast as good/evil, being Orderly or Chaotic, and they're supposed to be personifications of their domains, but act right.

(Literal personifications of eg. Death act alien in how they think. Think AI optimized for one particular aspect or fae a la Dresden Files. These gods are supposed to be like that, yet also act like humans like Greek gods. Note: Greek/Roman gods merely control their domain; they're supposed to be very human.)

The idea of his AI is awesome, but overpowered and poorly defined; it doesn't make sense for it to be as it is, ie., it should have caused a singularity already due to its overpoweredness in his home universe. There is no antagonist that improves as rapidly as he is to be considered dangerous. Yes, there's more powerful beings, but it feels like he'll eventually surpass them.

I could continue breaking down this story's anti-rationality later if anyone wants me too. (I'm on mobile and it's late.)

Ultimately, the prose itself is pretty good. Enough so that I'm not knowledgeable enough about writing to notice any negative parts that may exist. Despite this, the quality of the characterization, the plot, and the world-building are lacking (in my opinion). They're not good enough to be declared rational.

Is this a satisfying story that I'm going to at least going to get caught up? Yes. Will I continue after that point? I don't know. It's not rational enough for me to stop being annoyed to some extent, and I don't particularly care about any character. It feels like a story where the author will eventually write themselves into a corner and be unable to finish it. Maybe they won't, but down the line, the author is probably going to have a tough time working on it regardless.

I like the prose, but it's not rational. This is okay, but I just have high standards. I love your ideas, but implications were not fully thought out. Again, this is okay, but not for this subreddit. Know that I'll still follow this for a little while.

I wish you luck and happy writing.
