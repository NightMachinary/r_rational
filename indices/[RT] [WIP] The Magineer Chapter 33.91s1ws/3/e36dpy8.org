  He finally gave up and went back into his /simulated lab/. He immediately resumed his experiment.

  Today he was /modelling the new subatomic/ particles his *AI had detected* upon entering this world.

  He'd discovered 2 so far. He hadn't completely figured out their natures yet.

  The first seemed to react to spell casting, the second seemed to power it somehow.

  He was sure there were more particles to be discovered, but he had *no idea how to detect them*, short of emitting them himself.

Thinking of quitting at chapter 6... so much wrong here... /The AI should be able to model those particles, if it can simulate them./ *He also can't detect particles in a simulation, if his AI can't detect it and didn't know about them.*

Sounds more like science cargo cult or techno babble. Sadly programmers forget sometimes there are physical limits you can't program away.
