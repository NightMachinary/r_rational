  Right, but he could have made his own deduction and then, instead of testing whether he was right by swallowing the pill, could have tested whether he was right by taking the pills in for analysis.

That wouldn't be as fun for him, and as others have said he's motivated mostly by fun (or rather by avoiding boredom).

He sat down and got a decently real way to test his observational skills with real consequences. I don't think the tension was necessarily "can he figure it out?" but rather "can he resist the temptation to test his theory?"
