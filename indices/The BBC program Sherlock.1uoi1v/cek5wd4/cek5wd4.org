I don't think so. Going by the checklist to the right, I'd say we hit maybe three of the five - there's /occasional/ holding of the Idiot Ball, and the characters aren't driven into conflict by beliefs and/or values. The biggest Idiot Plot was in /The Reichenbach Fall/, where Moriarty's plan was frankly pretty moronic. Sherlock also spent the pilot episode deciding whether or not to eat a pill to see whether it was poisonous, even when he knew the gun was a fake, instead of just stealing the pills and then getting them analyzed. The TV Tropes page has a big [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/Sherlock][headscratchers]] page with more.

I guess my bigger problem with it is that it's just Sherlock on the side of good and the abjectly bad guys on the other side. Sure, he uses his wits, and the show is much better about that than the books, but if we're just going by mysteries that don't have gaping plot holes I think that's a somewhat low standard.
