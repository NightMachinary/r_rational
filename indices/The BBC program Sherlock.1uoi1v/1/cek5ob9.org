I havent seen the show in a little while, but I know Sherlock meets at least all but one of the main criteria of this sub. The only thing I dont remember well enough is if Moriarty has some utility function other than 'Be Evil'. Also, thank you for announcing that the newest season of Sherlock has started, I wasn't aware.
