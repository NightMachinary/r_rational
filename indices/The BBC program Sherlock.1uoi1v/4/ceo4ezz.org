If I was Sherlock, I wouldn't be solving murders. It seems that he could do so much more by focusing on gaining a lot of wealth and then systematically attacking global problems. Or perhaps focusing on existential-risk issues. Or perhaps minimizing global conflicts. Or making original scientific discoveries. I mean, he can infiltrate criminal networks, speak many languages, learn things lightning fast, and solve very complex real world puzzles. But to use it on crime fighting, as an adjunct to regular old law enforcement?

It doesn't seem like he's doing as much good as he could, if he thought a bit more creatively.
