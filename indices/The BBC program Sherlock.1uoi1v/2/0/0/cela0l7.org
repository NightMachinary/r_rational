Actually, as of starting to watch Series 3, I'm kinda agreeing with you. His character development is /really/ being cranked up as he spends more time with the rest of the cast, showing that what even he claimed was "high-functioning sociopathy" was actually just a shortage of peers when he was growing up.

Which he and Mycroft reference: they thought Sherlock was an idiot until they met other children.
