  Yes and no. Some characters clearly are, but Moriarty was pretty much just evil "for the evulz".

As [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1uoi1v/the_bbc_program_sherlock/ceka871][322955469 pointed out]], I think both Sherlock and Moriarty are motivated by boredom, not "good" or "evil".

  Not fully there. I guess, theoretically this is true, but either you'd need to be a savant yourself, watch at half speed or rewatch the episode before reaching the conclusion. Some of the clues are blink and you miss it, while others are more obvious.

I think that more often than not, the blink-and-you'll-miss-it clues aren't as important as the obvious ones (or not important at all, like in [[#s][Season 3]]).

  Not really. Although technology is sometimes used as a McGuffin.

I loved that in /The Reichenbach Fall/ [[#s][Season 2 finale spoilers]].
