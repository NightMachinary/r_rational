Or Moriarty. "Consulting criminal" sounds like a plausible guess for "profession most likely to make you X-risk-affecting amounts of money"; I could see Moriarty as simply an extreme case of a consequentialist (do lots of little evils leading up to one big good), who likes to play with the people nominally on the side of good by implying he has no higher purpose, all the while knowing he'll "earn out" every good thing they've ever done in the end.
