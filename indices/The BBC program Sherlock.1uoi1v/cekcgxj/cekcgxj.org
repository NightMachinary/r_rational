Let's go over the sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  The characters are not stupid. No one holds the Idiot Ball (or at least not the main heroes or main villains).
#+end_quote

Half true. There is some idiot-ball holding by both the main characters and the villains, but it's pretty minor and some of it /could/ be explained away.

#+begin_quote
  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Check. This is pretty much how all problems are solved.

#+begin_quote
  The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.
#+end_quote

Not fully there. I guess, theoretically this is true, but either you'd need to be a savant yourself, watch at half speed or rewatch the episode before reaching the conclusion. Some of the clues are blink and you miss it, while others are more obvious.

There's also the aspect of Sherlock's memory. His "mind palace" is the entire city of London, so you can pull pretty much every type of knowledge out of his mind and get away with it.

#+begin_quote
  Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

Yes and no. Some characters clearly are, but Moriarty was pretty much just evil "for the evulz".

#+begin_quote
  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

Yup. We know about everyone's abilities and for the most part the story is set in the "real world."

On to the bonus points:

#+begin_quote
  The main character uses (or tries to use) rationalist and scientific methods to demystify seemingly mysterious phenomena.
#+end_quote

Sherlock definitely does this. He might not be a rationalist all-star, but his methodology for solving problems is very influenced by rationality and the scientific method. (He does the "boring " parts, like research, but the show generally doesn't show this.)

#+begin_quote
  The story teaches sound lessons about rationalist techniques, which can be applied to readers' lives.
#+end_quote

For the most part: nope.

#+begin_quote
  The story hints at or embraces transhumanist ideals.
#+end_quote

Not as far as I know.

#+begin_quote
  The story deals with the dangers and potential of powerful new technology.
#+end_quote

Not really. Although technology is sometimes used as a McGuffin.
