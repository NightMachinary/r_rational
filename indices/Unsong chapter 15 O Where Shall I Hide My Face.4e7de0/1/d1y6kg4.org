Thoughts:

- It's interesting that the /wrongness/ only seemed to happen once she crossed the threshold into the UNSONG facility.

- The punctuation is different in Ana and Aaron's telepathy between this chapter and the previous one:

In Ch. 14 (Aaron's viewpoint):

[Aaron]...[I've come to save you. Are you there?]

[Ana*?*]...[Ana, I can take care of myself...maybe...Ana, get out!]

In Ch. 15 (Ana's viewpoint):

[Aaron*?*]...[I've come to save you. Are you there?]

[Ana*!*]...[Ana, I can take care of myself...maybe...Ana, get out!]

- Looking someone in the /eye/ is very precise, so Ngo probably isn't limited to just seeing the presence of Names or other forms of magic, she can actually see through the invisibility effect itself.

- I misread some of the action. Some unknown third party used the Tempestuous Name on Malia Ngo to help Ana escape.

- /probably/ a typo, but Ngo had the recoil of the gun knock her /to/ her feet. What was she doing before that, that the recoil caused her to become standing upright on the ground?
