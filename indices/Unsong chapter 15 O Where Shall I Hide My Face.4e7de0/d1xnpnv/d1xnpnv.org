My estimates of Ngo actually wanting to talk and being friendly took a severe hit by the whole 'attempts to shoot + uses combat magic at' thing - before this update I was thinking that the most likely way for the story to unfold would involve Aaron / Ana coming to understand that Unsong is not actively malicious but merely trying to keep a lid on things even as people like them keep doing things *extremely unwisely*. The shooting thing makes that seem less likely - though I could see shooting invisible people being a sensible part of public policy, honestly, all things considered, and it is quite likely Ngo was not in her most thoughtful mode during a prison break accomplished by mysterious means.

The whole 'seeing through invisibility' thing, which only Ngo has, though, makes me feel like Ngo might be either Sohu or possesses similar abilities regarding seeing names etc like Sohu does? I don't know what other abilities would be possessed ONLY by herself and not, for example, also by a small set of elite marksmen/snipers.

Edit: With Ngo's orders: I see [[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shut-down-everyting][what Scott did there]]
