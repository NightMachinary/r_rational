If she has them as the result of a name, though, the point stands. Why not teach that name to the guards posted at every facility? Or even a small, trusted group of snipers with orders to shoot on sight? Or if invisibility is used by UNSONG (for instance, undercover agents that don't have to blow their cover to report in person), orders to report invisible people approaching so they can be detained or allowed in.

If it's a name, Ngo shouldn't be the only one who has it.
