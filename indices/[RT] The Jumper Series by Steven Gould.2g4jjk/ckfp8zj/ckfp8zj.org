I absolutely adore these books. The protagionist is highly rational and the books are well written. I've read some of Gould's other work and it is at least as good as this series, so check those out as well.

There is also an excellent short story available for free on Tor's site. It takes place between the 2nd and 3rd books. It shows some of his charity work.\\

Despite the movie stinking on ice, Gould also write a pretty decent prequel to the movie called "Jumper: Griffin's Story". He brings his normal stellar writing to give life to what was an otherwise shit movie. It's almost like reading an author writing Fan-Fic of their own universe.
