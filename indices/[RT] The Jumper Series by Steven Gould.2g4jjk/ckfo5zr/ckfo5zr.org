There's a thing I'm noticing about the Young Adult genre, in combination with, well, anime - There's very little adult content out there about people becoming healthier individuals. In other words, there's little [scifi/fant] fiction and media for adults that's uplifting - it's pretty much all about broken people getting more broken, because /drama/.
