Ditto - This is what I came to say too ;) It does the best job of pointing out just how alien aliens could be.

Not as big of a Orson Card fan as I used to be, but the later books in the Enders Game series also kind of gets into this.

Uplift books by David Brin kind of go there.

I'm not remembering titles but there was a lot of good stuff in the late 70s, early 80s with the theme of "Human dropped in alien culture" and trying to adapt / go native, kind of as pushback to colonialism/cultural imperialism.

The Sparrow (The Sparrow, #1) by Mary Doria Russell - is another reflection on this - Flippantly called "Jesuits in space", it is inspired by experiences of early Jesuits missionaries in the "New World" - but it is not especially religious, and kind of casts the efforts as Hubris. But the Aliens are Alien, and the author is ruthless... not a warm and fuzzy book...
