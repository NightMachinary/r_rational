Many books by Hal Clement and Robert Forward apply, and the science in these books is also very well researched:\\
Dragon's Egg- A civilization where practically 2d individuals the size of sesame seeds living a million times faster than us inhabit the surface of a neutron star, and make very gradual contact with a human spacecraft.\\
Mission of Gravity- A terrestrial planet as massive of Jupiter but spinning extremely fast, so that gravity at the equator is just a bit higher than Earth's, but the poles have hundreds of times as much as Earth. The inhabitants are millipedes with a culture built around the high and variable gravity.\\
Cycle of Fire- An detailed exploration of multiple alien civilizations on a planet around a binary star where seasons shift rapidly.
