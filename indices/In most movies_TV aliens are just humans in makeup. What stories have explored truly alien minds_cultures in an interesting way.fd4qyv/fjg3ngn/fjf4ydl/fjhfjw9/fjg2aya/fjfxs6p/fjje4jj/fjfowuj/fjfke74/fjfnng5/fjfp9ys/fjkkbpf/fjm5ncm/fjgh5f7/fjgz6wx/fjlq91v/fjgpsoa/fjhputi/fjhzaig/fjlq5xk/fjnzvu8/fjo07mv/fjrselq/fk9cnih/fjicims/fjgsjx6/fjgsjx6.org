Movies/TV are not where you're going to find SF that really explores aliens, or anything else. There just isn't room.

C. J. Cherryh has produced a bunch of great aliens, particularly in the Alliance/Union series and the Foreigner series. Try /Voyager in Night/, /The Faded Sun/, /Pride of Chanur/, and /Foreigner/.
