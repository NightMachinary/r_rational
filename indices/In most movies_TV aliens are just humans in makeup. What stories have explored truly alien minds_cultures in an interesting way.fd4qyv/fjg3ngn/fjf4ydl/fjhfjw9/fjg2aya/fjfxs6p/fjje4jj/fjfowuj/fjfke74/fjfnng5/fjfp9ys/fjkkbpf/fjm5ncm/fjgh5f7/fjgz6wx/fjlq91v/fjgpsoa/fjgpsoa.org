Robert J Sawyer is a scifi author who has several books with aliens in them, usually in the hard scifi genre.

One of my favorite books by him is /Starplex/, in which humanity discovers a portal at the edge of the solar system and goes on to find other space-faring species. One of these is described as 'a watermelon in a wheelchair', another as a 'pig centaur', and another as a hairless creature that is actually water bound, so part of the multi-species ship is underwater. I love that his aliens are not human-based, or even remotely earth-based.
