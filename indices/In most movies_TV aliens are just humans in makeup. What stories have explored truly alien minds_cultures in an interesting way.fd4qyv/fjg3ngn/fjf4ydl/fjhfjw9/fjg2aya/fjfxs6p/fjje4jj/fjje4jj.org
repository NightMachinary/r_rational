The Tines from Venor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep.

Physically, the Tines look basically just like wolves, but their sapience is an emergent property of the pack as a whole which has a massive impact on their culture and their concept of personhood in general.

For instance, a particular Tine is technically immortal since they can add new members to the pack as old ones age and die, but the primary memories and skills are tied to the biological brains of each member, so each person will inevitably change as time goes on as memories are copied and fade. Memories become secondary as they get copied into new members' brains, and then tertiary when they get copied again, and eventually things that happened long ago become as if it belonged to someone else.

The Tines also have an interesting way of relating to their bodies. Since each "person" is the entire pack, the Tines don't consider a single member as a person or even as the same species as themselves, really, but more like a pet that they have to take care of. Biological urges like breeding is done clinically and with detachment, and the Tines raise new pups like a dog breeder would. A Tine could go to a professional breeder to pick up a new pup to add to themselves, the pack, when necessary.

Rather than biologically, intimacy is done by intermixing packs, by literally fusing two Tines into one temporarily. New Tines are created when a large pack fissions, or when sub-sapient members spontaneous come together to form a pack and thus a new Tine. The most intimate act two Tines can do is to trade members with each other.
