Oh really ? Yet, for as exotic as the societies and cultures (most of them human, mind you) he depicts in his tales, most if not all the aliens in them conform to being human-scale bipedal humanoids, oxygen-breathing, with many behaviours common to tool-using, pack-hunting, highly-social hunter-gatherers. In some cases (Emphyrio comes to mind) they're plain indistinguishable from humans, or (Demon-princes) nearly identical. As I understand this is because they're long descended from humans in the first place, which makes sense after eons of space travel.

The only exception I can think of right away are the krakens from â€˜Blue world' and they don't form a society or a culture on their own, it's not clear how smart they really are.

Side-note: Jack Vance is a fantasy and space opera author, I don't think he really does sci-fi. Languages of Pao comes close IIRC but not quite.
