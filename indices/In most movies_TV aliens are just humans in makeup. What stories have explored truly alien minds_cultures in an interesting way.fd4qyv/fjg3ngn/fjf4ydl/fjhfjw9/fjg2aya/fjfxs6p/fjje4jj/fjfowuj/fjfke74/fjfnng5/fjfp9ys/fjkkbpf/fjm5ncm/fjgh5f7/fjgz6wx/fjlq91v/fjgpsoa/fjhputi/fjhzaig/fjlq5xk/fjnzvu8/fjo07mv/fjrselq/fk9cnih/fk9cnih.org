Orion's Arm setting wiki. Various future offshoots of humanity are already weird enough, but the few discovered alien species are even more unusual.

My favorite one is [[https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/470007b39d192][Whisper]] - a whole planet's ecosystem transformed into an acoustic computer simulating a virtual world inhabited by the uploaded aliens.
