[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem][Stanislav Lem]] was /the/ great master of non-anthropomorphic aliens:

Solaris (his most famous work)

Eden (I like it even more then Solaris, though aliens are not so incomprehensible)

Not about aliens per se but their trace: His Master Voice

From more modern SF: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassytown][Embassytown]] by China Mieville
