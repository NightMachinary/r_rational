Bit more of a 'mainstream' example, but Liu Cixin's The Three Body Problem comes to mind. Would also second Blindsight.

You call out movies/TV aliens, and there are absolutely some weirder ones out there, but just by virtue of the medium/actors they need to be humanoid. Most books/plenty of stories /do/ actually do something interesting with their take on aliens.
