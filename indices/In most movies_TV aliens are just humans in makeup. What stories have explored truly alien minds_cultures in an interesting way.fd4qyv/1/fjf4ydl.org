I've recommended Blindsight on this forum a few times; (mild spoilers) it's a first contact story about aliens observing Earth from a base in the Oort Cloud. They discover fast-moving 9-legged aliens they name "Scramblers" but struggle to make any sense of how to communicate with them due to their extremely alien minds. I'd recommend actually reading it for why these aliens are so interesting.

(Heavy spoilers, entire ending and thematic conclusion of the book) The aliens are extremely intelligent, moreso than humans, but they do not have any interior experience of consciousness. Consciousness turns out to be unnecessary for intelligence, and a waste of calories and computing power.
