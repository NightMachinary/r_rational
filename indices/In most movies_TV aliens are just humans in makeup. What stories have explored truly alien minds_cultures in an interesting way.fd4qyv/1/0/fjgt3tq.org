I was going to say Blindsight as well. The other idea with that story is that, when dealing with Aliens, you send a bunch of neuro-atypicals in the hopes that one of them will see what the aliens mean. So they send a cyborg, an AI, a schizophrenic linguist, a semiotician who had a radical brain surgery and a vampire. (The last part is --- surprisingly--- not groan inducing at all).

Also Blindsight is available for free online.
