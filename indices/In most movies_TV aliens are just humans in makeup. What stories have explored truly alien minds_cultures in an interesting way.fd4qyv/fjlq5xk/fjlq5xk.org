I like Onwards to Providence(amateur fiction on Sufficient Velocity), it downplays how alien the aliens are at first, and how alien the human analogs are but as it progresses and worldbuilding happens you get a better picture. A minor thing that works well for example is how the first character introduced looks sorta humanoid at first but it's shown later that that's more a mimic octopus like thing from a species of diplomats, how Pylo works mentally is explored later than that.
