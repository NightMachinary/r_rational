The guy who made Transdimensional Brain Chip also drew another (complete) [[http://spacespy.thecomicseries.com/][comic]] about a guy who has to interact with a bunch of weird alien cultures. As with Transdimensional Brain Chip, the art is dire and the dialogue is stilted, and the alien culture stuff is all done through kind of a reductive evopsych lens, but it's still a solid read for anyone looking for Weird Alien Shit. There are dozens of bizarre, creative alien designs and the plot is regularly paused while the narration goes into depth about why a particular alien does a particular thing, the evolutionary history of where that behavior came from, the implications of that behavior for their wider culture, how the behavior and its root causes compare and contrast with related behaviors of humans and other alien species...It's silly, but a lot of fun.

Favorite details/ideas from it...One was this part where the human is trying to help an alien write a screenplay. He suggests that she cut the extended sequences about the hero trying to figure out which vegetables are safe to eat, and replace them with a romance arc. It turns out that vegetable discernment arcs are near-obligatory in this planet's fiction, and the alien is just as confused by the romance arc suggestion as the human is by the veggie stuff. The other is a bit about alien countercultures that I'm not going to describe at all because I don't want to spoil a great punchline, but you'll know it when you see it.
