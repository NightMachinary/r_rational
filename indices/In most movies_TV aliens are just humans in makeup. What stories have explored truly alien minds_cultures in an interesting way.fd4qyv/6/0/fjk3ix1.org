(I also enjoyed the internal matters, but found most of the main plot much less interesting.)

"The aliens who came down from the spaceship to make an 'Embassy' just planted a lot of the same type of plant and then got in a hole and died. The messages from the spaceship showed the aliens still there weren't bothered, but when the plants were even slightly injured the messages from the spaceship were FURIOUS. As an AI, I have deduced what not even one of seven billion human brains could even guess at--/THE PLANTS ARE THE MAIN ALIENS/. Be in awe of my inhuman level of insight."
