The Mote In God's Eye is a pretty good one. The aliens are more strongly adapted to their niche than humans, and have several sub-species with different cognitive specializations. In terms if key ideas, it's more xenoecology fiction than xenobiology fiction. But yeah, basically all the good stuff is spoilers and it's a short book.
