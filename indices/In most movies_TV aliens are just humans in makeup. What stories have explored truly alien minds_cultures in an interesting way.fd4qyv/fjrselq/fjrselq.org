Honestly, I'm going to say that C.S. Lewis' /Out of the Silent Planet/ is a really good look at alien psychology, even if it is entwined with religion. It takes the idea of aliens that don't have original sin and considers how humans would look in comparison, and also explores the concept of how the aliens don't have pets because they have other sapient species to fill that void. One of my favorite bits is near the end where one of the antagonist humans is trying to explain his moral perspective on why conquest is their right and the way the protagonist translates it the best he can with the aliens' concepts and makes it seem completely ridiculous.
