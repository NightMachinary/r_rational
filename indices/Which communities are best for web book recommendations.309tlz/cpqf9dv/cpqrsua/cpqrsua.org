Yes, Spacebattles has a quite amazing group of folks over there. There are quite a few fanfic writers who seem to write only within Spacebattles in the forums - several of them write well enough that they could easily do original fiction.

Recommendations range from extremely good, to not so great, but I've found that the lower quality stuff really doesn't get many recommendations.
