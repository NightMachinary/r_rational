Lots of good ideas here, thanks. Another comment also made me think of the "hidden objectives" idea, and I'm probably going to include either "Scientist" cards that give people different motivations and win conditions, go by organization like you suggest (military vs private company vs humanists) or do other things to incentive wheeling and dealing.
