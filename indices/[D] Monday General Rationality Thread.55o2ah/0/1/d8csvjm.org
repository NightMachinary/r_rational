I think the difference between cooperative and competitive ought to be that the different organizations have incompatible ideas of what moral rules the singleton should enforce. Whereas in cooperative everybody would agree to stick to one moral standard or say CEV (or maybe they are all secretly hoping to snatch control at the last moment, and are only being forced to work together by desperation).

For instance it would make the game interesting if there were different potential teams with various morals as well as perks and stuff that would actually affect gameplay. Some teams would pick CEV whereas others might pick CEV /but only taking into account the people funding the study/. Still others would would be commanded to just model the morality of the organizations sponsor (perhaps making that team more prone to sabotage).\\
There could also be teams that would want to severely restrict people's rights post-singularity. There's plenty of authoritarian governments that would /love/ to be able to force people to love the government or supreme leader. Plus all the religious authoritarians that would wish to be able to enforce their religious commandments onto others by force. If you want to get an idea of what many republicans wish they could make into law (that they're publicly endorsing) read the texas state constitution, or the codified republican GOP platform; it'll leave you nice and horrified..

More extreme organizations might say have more funding and be able to work faster due to the lack of bureaucracy. Whereas teams with accountability to multiple nations would have to jump through more hoops, and they might be much easier to steal research from because of the greater number of people involved. Basically you could easily have lots of organizations to choose from with clear effects on gameplay and extra fluff.
