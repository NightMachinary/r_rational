  To fit the naming convention established by the previous entries, I suggest Do What's Best. Terminology from fringe theories sounds weird in futuristic sci-fi, it puts me in mind of 1970s stories that assumed psychic powers would be discovered in the future. Besides, CEV has some theoretical flaws and MIRI thinks they can improve on it.

Gotcha. I was looking for a better word in general for DWIM, and couldn't find one, so I just settled for now with "Modeling." If there's a more technical or specific term for it, I'd love to know what it is.

  I like them best when there's a chance to mitigate the situation after a bad roll. Chance serves to add unpredictability, not to decide the game on-the-spot. It forces you to adapt your plans to changing circumstances, not throw them out the window... A single Risk roll to decide the whole thing seems... inelegant.

You're right, there should be ways to mitigate losses from bad rolls. I think when Testing the AI, you don't lose from a failed Risk roll automatically: players will have consumable cards they can burn to stop their AI and lose some progress along the way. It'll take some testing to determine how much of a loss feels "fair" and keeps the game enjoyable, without having the best strategy just be to ignore the risk and take a chance for a boost.

  If you want to show that there is a "correct" way to do AI in reality, then make there be one in the game - the overly conservative, needlessly cautious approach should be possible and theoretically should eventually produce a stable AGI every time (or at least lose less than one time in a billion), but be impractically slow and beaten by an opponent with a more aggressive strategy. I think that's the message you're shooting for.

If you take the time to R&D every Component, fully upgrade them, and implement every safety measure, I think the end state of the Risk should be down to 1%. But yes, as you say, the problem is that this isn't likely to happen: either because some other player thinks they've developed it enough that they want to try and steal the win, or in a Co Op setting because the external pressure doesn't let them take their time.
