But that's a terrible message :/

In the real world, risky competition for the "you win, they lose" scenario is bad for us, and we'd rather get cooperation to go for the "everybody wins" ending in a "conservative, cautious" way that is fairly boring and wouldn't make a good action movie.

Still, it is possible to aim for a defection to making an AI that makes you God-Emperor at any point in the "game," though I'm not sure where the Nash equilibrium lies. After all, being god-emperor doesn't sound that much better than just living in a futuristic utopia, but defection has plenty of risks.

Anyhow, I think this points towards a different take on the board game - rather than thinking of it as a competitive game where people can only build their own AI, you might think of it as a game that can be played either competitively /or/ cooperatively. Players might collaborate by sharing technology and forging social or technological bonds that make defection harder, but they might also try to keep technologies or resources secret (how to keep secrets in a board game? Have to have some other plausible reason for e.g. keeping several cards face-down. Perhaps certain research cards do nothing, but instead stay face-down in front of you?).

In this conception, players would be something like major funding agencies, and they might have several lose conditions:\\
- someone else wins and either gets or chooses to get the "you win they lose" ending.\\
- a player attempts to run their AI but during the random outcome generation to see what happens, they get an "everyone loses" ending.\\
- a risk track for a non-cooperating actor building an AI fills up (e.g. you might be able to make a technology public, which automatically shares it with the other players and gets you resources and a research bonus, but advances the AI-risk track, or it might be advanced by random events), and when randomly generating the outcome you get a "you lose" ending.\\
- the human extinction event track fills up and everyone has to roll for resistance to super-viruses.
