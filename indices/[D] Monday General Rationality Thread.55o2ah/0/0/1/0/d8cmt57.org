  In the real world, risky competition for the "you win, they lose" scenario is bad for us, and we'd rather get cooperation to go for the "everybody wins" ending in a "conservative, cautious" way that is fairly boring and wouldn't make a good action movie.

Correct. This means that the conservative, cautious way has to /exist/ and /work/. If the maximally reliable approach still only works 99% of the time, the game probably has too much chance in it.

Which is fine for a thought experiment, ala [[http://sl4.org/wiki/GurpsFriendlyAI][GURPS Friendly AI]], but not so much for a fun game.
