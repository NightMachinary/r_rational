I was learning in a Cognitive Science class about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion#Basic_emotions][six basic emotions]] /again/, but then my teacher mentioned the movie [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film][Inside-Out]]) which makes use of the same concept for Riley's emotions.

If you are sharp and quick-witted, you'll notice that the movie only has five emotions, Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness. What's the missing sixth basic emotion? Surprise!

We use surprise/confusion in our lives to notice errors in judgement and when something funny is going on.

  Surprise represents the difference between expectations and reality, the gap between our assumptions and expectations about worldly events and the way that those events actually turn out.

I'd be interested in a fanfiction of Inside-Out where Riley has her sixth emotion guide her and the other emotions into being a more rational person. Surprise can be a teacher-like figure who teaches the other emotions how to calibrate beliefs (a room in Riley's brain) to better map to reality and appropriate responses to scientific testing. Joy in discovering something new, Disgust at flawed thinking, Anger at others who consistently do science wrong, Sadness at being wrong (and knowing when to let it go), and Fear at being ignorant.

I just came up with this five minutes ago; anyone can use the idea if they wish.

P.S. Note that the six basic emotions are not actually considered to be a valid model of how people's emotions work, my professor was just going over it to talk about older theories and how it compared to the current theories on emotions.
