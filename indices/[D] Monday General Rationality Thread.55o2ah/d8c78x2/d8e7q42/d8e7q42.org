I'm still not amazing at the whole "planning" thing, but I think it's fairly obvious that this guilt isn't a very useful emotion. People need some amount of relaxing and fun time to be maximally productive, and I managed to convince myself this is some amount of true at a pretty deep level. However, I don't have a super clear idea of /how much/ fun time is needed, and so it also doesn't make sense to assume I'm spending too much time not working. Error bars go in both directions, and I while I'm pretty sure I'm not at the optimum, I don't know which direction or how far away from it I am. So I can accept it's just one of the many imperfect facets of my behavior that I will improve over time and experience, and generally try and catch myself if I start an unhelpful guilt cycle around that thing.

Idk how useful this advice is, but I'd if I tried to generalize it, I'd you should try to internalize you self identity as a process changing for the better over time, /not/ as a collection of properties that aren't as great and awesome as the "ideal you" you can visualize being.
