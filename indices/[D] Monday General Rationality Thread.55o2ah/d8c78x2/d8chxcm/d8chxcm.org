Days off are for relaxing, regaining mental energy, and doing whatever will make one feel good. This is perfectly legitimate, as having the motivation and energy to work harder will mean higher productivity in the long run.

Now, working on a problem can occasionally be a good way to relax and de-stress. If not working is stressing you out, feel free to do a little work. Ideally just enough to remember why you're tired of work.
