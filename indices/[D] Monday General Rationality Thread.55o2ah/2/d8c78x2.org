How do you rationals compromise between productive time and fun time without having sense of guilt or remorse? Or more generally, how do you decide your long-term life objectives and then consequently plan your day?

I'm really curious if [[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]] feels guilty when, let's say, watching a movie because he is not using that time to save the world from AI.

EDIT: thanks a lot for replies, I didn't expect so many and such articulate answers. It's really great for me to be able to pick your brains regardless of distance. I'm thinking ways to give back to the community in the next threads.
