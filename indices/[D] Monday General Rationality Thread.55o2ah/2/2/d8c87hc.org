Simple. Life works on a schedule. Even if you had the capability of working every second of every day without burning out, you probably wouldn't have enough work to do every day that you were capable of doing. And even if you did, burning out is a real threat to one's capacity to do good in the world and should be taken seriously.

It's sad, but people can't do everything all at once. Our minds and bodies aren't built for that. You need to get rest and relaxation sometimes or you'll have even more trouble helping others. If you don't take care of yourself it's a lot harder to help others sustainably.

As for feeling guilty, that's normal as far as I can tell. You have to do the best thing you can do given your knowledge and values. However, our knowledge isn't perfect and our rationality isn't perfect, and so that introduces a little uncertainty to the question of whether we're actually doing the optimal thing by resting and relaxing when we do for the amount of time we do it for. Plus the stakes are really really high for these kinds of decisions, so my guess is that people will end up feeling guilty about the lives they can't save regardless.
