For me, it helps to view happiness as a resource. When I'm stressed, I tend not to get much work done with the hours I put in. When I feel sufficiently happy or stress free, I can get a lot of work done in a few hours.

Multitasking is also very valuable. I do my session notes for work while listening to podcasts or playing some turn-based video game, where the pauses between my turns let me focus alternatively on both.
