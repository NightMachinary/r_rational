Does anyone know about any offline copies of anything by Scott I can get for myself or do I need to make my own personal version?

General Discussion Question: Do /you/ approve of people making copies of online literary works, even if they don't intend to give it to others? How about when it leads to improper public distribution?

Remember even if you think it doesn't affect you, this is a significant problem for authors on our subreddit writing web serials. For example, imagine that someone makes a private copy of [[/u/alexanderwales]]' /Shadows in the Limelight/ and then gives it to a friend, who then gives it to another friend, and so on all before he gets to publish it on Amazon. As a result, alexanderwales has possibly lost out on a significant fraction of his potential earnings.
