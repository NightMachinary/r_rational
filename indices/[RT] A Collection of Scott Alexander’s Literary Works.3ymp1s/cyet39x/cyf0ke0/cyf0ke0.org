Personally, I think that you shouldn't put /anything/ online unless you plan on having it be copied ad nauseum. Most of the time, authors have the opposite problem; no one wants to copy their stuff and it just sits there, unread, with no page views, and that feels terrible. To my mind, word-of-mouth is the most powerful force in the universe and getting a wide readership is the path to monetary gain anyway. It's a bit of a different story if the author has said something like, "Please don't make and distribute your own copies". Or if the content is gated in some way, which I think comes with a presumption of that same request. But for things that are freely available online ... well, I think that's part of the calculation an author makes.

The one difficulty here is that it makes traditional publication unlikely, but I think that's a bullet you're biting when you put the work online, not when it gets passed around through unauthorized channels.

My one other caveat is that I'd prefer stories that aren't really finished to stay under my control; if I have something I've shared that's not quite at the place where it's ready for wider release, I don't want it floating out in the wild. But that's a matter of pride rather than dollars.

(/Shadows/ likely has a long road to being published on Amazon, mostly because it requires dedicated editing time, which is much less fun than writing. I write because I enjoy writing and when I'm writing something I'm not enjoying it goes painfully slowly.)
