Agreed with this. Every physical book I've ever truly enjoyed has spread into my social circle to some degree, often through me straight out lending them my copy, and often they'll end up buying their own copies, especially for long series. I don't see why sharing a physical copy of online fiction would work differently.

It can get a bit hard to quantify though. The amount of people I know in meatspace who I've turned onto your writings is probably less than a dozen, but the barrier for others is often that they like reading off paper rather than screens. So if I were to get your permission to print out Shadows, pass it around in a binder, and even one of the people who reads it ends up buying your hypothetical eventual publication because of that initial spread, that's a purchase that might not have ever happened without it... or it's a purchase that doesn't happen because they already read it. It's really hard to know for sure.

But that's just my personal social circle. I can't calculate how many they in turn might spread your works to, or recommend it to when an edited-and-traditionally-published edition comes out. Which is why I generally agree that overall, the idea that people like your stuff so much that they want to share it, even if you don't make a cent off it, is overall better than the alternative of having a tiny or nonexistent fanbase because it's too hard for people to access.

But writing isn't a source of income for me, and maybe I'd think differently if it was.
