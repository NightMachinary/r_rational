There's also a chaining effect to consider. One of the reasons that modern publishing relies so heavily on series is that they're a really good sort of "natural" recommendation path, but to a lesser extent that also applies to authors. A recommendation for an author's work raises the profile for all of their other works as well. I see that sometimes with fanfic stuff; I'll get a flurry of notifications of favorites for some or all of my stories from the same person as they read though. Any one story having its profile risen raises the profile of all other stories, including stories that haven't been written yet.

For my own personal preferences, I'm completely fine with people making their own copies or passing those copies around, including any of the PDF/epub/mobi versions that I put out on Patreon (none of which have anything approaching DRM). I get uneasy when people start /hosting/ it, mostly because that completely dissociates the copy from its source. Fanfic is mostly fine for people to do whatever they want to do with it, unless it's public domain fanfic, which is basically original fiction.
