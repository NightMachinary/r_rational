It's not something that you're going to be able to get quantifiable data for, so you're going to run into a situation of garbage-in/garbage-out really quickly. There are also lots of other factors, such as what the author would want (which I consider to be more important than what makes the author the most money, though authors tend to like money), how this impacts the author's chance of getting traditionally published, the author losing control of their own creation, etc. You can't really quantify any of that, at least not to a useful degree with the numbers we have available to us.

If the author's wishes are what's most important (though I'd argue there are a few things that can override it) then the default ethical solution is asking the author.
