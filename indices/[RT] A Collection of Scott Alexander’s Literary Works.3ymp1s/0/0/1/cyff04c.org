Speaking as someone who frequently purchases things they have previously read to support authors (and who supports a few of the authors who post on this subreddit through their Patreons - great service that), a good editing run and maybe a few epilogue sections or some world-building prologue information would be a great addition to a compilation which would justify a purchase of even something I've already read. Also a great reason to justify a reread, which all good stories need eventually.

In some cases (The Traitor Baru Cormorant), the published version is just so much the superior to the freely available version that it's easily worth the purchase price by itself. Editing and expanding can be boring work, but it's justifiable added value.
