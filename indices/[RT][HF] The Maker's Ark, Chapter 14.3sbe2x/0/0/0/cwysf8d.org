When Schneier first started becoming well known, there was a meme for making cryptography jokes about him in the style of Chuck Norris jokes, so I used that for the name of the character based on him.

A good example from the Disqus comments on the chapter:

"Chuck Shiner doesn't know the meaning of the word ciphertext, because to him, everything is plaintext."
