I've pretty much just read [[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=322412][A Spark of Ice and Fire]] and [[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=317764&highlight=gladiusone][A Game of Kings and SI]]. The former is better than the latter, although Kings and SI is still readable by my fairly high standards.
