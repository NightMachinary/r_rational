He's actually got two Multiverse SI, and gabbalis is talking about the one I consider to be the worse one (due to comparative lack of dragons).

Hiver is an interesting fellow. Not a native english-speaker, the quality of his writing has increased greatly over the years, yet his early works are still readable despite all that purely on the strength of the rest of it. I would definitely call his writing enjoyable, with solidly applied munchkinry to fantastic settings and such. Logical thinker by and large.

Personally I'd call the majority of his stuff good but not great, workmanlike would be the word I would use, I think. Also rather easy to binge on, and quite a lot /to/ binge on seeing as he's been churning out updates daily on various stories for something like 4 years now. Not Quite Shodan (star trek) is probably his best work from my perspective, followed closely by the Multiverse SI with the dragons. I seem to recall I had to do some googling when he went out of the works I was familiar with.
