I mean, if we're going to define charming as deciding to boil two strangers alive for a petty insult, immediately forgetting it's happening until their steaming blood evaporates from their eyes, and then moving on to being dissapointed that they didn't quite how he wanted, then yeah. Charming.

He's most certainly a fun sort of monster though, in how he's so stunted and childlike in some ways yet absurdly competent in others.
