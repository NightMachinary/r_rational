I think 2 is actually the biggest probability, tbh. Every time we've had a Warlock interlude it's touched on his belief that basically no matter what this will all go back to the Post-Conquest normal they established- Catherine will be killed w/ out permanently alienating Amadeus, Amadeus and Malicia will reconcile, etc.

Maybe I'm reading too much into a couple of lines, but I would not be surprised if this is meant to allude to a sort of mental failure mode he's fallen into.
