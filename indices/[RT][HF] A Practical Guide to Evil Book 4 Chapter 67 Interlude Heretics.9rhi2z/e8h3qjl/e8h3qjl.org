The interludes are always the best part of the series.

Masgeo's viewpoint is a fun mixture of amusing and horrifying, and the dynamic between him and his fathers should be interesting to see play out. Prase is always a cool part of the setting to see. And however this Praes-Ashur conflict plays out is going to be critical for Callow's future.

There was also a bit of musings about magic, which on one hand is kind of interesting in its own right, but I've also just about given up on ever getting enough of the magic systems explained to have a grip on what can and can't be done within it.
