A good chapter. It was a good reminder of what Praesian court /is/. The twins were there to dig for information and they failed. It felt properly dangerous, which is something we've heard and not seen, which is nice but unnecessary. It also showed us that Masego doesn't need constant reminders of who his friends are to stay loyal to Callow.

He's rebelling, which feels good. A wedge has formed between him and his fathers, which, in theory, can't be resolved. I guessed months ago that warlock would die or be AWOL, and I thought that, coupled with his comfortable life in the Observatory, would be enough to keep his loyalty. Turns out he just chose his own way.

I'm happy for Masego this chapter. He's standing up for what he thinks is right, he even (or tried to, bless his cotton socks) put a lawful spin on boiling someone to death by justifying it with Treason laws.

I like the differences between his magic and his father's in play. Masego saw everything as it was and decided that it was his right to punish those who wronged him; the epitome of Praesian "Might makes Right" culture. His father's contingencies is a show of power. No application of effort, just a challenge for anyone to beat his passive defences.

I can't wait for papa Heirophant to come home to Callow with the shackles off and I hope Cat buys him a barrel of monkeys.
