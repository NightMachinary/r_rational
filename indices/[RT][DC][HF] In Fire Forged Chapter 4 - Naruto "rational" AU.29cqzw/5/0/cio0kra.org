I saw the review, but couldn't reply because it was a guest review. First of all, thanks for the review!

I know I have an issue with the semicolons, and I'm working on it. I'm actually currently looking for betas to resolve issues like that one, and some time before the next chapter goes back, I'm going to do a cursory editing back and resolve a lot of the minor issues that have been pointed out.

I've been made keenly aware that the beginning is horribly clich√© and has a lot of problems, and I'm starting to regret having done it that way. At some point, I will probably change it to something entirely different. However, that isn't right now - I'd rather focus on writing ahead and keeping up a decent backlog than getting too bogged down in editing.
