I went into this more thoroughly in the review I left, but I forgot to log in so it ended up as a guest review. You use semicolons too often and incorrectly. It shouldn't take too long to fix once you look up the grammar rules. It might seem unnecessary to fix minor grammar issues, but it can turn off some readers, though fanfic readers are generally more tolerant. Also, I when I first started reading your fic I was a bit turned off because the story starts in a really cliched way (the main character hurrying out of bed). This wouldn't have been an issue except that you focus a bit more than necessary on how Sakura hurries. It gets a bit redundant and tedious to read. Other than that I'm liking the way the story is going so I look forward to reading the rest.
