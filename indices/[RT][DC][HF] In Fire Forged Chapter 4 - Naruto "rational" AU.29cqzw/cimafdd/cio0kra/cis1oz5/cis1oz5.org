One thing I do is keep a google doc called "2YE fixes" for The Two Year Emperor. Periodically I go back and read a chapter when the mood strikes; I note down any errors that I spot and don't worry about it. Eventually, when I have the tuits, I sweep through and fix all the issues. It's working pretty well for me so far.
