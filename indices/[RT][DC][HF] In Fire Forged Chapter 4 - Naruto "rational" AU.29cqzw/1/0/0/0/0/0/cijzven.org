I think that if they weren't in some way sensible enough that people could take them seriously and get some use out of them, they probably wouldn't have stayed around for long after Tsunade left - even a Sannin can only get away with so much.

It's true that number four always bothered me in particular - it seems much more like the kind of dramatic flourish that you'd go for in shounen so you could do a badass speech at an appropriate time (see [[http://www.narutobase.net/manga/Naruto/577]] and the next page).
