Everything about genjutsu which is virtually indistinguishable from reality is basically nightmare fuel, I think. Luckily, most genjutsu isn't quite that solid when you examine the seams more closely, and there /are/ counters - in most cases anybody with the proper training could find out whether they were in a genjutsu or not if they suspected it, and get out of it eventually.
