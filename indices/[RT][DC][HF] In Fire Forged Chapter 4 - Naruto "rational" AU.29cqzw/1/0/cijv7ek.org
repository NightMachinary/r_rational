The idea isn't something that I've just pulled entirely out of thin air - there are similar rules in Naruto canon. It's not quite a hippocratic oath per se, but I /have/ fleshed the rules that do exist in Naruto canon out quite a bit, as well as changed them around - like with a lot of other stuff. The actual canon rules are:

1. No medic ninja shall ever stop medical treatment until the lives of their party members have come to an end.

2. No medic ninja shall ever stand on the front lines.

3. No medic ninja shall ever die until they are the last of their platoon.

4. Only those medic ninja who have mastered the Strength of a Hundred Technique of the ninja art Creation Rebirth are permitted to discard the above-mentioned laws.
