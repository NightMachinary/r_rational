I'd thought (though I'm not sure how this fits in with your story's model of chakra working) that it worked by releasing chakra in a way analogous to creating a highly-compressed gas under one's feet, and as the chakra "expands" it pushes the user, or she releases the chakra in a continuous "jet" to power the jump. (Though if this is the case, Naruto should probably be able to fly once someone points it out to him, especially if he has wind-natured chakra.)

Alternatively, perhaps what feels like channelling a burst of chakra out of one's feet is actually sending a pulse down one's leg muscles in order to jump further, but I think that's a different technique.
