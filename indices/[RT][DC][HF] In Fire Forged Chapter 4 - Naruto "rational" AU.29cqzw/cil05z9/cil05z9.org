Review reposted from fanfiction.net, in case anybody wants to reply to it:

This is by far the best rationalist!naruto fanfic I have read so far, and there's been a surprising number of attempts. Your writing style is really good overall, far far better than Time Braid which you compare your fanfic to. However, your descriptions are strangely lacking, especially those of other people's appearances. All I know of Izanami is that she has two swords, and I have no clue what Sakura's parents look like! This makes reading about them very strange because I have no picture in my mind of what's going on, which damages the immersion. I guess you could say this is representative of your Sakura if she really never pays attention to what's going on around her (In a way she feels more like canon Naruto than canon Sakura), but it still seems strange.

Your science-y passages are very nice. However, bear in mind however that their perspective on mundane physics is likely to be very different from ours on account of the people of the Naruto world growing up in a world with chakra. To them, it wouldn't seem as if chakra is something weird tacked on that breaks laws of nature as it does to us. They never had the benefit of our perspective. Naturalism/reductionism might never have caught on in the first place, since it certainly seems as if things like souls exist in the Naruto world.

I really like your realism tack and like others here I hope that it stays that way and the story doesn't go the way of the Shonen. A realistic portrayal of chakra-powered ninja would be really cool. Please steer clear of Ender-style 'it works because I said so' combat plans, especially the kind that character's come up with in between sword swings. Sakura's fight with Kakashi seemed a little like that to be honest. Ask yourself: "What would I do if I had these powers and I was in their situation?" You probably wouldn't risk blowing yourself up. You'd probably be terrified of explosive tags and ninja techniques and fighting with real swords, even if you're the one using them.

One last thing: Please make sure that you show how characters get their powers. I think a huge flaw of HPMOR is that HJPEV starts the story with "oh hey I have super science knowledge and rationality and a huge amount of gold and international fame that nobody ever saw me work for, don't mind me while I prance around and tell everyone they suck and get away with it." I think a good rationalist story show show why characters can do what they do, and how. Think of Brandon Sanderson's First Law:

"An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic."

How do Sakura's seals work? How did she learn them? What are their limits? How did Naruto get wind techniques? How do elemental techniques work? What are their limits? How does the Sharingan work? how did Izanami learn to use Genjutsu with it? How does Genjutsu work? What are it's limits? And so on and so forth.
