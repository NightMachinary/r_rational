You're right, I did implicitly assume that you were writing a rationalist fic due to the sections on chakra and science. It seemed to imply that the story was going to gradually evolve towards solving the science behind chakra, with Sakura leading the way HJPEV-style. If that's not your intention then explaining the logic behind the techniques is much less important, as long as we know what they do. However, I still don't like the part where "Sakura is so smart she invented a brilliant Anbu-technique all on her own" without explaining the thing that she actually did. It sounds like an informed ability this way.

Don't take my bit on characters being flat too seriously: I did mean only a little bit flat. It's mostly Naruto and Izanami who seem like they need some more depth, though that could just be because it's still early in the story. Sakura's narration implies a good deal of character but there simply isn't much we know about her. She has invisible parents who apparently don't want her to be a ninja but we don't know why; she wants to be a ninja but we don't know why; she wants to improve the world but we don't know why. In each of those points in the story you had a great opportunity to reveal a bit about her background, but you chose not to.

Speaking of which, every passage you write is supposed to have a point. Ask yourself: Why is this scene in my story and what would the story lose if I cut it out? If you're not going to reveal any new information in the whole "tell us about yourselves" segment, why does it need to be in your story? In canon Naruto, most of the main plot was revealed in that scene. You lost a great opportunity to do some foreshadowing of your own there. Or you could have replaced it with something else entirely.
