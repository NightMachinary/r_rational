Thank you for the blunt candor - I appreciate it, and if you've got more of it in the future, I do urge you to not hold back in consideration of my fragile ego. One of the best ways to get better at stuff is finding out what you're doing wrong, and then correcting that. A lot of what I do is me operating on pure intuition, and a lot of this feedback really helps make things much more explicit so I can /learn/ things, which is, to me, a large part of the entire point of writing this story - it's extremely valuable to me!

I carry around with me at all times a small bag of my favorite candy, of which I will only partake when I just did something like realizing an error I made and corrected on that (and will also try to think positive thoughts and feel nice about it). I get another feel-good reward cookie if I discover further good reason to believe that I indeed corrected successfully (for example, a later review states that now it's much better, and I agree). I note that, generally, I don't eat a lot of candy at all (it's expensive in Denmark).

As a strategy, I've found it works... fairly well, though it's no miracle cure. At least my own impression is that it mostly weans me off reacting negatively when people tell me I'm wrong, or have made errors.

*Mild story meta-spoilers ahead.*

On the topic of plot tension: much like EY, I've plotted the story along episodic arcs which are largely self-contained mini stories. As the introductory arc (ending with next chapter), the Spark arc is more aimed towards introduction and setting-up than later arcs will be - tension is going to ratchet up sharply in the very near future.

Granted, if I rewrote the first arc entirely I would probably do it very differently, given the perspective I've gotten since I wrote it almost half a year ago. I may even do that, eventually. That being said, given the arc's purpose and how it's meant to fit in, it's hard to change it for more "main plot tension". Maybe not impossible, but difficult without major changes to the entire story structure. I'm moving on for now though, as I think, while it's by no means a perfect introductory arc, at least it does its job... passably. I /think/.

I do think I can make the seal-work interesting, /and/ make it work in combat - maybe you misunderstood what I meant with the basics. There is a grounding in the basic principles coming, bit by bit, when it fits in, so people can understand what's going on and so Sakura's seals aren't just a bunch of black boxes - I don't intend to generally do the "oh, this works because I say it does" thing. However, the way you put it raises it to a more conscious level of consideration that it hadn't been at before, so thank you for that - I'll try keep it more firmly in mind now.

I originally hesitated to call the story explicitly rational, and maybe I still should. I've mentioned before that it's mostly /later/ in the story that a label like "rationalfic" could more justifiably be applied. So far it's mostly a classic take on a "rational" universe (another way of saying it tries to make sense and be realistic) with the effort of trying to write it well narratively, and that's it; the characters we've seen are certainly not explicit rationalists of any kind. For example, Sakura is clever, yes, but she is /not/ a typical rational protagonist right now, and I don't mean for her to be. I don't want to spoil too much, but be realistic - how many of us truly know exactly what we want to do when we're fifteen years old, and why we want to do that?

You say you want to see how people arrive at their powers (and you seem to count things like rationality as powers) - well... there you are. Sakura is simply a somewhat bright fifteen-year old girl. She doesn't herself know the answers to all of those questions, nor even that she should be asking them, for the most part. My story consists of three planned volumes, all of them fairly long, and this is simply the first. There's a long way to go yet. In fact, while I haven't exactly considered this perspective, you might say that what I'm really writing right now is in fact the prequel to volumes two and three. And I do know where I'm going - I knew what the ending was going to be before I wrote the first word of chapter one. In fact, I wrote some of the ending as the very first thing I did at all. The entire story is plotted on an arc-by-arc basis, so far, letting me shift things around as I need without compromising the larger picture.

As for my characters being flat, that's... disturbing to hear, and a very serious problem if it's true. I already do the thing with putting myself in the shoes of the characters, in fact. Can you elaborate a bit more on this issue? If you mean Sakura, I could be in deep trouble. If you mean Naruto, Izanami or Kakashi, the only thing I can say is that I haven't had the time to dig into the characters yet, but that it certainly is... coming. If you mean anyone else, then I'm much less worried.

Again, thank you very much for the feedback.
