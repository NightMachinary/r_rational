Haha, don't worry about the long reply, I like that you're taking the criticism so well. Which means I can afford to be more harsh, I suppose! (Bear in mind that I'm no great writer, so don't take anything I say for granted.)

EY is right that you need plot tension. Something has to make the story gripping for the audience. However, I don't like the whole "one month to beat Izanami" idea much because it feels so very Shonen. In fact, you need to decide (if you haven't already) what your story mainly is about, what the central message/theme is going to be that the story will work towards which gets resolved in the climax, and then make sure you introduce/foreshadow the central challenge as early as possible. It's like holding a speech: You start by saying what you will say, then you say it, then you say what you've said. You'll notice that you can predict the central plot of Naruto and HPMOR both from the first episode/chapter. Right now all I get from your first chapter is that Sakura will have a rivalry with Izanami and that she wants to make the world better. Pretty vague.

Also, right now your character writing could use some improvement, I think. I'm not saying it's bad, but your characters still feel a tad flat. I recommend the method of character writing where you put yourself in the shoes of each character and then have them act as if they were the protagonist of the story (like EY does). A cheap trick I know to make characters feel 3D is to establish a certain pattern of behavior for a character, and then have them break it by doing or saying something completely different. People surprise you in real life so your characters should, too. The part you wrote where Sakura came across a sulking Izanami is good because it leaves the reader to wonder what's going on in her head. As always, it's better to say less and show more.

I'm going to be frank about your combat descriptions: If you don't feel confident in your ability to make seal work interesting, why on earth did you make it your main character's main ability? There is a very good reason why Naruto's main ability is “shadow clones” and not “fire ball” in canon: The entire story is going to hinge on fights with that ability being interesting! You don't have to go in depth at this point, it makes perfect sense to reveal information bit by bit, but the audience needs to know the basics of what you can do with seals or else any solution involving seals will feel like a copout. You cannot, cannot write fight scenes where you go “and then Sakura did this clever thing and it worked” if you want it to appeal to a rationalist audience. Each challenge/fight/obstacle must feel like a puzzle that the audience can solve using the information it has. The alternative is the equivalent of a mystery novel where the critical information needed to solve the murder doesn't get revealed until after the criminal gets arrested.

One last thing: The most powerful aspect of rationality is not solving problems in a clever way (despite what people on Less Wrong seem to think), but allowing you to decide what you should be aiming for in the first place. Think about how some people spend 30 minutes on deciding what degree to get, and then 4+ years trying to finish said degree.* The point being that if you want Sakura to be a rationalist character and not just clever, some introspection on what she's doing and why would go a long way. (Why did I decide to be a ninja? Should I fight this guy? What are my chances of success? Maybe I should run? What do I want and how can I get it?). If a character waits with applying rationality until they're in the middle of a fight then they're not really rational. Is she even okay with killing people? Does she know? Food for thought, maybe.

*The main weakness of rationalists is that they spend forever on trying to decide what to do, and then they don't do anything (because humans can't consider things in a vacuum) --> akrasia.
