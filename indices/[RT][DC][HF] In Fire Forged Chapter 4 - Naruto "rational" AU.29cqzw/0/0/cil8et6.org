Thank you very much for the review - I appreciate the detail and thought you've put into it. TL;DR: Thanks for the review. Explanations and thoughts on various aspects of the story. Regret that I couldn't write even more without truly overstepping some kind of boundary.

I have a tendency towards writing walls of text and I think your review deserves a reply in depth. Also, there are a few thoughts it prompted that I'd like to put out there as well in case anybody wants to offer their thoughts, so prepare yourselves!

I'm very glad you think so highly of my fic - I'm not even sure what to say to that kind of praise. In lieu of doing some uncomfortable modesty/impostor syndrome routine (which I otherwise would), I'll say that I certainly appreciate the compliment, and feel even more motivated to write when I hear it. Every little bit helps - that, and the many various commitment contracts I've engaged in to combat my chronic akrasia!

You raise a lot of good points - several that I've thought about a lot myself, and several that I'm definitely going to think more about.

Your point concerning the lack of character description is well taken - I'm adding this to my list of things to revisit when I do my next row of backwards edits. I think perhaps I veered on the side of overzealous editing after my first drafts were far too heavy on description and exposition. What I did before didn't work either; I simply dumped a paragraph of description at a roughly appropriate time, in the middle of everything - it interrupted the flow. Apparently it's best to be really sneaky about it, so people hardly even notice you're describing the character, but that can be hard at times.

Also, a few scenes that didn't make the final cut had some of this description, and I forgot to transplant a bit of it over when I threw them out. A lot of it was also lost when I decided to cut an entire finished "interlude" chapter (the evening of partying in-between chapter 3 and 4), which broke from Sakura's POV and had 3rd person POVs from all of the "rookie nine" characters and touched on which changes they'd seen in this universe. I'm considering instead publishing the chapter as some additional voluntary reading material in the break between volume one of the story, and volume two. I've got a lot of extra material to post in such times that I couldn't fit in anywhere else.

For that, you can blame Eliezer Yudkowsky - I almost had a heart attack when I woke up in the morning and saw that he'd reviewed my story. When reviewing chapter three he said I needed "plot tension, fast", and when I thought about it, I happened to agree, so out went the party interlude chapter. I also changed chapter four around /quite/ a bit (rewrote almost half of it), and chapter five now needs some heavy editing as well to fit in.

Regarding science and physics, with our "physics with chakra tacked on" perspective and their "physics including chakra" perspective, I think this post would become too long (it already is) if I tried to fully address that without spoiling everything. Suffice to say, I've thought a lot about it and I think that, from what you've said here, you'll agree that it makes sense later as more information is revealed.

I'm certainly going to try my darndest to stay with down-to-earth realism and I hope to avoid the typical ridiculous shounen power progression - /particularly/ the New Powers As The Plot Demands aspect of it - it's no fun when people just conveniently pull powers out the moment they're useful, or worse, forget about them again! This isn't supposed to be a story about superheroes and larger-than-life figures, it's supposed to be a story about humans.

I realize that I sinned in the bell test fight, but it was a conscious choice: I felt that I needed to establish the credentials of the story with a "boom" in the first two chapters, and that provided me with some very limited setup time to do exposition and foreshadowing for the things to come. Also, the Unspoken Plan Guarantee trope does exist for a reason, clich√© or not. Still, my ambition is to be better and more twisty about this in the future. As for that not being what Sakura would have done, I'm not so sure - it was the best thing I could come up with that would actually have a chance of succeeding when I gave myself thirty minutes, and it displayed several of her strengths very well, I thought. The way the plan was carried out and presented was a little sloppy, though, I agree - that's on the list of editing stuff to do, too.

/However/, I'm not sure what to think about the amount of exposition that you seem to want. I agree that many of these questions are very interesting, and indeed a lot of them will see answers later as I get time and space to expand on them. The ones that are not necessary for the plot to work and that I can't sneak in somewhere, however, will necessarily be relegated to the info blurbs, where people who aren't interested can skip them.

As an example: I'm a computer programmer by profession, and I actually did sit down and take the time to think of a system for how seals work in general, though not in enough detail to be able to, say, give an exact part-by-part description of the inner workings of Sakura's exploding scrolls (yet, at least!). This seal system is, however, generally complicated, and while the basics probably will be described in the story, if you want to get a little more in-depth, the blurbs are a better place for it. While gratuitous "techsposition" may appeal to some, not everybody wants to read about how Sakura sets the individual seal components up in this specific novel fashion to get this awesome result because this and this and then this, and there "it works, on these general principles" seems better.

At least, that's been my thoughts on that so far. I'm open to persuasion, and I'm certainly considering this aspect anew, anyway. I'm sorry for writing such a long reply. I swear, this always happens - practically by accident!
