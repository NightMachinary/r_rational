There are plenty of obviously good reasons not to be a ninja. It's hard work that's liable to get you killed, for one.

As for Sakura's motivation...does a character need a reason to want to help people? Many people are raised in such a way as to naturally have an impulse of kindness. Sakura's will is probably extremely strong.

It would be nice to know more about why she chose to be a ninja, but I imagine it has something to do with taking advantage of Ninjutsu to further her other goals.
