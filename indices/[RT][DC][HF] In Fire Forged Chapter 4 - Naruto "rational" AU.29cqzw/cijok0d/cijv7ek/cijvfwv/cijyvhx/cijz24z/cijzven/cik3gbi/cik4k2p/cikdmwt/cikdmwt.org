The benefit of Tsukuyomi and genjutsu in general is that you can use it like Izanami did in the current chapter, start it at any point, and at first make it seem like nothing has happened.

Realistically speaking it happened right after your foe raised their eyes to meet yours and inhaled to start their hero monologue. The trick is then to wheels-in-wheels it by having the you in the illusion then 'use' the technique halfway through the speech, so that you can see what kind of counter they might have to it after you alert them to it. Then keep doing it over and over so they can never tell what is real and what isn't.

Effectively you curse them to 'Eternal Waking', that [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWithinADream][dream within a dream.]]

Man, everything about the Sharingan is basically nightmare fuel.
