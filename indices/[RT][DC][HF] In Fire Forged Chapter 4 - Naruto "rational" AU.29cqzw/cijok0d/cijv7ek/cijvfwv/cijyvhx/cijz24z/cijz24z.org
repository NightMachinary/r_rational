This is not "only unkillable medics may put themselves in harm's way", this is "medics who have one of my two unique signature techniques are exempt from the rules".

"Medics must keep themselves alive for the sake of their comrades" would basically cover the first three rules, and a charitable interpretation of the fourth. But when you think of the other perfect-defense type techniques in canon, calling out two by name makes very little sense... unless you look at Tsunade's character flaws, in which case it makes perfect sense. I hope for the sake this amazing universe that medics are a little more flexible now that she's elsewhere...
