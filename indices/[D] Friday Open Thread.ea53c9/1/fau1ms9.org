I've been wondering what the demographic split is like within this subreddit in regards to omivorism/vegetarianism/veganism.

It's a population that is significantly more likely than the average to believe that humans lack anything analogous to a soul, and that our conscious minds are the result of chemical and electrical events within our nervous and endocrine systems, which animals (notably animals such as cattle or pigs) also experience.

Thoughts? Personal stories?
