I don't believe most morality is based on pragmatics the same way you do, otherwise we wouldn't have such strong moral feelings for vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Seems like an extreme might makes right stance but that is consistent.

I don't directly value animal well being, I was just wondering how you could believe that animals might have human minds and yet disregard their suffering but it makes sense.

Yeah, better hope we aren't tasty to them or vice versa.
