Not only does meat production consume more resources (land, energy, water, etc.) per calorie, it also generates more pollution per calorie (greenhouse gasses, nitrate runoff, etc.). Beef production is the worst offender in every metric, so the people who don't want to go vegetarian but still want to make a utilitarian choice could stop eating beef.
