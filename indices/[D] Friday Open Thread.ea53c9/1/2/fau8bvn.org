Well meat is rather unsustainable, it takes like 20 pounds of feed to make one pound of beef, and we're already straining the environment. the smart thing to do would be to stop eating meat. but that doesn't have anything to do with souls.

If we're talking the concept of eating meat then I'd have to say I don't think there's anything inherently immoral about it.
