Sounds interesting, I think your example of swordfighting brings up some of the crazy things you would end up doing after you've mastered technical skills and physical ability in normal circumstances. Once the diminishing returns of normal practice are so bad there's more utility in practicing the edge cases even with the low chance they occur.

The only good in story explanation I can see though is an immortal that has utterly lost their mind obsessing over a topic, or a AI with a utility function of skill in that topic. Maybe a society of immortal hobby groups would progress this far, "The Player of Games" by Iain Banks comes to mind. Otherwise people are going to branch out once they get to a point, even if they love their skill they will get bored by diminishing returns eventually.
