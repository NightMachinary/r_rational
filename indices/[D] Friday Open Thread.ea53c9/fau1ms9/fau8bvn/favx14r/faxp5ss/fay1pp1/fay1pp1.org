Nah, there's no number of blades of grass that could aggregate to the worth of a single human, there really /is/ a hierarchy, and chickens really are pretty effing stupid. A chicken definitively perceives conscious awareness of experience and can experience pain and suffering and disappointment and whatnot, but objectively its brain is nowhere near as complex as a cow's brain. Even if the chicken's brain is only half as complex as the cow's brain, killing two chickens doesn't equal killing a single cow, you'd have to kill a hundred thousand chickens before that ever even started coming into consideration.

That being said, walmart sells a six or 12 pack of Sam's Choice brand frozen angus beef hamburger patties and I'll typically go through a 12-pack once every two to three weeks. That's like mostly once every other day with a lot of "every day" thrown in between. I eat an eff-ton of burgers. Which is stupid. My paternal grandfather had like three or four heart attacks serious enough to require "crack the effin' rib cage open" surgery and he had at least one stroke, but what actually ended up killing him in the end at almost 80 years old was the colon cancer. I've got colon cancer on mom's side of the family as well. Consumption of red meat is strongly correlated with incidence of colon cancer. I'm stupid for eating any red meat at all, and I eat more red meat than the average American. I probably eat an average of 0.75 third-pound hamburgers every day. But it's not my fault that evolution evolved humans into omnivores. It's pretty flipping expensive to eat a non-meat diet that gives you all the protein and fat and vitamins and micronutrients that you need, and I eat what I need to eat regardless of and in spite of any moral considerations.

It looks like you can get about 400 pounds of beef off a cow and about two pounds of chicken off a chicken. Idk where I was going with this, I fell off the wagon and I'm having trouble thinking straight but the point is that ... Man, I knew where that sentence was going when I started typing it, and now it's just gone forever. I'm honestly glad I got drunk again, it's a reminder for why it was good to give it up in the first place, it's like thinking isn't possible, and I like thinking. Drinking is a direct impedement of my goals.

Something something "dust specks" something something "even an infinite number of chickens wouldn't make up for a single cow." I don't have the money to make a difference. If you've got the money to make a difference, replace as much as possible of your beef and pork consumption with chicken and eggs. Eggs are great.

EDIT:

Well, shit. Even just a quick glance at Google shows that chickens are actually probably pretty intelligent.
