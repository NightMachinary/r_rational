Maybe employers won't hire them until they have some proof that these people's power are either safe, or that the people controlling the powers can be trusted to use their powers safely? For some powers, you'd want some sort of guarantee that the person won't, A, accidentally hurt someone, or B, intentionally hurt someone, because some powers are like having a loaded grenade launcher that is unable to be separated from the person wielding it. For more mundane powers, say biomanipulation, a hospital is going to want their employee to understand their power and anatomy well enough that they can be trusted to fix issues without generating significant side effects like cancer or medical malpractice suits.

Maybe mention a few spectacular failures that cause insurance companies to all but demand that the super powered people have some form of training.

Alternatively, if the powers fall into narrow enough categories that you can find two people with nearly identical powers, you could have academies that train people well enough to make hiring non-graduates impractical. Say a category of power can generate metal ex nihilo. A non-trained person can make kind of crude shapes out of iron that varies between wrought iron and cast iron. Neat, but not too useful. A graduate can make decently complex shapes out of any steel you could pick out of a catalogue, precise enough to not need a CNC machine most of the time, and with a few more years of training they can start making the same shapes out of metals like titanium or tungsten. All kinds of uses, and the difference is large enough that hiring the first guy isn't even a consideration.
