Thank you, this is what I'm thinking of. I wasn't thinking of any particular philosophy behind someone pursuing a skill for decades or centuries, but now that you mention it, it would be downright weird to have a character who "casually" becomes the best at whatever skill they happened to choose and without any real philosophical investment.
