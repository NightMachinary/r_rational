I think that the idea you're trying to grasp is that they're essentially pursuing a dao. One example of the kind of dedication you're thinking about is demonstrated by Metti in Kill Six Billion Demons. [[https://killsixbilliondemons.fandom.com/wiki/Meti%27s_Sword_Manual][Here]] is the exploration of someone that is exactly what you're talking about, plus some metaphysical mechanics and minus the more ancillary skills your swordsman would have. However, the core of their philosophy would, I think, be nearly identical.

For an illustrative example of how Meti's philosophy plays out, look [[https://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/king-of-swords-6-58/][here.]] The lesson Maya should have learned is that it is not sufficient to merely understand swordsmanship on a technical level, but that she must also possess the judgement and will to use it.

Your character is, essentially, practicing the use of the sword at all times. When looked at like this, any skill, from social to political to physical to artistic, plays into his skill with the sword.
