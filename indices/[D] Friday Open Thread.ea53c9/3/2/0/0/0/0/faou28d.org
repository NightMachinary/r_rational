Sorry, it seems we're talking about the same thing. I was thinking about Amazon's Kindle only for eBooks, but once a book is on there it's available as a paperback as well.

Most author's I've seen promote eBooks, I'm not sure if what they put on there is formatted for printing or if it's just automatically added.
