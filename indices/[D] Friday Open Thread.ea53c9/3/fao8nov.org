Are there any print on demand services I can use to create a physical book of the first arc/book of Worth the Candle or Mother of Learning? Bonus points if it looks like an actual book instead of a bootleg manuscript and is officially connected to the author so it tosses them a few bucks as well.

I wanted to give a book for Christmas, and figured it should be one of my favorites.
