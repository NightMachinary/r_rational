I'm attempting to write a rational superpower-academy setting - essentially, a school that takes in certain individuals with a set of powers and attempts to train them to use those powers effectively. I want to make this setting as rational as possible, and I think I've done so in terms of the potential 'powersets' so to speak - there is a system of analysing people's powers, and this broadly fits into the academic timetable. What I'm struggling with is a specific reason for those individuals to go to this academy.

Currently I have two ideas:

- The individuals trained can become part of some additional military system/covert operational institution that allows/requires them to make use of their abilities in order to succeed
- There is some greater external threat to society in general that necessitates the use of their abilities, and becoming a part of the defense against this external threat requires significant training in their abilities.

These two potential reasons seem like they each require very specific systems of education - in the prior, they are trained for precision usage of their abilities, in the latter they are trained to use their abilities in a more destructive capacity, in order to combat this external threat as much as possible.

I'm wondering if there is a middle ground/other potential reason for them to be trained within the framework of their abilities?

Apologies if this should go in the worldbuilding thread - I will happily cut and paste it into there when it is posted.
