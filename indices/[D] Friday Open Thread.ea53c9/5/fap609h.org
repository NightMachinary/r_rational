I've got a recommendation. It's a youtube channel. I think that sort of thing probably doesn't belong in the Monday thread because a youtube channel isn't a work of fiction, so I'm putting it here.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHaxi4GTYDpJgMSGy7AeSw][Michael Reeves]]

Basically he makes robots and does software programming that makes the robots do things. You might recognize him from videos that have gone viral with millions of views, like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8zC3-ZQFJI][The Robot That Shines a Laser in Your Eye]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8QlNuTUe4M][Trigger Me Elmo]].

Dark sense of humor. Edgy/meme-y. Tons of profanity. But if you're cool with those things, the videos he makes would probably be considered entertaining by a lot of the people who frequent this sub.

And now that I'm thinking about youtube channels, like, /surely/ most people here are subscribed to [[https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt][Kurzgesagt]], right? If not, that's the sort of thing that people here are likely to consider an entirely different type of entertaining for an entirely different set of reasons. The videos aren't NSFW at all. Their videos go viral pretty often too, so I don't think the existence of this channel will be news to many people, but hey, no harm in linking it for people who've never seen it.

Example Kurzgesagt videos:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP44EPBMb8A][How to Build a Dyson Sphere]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8][The Origin of Consciousness]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlTKTTt47WE][Is Reality Real?]]

The Fermi Paradox [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNhhvQGsMEc][Part One]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI][Part Two]]

The videos can basically be summed up as simple explanations of concepts, many of the concepts being concepts that are for the most part common knowledge for a lot of the rationalist communtiy, but not everyone is aware of every aspect of every topic, and a lot of the videos are about realistically going through scenarios like "what would happen if a nuke was dropped in the middle of a big city" or "what would happen if you dropped an elephant off a skyscraper?"
