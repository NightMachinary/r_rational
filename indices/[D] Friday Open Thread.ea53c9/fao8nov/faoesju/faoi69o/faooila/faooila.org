I don't think I've ever heard of an author who does that, some have self-published their work, but only as digitally. I'm not sure about MoL or WtC, but you can message the authors to ask what their plans are so maybe waiting for that is best if you want to support them.

If you do go down down the print it yourself route it might be best to send them a message regardless, just saying you'd like to make a copy (with them as author) as a gift and ask if they're okay with that.
