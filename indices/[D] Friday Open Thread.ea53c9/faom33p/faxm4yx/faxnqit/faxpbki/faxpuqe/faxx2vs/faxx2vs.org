Yeah. By and large, my list is a bit less forgiving of anything that results in "well what was the *POINT*, then??", while yours seems to be utterly racist against anything involving Helmacrons.

I did find it amusing that all of your "no"s that I marked yellow would predict whether that yellow was "good, but not necessary" or "ehhh, weird, but not like *offensive*". All told we're pretty much on the same page I think.
