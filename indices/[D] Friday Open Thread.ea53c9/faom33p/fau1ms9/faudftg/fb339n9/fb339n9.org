I don't think there's a way to grapple with these kinds of ethics consistently without going full-Singer. Obviously I choose to buy stupid, pointless wasteful things instead of giving to charity, animal or otherwise. I recognise that animals feel pain and that many are fairly intelligent/emotional. It's not impossible that their experience of life has qualia 'just like us' but trapped in a body that prevents tool use and language. Yet I'm still happy to eat them.

I think most people, myself included, work off what's popular and acceptable in society. Meat is common and the centrepiece of dinner. It's difficult to replace and tastes good. Why let the suffering of non-humans get in our way?
