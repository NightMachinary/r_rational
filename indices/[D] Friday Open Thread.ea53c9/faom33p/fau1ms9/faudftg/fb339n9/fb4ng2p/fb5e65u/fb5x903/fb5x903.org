I think our sense of morality is ultimately based on pragmatics. Don't hurt or steal from other people because they'll hurt and steal from you. The same doesn't go for animals because they can't fight back.

Vegetarianism is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to minimizing animal harm. Do we have to stop land clearance and slash-and-burn since it kills animals? Do we have to account for the suffering of birds when we build wind turbines? Modern civilization is mutually exclusive with large mammals in the wild. Ultimately, we have to choose between their utility and ours. Pure game theory dictates that we take 100% for ourselves.

I admit this system doesn't work quite so well if Hypothetical All-Powerful Aliens have an insatiable desire for human flesh and/or suffering.
