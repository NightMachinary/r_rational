Thanks for the answer, I guess the issue is that I have some wiring for empathy for human minds themselves. If I thought my burger might be made at the expense of human minds trapped inside of cattle I would find it revolting and morally offensive.

Edit: Yes arguing for taste/suffering self consistency would suggest eating particularly tasty people. Why stop at non-ingroup? If your friend is tasty enough the taste will outweigh our groups suffering. Now I really want to make a theory of human evolution based on preventing cannibalism...
