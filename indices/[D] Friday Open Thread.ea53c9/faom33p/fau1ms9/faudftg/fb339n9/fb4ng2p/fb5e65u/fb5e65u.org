  If you believe that livestock could be essentially a human mind trapped in a animal body how do you justify eating them?

Unless you believe in objective morality, then the act of assigning moral value to something you're not inherently wired to care about is special. That is, there's nothing inherently wrong with the suffering of others, but you can choose specific types of life (most commonly, ingroup humans, pets) to reduce suffering for.

Incidentally, any argument for veganism based on ethical self-consistency is essentially also an argument for cannibalism, as you're weighing "the suffering of the life you're consuming" versus "the tastiness of the life you're consuming," so it would be perfectly self consistent to decide that if cows are tasty enough to eat no matter how much they suffer in a human-like fashion, non-ingroup-humans could potentially also be justifiably eaten if their flavor outweighs their suffering.
