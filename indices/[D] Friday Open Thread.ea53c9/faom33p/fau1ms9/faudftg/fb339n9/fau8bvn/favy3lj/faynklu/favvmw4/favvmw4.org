I take the stance that, if anyone is going to reduce net suffering, it's going to be us. Given this, I don't think its important to worry about relatively minor issues like food animal rights while we still have so many massive ones to worry about. So I don't really care about the moral argument against meat, because caring about the argument doesn't improve the world in any meaningful way.
