As far as I know, neither author has plans to published a book of their story. I'm not sure how you printing a copy results in the author getting money. If you want to support them, I know MoL has a patreon or PayPal you can send money to.

You can check out grad thesis printing/binding services. If there's a university around where you live there's bound to be one. Or you can order it online. You might want to check with the author if this is okay. I know some have plans to publish their own work.

The book will look more old-fashioned, like this: [[http://www.copyrite.ca/downloads/Thesis-Binding-Info.pdf]]
