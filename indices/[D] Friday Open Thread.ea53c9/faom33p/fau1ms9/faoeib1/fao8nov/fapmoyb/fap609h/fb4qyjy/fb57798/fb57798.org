  Left-Wing voters tend to die somewhat earlier as a group

Whether that's true or not, that doesn't seem to be the generally accepted alternative hypothesis.

Basically, the idea is that different age groups came of age during different political conditions, and the political conditions when you come of age tend to have a strong effect on shaping your life-long political affiliation.

[[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics][This article]] claims that age-related changes entirely account for voting differences between the old and young, because people become more "small 'c' conservative" as they age (in the sense of being more resistant to change and less open to new experiences).

I don't care to look into the issue deeply enough to become 100% convinced one way or the other, but I'm leaning towards believing the "political conditions during young adulthood" hypothesis. Regardless of which one is right, I don't think "people die younger when they're left-leaning" is a valid hypothesis.

Those both reference studies, and the studies seem to contradict each other. However, it looks like I was wrong. "Left-leaning voters dying younger" might be a valid hypothesis. But I think saying that it's "/the/" alternate hypothesis is incorrect. Most of the discussion around this issue seems to center around "natural psychological changes due to aging" versus "political conditions during young adulthood."

Realistically, all three probably each have at least somewhat of an effect that adds up to a larger effect. Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation were definitely affected by Reagan and Eisenhower and pulled to the Right. Millennials were definitely affected by Bush and pushed to the Left. Boomers and Silents who were poorer (and? more? Left-leaning?) haven't lived as long as their wealthier (and? more? Right-leaning?) peers, and moderates who never had strong leanings one way or the other may have started leaning Right due to aging. I don't /know/, but I /feel like/ "different generational political conditions" probably has the strongest effect, and that the effect is amplified by the other two.
