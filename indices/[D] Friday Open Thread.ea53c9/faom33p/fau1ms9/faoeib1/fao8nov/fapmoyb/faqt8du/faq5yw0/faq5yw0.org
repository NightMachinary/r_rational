It could be the same reason why people go to university in real life - refining their skills so that they can get jobs and contribute to the country's economy in adult life.

Or, it could be a system to instill values and code of conduct into superpowered individuals, PGtE style. Basically teaching them how to properly use their powers in society so that they won't try to disrupt the order.

Or, if it's combat-focused, then it could be the training ground for some conventional fighting-oriented jobs, such as the military (as you've said), the police, bodyguards, or the like.

Or, it could be for something specific like there being an international fighting tournament held every however many years where the countries who place highly will gain a great amount of prestige and/or other rewards.

Or, there could be something that increases demand for combat skills. Not an external threat, per se, but maybe something like the existence of combat-oriented dungeons where great amounts of resources can be obtained, or valuable monsters that can be hunted.

Or, there could be some fundamental aspect of society that demands it. An idea brought up in the Rationally Writing podcast is if the justice system were to be based on trial by combat or duels. Then, instead of lawyers, people would be hiring these super-people to fight their cases for them.

Or, you could cheat a little and have it be an ingrained tradition, or the will of some billionaire, or the order of the alien overlords, where the base intent is unknown.
