It really depends on what the powersets are like, how much they overlap with each other, and how much they benefit from training. Absent other factors, superhero academy might exist for much the same reasons that normal academies are supposed to exist: the government or the supers themselves are paying in time and money for facilities and instructors in order to get a return on investment. In the case of supers paying their own way, it might be because the cost of education, paid via loans, is expected to be paid off in ten years time with increased earnings, and you can do some numbers there to see what would make it essentially a no-brainer for the supers, and for the banks that are giving them loans. In the case of the government paying for the supers to attend the academy, it's a similar calculation, but it can be a bit more nebulous depending on how the government is determining what pricing is worth, whether that's military value, economic value, or sociocultural stuff (e.g. propoganda, the arts, etc.).

Generally speaking, I'd think that if there were supers of a certain power level and rarity, then any sane government would be running the numbers and then doing their best to make sure that the supers were happy and well-fed, in the same way that governments often do with their militaries. The cost of a rogue super might be pretty high, so it's just plucking the low-hanging fruit to make sure that the supers learn some basic life skills that they might not otherwise get in their normal lives. In that way, super academy might serve as a way of taking people out of bad home environments, away from corrupting influences, and in a place where they can learn skills necessary to live a comfortable life. There's a commonly cited study that happiness increases with income up to $60,000 a year, at which point it plateaus, and part of what super academy should be doing is to give supers a $60,000-a-year lifestyle for 3-5 years, and ensure that they're capable of supporting themselves at that level when they "graduate", all as a method of ensuring that there are virtually no criminal supers, at least on the scale that would be a major problem for civilization. So a fair bit of the coursework, in this scenario, would be in terms of "general studies" where the supers are properly socialized and every effort is spent making sure that they won't slip through the cracks. This almost certainly provides dividends to the government (again, depending on the parameters).

Of course, such a scheme would also mean that you're putting every super from all walks of life into the academy, and assuming that powers don't care about who you are or where you come from, you're going to get people are both ends of the bell curve (as well as in the middle), which means that your super academy would probably benefit from stratification, if not having multiple tiers of super academies. Maybe there's a scheme to test out of the life skills classes, or maybe there are tests prior to entrance into the academy, but if you have the top 25% and the bottom 25% in the same class, you're either wasting time and resources being redundant for the top of the class, or flunking out the bottom of the class.

I guess the thing I would want to stress is how much effort I would put into things that aren't strictly related to powers at all, the sorts of classes that would essentially just get transplanted into the academy from more mundane places of learning because they would be very helpful for the supers to know, even if they didn't have as much direct utility for whatever the supers are expected to do as their future line of work.
