I've been idly toying around with the idea of someone who is ridiculously good at something, better than a person could realistically be IRL. Say that the thing they're good at is swordfighting, and they aren't just the foremost expert on the subject anywhere, they haven't just spent decades of study on the subject, but they've spent a significant amount of time on incredibly niche things simply because at their level it's the only avenue to improve. They've spent at least a year on learning how to fight after their sword has been broken, how to fight when low on blood, their workout routine is calculated down to the second in order to maximize effectiveness, etc.

I think this was inspired by some stories that include people who are just ludicrously old, far past what is possible for humans, and thinking of what they would do with their time if they were trying to advance their skills. They aren't practicing the basics anymore, because they haven't just hit steep diminishing returns, but they ran out of returns on the basics millennia ago. So at this point, they're spending significant time on super minor things, tiny improvements that anyone starting out wouldn't even consider something worth studying.

Another source is the Factorio development logs, and how much work they spend on optimizing things. Even really minor things have had significant thought put to them in terms of optimizing their memory layout, improving the performance of edge cases, parallelizing aspects of the game that don't interact too heavily with other parts, stuff like that. Applying lots of hours of time from people who are really good at what they do in order to improve something in a way that most people won't even notice. From that thought, applying it to a person improving their own abilities far past what anyone else would consider reasonable is a natural leap, even if IRL people are constrained by things like resources, return on investment, how much they can actually remember about a subject, and all those pesky real life things.
