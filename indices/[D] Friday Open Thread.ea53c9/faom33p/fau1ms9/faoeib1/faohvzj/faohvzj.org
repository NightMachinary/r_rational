Wouldn't it be more rational for them to practice a different skill? You don't have to be the best ever, just better than everyone else around you. Besides higher skill doesn't guarantee victory, it increases the chances of winning. You could never be an invincible swordsman unless you have super powers and nobody else does, you just win in fair fights more than you would if your skills were lower.

Skill at higher levels tends to turn into decision making.

- Risk analysis: How many opponents there are? Should you use high risk moves to remove some opponents faster so you don't get overwhelmed? Or just go low risk stay defensive and hope nothing gets through?
- Cost analysis. Is this move that tires me more than others but has a higher chance to hit worth using in this circumstance? How long can I afford to spend on each opponent individually?
- Yomi. What's my opponent going to to? How is he likely to respond to X move? How to I counter that?

Skill is the base, at higher levels it's just a minimum requirement, the entry fee , other things are more important..
