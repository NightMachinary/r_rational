Swordfighting wasn't necessarily the best example, because I wasn't thinking of skills that are necessarily adversarial. Another example I was thinking of was woodworking, but I don't actually know much about it. The goal wouldn't be maximizing outcome, because then the correct action would be using the skill for something practical rather than chasing the absurdly minor marginal returns on investment for getting better. The goal would be getting better at something for its own sake, a way of spending large spans of time improving on this one specific thing.

And even if you're the best around, if the fighting isn't restricted to 1v1 fighting then it could be worth pursuing increased skill. Even if it is, you could minimize your chance of injury by becoming more skilled.

In regards to your other points, I would consider them a part of becoming a better swordsman, in the same way that improving your exercise improves your ability as a swordsman. It isn't part of the mechanical skill of wielding a blade, but it is part of the skill of winning a swordfight. And naturally, those things would be something that this hypothetical swordsman has mastered to as great an extent as possible long ago, at least so far as those abilities relate to swordfighting.
