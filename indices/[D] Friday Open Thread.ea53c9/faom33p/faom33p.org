A couple people mentioned reading the canon Animorphs books in the most recent Reckoning thread, so I figured I'd share this again here:

This is a chronological reading order and a recommendation list for what is worth the re-read, as someone who's gone through the series a number of times. The only thing I might change about this order for a brand new experience would be to skip the first entry The Andalite Chronicles and read that in published order after #13, which is noted in the notes column for those two books.
