Does anyone know are good sources for polls of voting by age group and district, over the last several elections (UK or US)?

I see recently that Labour's recent results are split very heavily by age group, to the point that if only [age group] were voting, the results are stacked one way or the other. Many are taking this as a sign of a long term 'Labour Wave' in the coming generations, but I suspect that in the common wisdom (Voters tend to shift political parties as they get older) prevails here.

(If anyone has a way to test for the alternate hypothesis- That Left-Wing voters tend to die somewhat earlier as a group, due to lower average incomes or discrimination, I'd also be interested)
