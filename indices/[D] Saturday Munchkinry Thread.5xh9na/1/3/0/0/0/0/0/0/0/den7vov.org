Playing your whole life isn't really totally necessary, because you'll know that as soon as you press the button the logic still holds that your memories stop being evidence for or against you being simulated.\\
But yeah if I was just going to rely on anthropic reasoning to exert control over reality I would probably want to retroactively simulate my life like you say.

Anyway even without retroactive simulation it's super useful to simulate yourself for the other reasons I brought up. Namely that you can get an arbitrary amount of mental work done for zero effort, in a period of time you would perceive as instant, which means instantly getting FAI, or at least the best chance you could ever hope for.
