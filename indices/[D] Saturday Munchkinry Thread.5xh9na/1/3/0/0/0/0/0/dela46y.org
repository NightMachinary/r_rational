Yes but this is something of a newcomb style problem, in that can't affect how the world is already set up. However that still doesn't change the fact that if you create enough simulations, the chance of you being the one in a billion-billion, etc identical version of yourself that happens to be "real" is absurdly small.\\
Funnily enough before you make the simulations you have every reason to think you're real, but the instant you make them your memories stop counting as evidence so you're probably simulated.
