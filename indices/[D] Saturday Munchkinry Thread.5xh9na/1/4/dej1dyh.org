I would win fairly quickly once I used it to get rich and was able to throw money and the best minds at it:\\
Just brute force a model that will let it find the most likely conditions for universes with all same observable variables as our own (or just only select for information available to you personally), then start simulating as many of them as you can possibly manage (making some program that starts with the largest number you can figure out how to express then brute forces new programs that find new ways to express larger numbers, you get the idea).\\
This will mean that you are vastly likelier to be a simulation within some iteration of the computer as not, so it suddenly becomes trivial to manipulate the simulation and thus be fairly certain the "real" world will respond in the same way.

So just set up a program that will institute all the changes you want to make at once (so people can't react) then do some of the following right away:

- Delete all the world's weapons and continue doing so constantly\\
- Delete all factories and replaces with giant boxes that will copy paste any non-living material placed within\\
- Reverse climate change and environmental degradation\\
- Copy paste soylent and clean water in staggering amounts\\
- Reverse aging and all other diseases (plus allergies, nearsightedness, malnutrition, etc) in nearly everyone (may not be able to fix some not fully understood neurological disorders/mental illnesses since you can't just revert someone's brain to an earlier state or the like ethically), and continue to automatically fix any injuries or illnesses. Also automatically render bodies invulnerable if it predicts they're about to be seriously injured.\\
- Delete all the world's power plants and just have the computer magic electricity directly into the grid\\
- Create "teleportation" stations all over the place, some of which even go to space or other planets. Will be created all over the place and in areas that try to keep people from using them they will be even more common and some will change location frequently (others in those areas will change location if not used by anyone for too long).\\
- Create shit-tons of smartphones all across the world with considerable amounts of computing (because it outsources to the computer) that are internet connected, filled with nearly every conceivable useful program and have interfaces in the local language as well as voice command. Phone's will be created regularly over people without any smartphones in the sky with parachutes, will disappear if damaged.\\
- Set up a magic system wherein people can create "magic" circles that let them create many of the previously mentioned items, teleport to teleportation stations (can also be done via "magic" trigger phrases and whatever other things I think of. They will have limits on their size, won't work if there's stuff in the circle and will have other such safeguards, the instructions on their creation will be in the smartphones as well as written in the sky in the local language.\\
- Information of use will be written in the sky at regular intervals as well as at random intervals (to avoid people being forced indoors so they can't see the messages), will also have a voice that appears from nowhere near people.\\
- You know what screw it, people can now fly at subsonic speeds by tensing the muscles in their body in particular patterns.\\

A hell of a lot of these are somewhat redundant, and certainly not my best possible solution. However I can't risk too many people knowing about the computer so I implement this (admittedly sloppy) solution immediately. If you can think of any terrible consequences let me know, but everybody's invulnerable can fly and has all their basic needs met so it seems pretty great.

*EDIT* Actually I came up with a much better plan, and best of all it requires next to zero effort on my part: Just create copies of yourself in simulated rooms (they can easily use commands to create air, food, etc ex nihilo since they have access to versions of the computer), that are sped up an arbitrary amount from your perspective, you might want multiple copies per room (assuming you can't trust anyone else with absolute power). Boom they work on things for a while (while constantly speeding up the rate they are simulated as much as possible) then they just create even more sped up copies of themselves from before they got tired and feed them all the progress they've made, rinse and repeat.\\
Of course from your perspective it's as though the instant you create a faster simulation of yourself all your work is done instantly and you find the world instantly turned into a utopia.
