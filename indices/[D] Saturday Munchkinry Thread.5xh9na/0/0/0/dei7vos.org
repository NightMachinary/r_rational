Scent is an elaborate and distinct sense, so you could establish an entire language of such smells coded out with considerably variety and complexity. With a little work, and with smells that overlap well (sweet vs. acrid), you could establish a code for (in the football betting example) exactly how many points the team would win by, or what the score would be quarter-by-quarter... harder bets with higher payoffs.

Get a capable enough code and you could find winners on the stock market. It wouldn't be a lot of work to say whether markets are trending up or down on the day, and which of (say) ten or twelve large caps will have the largest gains. A reliable +1% every business day is better in the long run than a big win. Over a year, that's a more than 1200% return, and with large caps you can become a billionaire in three years even paying day trader taxes.
