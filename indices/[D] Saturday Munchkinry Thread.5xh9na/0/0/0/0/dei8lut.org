In the interest of avoiding confusion when your future self is having meals or walking near restaurants, etc., it might be a good idea to carry two perfumes with you. One to smell just prior to sending back important information, and another to smell when you're done or you want to be sure to avoid applying any interpretation to any upcoming smells.
