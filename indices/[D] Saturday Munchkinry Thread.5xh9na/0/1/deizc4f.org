I always find it weird how people often seem to think that limited forms of precognition won't incur all the usual problems. Just make a code with ~26 different distinct smells and you have basically an antitelephone, then just clearly delineate the start and ends of messages and add timestamps within the message if it doesn't already come with them by default.\\
Then the obvious thing to do is to become filthy rich in stocks and start introducing future tech and science earlier in order to speed up tech development. Use your future knowledge to gain behind the scenes control of most major world leaders and accrued enough wealth to make Rockefeller blush. Once you've got enough influence do everything you can to deliberately stunt AI development and goal alignment so you can work on it exclusively for the as many decades as is manageable.\\
Of course none of this will ever actually be seen by you, since all you need is to follow the directions given to you from the future to quickly develop AI tech within a few years.
