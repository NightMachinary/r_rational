Suppose you're given access to a computer with infinite* processing power and memory, loaded with every programming language you can think of and any other (currently existing) programs that you want. What do you do with it?

*As in, it can perform any finite computation instantly. Want to brute force a million RSA keys? Want to find every digit of Graham's number? Want to find every prime number less than or equal to Graham's number? All done the instant after it's started. (If you give it a literally infinite computation, like counting the sum of every natural number or something, it just hangs.)
