They're a fun puzzle-y diversion that'll help to hone your math/programming skills. They do ramp up in difficulty as you go on (partly reflected by the # of people who have completed each), so while you might be able to solve the first few dozen in a handful of minutes your progress will definitely slow (unless you're a supergenius or something). The forums have lots of people posting and benchmarking their own solutions to each problem, too, so you can see how much more elegantly and efficiently others have made their way through them.
