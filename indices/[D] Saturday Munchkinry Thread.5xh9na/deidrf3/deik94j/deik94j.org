Bake an apple pie? In the long term I'd want to instantiate an arbitrarily large number of universes of limitless joy and flourishing, but would have to be careful e.g. in kicking off physics simulations because those could easily (and perhaps inevitably) lead to prodigious suffering, too.

In the medium term I'd solve all the science.

In the short term I'd do all the [[https://projecteuler.net/archives][Project Euler problems]] using my shitty, inefficient code! Muahaha!
