I was still vastly underestimating this ability when I made my comment as well though. You will basically be able to directly control the world around you by creating enough simulations that you're probably in one.\\
Ultimately by simulating versions of yourself with access to the computer that are staggeringly sped up from your perspective you can probably get any amount of mental work (such as that needed to solve GAI and goal alignment) done in a time short enough to feel instantaneous.
