  Delete all factories and replaces with giant boxes that will copy paste any non-living material placed within

  Set up a magic system wherein people can create "magic" circles that let them create many of the previously mentioned items

Sounds like someone might figure out how to make replicators replicate replicators, overwhelming the world.

  This will mean that you are vastly likelier to be a simulation within some iteration of the computer as not

  Create shit-tons of smartphones all across the world with considerable amounts of computing

You will be maximally likely to be within that physical-law-abiding simulation which is run at maximum weight. What weight means isn't clear, but is likely to depend on the amount of computation dedicated to it. The number of simulations spawned is ludicrous, as each simulation's smartphones can spawn more simulations. Since [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/][the tails diverge]], the universe whose inhabitants find the description of the longest-running program that halts^{1} (and are thus able to allocate the vast majority of simulation weight) is unlikely to satisfy your values - consider that an AGI that spawns anywhere and figures out your scheme would be pretty effective at coming up with ways to come up with long-running programs.

Edit: Actually, your computer will probably just hang if there is any way at all left for inhabitants of a simulation to produce nonhalting computations. Beware of debugging, for if crashing the simulation is hard to pull off, you're likely to be looking at that simulation which was prepared for that purpose by that agent which was able to figure out how to crash.

Edit2: Actually, your universe can't be simulated by a turing machine if it contains a halting oracle. Duh. Though you might be able to patch this by having the oracle instead test whether given machines instead run less than some very long time.

Edit3: By [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice's_theorem][Rice's theorem]], you might run into another problem identifying the simulations that fit your parameters.

1) Each breakthrough dwarfs the effects of all previous breakthroughs from all other simulations combined, see the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver][Busy Beaver sequence]].
