Well, I can certainly say the one I WORKED on wasn't my favorite. :P It... kinda... died after I came on, because the rest of the group never wanted to work on it...

MSPM is definitely one of the best. I also liked Author Hunters and Sakurai Diaries.

Fusion Adventures was hit-and-miss, but yeah, it did have the occasional good part.
