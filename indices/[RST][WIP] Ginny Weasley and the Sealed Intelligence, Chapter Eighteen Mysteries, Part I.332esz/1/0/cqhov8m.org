After seeing this comment, I decided to plot it. On both subreddits, there was a large drop between chapters 1 and 8. On [[/r/HPMOR]] there was about an 80 point drop before the scores started oscillating around 20, while here the scores started just over 50 and dropped to zero. Given that there are 2850 subscribers here, and almost 8000 there, I don't think there is a significant difference.
