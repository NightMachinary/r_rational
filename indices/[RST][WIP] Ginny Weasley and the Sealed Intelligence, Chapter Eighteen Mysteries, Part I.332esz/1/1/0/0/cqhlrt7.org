I think the issue may be more about the purpose of the subreddits. [[/r/hpmor]] upvotes it because it's an HPMOR fanfic. [[/r/rational]] downvotes it because the protagonist (or, at least, the main character -- unclear if she's actually a protagonist) is not actually behaving all that rationally. She certainly is not behaving like a rational/ist/, despite professing an interest in becoming one.

NOTE: I'm not saying that this is a bad story. Simply that it's not a good fit for a subreddit devoted to rational(ist) fiction.
