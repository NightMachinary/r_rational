Ehh...we might let a game submission slide if the /narrative/ was rational fiction, or if they were doing something particularly clever with the game design on a meta level or something.

Merely "needing to use brains" applies to every puzzle and strategy game ever made, and that's too low a bar for submissions here. We'll stick to rational fiction.

Feel free however to post in the Friday Off-Topic threads about it, however.
