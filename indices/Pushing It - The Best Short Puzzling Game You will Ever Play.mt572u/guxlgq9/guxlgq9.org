It's short with only 12 levels, but unlike most other games where they baby you by taking several levels to introduce each new mechanic, this game will ramp up the difficulty and creative puzzle design at a very quick pace.

Why am I posting it to here? Because I figured you guys liked using your brains and this really is one of the best short games I have ever played.
