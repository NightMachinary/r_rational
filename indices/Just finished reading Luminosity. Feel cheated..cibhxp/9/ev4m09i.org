I predict you will be fully happy with the ending to the sequel, Radiance. To me though, it swung things a bit too far the other way; Luminosity's ending made me feel desolate sadness and loss, but Radiance made me feel a bit cheated of any sense of loss at all; it's basically a "too perfect" happy ending that didn't feel fully earned.

All stories have to choose to fall somewhere on the continuum of sad to happy endings. Dystopic novels like 1984 tend to have downer endings to drive their point home, and I think that makes sense because it fits the narrative theme of the story, but for me the best endings are never at one end or the other. A happy ending needs a note of loss or worry about the future, and a sad ending needs a note of hope.
