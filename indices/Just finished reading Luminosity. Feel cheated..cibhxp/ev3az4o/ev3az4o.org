The biggest thing to keep in mind is that Luminosity is a two-parter, and its downbeat ending is meant to be understood in terms of the existence of its sequel. Looking at Luminosity alone is like looking at The Empire Strikes Back alone.

Without spoiling more than I have to, I'll give an assurance that Radiance ends very, very upbeat.

As for stories which genuinely do work like this, though, IDK for sure. Maybe it's a literary form of BDSM. It's cathartic.
