Spoilers for worm

I felt like Worm arguably ended on a triumph. Literally saving all of humanity is a pretty big win. We get an awesome final fight scene. She doesn't even stay brain damaged, she just doesn't get to keep her powers. Sure, it'd arguably be better to have them, but that's not absolute and given everything that happens it's not such a big deal really.
