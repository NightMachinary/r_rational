In the case of Luminosity, the second part, Radiance, provides at least some of what you might have been seeking.

To the bigger question:

  I suppose my question is, why do people write stories like this? I do know that a lot of people find them enjoyable. I just want to know why.

Part of it is just the joy of being transgressive. There's joy in telling a story that diverts from expectations, because it means that the story can be fresh and new, even if there are only one or two diversions. Stories that do things that stories aren't supposed to do have, by this metric, their own intrinsic worth.

Part of it is that fiction can provoke lots of feelings, tragedy and sorrow being one of them, and some people enjoy ... well, maybe not being sad, but having their emotions provoked. People like to feel fear from horror stories, for example, because they like that feeling, even if it doesn't come with any catharsis at the end.

Part of it is that fiction can /say something/ about the world, and sometimes, you have to have a tragedy to do that. Sometimes the world ends. Sometimes a couple breaks up. Sometimes bad things happen and it's just /bad/, there's no recourse, there's no real resolution. An author might have to have a "bad" ending or torture a character in order to express the thing that they're trying to express, and a reader might be willing to accept that torture in order to "get" the message in this weird form of communication that is prose fiction.
