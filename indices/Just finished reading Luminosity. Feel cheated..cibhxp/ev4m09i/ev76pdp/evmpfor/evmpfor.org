I think the main issue with Radiance is that everything goes just too smoothly at the end. There's a rule I read somewhere that when writing a story in which the heroes lay down a plan, either they don't say it out loud and the reader only finds out as they execute it, or they do and then the plan has to fail and be amended at the last minute. Radiance doesn't do either - the final battle has the heroes making a plan, saying it out loud, /and then said plan works like a charm/. Which makes a lot of the ending feel rather unnecessary.
