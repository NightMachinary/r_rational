If you want a break from all the angst, grinder and general wallowing in despair, I highly recommend There is no Epic Loot here Only Puns. It is literally my favourite story ever including published works. Not exaggerating. The amount of happiness each chapter makes me feel is unparalleled. Only thing that really comes close in feel good factor is either Good Omens or Discworld. It also doesn't sacrifice any plot tension.
