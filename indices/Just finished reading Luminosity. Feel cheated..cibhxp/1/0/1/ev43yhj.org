More seriously, that doesn't terribly affect my point. I might find it harder to understand someone who's into ruined orgasms than someone who's into masochism, but it's still a thing that does /something/ for some people, same as these stories.

(I might compare it to edging, though, actually, if we're going full force on the sex analogy. There's generally no release with these things, just a build up of tension---sexy pleasure in one case, stress in the other---and then the process stops and we move on with our lives.)
