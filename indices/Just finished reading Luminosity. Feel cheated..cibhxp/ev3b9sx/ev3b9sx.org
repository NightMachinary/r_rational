Maybe the reader cares more about the world in general than about the protagonist in particular.

See also the many alternate-history stories that have no protagonists at all (Flint and Turtledove notwithstanding). There's a scale from "literally nothing but dialog and you have to guess from context what the world looks like" to "the world is an afterthought that exists only as a background for the plot" to "the plot is just a fig leaf to allow the author to show off his worldbuilding skills" to [[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/]["literally just a description of the author's world"]].
