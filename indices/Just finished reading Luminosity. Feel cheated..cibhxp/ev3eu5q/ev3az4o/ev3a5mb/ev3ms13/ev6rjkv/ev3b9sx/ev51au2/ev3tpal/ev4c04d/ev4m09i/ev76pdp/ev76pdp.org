Uhh Radiance ends with Edward no longer loving Elspeth and Elspeth no longer loving Bella, if I recall correctly the final words of the story are Elspeth being like “Yeah I don't really love my mom anymore, but I'm reasonably certain that I'm happy”... there's a good dose of bitter to go along with the sweet

I do think the good guys had an unrealistic amount of help given their end goals, but the plot wrapping up too tidily isn't the same as being too happy an ending.
