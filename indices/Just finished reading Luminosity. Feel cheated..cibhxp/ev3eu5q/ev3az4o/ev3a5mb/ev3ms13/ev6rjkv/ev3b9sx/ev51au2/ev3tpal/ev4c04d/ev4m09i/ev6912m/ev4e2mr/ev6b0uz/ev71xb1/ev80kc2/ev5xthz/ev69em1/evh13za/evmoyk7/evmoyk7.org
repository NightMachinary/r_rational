I agree with most of the others, it's a weird complaint because the story has a sequel. I still felt it was /a bit/ frustrating because it moves the PoV from Bella to her daughter, while I found the former a more interesting character, but it certainly wraps up every single thread that is left hanging at the end of the first part.
