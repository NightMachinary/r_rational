I accidentally read Flashes first, a series of vignettes that occur throughout the entire series, and it had spoilers for lots of things I didn't know were spoilers at the time. Whoops! But having read it and knowing the end from the start helped me get through the angst and tragedy of 90% of the prime stories.
