No, that wasn't it. You're thinking of an early event in the sequel. The reason everything fell apart in Luminosity was because Bella awakened the whole wolf tribe, which then proceeded to do what the wolves do, namely kill trespassing vampires, and as soon as word of this got out, other vampires came over and hammered them. Quite logical, really.
