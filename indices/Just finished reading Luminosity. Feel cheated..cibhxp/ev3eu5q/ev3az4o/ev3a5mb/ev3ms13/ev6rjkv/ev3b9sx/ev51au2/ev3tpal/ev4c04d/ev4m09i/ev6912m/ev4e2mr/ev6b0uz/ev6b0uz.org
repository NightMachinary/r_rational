I agree, I didn't like the ending of Luminosity, but not just for that reason. One additional problem with it is that it's also not a logical consequence of the minor mistakes of the protagonist, but also quite a Diabolus ex Machina. It's been a while since I read it, but if I remember correctly, the reason everything went to hell was some kind one in a billion coincidence. (Some specific and already plot-relevant person turned out to be Bella's singer?) Like, what am I supposed to learn from that? You can't protect from colossal misfortune. Sure, it could happen, but a Diabolus ex Machina is even less satisfying as an ending than a Deus ex Machina. And the reason, I think, you pointed out well: it doesn't feel like there is payoff.
