I felt similar afterwards, but one thing that I came to enjoy overtime was how it stands as a counter to a lot of rationalist fic. A lot of the heroes on rat fic get away with things just because they've thought about them a lot. This ending shows that just because you're trying to be clever doesn't mean you'll get handed a favourable outcome.
