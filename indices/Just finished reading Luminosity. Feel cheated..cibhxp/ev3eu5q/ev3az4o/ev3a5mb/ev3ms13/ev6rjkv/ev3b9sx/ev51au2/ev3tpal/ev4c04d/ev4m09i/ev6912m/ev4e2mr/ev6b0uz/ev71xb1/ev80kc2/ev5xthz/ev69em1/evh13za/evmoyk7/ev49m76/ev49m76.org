Heh. Finishing Worm I promised myself to never touch Wildbow's fiction ever again. It's actually economy in general, not just a Ratfic case: Authors can experiment to expand and deepen their skill all they like, but it's readers who spend time (and money if it's sold) expecting to gain something out of it. I just happen to be a customer who want my hero to triumph by the end of the story. If providers don't provide what customers want, then don't expect a repeat purchase.

EDIT: (I almost decided to not post edit, it's low impact given this comment current vote count)

It seems I don't define triumph the same way you do. A hero ends up saving the whole other people from the worst is never enough for me. I want the hero crush his/her/their opposition and live more powerful/influential/richer in the end. A suitable reward for a job well done. Or did you not read the Thread? OP require pay-off for hundreds (or thousands) of pages of beatings.

Worm gives Taylor a start over. That's it. After all her suffering. The same thing her father get without torture she's treated to. That's not triumph for me. That's just, "Oh, my hard work manage to keep me at the same place I begin with." Her sacrifice pretty much worth a whole lot of nothing. No ability that can help her lives her new life easier. No comrade to call upon for help or just emotional support. No enemy which their suffering she can enjoy. Nothing. An exact no-reward situation the OP is complaining about. If you think that end is better than pre-bullied Taylor, good for you. I keep my opinion it doesn't worth the hassle.

This is taking things out of proportion, but frankly, I'm tired speaking about this one fiction. On one side, I'm grateful for this subreddit subscribers who first tried to make sense before countering my argument. They are why I'm here, to present a view so that it get torn apart, if it could be torn apart. After all, I don't form opinion if I didn't see the truth in it. But on the other side, every time I present opinion about Worm, a whole lot of people just disregard it and go on praising teh fic. I start to think the majority of fandom cannot take shit about it. Their love for the work is blind. Of the three replies this comment get (yep, three is not a good number, somebody might have opportunity to get bigger number in the future), only the most recent one offer a good counter (thanks [[/u/dinoseen][u/dinoseen]]. Your opinion is not new to me, it can't convince me to change my opinion just yet, but the way you assign importance to things is good stuff). I hope it gets most upvote. It would be very disappointing otherwise.
