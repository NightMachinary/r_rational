I'm reading the Pact now and see what you're talking about, but why would you hate on Blake UNTIL roughly the Execution part? If anything, I thought he looked good, not holding grudges, not following his monster instincts and sticking by helping his friends?

He does become an asshole closer to the Execution part... I'm only hoping that's what the author meant because he's now simply looking for excuses to do some killing and I don't like if that had still been meant to be "sort of good". And the whole plot has degraded into endless pointless Mortal Kombat.
