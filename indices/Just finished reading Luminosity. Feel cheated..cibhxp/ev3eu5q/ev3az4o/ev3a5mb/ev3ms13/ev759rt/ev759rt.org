It's hard to understand or care about that emotional depth, though, when it's so unremittingly awful that by 2/3 of the way through, you just can't care anymore.

With the exception of Evan, there wasn't a single character in Pact whose fate I cared about. Everyone is basically a giant asshole and even Blake felt like a weird, broken tabula rasa (on some level I get that that's the point), but I just found it hard to give a shit about him. /Especially/ after the bit with the drains.

And then there's supposed to be this huge, dramatic thing where like the fate of the town is in question, and I all I could think reading it was, "good, just get dragged to hell, Jacob's Bell, because you're a goblin-infested shithole and the world's better off without you."

Having said that, the world-building itself is /wonderful/. I think I would've cared about literally any story OTHER than Blake and Rose Thorburn. Like the Astrologer - who was her mentor? What was that relationship? Why was she so broken up about his death? Were they lovers? What was their magic like? They sounded really fucking interesting.

Even Peter Thorburn, giant asshole that he was, sounded like he had a more interesting backstory than the story we saw. What was going on in his life? How did he self-sabotage every meaningful relationship he had? Show him being clever and snarky and vaguely attractive because some poor girl thinks that kind of cynicism is "worldly" after her sheltered upbringing. But then the relationship sours and eventually they break up. She grows and learns and ends up a better person for it, but Peter's still stuck being a giant asshole, unconsciously carrying the Thorburn karmic debt.

Or the Knights of the Basement? What's up with them? They sound freaking hilarious.

Or what happens when a practitioner lies and becomes forsworn. We read a lot about it, but we never actually take that journey with someone. Let's read about a person we like who finds out the supernatural is real, does the ritual to become a practitioner, and then gets put in a situation where s/he has to lie or sacrifice something infinitely valuable to them. Then we follow as their life crumbles due to the lie. Somehow they make some huge sacrifice that earns redemption and some small measure of power returning to them, but the lie they originally told gets revealed anyway.

Or, or, or...
