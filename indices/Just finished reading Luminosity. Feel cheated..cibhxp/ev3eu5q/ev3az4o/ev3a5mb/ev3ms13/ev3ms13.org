People are already commenting about luminosity, but Pact also has intriguing worldbuilding, fantastic characters, and a bittersweet conclusion. It was also explicitly a way for the author to learn and grow as a writer by playing with that kind of breakneck pacing. Pact has a lot of emotional depth beyond senseless grimdarkness.
