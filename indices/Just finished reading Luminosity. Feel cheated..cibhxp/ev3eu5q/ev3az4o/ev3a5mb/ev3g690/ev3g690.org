I do agree with your point, and my problem isn't with tragedy per se, but mostly with despair. "Tragedy happens, what can we do about it?" Is a useful message. "Tragedy happens, what can we do about it? Well, turns out that the answer is nothing! We can only be miserable forever." may also be useful message... in a short story. But residing in that character's head for an entire book is just torture.

I suppose that the "You are immortal, but now get to be sad for the rest of time." in luminosity's ending just rubbed me the wrong way, but at least it ended after that. I might give the sequel a shot, now that I saw that the main character is different.
