I completely agree. Much of my enjoyment of rational or rational-adjacent fictions I choose to read comes from the rational part having intellectual payoffs that less rational fictions rarely do in an elaborate manner . There may be some awesome torture porn rational fic out there where there is a excellent happy ending, but I will not be the one to tell you about it. Unless there are small victories, small payoffs, reading the stories you describe is pure boredom.

Most of the tragedies I've enjoyed are shorter stories or not fiction, because I never expect a happy payoff in a short story, and history has the benefit of probably being true.

For me, a generalized "good" ending give a vague sense of hope and expansion, like there are infinite possibilities that could happen in their futures. A tragic ending usually feels like the exact opposite, and has the bad effect of retroactively making the entire story pointless (from a certain perspective).

A positive ending that doesn't feel like a cop out or a deus ex machina is hard. A positive ending that feels like the characters earned it is hard.A positive ending where even though you expect it, it still felt at times like they might not have made it, is hard. A negative ending is easy. Shit happens. Shit happens all the time. It's always going to be easy to make a bad outcome realistic.

As for why people would write stories like this, it's because humans in general focus on the negative way more than the positive. And when people write, their stories often reflect some aspect of life. So it's not surprising sad stories get written when the author tries to ground the story to reality in some way.
