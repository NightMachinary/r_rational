It's about different meaning of winning. In rational world you can not have absolute win, like become immortal supreme god of the universe. You can only optimize, get maximum number of points. You will die anyway but that doesn't mean you have to stop playing the game, the scores still count. The worse the odds the higher the scores. Both Pact and Worm protagonists scored pretty well.
