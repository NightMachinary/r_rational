Yeah, I haven't read Pact so maybe it's different but Worm had this done well. It's a shounen where you're waiting for the protagonist to power up and she just excruciatingly doesn't. Well, she does, but not quite in a "BANKAI!" way. It never feels like she's a big deal. There are always gods and titans fighting with tsunamis in the background of this normal girl relying on bugs to maybe save a few of her friends.

It changes so slowly that you don't notice by the time they're gathering half the city's superhuman force to apprehend her.
