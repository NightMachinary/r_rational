  Hey, we'd all love it if you'd keep writing in this world. If you publish at least another 5,000 words of FtP and/or sequels / prequels / etc I'm happy to pony up a month of Gold.

Hehe, thanks. :)

(I don't actually use reddit enough to have any use for that, so you won't need to, but it's about the principle of winning the bet. ;))

  Quick question for you -- is there anything in canon about a weight limit on what phoenixes / phoenix owners can bring along on a teleport?

Not in HPMoR or HP as far as I know. In FtP, there's only these rules:

  "Now, Miss Granger, phoenixes can carry incredible weights. In fact, anything they carry gets lighter. You can transport up to fifty people at once, as long as they all hold each other tightly."

  She grabbed Harry's hand. She was a bit nervous about this one. She'd never traveled by phoenix before, and it would be Xare's first time, too. "And then?"

  "Just picture the place where you want to go in your head, and ask your phoenix to take you. They accept mental commands. You must hold her too."
