"4,000 kilos" is an oddly specific number. Not a nice round 5,000? And if I do the math out as a metrically challenged Amuriken, I find that it means 50 people each of whom weigh 176 pounds which is (assuming average height Amurikens) a really fit male adult or a slightly heavy female adult but either way is an insanely obese 11-year-old...oh, wait, that's what you meant by "she was being very cautious ". Ok.

Still, where did 4000kg come from?
