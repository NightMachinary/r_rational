Hey, we'd all love it if you'd keep writing in this world. If you publish at least another 5,000 words of FtP and/or sequels / prequels / etc I'm happy to pony up a month of Gold.

Quick question for you -- is there anything in canon about a weight limit on what phoenixes / phoenix owners can bring along on a teleport? You had Xare carrying fifty schoolkids which says the limit is pretty high -- was that your call, or was that based on something canonical?
