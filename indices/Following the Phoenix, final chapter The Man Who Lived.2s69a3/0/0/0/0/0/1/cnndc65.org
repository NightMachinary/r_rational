Accepted!

Two last caveats to clear up though.

- Both of us are not eligible to write the story and claim the Reddit Gold. We are betting on someone else doing so.
- If the author is not someone who has a reddit account, then I'll pay you the two months of Reddit Gold instead.

P.S. I currently rate my odds of winning this bet to be at 80% since people on this subreddit now know they can earn Reddit Gold to by writing a measly 2000 words.

But it's an acceptable loss to get more recursive fanfics of HPMOR. ;~>
