Huh?

Ooooooo!!! You were planning on tricking me for gold?!?! You sir, have a fantastic career ahead of you as a pirate. Can I join your crew?

Hmmm....I really do want to see someone write it and I did love /Two Year Emperor/ which is a rather high recommendation of your writing skills.

Alright, I'm willing to pay just *YOU* two months of Reddit Gold if you post a fanfic of /Following the Phoenix/ within the next three months by 4/13/2015. Don't worry about rushing it though. I know that you need to finish up a couple of other stories for your Kickstarter first.

Disclaimer: Since the bet no longer applies, I will not be paying anyone else if they happen to write one. Sorry!
