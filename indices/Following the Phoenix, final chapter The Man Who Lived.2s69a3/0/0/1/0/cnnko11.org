I was thinking about how Ignotus' burial chamber could actually be a lost remnant of Atlantis, and Harry's likely response to finding out that other such remnants could exist. Draw some parallels from nWoD's Mage: The Awakening.

Followed by an adventure story with significant timeskips, involving alternated research into HPMOR things and Indiana Jones-esque lost artifact hunting.

I mean, think about it, what are the good guys most powerful tools, things which have so far been used to save the day over and over and over again? Only one of them is a spell (True Patronus). The others are /all/ artifacts.

The Elder Wand, the Philosopher's Stone, The Resurrection Stone, Time Turners, the Cloak. Some actually able to be engineered today or copied, others not.

Then there are the old legends of Merlin being frozen by Nimue in a cave, in a very similar manner to Ignotus, or similarly to what you would expect modern cryonics to suggest...

You can get a lot of high-level adventures out of this world.
