The general reaction, both on FF.net and here, seems to be that this was a happy ending. Are we really sure about that? The setup of this last chapter really reads to me like Harry has just started talking to the boxed AI, and is just about to happily let it out of the box. Maybe this is just me being paranoid, but we've got a number of quotes from previous chapters related to existential risk that suggest Harry is...very bad, to be kind...at managing it.

  "If there was a one in a thousand chance that the ritual did not do what you expected, that it might have summoned an unstoppable horror that could have ended all human life, then you should not have even /considered/ it. All turned out for the best yesterday, but what will happen the next time you make such a gamble?" [Ch 112]

  "have you managed to destroy civilization yet?" There was no anger in the question, merely resignation. [Ch 115]

  /Note to self: think before acting./ [Also Ch 115]

What does Harry do in the last chapter? Just a partial list: he enters the tomb before anyone else, he meets the eyes of the /insanely powerful person/ from an /entirely different culture with potentially alien values/ without thinking twice, and as the story ends he's just about to give Ignotus the ability to possess the most powerful wizard currently alive today, with access to a phoenix and the Elder Wand!
