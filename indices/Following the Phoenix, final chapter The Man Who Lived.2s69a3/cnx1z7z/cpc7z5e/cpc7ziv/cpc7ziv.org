  *Star lifting* is any of several hypothetical processes by which a sufficiently advanced civilization (specifically, one of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale][Kardashev-II]] or higher) could remove a substantial portion of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star][star]] matter for any number of purposes. The term appears to have been coined by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Criswell][David Criswell]].

  Stars already lose a small flow of mass via [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind][solar wind]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection][coronal mass ejections]], and other natural processes. Over the course of a star's life on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence][main sequence]] this loss is usually negligible compared to the star's total mass; only at the end of a star's life when it becomes a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant][red giant]] or a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova][supernova]] is a large amount of material ejected. The star lifting techniques that have been proposed would operate by increasing this natural [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)][plasma]] flow and manipulating it with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field][magnetic fields]].

  Stars have deep [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_well][gravity wells]], so the energy required for such operations is large. For example, lifting solar material from the surface of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun][Sun]] to infinity requires 2.1 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation][× 10^{11}]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule][J]]/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram][kg]]. This energy could be supplied by the star itself, collected by a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere][Dyson sphere]]; using only 10% of the Sun's total power output would allow 5.9 × 10^{21} kilograms of matter to be lifted per year (0.0000003% of the Sun's total mass), or 8% of the mass of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth][Earth]]'s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon][moon]].
