Spoiler is in the eye of the beholder. I don't think it spoils anything to know that you're reading the last chapter of a work, and thus I don't consider it a spoiler. You're operating under a very restrictive definition of the term, and using it in a somewhat non-standard way. The fact that this is the last chapter is something that ff.net would "spoil" for you once this piece was marked complete, and we can infer that they don't consider it to be a spoiler. The author herself has said repeatedly that this is the last chapter, and I can conclude that she doesn't consider that information to be a spoiler either.

Calling something a spoiler doesn't mean that it's a spoiler.
