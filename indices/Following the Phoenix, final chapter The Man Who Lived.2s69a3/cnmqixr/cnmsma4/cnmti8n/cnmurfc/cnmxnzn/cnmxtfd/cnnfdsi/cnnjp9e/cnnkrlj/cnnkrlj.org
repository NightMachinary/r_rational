When he and Harry talking to the Muggles in Parliament, he mentions that the bomb he diverted detonated on [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Azkaban]["A small island in the North Sea"]], away from any other human habitation.

Then he mentions in a previous chapter that it was completely and utterly destroyed, and it was in fact a good sight for him, that he might share the Pensive thoughts with others.

So, yes, I noticed that! It wasn't entirely clear that it was Dumbledore that destroyed it in the first instance, but the subtle little hint int the other chapter suggested it.
