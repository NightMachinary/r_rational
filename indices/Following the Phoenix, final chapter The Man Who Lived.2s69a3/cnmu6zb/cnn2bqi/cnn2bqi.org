Considering how popular HPMOR and this fanfic is, I will bet 75% or greater probability that someone, within the next three months, will do so. Conditions for winning: a fanfic of any length greater than 2,000 words explicitly stated to be based on /Following the Phoenix/ published before 4/12/2015.

Propose your stakes for this most glorious bet! It's win-win for anyone going against me, since my opponent will either win, or receive a new HPMOR fanfic as a consolation prize.
