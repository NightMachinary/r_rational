If we're going magic-assisted space tech, you could rapidly assemble the parts of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry#Space_VLBI][space-based Very-long-baseline interferometry telescope]] that would have an effective diameter of most of the solar system, giving you the resolution to image exo-planets and so island-hop interstellar distances.

Also, did HPMoR or FtP ever establish how Floo networks work? Because, theoretically, phoenix-hopping a Floo engineer to another solar system could be exploited horrifyingly well.
