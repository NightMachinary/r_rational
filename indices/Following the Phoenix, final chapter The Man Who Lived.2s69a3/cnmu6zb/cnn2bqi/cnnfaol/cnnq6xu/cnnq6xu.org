Nope. Although one thing we COULD do is use Xaremione to get to Mars.

Or, alternatively, the moon. We build a giant telescope there (no atmosphere, great for telescopes) then use that to study one of the nearer earth-crossing asteroids. Hop to that, build another telescope, hop to another asteroid farther out, then to one of the moons of Jupiter, etc. We could island-hop our way pretty far like that. And, since we could launch telescope-equipped probes from each location, the "phoenix-able" zone would expand quickly.
