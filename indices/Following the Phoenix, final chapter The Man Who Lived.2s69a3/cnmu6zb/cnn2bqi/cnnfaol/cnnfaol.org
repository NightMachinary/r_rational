I /was/ actually planning to challenge people to write a recursive fanfic just for the sake of getting to third level, but decided against it given the proimity of an HPMoR update. :P

Possibilities with a lot of potential include Sirius Black's trial (Dumbledore promised he would /get/ one, but it never made its way into FtP - although I suspect EY is already going to be doing something with that, so this may not be a good option), Michael Verres-Evans' first lesson (he /was/ teaching for a week, so he got several lessons done, and there were some great suggestions on the reddit about it), and Hermione's summer job for the British space program (although some of that may already make its way into the epilogue - I'm just not familiar enough with the physics and progress of space travel to really do this justice; do we actually have sufficiently clear photographs of anything out of the solar system so Hermione and Xare could use them?).
