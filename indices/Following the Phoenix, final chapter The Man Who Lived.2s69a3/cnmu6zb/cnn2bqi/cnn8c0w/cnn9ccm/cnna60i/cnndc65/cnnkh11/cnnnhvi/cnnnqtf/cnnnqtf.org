My personal probability of a substantial (like not some piece of crap ejaculated with half a second's effort) recursive fanfic being published before HPMOR continues is far lower than 75%. More like 30%, I guess.

So we should both be willing to bet on odds between those values, given that it should appear favourable to both of us. Say 50:50 - you give me 1 month of Reddit gold if no such fanfic appears, I give you 1 month of Reddit gold if it does (providing it's neither of us who writes it).
