That's true except for one thing. I wanted to see someone write something based on /Following the Phoenix/ *before* Eliezer publishes the next chapter to HPMOR. Even though I gave a deadline well after his prediction of when the next chapter is coming out (which is stated to possibly be on 1/28/2015), I disguised this fact by agreeing to eaglejarl's condition that I would only pay out the first metafic written to incentivize speed (I would have included that condition if eaglejarl hadn't mentioned it first).

I'm actually mildly surprised that anyone accepted the bet at all. Of course the bet's now off, but I'm willing to wait and hope eaglejarl accepts my "terms of surrender" in exchange for some HPMOR fiction written by him (even if he publishes it after Eliezer starts updating again).
