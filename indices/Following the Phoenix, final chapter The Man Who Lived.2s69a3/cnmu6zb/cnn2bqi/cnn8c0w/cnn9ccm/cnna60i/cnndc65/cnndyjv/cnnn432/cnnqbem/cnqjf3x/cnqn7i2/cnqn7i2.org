Thank you! I was really happy with how Baby Blues came out. It flowed out of the keys with very little effort, needed some revision but not a massive amount, and I was proud of the result.

"Pay Attention," on the other hand, is the single hardest thing I've ever written. I've already written it once and then thrown out 80% of it and started over. The entire planned setting of the second half has gone out the window. I'm currently at 12,439 words, I expect to hit 15,000 easy before I finish it (it was only supposed to be 9,000!) and I keep re-reading what I have and thinking "this has the impact of a wet noodle," so I suspect it will need major editing once I finish it again. If you (singular and generic) end up liking it, I am going to end up patting myself on the back so hard I'll break my arm.
