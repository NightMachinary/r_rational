Really, all those conditions combined with the old ones guarantee is a very mediocre 2000 words out as fast as possible, and then people giving up on actually writing a sequel.

Think about it, you are incentivising speed (only the first one wins) over all other potential values, and then removing any potential reward afterward so that even people who have 1999 /good/ words have lost direct reward for sharing them.
