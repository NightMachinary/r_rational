Yeah, that was unclear. Ok, here's the bet I'm offering:

If a 2000+ word metafic of FTP is published on or before 11:59pmUTC on April 12, 2015, then you pay the author two months of Reddit Gold.

If such a story is NOT published by that datetime, then I'll pay you 2 months of Reddit Gold.

Do you take the bet?

EDIT: To cover some corner cases:

- The metafic only needs to be based on FTP content that is up as of today -- that is, things up to and including Chapter 36. If [[/u/heiligeezel]] publishes more after this and the metafic happens to overlap with / contradict events in those new sections, then the metafic is still considered acceptable.
- [[/u/heiligeezel]] is excluded from winning this bet. :P
- You only need to pay out on the first such metafic published.
