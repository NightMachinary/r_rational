  I would have liked to know why we keep hearing that Harry can off-handedly destroy the world.

I suspect the final chapters of HPMoR will provide an answer to that. :P

The simple reason: magic + technology is /really really powerful/. Harry is giving away all the control he has, and for example, some well-meaning scientist might end up discovering and publishing a way to end world hunger, without realising (because they don't /quite/ have the eperience with power and cynicism that powerful wizards have) that the exact same magic / technology combination with a few small tweaks will destroy all crops in a country beyond magical repair. Add some terrorists who use that on, say, all western countries, and we're in for a fair bit of trouble.

(Of course, that risk exists even without scientists having magic, which is why Riddle dislikes them so much. However, without magic it will generally be harder.)
