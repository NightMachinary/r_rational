A lot of the apologia is because when people post things which /aren't/ rational fiction, they'll get comments to the effect of "but this isn't actually rational?" or "how is this rational?"

I generally consider those comments (and the apologia meant to head them off) to be appropriate, because this is a subreddit with a defined purpose, and there's a constant threat that it will become nothing more than just "web fiction" or "what [[/r/rational]] likes", which would involve a lot of drift from its original incarnation that might make it a less worthwhile place.
