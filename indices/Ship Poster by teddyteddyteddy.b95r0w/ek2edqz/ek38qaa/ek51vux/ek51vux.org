If you're reading this and somehow still haven't given Game By God a shot, I just wanna say that teddy^{3} is currently creating a webfiction experience like none other I've seen. Even in its incomplete state, I can't recommend catching up on GBG enough - I think time will tell how teddy^{3's} stories will read archivally, but following them chapter-to-chapter has been a blast and Ship Poster is already shaping up to be pretty great.

Most discussion related to Korridor ends up taking place in a dedicated channel on Alexander Wales' Discord server (linked from the Korridor site), and I suspect that's a big part of the reason why these threads and the story's own comments sections end up so sparse. Even if these stories aren't technically rational/rationalist, they're still definitely of interest to users of this sub!
