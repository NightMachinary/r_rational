So this is another story by the same guy who wrote [[https://korridor.rip/650-2/][Game By God: Sludge Preformation]] and I'm mainly posting about this web-serial because of how much people here enjoyed GBG (before we reached the end of it anyway).

Before anyone asks, it's not a sequel to GBG (unless he's lying again (or at least it's not /advertised/ as a sequel)).

So far, the story is a lot more straight forward than GBG ever managed to be even within the first three, very short, chapters so far. I really like it's take on how a tragedy can be so heavily distorted by the media.

Anyway it's about a renowned violinist who is hired to perform for an oddly-themed luxury cruise to nowhere. Having boarded with her attendant, Hallie Nordhoff hopes to see the journey proceed as smoothly as possible. Let's hope we get a more satisfying ending this time (has anyone noticed how much I was disappointed by GBG ending way too soon yet?).
