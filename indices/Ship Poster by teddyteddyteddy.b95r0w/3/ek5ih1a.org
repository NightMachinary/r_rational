Just a meta post but why d/o/ we /see/ so much apologetics for not being pure rationalist fiction these days?\\
The trope definer for rationalist fiction, while being beloved of many of us, including myself, is a preachy morality tale, and generally rationalist fiction fails at being either human or fails at realism. ( I'll gladly take counter-examples for re-read/,/s my stack is getting thin. I might make this a top level meta post if it continues to annoy me.)
