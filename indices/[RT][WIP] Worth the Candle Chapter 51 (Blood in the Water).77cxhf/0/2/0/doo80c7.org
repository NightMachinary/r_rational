Haha, thank you! The intent certainly was to entertain :)

If you're a first-time potato salad cook, here's some more tips:

- Don't mind the potato slices breaking, because that happens anyway while tossing them. As long as it doesn't turn into complete mush, it's fine.

- It's fine to just kinda guess, as far as the dressing goes. You'll probably need a cup of broth and quite a few tablespoons of oil and vinegar, but it's not an exact science because the potatoes can vary. It'll be fine :)
