I'm glad to see that you don't put mayonnaise into your potato salad ;)

Overall your choices seem interesting (spring onions in particular are something I've already tried and can recommend). However, there are two points that puzzle me. First, doesn't bacon grease turn solid at room temperature? I would have expected that to ruin the mouthfeel. Second, adding flour to your dressing seems a bit weird. Do you cook it like a roux? If not, do you like the taste of raw flour, or what's going on here? If you toss the potatoes while warm, the starches in the potatoes should be more than enough to thicken the dressing, in my experience.

Thank you for writing, as always. Worth the Candle is awesome.
