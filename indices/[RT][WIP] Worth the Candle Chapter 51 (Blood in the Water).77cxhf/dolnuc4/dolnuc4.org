  German potato salad, which has bacon in it
#+end_quote

/Nein!/

Okay, impromptu cooking lesson/rant here. I know that to most people, potato salad isn't the most important food on Earth, but I won't ever accept that. It's perfect in every conceivable way! The right kind of potato salad, that is.

In Germany, there are two kinds of potato salad, which makes "German potato salad" in itself an insufficient descriptor. It's even worse than that. Potato salad from Northern Germany is an /abomination/, a heresy of the utmost degree. It contains mayonnaise, for Christ's sake! (When someone offers you potato salad with mayonnaise, don't even try it. It will be bad.)^{0}

Southern potato salad, however, is the food of the gods. Cook waxy potatoes (Yukon Gold, for you Americans.^{1} My German Grandma insists on the Sieglinde variety, which have become rather rare after the patent on it expired recently) until they are just done. Use a mandoline, or a knife and a serious amount of skill, to cut the still-warm potatoes into 2-3mm thin slices. Toss with oil, vegetable broth and vinegar until a somewhat gloopy vinaigrette forms.

This is the most basic Southern German potato salad possible. An enhancement that should be considered part of the core package are raw onions, diced as finely as possible (look into rapid pickling if you fear the onions' bite, and pour the boiling vegetable broth directly over the onions before tossing the salad). Also, mustard is /remarkably/ awesome, but more than a teaspoon per two pounds of potatoes is excessive.^{2}

Once you've got the basics down, you can go wild. Add chives, pickles, dill, julienned carrots, whatever tickles your fancy (though not everything at once, please, the potatoes are too important to overshadow). Maybe even bacon, I'm not a purist. But if you take anything away from this rant, let it be that "German" potato salad shouldn't /ever/ contain mayonnaise.

Also, typo I guess, "she'd probable been clinically dead" needs to be "probably", but who cares about that when there are potato salad rants to be had!

^{0} Okay, I'd still eat it, but I'm a starving student. I once ate bread that I baked from a dough that had fermented in my fridge long enough that the yeast had produced a noticeable amount of alcohol /which had then turned to vinegar/.

^{1} Actually, more ambitious Americans should look for Fingerling Potatoes, which have a hint of sweetness to them. You probably won't find them, though. A workaround suggested by Kenji from SeriousEats is to [[http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/07/erdapfelsalat-austrian-style-potato-salad-recipe.html][store the potatoes in the fridge]] to force them to convert starches to sugar. However, if you're in a hurry, a pinch of sugar does a lot for otherwise bland potatoes.

The issue of storage is interesting in particular. If your potatoes start sprouting, don't throw them away! They lose moisture and starch to grow their tentacley appendages, which causes their flavour to be intensely concentrated. Perfect for potato salad, in which the flavour of the potatoes takes center stage!

Look, the point is that I could talk for hours about the potatoes alone, get back to the main comment.

^{2} As excessive as this rant? This rant isn't excessive at all, because I believe potato salad to be the ultimate form of potatoes. Fries? Crispy, yeah, but is their every component optimized towards full potato flavour? Fuck no. Mashed potatoes? Even the most luxurious and creamy of French Pommes Pur√©e isn't the best form of potatoes, because it's more butter than potato, and it gets better the more butter you add to it. Croquettes? You're getting closer, but Croquettes are basically breaded and fried mashed potatoes, and we've been there already. Schupfnudeln? Don't pretend you know what that is. Sure, they're awesome, but /potato salad/. Hash Browns? I think I'll stop here, it's clear that we're scraping the bottom of the barrel.^{3}

^{3} We're not. I could do Bubba's shrimp joke from /Forrest Gump/ with potatoes.
