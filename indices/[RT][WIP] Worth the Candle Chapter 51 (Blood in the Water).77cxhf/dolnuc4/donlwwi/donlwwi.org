I don't actually use a recipe when I make it, but the recipe that I have on file calls for bacon /in part/ so that you can use bacon grease to toss rather than oil, and thinly sliced spring onions rather than raw onion (though growing up, my dad did raw onion). Other than that, white wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and a little bit of flour to thicken the "dressing" up a bit. Dad used finely-chopped parsley and other herbs from the garden, I generally don't.

I had no idea there was a distinction between Northern German and Southern German potato salad; the Northern German variety sounds so similar to the regular Americana variety of potato salad that the cleaving distinction probably wasn't that useful to middle Americans.
