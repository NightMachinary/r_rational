Yes, it's cooked like a roux. The bacon is cooked in a skillet, then that skillet is used for making the dressing. We never really eat it at room temperature, it was served as warm/hot as possible, so congealing isn't an issue. (And yes, having a "hot" side dish is somewhat inconvenient for picnics, but generally considered worth it.)
