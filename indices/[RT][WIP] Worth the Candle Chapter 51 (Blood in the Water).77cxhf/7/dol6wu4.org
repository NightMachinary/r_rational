So if you google "five factor" you get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Descriptions_of_the_particular_personality_traits][the five factors of personality]], and I'm wondering whether this is a play on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type_personality_theory][blood type personality theory]] in any way. I'm a little hard pressed to say that it's just coincidence.
