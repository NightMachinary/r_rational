Great chapter, really tense post battle situation.

I am surprised Fenn's loyalty didn't increase when she found out what Juniper did for her especially since she was shaken enough about it to share with Juniper the knowledge of why it was so significant to her beyond just the fact he saved her life. Unless if the whole thing just creeped her out and she was just being polite by explaining what it meant?
