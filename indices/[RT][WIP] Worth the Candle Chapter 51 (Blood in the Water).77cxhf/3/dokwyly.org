Yup, regrowing the hand didn't fix the boneitis. Because his soul is affected, not just the bones.

  “Anyway, the idea is basically that the soul has a blueprint of the body, and the bones are the scaffolding that everything hangs off of, with their own local blueprint copies,” said Fenn. “He kind of went on for a long time about whether ‘scaffolding theory' or ‘blueprint theory' sounded better, wanted to get my advice, that kind of thing, it was a very poor use of my time. He thinks that some healing works off what the scaffold says and some works off what the blueprint says. Like, I guess, if you had some shingles blow off your house, you'd know where you needed to put new shingles just by looking, right, because there's nowhere they could go, but if a wing of your house got wrecked by a tornado you'd have to look at the blueprint to figure out how to rebuild. Sorry, I feel like I'm making a hash of it.”

  “No, you're doing fine,” I replied.

  “Oh, good,” said Fenn. “But to get at the actual question, the problem seems to be that when you drain bones, you're not affecting the scaffold, or not just, you're actually fucking with the blueprint. So your finger gets hurt and asks the nearest bone, ‘hey, what should I do about this?‘ but that bone is basically dead and doesn't respond back, which means that the finger needs to go somewhere else and get an answer to the same question, which takes longer and maybe in the middle of this conversation things get screwed up because of the distance. That's my layman's understanding, anyway.”

Looking back at it, raccoon-guy's explanation confused me because it didn't actually explain why draining bones would affect the soul.

My theory is that the magic in the bones is an /expression/ or /manifestation/ of (a part of) Juniper's soul (rather than just a /copy/ of some part of it), and draining it literally damaged his soul in some way.
