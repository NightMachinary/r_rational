My guess is that the reason they don't interact has to do with the fact that they're both types of magic. From a game-mechanical perspective, blood magic costs you blood to use, and if you could circumvent that with bone magic, their synergy might be too strong.

From an in-universe perspective, creating magic from magic might be hard to do. I'm trying to think of counter-examples, but the most obvious ones are consequences of leveling up, not "normal" magic. Blood is produced by a the body as a result of its natural processes, but it's not just blood, it's also ki, or something like it. IIRC, fairies don't heal blood loss either, but that's hard to explicitly search the text for, so I might be wrong there.
