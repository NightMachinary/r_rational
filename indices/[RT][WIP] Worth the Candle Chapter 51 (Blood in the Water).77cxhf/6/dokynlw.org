I don't really get how magical healing works. It is really weird that Solace was able to put back Fenn from being literally in two pieces (which is an astounding feat, operations to reconnect even a finger are incredibly complicated) but was unable to treat the blood loss problem. In the same vain, why bone magic isn't enough to treat the blood loss? If I remember correctly, bone magic enhances the body natural healing. replenishing blood is natural body function, so I would expect bone magic to work here...

In any other story, I would probably suspend my disbelief, but here, I can't help but wonder if it's all a plot by the DM... (Creating a specific situation where Joon can save Fenn's life using blood magic...)

By the way, this is a great story, and I'm quite enjoying it. Thanks for writing!
