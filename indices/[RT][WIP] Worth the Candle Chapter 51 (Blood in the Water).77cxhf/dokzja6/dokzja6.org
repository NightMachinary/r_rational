Holy shit I can't believe how close Fenn was to dying there, thank God she made it but damn this will definitely be a traumatic incident for her. Don't bully the half-life too much :(

And damn how much of this is actually planned by the DM God? Joon's abilities, his levelling up and him being a suitable donor to Fenn.. It really makes you wonder how much of it is Joon being too paranoid and over thinking things, and how much of it is the DM pulling the strings on their lives. Hopefully Fenn will be alright but man this was too close for comfort.
