  Yes, viewing reality from multiple levels is useful, but do the â€˜extra' levels have any meaning outside of your mind? Can you say that a system has multiple levels if there is no one around to use the system or understand the multiple levels?

Minds are about information, so yes. [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6738][Viewing reality from a "more abstract" level just means making only slightly worse predictions using dramatically less information.]] A successful causal model still approximates the real world, even when you look away from it. If it didn't, it would be useless when you /were/ looking at it.
