Okay, someone help me out here. I would swear that at some point the book mentions a "pedal point", where the melody is supported by a single bass note for a long time, and that in a nearby dialogue, Achilles just says "Gee!" over and over for a long time. This would be a great match for the first prelude (in C major) in the WTC, which has a pedal point consisting of G over and over. Where is that in the dialogues?
