Sorry that I missed the last discussion.

I think that these dialogues are meant to evoke the Well-Tempered Clavier. The first prelude and fugue in the WTC (BWV 846), which is pretty well-known, fits really well. Toward the end of the prelude, there is a pedal point that takes a very long time to resolve. Once it does, it resolves onto a chord that is held somewhat longer (a fermata), and then proceeds (attacca) to the fugue.

Here's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMrqGRNx20][book 1 of the Well-Tempered Clavier]] in one video (with no visuals except a still image of the pianist). This is over two hours of music, but hey, it's really good. Even if you just listen to the first two preludes and fugues, it's already worth it.

The pedal point I'm talking about is from 1:27 to 1:57.
