Sorry that this post is late today. I completely forgot about it yesterday and when I woke up this morning, I realized my mistake.

/bangs head against desk/

This post is pretty short today, because I was rushed and the chapter was pretty basic with mostly examples of the concept that Hofstadter is trying to illustrate. There was a lot I could have gone into in the /Ant Fugue/, but most of them are related to music which is something I don't know very much about, so I decided to just make a little joke about it in the style of Fermat's Last Theorem in the hopes that people will think of them for me in the comments.
