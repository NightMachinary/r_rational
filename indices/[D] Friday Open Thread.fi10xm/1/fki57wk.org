I got concerned about Corona in Germany around 1st of March. Thats when I set aside a couple hours and called immediate family members and talked about it with friends I see on the regular.

I shall note as a personal failure that I failed to call people not in this close group that are at risk or have immediate family thats at risk. Like my 70+ godmother or those friends I only talk to on a monthly basis with their parents. Best of luck to you all in the month to come, internet friends. Glad to have your company.
