Sooooo who here LOVES puzzle books?

Anyone here who also loves puzzle boxes?

Codex Silenda is a child Kickstarter project of the two put together! It's a "a wooden, mechanical puzzle book where each page is a laser cut, 3D puzzle that must be solved in order to unlock it and progress to the next page."

I can't really do it justice, but it's so awesome!!!! It sounded like it's perfect for this community since a lot of people here love solving puzzles and I really want them to meet all of their stretch goals.

Go check it out!
