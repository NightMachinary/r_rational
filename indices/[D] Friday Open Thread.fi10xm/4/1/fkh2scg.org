Repping the [[https://discord.gg/v45xQRr][Blue Hoods]], the world's largest unified-campaign D&D discord server. It's West Marches style rather than longform campaign-based, but it scratches the itch for me and the community is great.

Like this subreddit, it's also among the least toxic online spaces I know of, and makes an active effort to remain that way despite being a hub of nerd culture, which can often get pretty weird/hostile/unpleasant pretty quick.
