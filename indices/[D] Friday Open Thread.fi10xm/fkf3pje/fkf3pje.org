So last Saturday [[https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/][Deep In Pact]], the podcast analysis of [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]], recorded their final episode covering Pact's epilogue, and to celebrate the occasion, they did a 24 hour livestream on [[https://www.twitch.tv/doofmedia][Twitch]]. They had fun activities like taking donations for charity in exchange for doing drinks or "Tarot readings" for listeners, Musical brainstorming, or roleplaying games. Special guests were Matt and Scott from We've Got Worm, JayManiac the author of Worm's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFvV0BvPtkg][Entities as Audience surrogates]] theory, and the man Wildbow himself.

Memorable moments were the two Aussies getting drunker and drunker because fans kept making them drink disgusting mixtures, their attempts at drawing fanart within 60 seconds, [[https://twitter.com/mediamdpodcast/status/1236801837631557632?s=21][Elliot's Barbered face]], the two of them fighting to stay awake after 24 hours of talking and drinking, and, of course, Wildbow's live interview. I didn't get to watch the whole thing live, but I'll be watching chunks of it here and there, and I think they're planning on doing a highlight reel on Youtube, as well as uploading their last episode to podcast apps sometime this week.

It was great fun, but I already miss the two to three weekly podcasts which I listened to on my way to work.
