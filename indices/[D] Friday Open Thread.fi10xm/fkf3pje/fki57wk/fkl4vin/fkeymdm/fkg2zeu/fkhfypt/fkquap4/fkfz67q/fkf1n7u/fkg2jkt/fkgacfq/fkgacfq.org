A young male has a [[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html][0.1% chance]] of dying in a whole year (actual probability varies per age, I'm simplifying here). If you get Corona you have a 0.2% chance (again number for the young) of dying in a month (rough duration estimate from incubation to recovery). It's like increasing your risk of death by +25+12x in that month (i.e. the 0.1% base risk is for the year, it's much smaller per month).
