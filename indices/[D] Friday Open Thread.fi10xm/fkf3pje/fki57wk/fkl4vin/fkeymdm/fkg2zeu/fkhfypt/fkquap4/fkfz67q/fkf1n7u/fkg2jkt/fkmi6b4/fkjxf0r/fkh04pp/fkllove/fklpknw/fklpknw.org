TLDR; Mask use is effective but people just don't wear them. When you actually wear the mask, you're significantly protected. N95's are basically identical protection to surgical masks.

Also, fuck the CDC for saying to the public that face masks don't work, when their own guidelines say that it provides significant protection.

Check the chart near the bottom of the page. If a CDC worker comes in close contact with a patient while they don't have a mask they're are at medium infection risk and must take 14 days off work; if they have a mask they're at low infection risk and fine to keep working.
