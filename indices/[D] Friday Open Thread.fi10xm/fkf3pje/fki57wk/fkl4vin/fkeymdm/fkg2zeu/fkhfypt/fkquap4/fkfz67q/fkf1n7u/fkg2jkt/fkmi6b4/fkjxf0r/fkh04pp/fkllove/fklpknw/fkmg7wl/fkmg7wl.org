Alright, I'm wrong. I still think the CDC lying is in the best interests of society at large. It reduces the likelihood of hoarding by people who aren't healthcare workers and prevents shortages of vital materials and staff during the worst disease event in living memory.

Also, masks definitely provide little protection when they get wet, and the general public isn't going to replace their mask every time they contact a new person. So those masks are better used in the hands of people who know how to use them anyway.
