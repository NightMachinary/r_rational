You don't even need to make such a crude estimate. The numbers for older and predisposed people are pretty clear. 10% of getting it in the next year is very low estimate, Germany works on models of 70% of people getting it at some point. (source: Chancelor Merkel, not for the next year but overall).

Eg. yes if you are young+healthy you are fine. If you have any older friends or relatives, take care.
