  That's 0.2% risk of death. Probably less if young and healthy. Scary, but not much more than dying in a car crash or from cancer.

Just taking those numbers at face value, that doesn't add up.

0.2% of the US is about 600.000 people. In 2019 about 40.000 died in car crashes in the US. That's a factor 15 difference.
