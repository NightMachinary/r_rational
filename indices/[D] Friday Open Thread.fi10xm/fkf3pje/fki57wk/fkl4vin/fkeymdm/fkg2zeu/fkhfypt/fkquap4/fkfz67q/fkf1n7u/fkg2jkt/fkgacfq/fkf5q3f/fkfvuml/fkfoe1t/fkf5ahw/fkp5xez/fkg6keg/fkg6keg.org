Here's the secret to boosting your immune system and resisting the effects of coronavirus:

Work on getting in shape/fit, it's pretty obvious and everyone is saying it everywhere but your average person certainly isn't doing it. Especially if you think this is just a panic (experts say it isn't) you should reduce your risk of long term killers over time.

Change your eating habits to keep a healthy BMI, get 8 hours of quality sleep a day, and do cardio daily. I recommend jump roping in your basement or going for a run in a P95 respirator!
