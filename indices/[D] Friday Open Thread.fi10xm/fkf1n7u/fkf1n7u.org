Are there any actions or precautions a rationalist should take during this coronavirus pandemic that your average person likely isn't taking?

Personally I don't see it as something worth panicking over. Let's say the chance of getting it is 10% and 2% of victims die. That's 0.2% risk of death. Probably less if young and healthy. Scary, but not much more than dying in a car crash or from cancer. Do you think my numbers are totally off?

Edit: my numbers were way too low.
