I think you're neglecting some selection effects here, as in the people tested for lung damage are going to be ones whose symptoms were bad enough to get into hospital care.

The part about hospital capacity overload is the more relevant, I think, besides the need to delay the infection until better treatment is developed for vulnerable populations.
