I wouldn't take Death as the only significant threat. Despite some countries deciding they'll just let 70% of their population get it eventually (IIRC, that's Germany & UK's plan), it really really sucks to get.

People talk about the coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) as though you get it and then either die or recover. Of the patients released from Hong Kong, some had a [[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3074988/coronavirus-some-recovered-patients-may-have][20-30% drop in lunge function]].

  A review of lung scans of nine infected patients at Princess Margaret found patterns similar to frosted glass in all of them, suggesting there was organ damage.

We don't know how often it causes permanent damage although 9/9 seems very frequent, and we don't know how long term that damage is, but so far I still haven't heard of anyone who's fully recovered with zero lung damage. The closest we can compare to is SARS. [[https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2010/09/02/sars_survivors_struggle_with_symptoms_years_later.html][One article]] said SARS resulted in permanent effects for 88% of its survivors 4 years down the road. Imagine just getting a disease, getting sick, and then never quite getting 100% better ever again for the rest of your life.

--------------

Aside from just a permanent lung tax for the rest of your life, keep in mind that's just for the average 81% of cases that are mild. If you're part of the 19% that have a worse case, you /need/ oxygen. That means you already went a sustained period with lowered oxygen unless you've gotten really lucky on diagnosis. If you're slow to get onto oxygen or the hospitals are too slammed for you to get oxygen (and all hospitals in the affected countries have been slammed, the only question is how much), you're maybe looking at some permanent damage to your brain, kidneys, and heart among other organs. On top of more lung damage.

Then there's also the unlucky 5% chance to need a ventilator. As best I was able to find, anyone on a ventilator long term has a >50% rate of mortality within a year, although that's other causes.

--------------

So to combine these-

- 81% likely permanent lung damage\\
- 11% likely permanent lung damage, chance for brain, kidney, heart damage
- 5% go on a ventilator, 50-50 chance you die later, plus all the other organ damage\\
- 2% jackpot you die\\

That's quite a bit worse than just saying 'ah, 98% chance to be fine!'

--------------

I would focus 100% on not getting it.

As for what you can do, I'd say that you should take social distancing seriously and make sure the people you live/interact with frequently do so as well.

Also be willing to look stupid for a better chance at avoiding the virus, like wearing a mask and being fastidious with sanitation, even if the people around you aren't.

You don't want to be saying two years from now, "I can't jog more than 50 feet without being winded for the rest of my life, but at least I didn't /look silly/ by taking the supervirus more serious than my friends did."
