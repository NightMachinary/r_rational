First-year respiratory student here. I heartily concur that trying to get a disease more quickly is a terrible idea, but I'm less convinced where the scarring is concerned. As the article notes, it's not clear to what extent this condition will be permanent, and SARS was a notably more brutal germ than this--which is part of the reason why it spread less effectively. Also, it says two or three of a dozen Hong Kong patients showed decreased function--and doesn't mention how jacked up any of these patients' lungs were beforehand. The disease is more likely to hospitalize people with existing conditions, and I could see coronavirus tearing up an already weak pair of lungs.

Any protracted illness of the lungs can cause "anatomical alteration," as my textbooks put it. They react to continual stress by deforming. That's how COPD gets you. However, we're not talking about a truly long-term stress here, so my barely-educated guess would be that at least some of that function might be restored by therapy. But, y'know, first year student. I've got a lot to learn.
