Let's instead say the chance of getting it is 75% and the death rate is 4%.

That's 3% of everyone.

In other words the statistical expected value of how many people will die in your top 33.3 is 1 person in that case.

At 0.2 that's 1 in your top 500.

So yeah, even at the too low estimate chances are someone you went to school with will be dead from coronavirus when it's all said and done (or someone you know about that well)

And that's for everyone who is within the 0.2% population so even if you're lucky and nobody you know gets sick, most people you know will have e had someone they know to that degree die of it.

That said, mortality rates are heavily skewed toward the elderly (80+ range) so for the most part it's likely to be someone in that range.
