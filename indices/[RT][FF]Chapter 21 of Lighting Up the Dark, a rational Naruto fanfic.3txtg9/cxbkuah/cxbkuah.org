Ok, take this:

- Fact: Bijuu are supercomputing killing machines.
- Fact: In canon, the Sharingan can control the Bijuu.
- Fact: One of the most badass ninja in the world is asking a twelve year old for help.
- Fact: said twelve year old is the only accessible Sharingan user.

Hipothesis-1: Like in canon, the Sharingan has the possibility to control the Bijuu.

Hipothesis-2: Seeing the recurring AI theme of rational fiction, my idea is that the Sharingan has the power to forcfully update the Bijuu/AI optimization preferences.
