So, I don't think there is any evidence to trust Orochimaru, and this kinda holds true for any rational naruto fanfic. This does have some assumptions, mainly two: 1. Orochimaru in your rational fanfic is rational himself, and is actually really good at it. 2. We don't know what Orochimaru knows.

Here's the problem. The reassurances that Orochimaru in this fanfiction, and many others, boils down to: "I could use force, but I am not, therefore, believe that I am being honest." And that's fine, and that's true, but it also means nothing because, just like we are looking at this conversation from, in this fanfiction, Sasuke's view, and going, "well that seems reasonable", no one is looking at Orochimaru's view.

Here is what I assume Orochimaru is thinking, "If I can convince this kid, with only words and no hard evidence, to do what I want willingly, that's great. If he offers any resistance though, I will go with my well thought out and personally well-liked plan of brainwashing this motherfucker."

Like, to me, any evidence we assume showing that Orochimaru is being "truthful" or "nice" or "makes sense" is just as easily evidence for Orochimaru being smart and wanting to manipulate people into being willing allies, which is pretty much always better than having to spend time and resources brainwashing, forcing, or manipulating on some more obvious level.

At this point, without really knowing anything about Orochimaru (we all have a bunch of assumptions from the manga) we really KNOW nothing, nothing at all. We have no information, at all.
