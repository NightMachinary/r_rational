I wonder if this could be one big fake-out to test Sasuke's loyalty to Leaf. I wouldn't put it past Danz≈ç or Hiruzen to make some Yamanaka mind-read blackmail material from leaf grunts and have Anko impersonate Orochimaru. In any case, all of this ought to be much easier to organise for Leaf leadership than for Oro-tan, unless he's extremely competent (in which case, why isn't he already ruling the elemental nations?).
