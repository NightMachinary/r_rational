  It may be simultaneously true that 1) what Orochimaru told him is evidence for the deal being bad, and 2) the deal is actually good and Orochimaru couldn't have told him anything better.

We're probably just misunderstanding each other, but Bayessian evidence exists when there is a difference in some indicator depending on some fact. In other words, if Orochimaru couldn't have done anything differently, even if he was being honest, then what he did constitutes no evidence towards his dishonesty.

  Then Orochimaru would simply have gotten very unlucky--by pure chance this good deal looks very much like a bad one from the outside. And it would still be logical for Sasuke to treat it as a bad deal; Sasuke would just be unlucky in that he is turning down a good deal that has a lot of evidence for it being bad.

That's the fate of all non-omniscient beings. It's on Orochimaru to present enough guarantees of trustworthiness that the prior suspicion is overcome. I would like Sasuke to take the deal, because I predict I'll enjoy that development more that the alternatives. But I'm not sure I'd take it, if I were Sasuke (but then, I'm not a revenge-obsessed idiot, so what would I know?).
