Just the fact that the deal requires betraying his country is Bayseian evidence that the deal is bad, since villains would frequently want people to betray their country and actual beneficial plans would be no more likely to contain the feature of betraying one's country than any other feature. Likewise, the fact that Orochimaru is giving him seriously incomplete information about the plan is Bayseian evidence that Orochimaru is trying to deceive him, even though it's possible that genuinely good plans cannot be revealed. Also the fact that he can't safely talk about the plan to anyone else.

Also, plans which too conveniently fit with one's predilections are Bayseian evidence for the plan being bad, for similar reasons. (See also [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/jao/siren_worlds_and_the_perils_of_overoptimised/%5D][this]], where a plan that fits with one's predilections would be equivalent to a marketing world.)

And his statement that evil consists of having a bad motivation is a seriously incomplete description of evil. If your motivation is to kill all Jews, you're evil, but what if your motivation is just to help all Aryans, and killing the Jews just falls out of your plan rather than being your actual motivation? And whether something is a motivation is partly arbitrary, anyway--for instance, you could argue that in the latter example, killing Jews is in fact a motivation.
