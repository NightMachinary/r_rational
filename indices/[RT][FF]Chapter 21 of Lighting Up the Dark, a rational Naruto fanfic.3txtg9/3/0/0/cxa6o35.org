To be honest, I like this Orochimaru so much more than Sasuke with his boring "hurr durr I'm avenger, but what if I gave it up and was happy, but that would be betraying myself" routine, that I would be satisfied if he just donated his body to Oro-tan. At least this Orochimaru will do something interesting and useful with it, instead of pointlessly running around trying to find new people to take revenge on.

EDIT: Also, can you imagine [[/r/rational]] authors running a Naruto quest? You could DM together with [[/u/omgimpwned]], [[/u/Wertifloke]] and [[/u/eaglejarl]] (well, [[/u/Velorien]] is a given of course). Ah, what a glorious thing that would be...
