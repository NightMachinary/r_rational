Look at all the S-class people in Naruto: they all have pretty damn huge advantages over the run-of-the-mill shinobi. If we're making the universe rational, then we can draw an implication from that. The player character is not going to be the only ninja to crave power, but the only one to actually achieve serious power-levels without cheats was Hiruzen. We know that the low-hanging fruit isn't enough to become S-class.

Now, on one hand, we might as well use this to make things interesting and give players a perfectly ordinary person to start with. See how long it takes them to bootstrap their way to godhood without some bloodline shortcut.

On the other, we may want to allow people to pick a truly powerful advantage, but make sure they need it by making the antagonists truly challenging. Not to mention that some problems are just not solvable via sufficient firepower. If your goal is to make elemental nations into a peaceful paradise, then your enemy will be the mentality of the people. Can't exactly punch that out.

I'd go for making the antagonists truly powerful, giving people a starting character without any advantages over a median genin, but allowing the players comparatively full freedom to optimise as they see fit, including the ridiculous power-multiplier things like Edo Tensei and stealing some Sharingan from somewhere. We can manage to keep things challenging without forcing people onto the underpowered-jutsu rails.
