Well, trying to figure out how Danz≈ç manages to both have a shitload of cheat-codes, half the ANBU subverted, and still can't do anything but fuck things up is nigh impossible. That pile of bullshit doesn't deserve the effort it would take to justify it. As long as setting is recognisably Naruto, we're fine, I think. We could even start in some backwater without a ninja village and chill with some original characters for a while, if you and [[/u/Velorien]] want to. Konoha isn't the only place in elemental nations after all.

On that note, what are we going to do about canon power ballance between shinobi and vanilla mortals? Are we going to just chuck the idea that daimyo have any appreciable power and be done with it? Or are we going to try and concoct the reasons why badass wizard master-race serves civilians and not the other way around?
