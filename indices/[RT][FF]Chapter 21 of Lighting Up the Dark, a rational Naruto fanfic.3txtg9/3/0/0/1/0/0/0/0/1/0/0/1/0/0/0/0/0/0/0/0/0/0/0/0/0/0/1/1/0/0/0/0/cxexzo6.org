  Should the daimyo just be subordinates, who deal with the administration of civilian population without any ability to order ninja around? I doubt any shinobi would find that kind of work terribly appealing, so a trusted civilian would naturally fill the position. Remote areas away from big ninja villages could have their own governance structures of course.

Yeah, that's probably easiest. As you say, it's a hard thing to justify.
