Anko is actually a special jounin, a rank between chuunin and jounin. Special jounin are like chuunin with jounin-level abilities in a specialized area. In Anko's case, she is also kept below jounin-level because of the Cursed Seal of Heaven and her personal relationship to the S-level missing-nin that gave it to her (I think this might be just fanon, but it makes sense).

^{^{^{^{^{^{...Anko}}}}}} ^{^{^{^{^{^{is}}}}}} ^{^{^{^{^{^{my}}}}}} ^{^{^{^{^{^{favorite}}}}}} ^{^{^{^{^{^{character.}}}}}}

Should there be chakra budgeting? Other stats?
