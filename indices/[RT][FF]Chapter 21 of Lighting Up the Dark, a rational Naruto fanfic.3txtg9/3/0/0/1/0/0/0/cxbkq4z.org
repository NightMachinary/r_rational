Generally it's one DM and then all the posters are in control of one character. The GM usually gives a couple options for each major dialogue or action, and sometimes allows posters to write-in what they want. There's voting for each choice, and if necessary a roll to determine how well the action was done.

That's basically it. For a multi-GM quest, I was proposing that you have each GM run the major characters in the background while the main character is doing their thing, but realized that most of the people they would be running in a Naruto-themed quest would be generally fairly powerful, both personally and politically, allowing the GM's full rein to blow holes in the setting from behind the scenes while the main character would be run by a bunch of posters, who are generally more inclined to starting lesbian relationships and arguing with each other.
