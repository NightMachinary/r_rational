I am totally on board with that. It's a pain in the neck to keep track of and makes basically no difference anyway.

If we leave all the canon stuff in, the problem is what's available? Do we assume that all non-bloodline jutsu are available to everyone? Most techniques on the wiki are listed as only having a few users. Is that descriptive or proscriptive? [[/u/Velorien]]?
