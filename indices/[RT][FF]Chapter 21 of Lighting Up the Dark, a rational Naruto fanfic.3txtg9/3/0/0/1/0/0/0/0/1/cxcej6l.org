  (Honestly, why do people keep changing the names? 'emoticons' was a perfectly good name, we didn't have to go to 'emoji'

I would speculate that "emoji", the Japanese word, came in with the more elaborate Japanese style of emoticon. But that's a random stab in the dark, much like assassination by an incompetent ninja.

Never having so much as read one of these, I would hypothetically be prepared to give it a try, on the understanding that chaos, doom and disaster would inevitably ensue. Also I might mess it up. I think I'd want it to be in some neutral setting, definitely not the LUDverse, and ideally not someone else's AU (so as to minimise hidden assumptions and also avoid spoilers for background lore and such).
