It's not just you. Looks like the whole freenode IRC is down for some reason. What exquisitely annoying timing.

Alright, time to find a newer alternative. Let's [[https://rational-naruquest.hipchat.com/chat][try this hipchat app google tells me is pretty good]]. Looks like the sign-up is hassle-free (just choosing a nick and entering an email) and I've already created the channel for us. Web 2.0 for the win, I guess. [[/u/eaglejarl]], I invite you to try and connect as well just to see if everything works.

EDIT: I may have to invite you specifically, so send me a message with your chosen email here on reddit once you've signed up.
