Don't know yet. Looks like [[/u/Velorien]] is away somewhere. I suggest the three of us have a quick discussion in [[https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23rational&amp;uio=d4][#rational over on freenode IRC]] once he surfaces again. Or I could set up a server for mumble, if you prefer voice chat.

For what it's worth, I don't think using feudal japan tech levels with seals for semi-modern stuff will be terribly controversial. Nerfing the power of daimyo should be alright as well, judging by past discussion with [[/u/Velorien]].
