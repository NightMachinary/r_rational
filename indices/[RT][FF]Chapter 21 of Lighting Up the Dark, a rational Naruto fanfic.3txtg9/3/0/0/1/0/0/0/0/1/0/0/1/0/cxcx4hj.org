Holy shit, sudden responsibility, time to run and hide!

Once you guys decide what interpretation of universe you're going to be running the quest in (at least the bare basics as far as tech-levels and the approximate mechanism behind chakra magic go) we can leave the rest to players. Basically, you can just let everyone choose what character and location they want to start with. I'd suggest giving a couple default options and a write-in a-la:

1. [] You're an orphan. You were just rescued from a burning orphanage by mysterious [[#s][snake-like gentleman]].

2. [] You're a boring person who didn't choose option one. You'll be playing as some nameless genin mook of a minor village in the arse end of nowhere.

3. [] Write-in

The traditional way to run a quest is to basically go with the most popular option the players choose (first-past-the-post style). If we're going for a rational-ish Naruto, this may be a bad idea, because everyone will go for a shiny sooner or later and the quest will end in blood and tears. Some people have restricted voting only to a select list of reasonable people, some do not care about the votes, but choose the option with the best presented reasoning and so on. You (we? should I be the designated "takes care of background technical stuff" person for this quest?) should probably decide beforehand what kind of write-in and voting system we're going for and tell the players immediately.

Then we have the game mechanics side of questing. Basically, are you going to be doing skill checks when players decide to try something with uncertain chances of success? For reasons of stupid-monkeyness, giving the players a chance to determine the fate of the character via calls to rng really improves the satisfaction people derive from participating in quests, so you might want to do it. In that case, we should decide what style of system we should go with: there is classic DnD style of opposed checks, there is new and old World of Darkness dicepool stuff, we might actually want some simple homebrew system that's just better.

tl;dr There is technical stuff to figure out first, if we want to run the quest properly. Of course, dealing with this may be just the trivial inconvenience that kills your motivation to run the quest before you can even begin, in which case --- fuck it, write the intro the way you want it and we will figure out the exiting (to me) stuff, such as game mechanics, later.
