  we? should I be the designated "takes care of background technical stuff" person for this quest?)

Yep. Figure it out, call me when it's time to start writing -- I offer you total trust and leave it all in your hands.

[[/u/Velorien]]:

- If you want to weigh in on the fiddly bits, talk to [[/u/AugSphere]]. I'm fine with whatever you guys come up with.
- If you want to write the kickoff that's cool, otherwise I'll do it. [[/u/AugSphere]], please talk to Velorien and get his answer. Once the mechanics are worked out, ping whichever one of us is writing the kickoff.

EDIT: As to worldbuilding, my suggestions would be:

- Tech level of medieval Japan. No cell phones or other electronics. Maybe electricity is being experimented with, but it's still at a Leyden jar stage.
- Med-nin understand anatomy at a gross level -- down to the level you can see with a low-power optical microscope -- but do not know DNA exists. Orochimaru and a few other experts might. Note that the Byakugan canonically allows seeing everything down to the size of a dust mite (~ 0.25 mm)
- Seals are a thing and are used to run chakra-based technology. (Refrigerators, ovens, etc) A seal requires that the design be perfect and then a certain amount of chakra be added in order to activate it, but you don't have to add it all at once. Civilians have very low chakra reserves so it takes a long time to energize anything other than a very basic seal. Retired ninja can make good money selling the things, just because they can produce them faster than a civvie.
- Konoha is the largest village, with a population described below. Other major ninja villages are roughly the power level.
- There are multiple ninja school, some better than others. The Academy is the best. (Think Princeton or Oxford, with school quality trailing down to 'no-name diploma mill'.)

The Byakugan is an utter pain in the ass to write because it's so overpowered. I suggest the following definitions, most of which are canon:

- Infrared through UV
- Sees chakra, can identify individual people / animals / seals by their chakra
- Down to 0.25mm resolution
- Range of 50m for genin (e.g. Hinata at Wave Arc) up to 10km for Hiashi
- There's a 5 degree cone out the back of your neck that you can't see. (In canon it's smaller and variable.) Define this as: take the normal of your C4 vertebrae, draw a series of lines at 2.5 degrees off from that normal.
- Has one or more points of focus that they see absolutely everything in, including the insides of objects. Everything else in range is seen as clearly as a normal person sees in the arc 45 degrees off center. (Motion, color, approximate shape, no fine details.) Most users have 1 point of focus that is a sphere ~2m across. Skilled users have multiple and/or larger points of focus.
- Students start school (ninja or civilian) at 6 and go to school for 8 years, so graduates (ninja or civilian) are ~14. Higher education is available for civilians after graduation. Ninja students learn reading, writing, and basic math (up through algebra), but are lacking most civilian education and rarely pursue it further as they have more survival-critical skills to train.\\

Konoha:

- Total population w/civilians: ~50,000
- Hokage: 1 (Hiruzen Sarutobi as at start of Wave Arc)
- Elite jonin (Kakashi, Gai, Anko, etc): 30
- Other jonin (including special jonin): 100
- Chunin: 400
- Genin: 1600
- Itachi is gone, the Massacre is over, Danzo / Kakashi / Sasuke are the only Sharingan users in Konoha.\\
- They do more civilian missions (irrigation, wall-building) than military ones -- the money isn't as good but there are more of them and they don't risk valuable assets.

This is 1:25 tooth-to-tail ratio, which is low even for a medieval army so I think it works for a militarized city.

Rules:

- Players are not, I repeat *NOT*, allowed to have a Sharingan or a friendly bijuu inside them, although they can have an unfriendly one.\\
- There can be jinchuriki of non-bijuu if people want to do that. Minor animal or nature spirit, ancestor, etc.
- Players who want to be ninja start as genin.
