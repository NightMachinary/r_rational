I'd honestly love to as it sounds like great fun and I have a long and treasured past with online RP communities, but as I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, my current time constraints won't really allow it. My answer would probably be very different in four to five months (I'm taking a sabbatical year or two around then if I can get away with it), but I can't right now.

The sporadic writing time I do these days generally goes towards IFF. Even that isn't much, at the time. (Yes, I still work on it. No, it's not abandoned, and it won't be. It'll just take... time. Life keeps me busy. Sorry.)

Anyways, for what my opinion is worth, I'd agree with regards to not putting it in any one author's own universe.

I'd have a similar impulse to setting it within the IFF-verse, because I know the rules there and have spent ages trying to make them consistent. It's very different from your 'verse, though, and most of the other rationalist takes on Naruto I've seen. I'd also necessarily have to divulge some pretty heavy world-building spoilers.

Regardless of whether you guys are going to go ahead with this before my own completely unreasonably long (and unreasonably uncertain) time schedule of basically half a year, then I'd suggest some proper rational and well-defined setting is found that doesn't have a cornucopia of easily exploitable powers defined as an integral part of canon (I'm looking at you, Naruto).

Perhaps a shared creation would be interesting. Even the idea of a shared Naruto-verse might have some strong merits. We've all spent a very long time thinking about how to have that make sense and not break down instantly, after all.

Just airing ideas, here.
