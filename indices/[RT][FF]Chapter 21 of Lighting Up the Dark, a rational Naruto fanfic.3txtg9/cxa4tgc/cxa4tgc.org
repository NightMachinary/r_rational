If this story were a quest, I would be giving all of my votes to taking Oro-tan's offer as soon as possible and convincing Naruto to come as well (taking Sakura only so that she wouldn't be a pain in the ass with her Yan-Yan tendencies). Orochimaru is like the perfect character to turn in to a rational affable villain. You've done an awesome job so far!

  Sasuke enjoyed his manga more than he would ever admit, but he wasn't Naruto, and he knew that there was a solid line between fiction and reality.
