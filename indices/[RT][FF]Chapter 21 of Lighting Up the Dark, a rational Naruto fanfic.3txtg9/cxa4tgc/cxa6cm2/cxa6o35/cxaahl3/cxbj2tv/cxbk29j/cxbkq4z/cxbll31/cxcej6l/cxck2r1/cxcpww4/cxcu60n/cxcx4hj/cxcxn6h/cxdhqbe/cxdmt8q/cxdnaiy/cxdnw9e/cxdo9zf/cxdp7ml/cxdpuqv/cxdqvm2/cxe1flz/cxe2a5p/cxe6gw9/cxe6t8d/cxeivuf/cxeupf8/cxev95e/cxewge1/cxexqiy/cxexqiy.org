  The ninja have tried taking things over in the past, but the people don't want to be ruled by ninja. Military resistance doesn't work, but passive resistance does -- farmers don't farm efficiently, merchants don't merchant efficiently, etc. The ninja can make people do things by standing over them, but there aren't enough of them to do that. Given the fatalist view of the population, punishment raids are not effective. There are some collaborators, but in general it's just easier for the ninja to be a detached military force whom the civilians are happy to work with.

The problem with that argument is one of delegation. Let's treat the daimyo as a supreme ruler in a feudal system for a second. There is no way the very top of feudal power hierarchy would refuse to serve a ninja, they are just too few and too easy to hunt down. Holding their families hostage would be trivial for ninjas as well. So we have a ninja at the top. That kind of reasoning gives us at least a couple of top levels of a hierarchy in the hands of ninja (perhaps retired ones, who still crave power), with the lower levels, who handle the actual interactions with peasants, being vanilla mortals. Would peasants really care about who their daimyo is, even if they still deal with the same people? I think not. At least not enough to slack off more than they already do. Plus, I've never actually got a sense that ninja have any scarcity, at least as far as shelter and food go. There are few enough of them that they could comfortably tax a small number of civilians and live carefree lives of routine murder.

Should the daimyo just be subordinates who deal with the administration of civilian population without any ability to order ninja around? I doubt any shinobi would find that kind of work terribly appealing, so a trusted civilian would naturally fill the position. Remote areas away from big ninja villages could have their own governance structures of course.
