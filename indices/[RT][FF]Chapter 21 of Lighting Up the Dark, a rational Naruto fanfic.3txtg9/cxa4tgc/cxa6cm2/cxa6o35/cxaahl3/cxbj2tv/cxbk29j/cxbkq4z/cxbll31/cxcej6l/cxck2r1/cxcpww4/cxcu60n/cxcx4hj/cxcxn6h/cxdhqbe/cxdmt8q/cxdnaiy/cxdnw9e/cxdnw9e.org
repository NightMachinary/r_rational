The dice thing seems complicated to me. I'd prefer that everyone has a number of points in their chakra pool and they buy things. So, "shadow clone cost N points to start up, plus 5 per clone" and "you can buy an additional die on your taijutsu for X points". Pools refresh between scenes or when the GM says so.
