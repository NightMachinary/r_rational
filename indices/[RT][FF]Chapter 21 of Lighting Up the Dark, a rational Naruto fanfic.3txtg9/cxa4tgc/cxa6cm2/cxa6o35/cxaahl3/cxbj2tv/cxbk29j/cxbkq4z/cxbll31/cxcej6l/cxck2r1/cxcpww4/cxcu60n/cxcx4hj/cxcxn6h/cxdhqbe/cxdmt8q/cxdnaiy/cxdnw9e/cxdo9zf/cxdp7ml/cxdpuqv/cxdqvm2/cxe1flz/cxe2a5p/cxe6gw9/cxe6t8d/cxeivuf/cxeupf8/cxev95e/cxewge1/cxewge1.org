Hm, actually, a handful of missing-nin trying to build a new village sounds really appealing. Maybe it's a couple of jonin, a handful of chunin, and a bunch of genin, and they need to attract some other ninja and a lot of civilians to do the farming and such. Could be survivors of another village, but I prefer the idea that one chunin missing-nin with only moderate ninja-power but excellent charisma went around convincing other missing-nin to band together and join up. The chunin is in charge, even though the jonin outrank him / her.

Reasons why daimyo might be in power:

- The Daimyos and Kages are co-rulers, with the Daimyo handling the civilian side and the ninja handling the military. Both of them are aware that the Daimyo is dead any time the Kage wants him to be, so the daimyo is second fiddle.
- Same as above, but there is a widely-held belief that the military should be subordinate to the civilian side (e.g. America, every other decent nation on earth) and everyone buys into it.
- Samurai are basically ninja with low chakra reserves. In a fair fight they are not a one-on-one match, but there are a lot more of them.
- The ninja have tried taking things over in the past, but the people don't want to be ruled by ninja. Military resistance doesn't work, but passive resistance does -- farmers don't farm efficiently, merchants don't merchant efficiently, etc. The ninja can make people do things by standing over them, but there aren't enough of them to do that. Given the fatalist view of the population, punishment raids are not effective. There are some collaborators, but in general it's just easier for the ninja to be a detached military force whom the civilians are happy to work with.
