Oh, so it's another name for a play-by-post RPG. (Honestly, why do people keep changing the names? 'emoticons' was a perfectly good name, we didn't have to go to 'emoji' We didn't need the name 'XML', either, since we already had 'mind-crushing source of misery and horror'. Bah! Get off my lawn! /waves stick/)

I'd be willing to try it, with the proviso that the posts would likely be pretty short to start and I might need to bail out if it ends up taking too much time. If I were doing it on my own I'd set it in the Team_Anko-verse -- it could be a fun way to explore the Republic/Elemental Nations conflict. Although, if other GMs are chiming in we'd probably want to do something different, since locking them into my sandbox seems rude.

[[/u/omgimpwned]], [[/u/Wertifloke]], [[/u/Velorien]], what do you think?
