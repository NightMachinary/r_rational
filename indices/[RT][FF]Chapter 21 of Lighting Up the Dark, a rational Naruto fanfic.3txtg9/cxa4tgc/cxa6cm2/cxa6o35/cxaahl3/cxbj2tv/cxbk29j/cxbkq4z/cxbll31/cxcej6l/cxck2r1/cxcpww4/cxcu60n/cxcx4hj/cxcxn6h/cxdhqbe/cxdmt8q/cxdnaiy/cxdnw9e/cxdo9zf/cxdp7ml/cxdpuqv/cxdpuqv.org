Yup, seems reasonable. Now we just have to assign the numbers to techniques.

As an aside, do we really need the blind spot for byakugan? It always bugged me, because it was an obvious ugly hack added for the sake of a single fight in canon. Just toss it out, I say. Otherwise all the HyÅ«ga will just constantly fidget around and no other difference will be apparent, but it'll bug me to no end. Compared to the other magic eyes byakugan has a pretty low power ceiling anyway.

Also, what kind of power curve are we going for? If we're aiming for a pretty short wild ride a-la waves arisen, we may want to just leave all the ridiculous stuff in and see how quickly things escalate. Personally, I always get tetchy when things are nerfed, because it feels like stripping the universe of it's flavour, but I'm not writing, so it's up to you and [[/u/Velorien]].
