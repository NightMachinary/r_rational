Another thing we could do that would give the character a sense of personality straight off the bat is to allow them to choose a technique which is powerful (compared to non-optimised use of Academy techniques), but narrow in its application or possessing significant drawbacks which enemies can and will exploit (Shadow Imitation is an example of the former, Mind Transfer an example of the latter). It would fit with the canon approach to Genin.
