For the character that the readers control, I think what specific techniques they learn should be mostly outside of their control.

For example, remember in the Wave Arc after the first time they fight Zabuza, the kids have a chance to recover their strength for a few days and learn tree-walking?

If something similar were to happen during the game, the players should get a choice of roughly what they get to learn, within reason. Perhaps the choice could be something like this:

*Learn a technique to help with evasion and escape

*Learn a technique that helps in close-quarters combat

*Practice one of your old techniques and see if you can master a new application of that technique.

*Work with your team-mates to develop some kind of combination-attack.

*Rest well to be in top shape for the next fight.

The players choose roughly what to focus on but the Game Master always chooses the outcome and what specific techniques the player character learns.
