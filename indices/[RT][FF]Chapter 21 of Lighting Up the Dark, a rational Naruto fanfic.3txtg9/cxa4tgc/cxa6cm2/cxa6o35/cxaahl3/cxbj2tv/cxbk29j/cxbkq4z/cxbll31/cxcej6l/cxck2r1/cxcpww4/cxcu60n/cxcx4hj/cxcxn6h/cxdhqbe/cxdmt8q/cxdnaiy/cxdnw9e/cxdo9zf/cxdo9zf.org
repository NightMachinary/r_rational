That's what I was proposing, yeah. Should have probably expressed myself better. So a character has some chakra points. He can either use them in a jutsu, or use them to add dice to their basic taijutsu/shurikenjutsu/hoejutsu/whateverelsewashandyjutsu rolls.

Do we allow them to buy dice on top of jutsu? Suppose a player says, "I'm gonna use a fireball for X dice, but I really, really want it to hit, so I'm gonna pump some Y chakra into my legs and position myself properly while doing the hand jive". Then we have him cast the jutsu for X normally, but add extra Y (or Y/2, or whatever going rate we decide on) dice to his attempt to hit with it.
