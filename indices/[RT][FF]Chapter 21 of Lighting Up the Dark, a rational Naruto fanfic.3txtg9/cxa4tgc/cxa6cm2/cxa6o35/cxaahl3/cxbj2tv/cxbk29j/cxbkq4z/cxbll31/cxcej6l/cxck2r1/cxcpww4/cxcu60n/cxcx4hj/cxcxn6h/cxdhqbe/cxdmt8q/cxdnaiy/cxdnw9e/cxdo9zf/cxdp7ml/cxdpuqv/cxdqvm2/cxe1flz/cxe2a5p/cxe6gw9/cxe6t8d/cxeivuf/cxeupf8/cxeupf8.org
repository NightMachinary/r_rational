Well, if Hiruzen can do it then in theory anyone can. As I recall he didn't have anything special -- not unusually large chakra reserves or a bloodline or anything. He was just that damn good, yes?

I'm totally fine with characters optimizing as they like. I'll happily hand out Death Stars as it becomes necessary.

One thing that I will say, though: to hell with canon. I'll use the setting, but Danzo isn't going to conveniently have ten Sharingan on his arm for anyone to steal. Anyone complaining that characters and/or events aren't true to canon (too old, too young, can/can't do something they did/didn't do, know/don't know something they should, watever) can take a flying leap out of the game.
