  Should there be chakra budgeting? Other stats?
#+end_quote

If we want to do chakra budgeting, I have formulas. They are intentionally fairly restrictive, but could easily be opened up. Also, I would say we should standardizs the henge -- is it physical, illusion, or can it be either at wearer's choice? This is important to determine what happens when someone henges into an object as opposed to s person.

He's my favorite Team Anko character, since I made him intelligent and non-pedo. Not so keen on the canon idiot, though.
