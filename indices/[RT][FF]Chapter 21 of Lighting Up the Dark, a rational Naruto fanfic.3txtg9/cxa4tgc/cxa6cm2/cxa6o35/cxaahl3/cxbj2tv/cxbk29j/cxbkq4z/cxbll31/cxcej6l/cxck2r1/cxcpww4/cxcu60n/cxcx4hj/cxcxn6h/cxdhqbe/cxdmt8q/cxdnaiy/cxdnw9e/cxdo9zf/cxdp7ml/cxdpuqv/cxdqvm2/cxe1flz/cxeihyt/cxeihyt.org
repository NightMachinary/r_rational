Let me be a voice of dissent on this. We're targeting [[/r/rational]] audience with this, people will crave optimisation. And people *know* that some techniques are miles ahead of others in usefulness. We could make their sensei an asshole, who refuses to let them know the specifics of what he'll teach them, or something, but that would simply be an obstacle to be overcome on the path to power. Sooner or later people will manoeuvre the character into a position, where there is no justification to deny them full information about what they could learn other than 'DM fiat'. Just outright taking the ability of players to choose optimal path of development is huge dick move. If we're gonna restrict players that much, might as well give up on the whole quest and just write a collaboration fanfic.

That said, we probably shouldn't just allow people to freely use their meta knowledge. If they don't know about the specifics of shadow clone technique in-character, then there will be no reason for them to obsessively try to acquire the technique and we could disallow it.

In short, attempts to curb power levelling should be done via controlling the information the character has, or just by making the world hostile and not at all obliging to power-levelling. If the players have invested in-character time to look for specifics of some technique, we may as well let them have it.
