  Why this?

Inexplicable authorial aversion to overwhelming firepower. It's the whole "a proper ninja must be sneaky and backstabby" thing, which somehow manages to miss the fact that Narutoverse "ninja" are not medieval Japanese peasants, but wizardly warrior-gods. The in-story justification boils down to grinding the base stats first before applying power-multipliers, which smells of bullshit, because possession of power-multipliers doesn't lock Rei out of grinding her stats. Happily, everyone who tries to sell her that bullshit has actual reasons to want Rei to remain as weak as possible for as long as possible, so it's not that jarring to read.

I don't expect to see much more of this, actually. Both SB and SV flip out at anything even very remotely resembling sexuality for some reason. If I were writing and people gave me oblique hints in the style of "nice story you have here, be a shame if mods happened to it" every time I wrote anything more edgy than people holding hands, I'd stop writing anything more edgy than people holding hands.
