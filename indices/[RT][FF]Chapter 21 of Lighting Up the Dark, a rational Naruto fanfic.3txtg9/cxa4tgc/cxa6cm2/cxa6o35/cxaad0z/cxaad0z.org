The only thing I want to see is a triple crossover with [[/u/FuguofAnotherWorld]]'s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11402847/1/Roll-the-Dice-on-Fate][Roll the Dice on Fate]] modified to be Choji's brother, Silver Queen's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][Dreaming of Sunshine]], and SixPerfections's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10779196/1/Walk-on-the-Moon][Walk on the Moon]].\\
It'd be a triple SI ino-shika-cho power stomp.
