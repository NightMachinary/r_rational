To be fair, all of that is pretty weak:

1. 

   #+begin_quote
     Just the fact that the deal requires betraying his country is Bayseian evidence that the deal is bad
   #+end_quote

   Simply transferring to Orochimaru is impossible, so generally Sasuke would have to defect to get some optimal training. That is pretty much true regardless of Oro's intentions, hence weak evidence.

2. 

   #+begin_quote
     Likewise, the fact that Orochimaru is giving him seriously incomplete information about the plan is Bayseian evidence that Orochimaru is trying to deceive him. Also the fact that he can't safely talk about the plan to anyone else.
   #+end_quote

   That's a bit more concerning, but what could he actually tell him? The fact that his eyes could be used to control the bijÅ«. But he could have just as well avoided telling him because he doesn't want Sasuke to give himself away and is otherwise acting in good faith. Not getting Sasuke put under guard would be a goal regardless. Again weak.
