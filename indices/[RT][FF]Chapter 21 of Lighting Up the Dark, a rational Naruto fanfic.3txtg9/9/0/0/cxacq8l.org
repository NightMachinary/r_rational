  That's a bit more concerning, but what could he actually tell him?

It may be simultaneously true that 1) what Orochimaru told him is evidence for the deal being bad, and 2) the deal is actually good and Orochimaru couldn't have told him anything better.

Then Orochimaru would simply have gotten very unlucky--by pure chance this good deal looks very much like a bad one from the outside. And it would still be logical for Sasuke to treat it as a bad deal; Sasuke would just be unlucky in that he is turning down a good deal that has a lot of evidence for it being bad.
