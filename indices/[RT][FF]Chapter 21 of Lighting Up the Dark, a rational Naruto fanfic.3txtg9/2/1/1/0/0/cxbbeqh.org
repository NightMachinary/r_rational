I know for a fact that Orochi doesn't know about the Dead Demon Consuming Seal when Hiruzen uses it on him, because he comments about it being an interesting new jutsu and /stands still/ so that the Hokage can use it on him. Out of curiosity. Really, that's just incompetence of the highest order. The God of Shinobi is using a new attack you've never seen before you don't just stand there and take it.

Presumably after the battle he researches the fuck out of it in order to regain his arms and finds the release. Of course, whether or not this Orochimaru knows it is up in the air.
