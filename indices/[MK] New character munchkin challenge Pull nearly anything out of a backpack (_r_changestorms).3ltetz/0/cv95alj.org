[[https://www.reddit.com/r/changestorms/comments/3ltela/mk_callsign_mole_produces_things_from_his_backpack/][Quinn Hallman]] is one of the main characters in my as-yet-unpublished, WIP novel /Induction/. His power is based on 'White Hole Man', a character that a friend of mine played in a Champions game ages ago; I've just nailed down some of the edge cases. His callsign is a nod to the 'White Hole Man' origin.
