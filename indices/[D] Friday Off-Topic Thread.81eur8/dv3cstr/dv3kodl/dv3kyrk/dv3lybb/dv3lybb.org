I am unsure how to answer this without spoilers. there's a lot of world development you are missing, but it's wildbow, every chapter is rife with world development.

I will say there is a list called the skitter facts on TVTropes and all of them are arguably accurate, but yes the Earth bet world is burning down and I'm not going to spoil the ending things, but thing escalate, and keep escalating, but not so badly that there isn't a sequel. Do we get escapism in it, sometimes: the next Arc [[#s][skitter fact]] , do we get real adult fear in this story, boy howdy yes we do.

To go by analogy I read Charels Stross "laundry files" if you aren't familiar with the series it's a bit of a Cthulhu comedy/adventure/horror with each book parodying the style of some popular genre, where the horror factor keeps ramping up, and now the stars are right. The next book in the series is really going to hurt, so is the next book in the [[https://www.tor.com/2015/08/27/how-baru-cormorant-would-overthrow-emperor-palpatine-kill-voldemort-and-stop-sauron/][Baru]] [[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/seth-dickinson-answers-5-questions-monster-baru-cormorant/][Cormarant]] series but they are cool stories with well intentined deeply flawed people/monsters trying to do what they think is the right thing.
