I believe one of the taglines joking proposed for Worm as it was coming out was "And then it gets worse".

But honestly the story has many ups and downs. And there are parts of it where it feels like Taylor and those around her do gain their footing for a little bit and things somewhat calm down. But for there most part there is a steady decline here, not necessarily always for Taylor herself, but as a general tone for the story.

So I guess what you have to ask yourself is if the high points of the story you've seen so far are worth experiencing the low points that you've seen. Because there's more of both coming, with less and less time for stabilization as things head towards the end.

I'd say it's worth the ride, but if it's honestly depressing you then maybe the story isn't for you, or maybe you'd do better to take a break and read something else for a while before coming back to it.
