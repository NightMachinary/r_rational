I'm still only halfway through Twig (I stopped for a bit at what seems like a fairly major turning point in the story) but the main thing that makes Worm and Pact grimdark, I think, is that feeling of a ceaseless grind of bad-to-worse situations, and the first half of Twig doesn't really do that.

I don't mind if you spoil the second half a bit by saying it does get to that eventually (I'm kind of expecting it to at some point), but if you disagree and think that even at the first half it's darker than Worm, I'd be interested in why.
