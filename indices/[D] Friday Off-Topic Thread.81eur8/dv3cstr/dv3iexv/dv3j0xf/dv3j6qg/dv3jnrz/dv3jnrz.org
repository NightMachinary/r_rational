Not sure. I read everything that was there a year or so ago and haven't checked back on his progress since yet. It's on my todo list. Superpowered's protagonist is pretty average, definitely not rational, but several other characters, including one of his friends and a few teachers are very intelligent. One of the big themes is that a lot of the more powerful heroes optimize their powers to ridiculous degrees, often spending years really understanding how to use their abilities to the fullest. The school's headmaster in particular has munchkin-ed his initially relatively mediocre ability pretty hard.
