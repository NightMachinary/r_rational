I quit at the same point you're at because I just couldn't take how harrowing it had become. I preferred watching Breaking Bad because, as dark as that show is, the tragedies are more cathartic and the protagonists are unlikable enough that you don't feel as bad when they suffer.

I /loved/ Worm before Leviathan showed up, I put it up there with season 1 of Daredevil, but by the time the Slaughterhouse 9 showed up reading it just became painful. I've heard Wildbow's other work is good, Pact is at least horrifying from the start while Twig is actually about heroes fighting evil and winning.

If you want more clever superheroes that isn't nihilistic, I recommend the anime My Hero Academia and the book Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain. Both have their dark elements, but know how to appeal to the fun escapism of people with power using it to help others and fight injustice.
