It's from the same people behind the RPG anthology One Shot Podcast, which they sometimes upload Invisible Sun content to as well. I recommend listening to updates in order of when they were uploaded, though [[http://oneshotpodcast.com/podcasts/one-shot/241-a-woman-with-hollow-eyes-calvins-escape/][this session]] takes place between Episode 2 and Episode 3A despite being uploaded later.
