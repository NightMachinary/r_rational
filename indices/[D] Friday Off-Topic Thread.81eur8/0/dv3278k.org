I saw The Matrix again yesterday, and I was once again impressed with how good it is. I think if I could choose to forget something in order to experience it for the first time again, The Matrix would be very high on the list.

Also, there seems to be a lot of fodder for a rational take on it. The theory that it's nested simulations. That the machines are actually benevolent caretakers of humanity, or that humanity created The Matrix originally as a paradise for themselves, and that the machines had some sort of value drift.

The most fascinating part to me is how it sets up hackers as being these truth-seeking mystics looking for a greater truth. I can't imagine that The Laundry Files by Charles Stross wasn't based at least in part off of that.
