Anyone have recommendations for good and or rational Star Wars fics?

I finished The Waves Arisen yesterday after going in blind, and while I don't dislike it, it read as a draft of "I want to hit these plot points, and fill in the rest later." Everything just felt very rushed, with basically no stopping for character development or character interaction between the fighting and munchkining. No spoilers, but a big example is after Hinata's fight with Neji, she kind of just never mentions it again. Hinata started as a rather shy and withdrawn person, and ended at very nearly the same place. Basically the same for Sasuke, although he did change some.

Also, everything seemed to just... Work out extremely well. Naruto is smarter, sure, that's the premise. But shadow clone is also categorically better as well, same with water clone, same with Sasuke's powerup he got early on. And that would all be ok, but the antagonists aren't scaled up to match. They're mildly better than in canon, but nowhere near an intelligent Naruto with broken abilities.

I'm not saying that the entire work is bad, it's not, but a lot of the plot could be changed for the better while keeping many of the same elements that make it enjoyable now. Many things could be fixed by simply slowing down the pacing in certain areas.
