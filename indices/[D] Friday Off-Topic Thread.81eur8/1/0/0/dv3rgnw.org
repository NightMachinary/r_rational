Currently watching the Clone Wars series. As in, as I'm typing right now. I read one book series following Darth Bane I think? The one who got some cool living carapace armor stuff and instituted the Rule of Two. Also some comic about one of Luke's grandchildren. Liked the former, kind of disliked the latter. That was years ago though, and that's pretty much all I've seen aside from the movies.
