Are you picking up on how unreliable the narrator is? There's a lot of moral questions being asked, there's a lot of exploration of different moral codes, and sometimes it's subtler than you thought at first read. You are at one of the lows in the story, depending on your relative values of various taboos, and thoughts on foolish utilitarians robbing banks, there are lower lows. Have you tried listening to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HydKjQMzJ8][we've got worm]] it's a podcast that comments on the literary aspects and often gives Taylor a well deserved hard time for the bad rationalizations she gives. I don't know if it will make it more or less fun for you after you see someone discuss it, but it was added value for me on a reread and it pointed out the little harmonies in the story that argue against the nihilism.
