  NINJA EDIT: I think the only way this would work for me would be if taylor was a tinker instead. This would allow me to see taylor evolve or something. Allowing me to have hope that she could prepare and possible take down the bad guys. All of this was dashed when Pan went into the prison.

Don't worry Taylor does develop, eventually, and Skitter will take down the bad guys.
