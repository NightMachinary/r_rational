? I am confused about that last line. Taylor herself is not very nihilistic it is the world she lives in that is. I also understand how her robbing a bank is not very utilitarian but that is not one of my problems with this story. I just feel like their is no hope in this world. It does not matter what taylor does it will never come to anything good, and that is why I am having trouble reading more of the book.

I think I want escapism when I read books, and I never want to escape to this world.

NINJA EDIT: I think the only way this would work for me would be if taylor was a tinker instead. This would allow me to see taylor evolve or something. Allowing me to have hope that she could prepare and possible take down the bad guys. All of this was dashed when Pan went into the prison.
