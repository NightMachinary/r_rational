Honestly, twig and pact are both way darker than worm. Pact gets bad enough that people who liked worm were complaining about the darkness by the end of it, and describing the protagonists of twig as heroes is really stretching it. Worm is amazing, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. There are several other excellent, but not as dark, superhero fictions out there. It's definitely recommend Superpowered's, if you like worm but would prefer if it was like 3 steps less horrifying. ([[http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/superpowereds/]]). Citadel is also decent, but I think it got abandoned. I've heard legion of nothing was good, but never really got into it.
