I'm one of those people who never liked The Matrix, even the premise didn't really appeal to me, but instead of whining about what I didn't enjoy about it I'd like to talk about a tabletop game and actual play podcast with a similar premise that I do really like. It has more of a fantasy flavor than sci-fi, but I think that just allows for even more imagination. No kung-fu, though.

[[https://www.montecookgames.com/category/invisible-sun/][Invisible Sun]] by Monte Cook Games has similar themes of Gnostic philosophy and uncovering mystical enlightenment that gives you cool powers, but instead of a ruined Earth ruled by machines the real world is more like Welcome to Night Vale. It's strange and surreal, oddly humorous and subtly horrifying, and the heroes need to explore its many wonders. From a game design perspective, I think it's a really interesting system for emergent storytelling.

[[https://youtu.be/II8MpLIEh20][A Woman with Hollow Eyes]] is a completely improvised RPG campaign, by professional improvisers, about a trio of wizards regaining the memories they lost while they were hiding on Earth and all the weird yet relatable things they run into along the way. The series is streamed on Twitch weekly, where the audience can participate, and [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3-PonsBj4qPT1FNluLQCj9bIPy-9bHns][then uploaded to YouTube]] but I use podsync.net to turn the videos into a podcast feed.
