If you hire someone to enchant your door, they will necessarily be able to unenchant it, so pretty much every system automatically has a back door.

It would be nice to have a way to set it back into training mode without removing it entirely. Better would be to make it so you could set the level of training, and turn it down as it gets closer to exactly what you want.

What happens if the original caster dies? Does the enchantment become permanent?

How intelligent is the magic? I get that it doesn't care about what you mean to train it, but what can it notice? I imagine training it to detect prime numbers would be impossible, for example.
