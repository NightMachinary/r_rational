It's underspecified, but perhaps with the rules as they are you could still do this. Train an object to apply a force proportional to, say, the number of marbles in a jar, only train it with 1-10 marbles to start with, and then when it's locked in, you put a thousand marbles in the jar and it applies a hundred times the force?
