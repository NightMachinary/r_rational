I think the biggest problem is point 4, as everyone would try to Enchant as many things as possible so that no one else could, since there seems to be no deliberate way of finding out who Enchanted an object. When you are born you can expect that every single thing in the entire world that you could reasonably get your hands on has already been Enchanted. I would suggest some other form of control method for not having some douche Disenchant your door that you spent MONTHS to train and you FINALLY got to work properly. Perhaps you can train an Enchanted item to avoid being Disenchanted? Or perhaps Enchanting leaves /magical fingerprints/ so that you can figure out who Enchanted or Disenchanted something?
