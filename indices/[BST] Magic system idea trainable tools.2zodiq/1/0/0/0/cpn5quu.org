  Can you make circuits with magic?

This one sounds like it could have great potential. You could probably make a computer functionally similar to ENIAC with relative ease. I would imagine that training simple conditions would be easier and faster than training complex ones. That would mean a transistor or a logic gate would be the easiest things to make. Lets say that you can only work with an object that is large enough to see, so a grain of sand is about as small as we can make our transistors without using a microscope (if that would even work for miniaturization.) A grain of sand is still a huge improvement over a vacuum tube (size, no heat, no burning out.) Now the only obstacle to our sand computer is how fast you can churn out the gates, if you can make them in batches- great! we're on our way to magic Moor's law. If not, than magic computers modeled after our computers probably won't get that far.

But even if magic can't miniaturize well enough to give them computers similar to our own, magic computers could be much more flexible than our own. Maybe make some sort of system that can use base 3, or higher base transistors and make pseudo-quantum computers.
