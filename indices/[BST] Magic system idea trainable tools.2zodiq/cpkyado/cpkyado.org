Ooh, cool.

Hmm ... how well can objects see? Is everyone's clothes and walls "trained" to do nothing so they're immune to telekenesis?

Might be worth killing or kidnapping your trainer after they finish training the doomsday device, if you're evil ...

Hey, speaking of which, what are the limits of this telekinesis? Is it stronger than you are? How much precision do you have; can it cut through things like a molecule-thin blade, for example? Can it reach through solid objects, or down narrow holes?
