Yeah, I definitely need to work on the input side of the system. Lazily, I could go for microscopic detail on everything inside a magic circle or something, but I don't like that option particularly. Visual display slightly less than human acuity in the line-of-sight of the trained objects?

I'd say that it's a general practice to train clothing and walls with nothing. Trained objects can still interact with each other normally, though, so it's not a perfect defence.

Still haven't decided what happens to trained objects at a trainer's death. One option would just be exponential decay in the force available over weeks or months, immediately ceasing to function, continuing to work but able to be untrained by anyone, or just continuing to work indefinitely. I like the "continuing to work but anyone can disable it" option most so far.

As for the limits of telekinesis, I was imagining something like more or less direct control of any contiguous object. Not quite sure how to describe what I mean, but it's like proprioception extends to include the object under control. In training, it can't exert a force higher than a Newton or so, and maximum speed of 2m/s, but a trained object can exceed that by about three orders of magnitude. Need to brush up on mechanics to make sure that makes sense, but that's roughly what I have in mind.
