Make perpetual motion machines easily. They scale, too. Flight and all forms of travel are a piece of cake now. Just make a bunch of bricks that push in the direction of a controller device at 1k newtons. People make personal at first and then standardized mechanical remotes that activate certain objects based on patterns in the remote. Keys that activate objects passively based on their characteristics. Assembly line rituals for enchanting hundreds of important tools with the same training data. Any number of amazing sensors based on macroscale or abstract things. (Perfect cancer tests) Science about magic working faster than light or not.

However, much of this magic system is still not very well defined. How exactly do you train objects? Is magic a perfect binary solomonoff inductor? What would that even mean? How do enhanced force and different patterns of programmed action factor into that? How exactly does the telekinetic control work? What does it feel like? Can you use magic on fluids? What about silly putty? How fine-grained is it? Can you imprint paper with images in your mind using ink? Can you make movies just by imagining them? If you can feel where the liquids are, can you submerge an object and know its shape? Can you make "solid" books that you can read with this new sense? Would reading brail become faster than reading text? Can you automatically train objects? Can you automatically cast new magic? Can animals do magic? Bacteria? Can you make circuits with magic? Complex ones? How do you make an adder? Can you abstract and combine two complex mathematical functions? How long would it take to train that, and how would you do it?
