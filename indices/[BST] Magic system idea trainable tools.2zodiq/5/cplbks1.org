Perhaps instead of telekinesis, magic gloves? Then the action could be tied to the gloves instead of specific people. If you wave your hand before unlocking a door for the first two years then you can just wave with the glove and the door unlocks itself. Then you can just throw away the key and keep the glove. That would also allow objects to have different trainings with different gloves. A wave of the left hand unlocks and a wave of the right locks.

Depending on the glove material this could also allow mass production of trained items with matched gloves. This could be done by training a mechanism to wave and then unlock a door every two minutes. Then attach a glove and it will automatically train the door to unlock when that glove waves. Switch out door and glove and repeat.
