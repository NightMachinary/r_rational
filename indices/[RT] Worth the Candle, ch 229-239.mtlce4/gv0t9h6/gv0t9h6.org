This was so hard to read, I was shaking throughout both chapters, revealing the text line by line, driven by the horrifying need to know what was going to happen while a voice screamed in the back of my mind, pleading with me to stop.

Somehow, even though it has been foreshadowed to hell and back, the ending caught me completely by surprise and felt like the hit of the vorpal blade itself.

What a great piece of writing. I am in awe.
