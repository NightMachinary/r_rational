You may, but I certainly would not be able to help skim them enough to be spoiled about torture/hell/murder/rape/violence.

[the same glance showing me an area of the screen is trigger warnings is is enough to read the salient words for me]The chapter started without any of this, so there was actually suspense for me, whether we'd see any of that. So trigger warnings should be in spoiler tags.

Even if there's nothing triggering, they should be there and say nothing, no trigger warnings for this, so nobody will be spoiled implicitly.
