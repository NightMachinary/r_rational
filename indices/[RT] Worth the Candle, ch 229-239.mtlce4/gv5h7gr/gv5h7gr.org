A few thoughts (tl;dr, I think he let them go so they would open the door for him):

- How would things have played out if Joon had just died and gone to the hells earlier, skipping straight to whatever this is? (My guess is he wouldn't have known that the door needs a password and a key and wouldn't have looked for them in the hells)

- Fel Seed was explicitly unable to open the door; this feels like it's saying something about "doing that won't bring him back" in terms of how the original campaign came about. It might just be a narrative necessity, though.

- The vorpal blade, despite being explicitly shown to still have the "conceptually dismember whatever it hits" property, merely cuts Joon's head off. This is probably as simple as Fel Seed deciding that sending him to the hells intact is the worst thing he can do to him at that juncture, although there remain issues of "he doesn't get to actually witness the suffering" and "it's hard to believe that he legitimately failed to catch anyone else given all the other blatant cheating that went on" (especially given the literal speed of light attack that occurred right at the start, which honestly should mean he could just dismantle everyone in an instant if he wanted to). The whole thing has an air of DM fiat (or Fel Seed fiat, if this is for some reason the outcome he wanted) to ensure exactly this outcome; similar to how the original campaign went, but with a different result. It also MIGHT be possible that some other form of metaphysical damage was done to him (or just plain meta; perhaps the game is not supposed to be "over" but the blade has severed him from it) but I get the impression that the disassembly is all-or-nothing.

- Concluding from a few points above...if Joon going to the hells is required to get the information to open the door, and Valencia and the team providing support is necessary for this to happen, I could believe that this is all being orchestrated by Fel Seed to get them to open it; that being the one thing we've seen that he explicitly CAN'T do himself. The behavioural oddities could be explained by the fact that he actually needs to use these people for something, when in the original campaign he wanted for nothing.

- Joon DID give up a bit of himself to the blade, an action whose consequences persisted despite the following time reversal. I have no idea of the implications of this; it might affect how he manifests in the hells, it might just have been for flavour (although I am loath to believe that given how thorough the story has been about everything else), or it might become relevant in some other way.
