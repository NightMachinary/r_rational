Perhaps "Achievements Unlocked" can be a stat? Juniper unlocked 37 different achievements onscreen if "Helldiver" and "Game Over Man, Game Over" count, or 35 if they don't. +I don't think there's any mention of achievements received off-screen.+

Edit: He gets an achievement off-screen for unlocking Velocity Magic. Thanks to [[/u/BaronVonPwny][u/BaronVonPwny]] for pointing this out! From Chapter 225, "Runination":

This brings the total up to 38, or 36 without the last two achievements.
