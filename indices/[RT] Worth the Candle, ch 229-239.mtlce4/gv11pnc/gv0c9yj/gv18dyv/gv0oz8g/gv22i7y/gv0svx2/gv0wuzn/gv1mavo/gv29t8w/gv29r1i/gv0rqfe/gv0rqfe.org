Optional Bosses Defeated: 4. (Mome Rath, Onion, Tommul, Perisev) These are all fights Joon needed bullshit to win and could have avoided fighting altogether. Slayer of Horrors completions /might/ count as well for this?

Capstone Virtues Discovered: 11 (Soul, Still, Spirit, +8 from the Onion fight.)

Bonus edit: most pounds of gold used for gold magic. Don't know the numbers on this one, but would be a funny high score metric if WtC were a video game.
