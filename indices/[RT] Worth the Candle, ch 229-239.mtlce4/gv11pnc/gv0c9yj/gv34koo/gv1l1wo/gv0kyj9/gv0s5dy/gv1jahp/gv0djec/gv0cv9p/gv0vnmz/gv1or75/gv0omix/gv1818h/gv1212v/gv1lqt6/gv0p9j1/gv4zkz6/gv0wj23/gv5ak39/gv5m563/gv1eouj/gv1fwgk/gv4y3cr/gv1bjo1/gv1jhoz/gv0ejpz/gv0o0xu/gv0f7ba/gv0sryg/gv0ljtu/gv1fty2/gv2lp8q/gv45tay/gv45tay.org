Nuclear weapons are excluded (at what level is unclear -- would it also apply to fusion or antimatter reactions in addition to fission?), but Juniper knows that those levels of power could be brought to bear. Why not just spend a decade constructing some sort of kinetic bombardment + death laser + moon-based railgun etc. type of structure to raze the EZ a hundred miles down and five hundred across?

(what was the source of the time pressure here, again? Was it concern that narrativium would scale Fel Seed up to whatever higher reaches the party might yet grasp? If the story has taken place in under a subjective year, it seems like they could have spent a few more maxing out all the skills or whatever before trying to take him on, especially if they suspected his level did not scale)

That, or more esoteric conceptual stuff -- forge a spear that's the material embodiment of victory, or work metamagic up until you manage to modify the boundaries of exclusion zones and squish his down to the volume of a marble. Chuck the gods of Aerb at him. Maybe explore the possibilities of some sort of intelligence explosion, and let that post-singularity being figure it out. It's hard to imagine something like a Culture Mind doing anything but trivially brushing off Fel Seed's mountains of flesh, say. Speaking of, I wonder how the hells of Aerb will compare to the digital hells of /Surface Detail/ (that's generally how I've been picturing them so far).
