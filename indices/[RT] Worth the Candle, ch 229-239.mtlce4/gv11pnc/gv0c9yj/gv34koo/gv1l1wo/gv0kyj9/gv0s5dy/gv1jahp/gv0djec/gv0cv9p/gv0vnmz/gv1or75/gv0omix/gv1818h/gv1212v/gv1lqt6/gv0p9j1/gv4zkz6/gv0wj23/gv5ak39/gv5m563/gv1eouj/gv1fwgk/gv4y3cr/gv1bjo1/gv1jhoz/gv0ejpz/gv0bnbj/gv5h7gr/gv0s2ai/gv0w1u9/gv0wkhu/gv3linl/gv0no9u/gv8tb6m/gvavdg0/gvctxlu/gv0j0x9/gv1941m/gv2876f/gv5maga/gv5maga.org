How does the game setting "Helldiver" actually work? By the rules of the world, anyone dead goes to the hells unless someone bottles the relevant part of the soul within the time limit.

We imagine Fel Seed is not the sort to do this, but how /would/ that work? Would there effectively be two of Juniper, one in the hells by game fiat and (part of) one in a jar?

Alternatively, we can comprehend a state of affairs where the checkbox actually does nothing because Juniper is truly inside the world, not interacting with it as a game from outside. The fact that the Infinite Library can model him is perhaps evidence for this.
