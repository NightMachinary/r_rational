I love this story and these two chapters had me on the edge of my seat and were interesting to read. But they were also mildly traumatizing. I'm debating if I should read the next chapter batch or have someone summarize it for me.

I'll recover just fine on my own, but it will take at least a day or so and there was stuff I was hoping to get done tomorrow which I'm not sure if I will or not. While I've been traumatized in worse ways than merely reading chapters like this from a novel so it probably will only take me a few days to fully recover at most. But that's probably going to cost me *time from my schedule* which I was hoping to spend on other things.

This would have been a good place for content warnings, because I think a LOT of people are going to be affected similarly. Something like "these two chapters are interesting and gripping but also may be mildly traumatic even for people who wouldn't normally be triggered by such content in any other stories. You should consider blocking out a day or so from your schedule to recover emotionally, even if it doesn't take you anywhere near that long to read and even if you don't expect to be triggered even after seeing this warning."
