Here's a question that completely goes against the spirit of Fel Seed and the meta-narrative, would max-power-Gold+Soul-boosted Juniper have been able to skip the gore and retreat from the fight if not manage a pseudo-win? I know it would be very hard to write someone with that many options (imagine how ridiculous the Onions fight would be if he had magic and more than 3 entads).

If he could uber-charge Gold, Velocity, Stilling, Bones... is there a real chance he would've been able to blitz around the Palace, killing clone after clone before retreating out of the EZ? Or are Fel Seed's unspecified ultra-powerful defences capable of forcing him to die no matter what? To me it's kinda dumb that he used his trump cards so aggressively on lesser foes - though I fully understand the logic in getting rid of them for ease-of-writing and DM balance.
