So the quest text for Fel Seed didn't say "You can defeat him", it just said "You know his weakness." As such, my new conclusion is that Fel Seed's weakness is: he can't hurt you if you're in Hell. Plus, 4/9ths of the Hells aren't even that bad, in comparison. To paraphrase War Games, "the only winning move is to subject yourself to a different eternal torture."
