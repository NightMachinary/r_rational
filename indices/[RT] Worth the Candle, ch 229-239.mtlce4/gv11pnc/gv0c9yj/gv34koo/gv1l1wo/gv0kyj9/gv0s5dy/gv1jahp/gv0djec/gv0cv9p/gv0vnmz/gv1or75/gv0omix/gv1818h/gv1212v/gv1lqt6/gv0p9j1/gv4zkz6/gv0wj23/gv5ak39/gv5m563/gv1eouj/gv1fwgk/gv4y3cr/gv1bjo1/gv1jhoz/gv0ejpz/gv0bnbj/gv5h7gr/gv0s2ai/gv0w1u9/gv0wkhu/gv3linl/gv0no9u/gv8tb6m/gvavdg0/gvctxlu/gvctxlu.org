With Bethel so powered up, I expected them to finish as many secondary quests as possible (including reinforcing the Gates against the other side).

Some swift murdering-and-fixing spree, a minor scale repetition of what was done in Necrolaborem, THEN going for Fel Seed.

As others have posted, time dilation plus Valencia plus whatever entad/loyalty bonuses can do to aid her, also makes seem possible to clear the hells before Fel Seed.

I would have done it, as a backup plan, if I am so sure Fel Seed will kill me, then fixing the hells before going seems really useful, considering that the team might end up there.
