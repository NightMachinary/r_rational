Make Fel Seed fight himself. Since he's a representation of Juniper's depression, it might be possible for Valencia to talk him into it. Alternatively, since he has so many avatars, you could try to get him hooked on torturing himself--experiencing masochism might be a new thing for him considering how Joon mentioned the latter's boredom.
