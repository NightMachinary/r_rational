What's the range of a unicorn bone? If you're holding a unicorn bone while having a phone conversation with someone in another country, can you help them brute-force a problem?

If so, you may have a beginning of a plan.

Assuming Fel Seed genuinely can't bullshit himself out of Unicorn loops the way the Cannibal did (and so far it doesn't look lile he can), you can use bones to brute-force approaches.

Use a communication entad to communicate with someone from the Doris Finch EZ, who uses and unlimited supply of unicorn to try different approaches.

Minor downside: you have now introduced a unicorn bone in the DFEZ. The spacetime continuum is doomed.
