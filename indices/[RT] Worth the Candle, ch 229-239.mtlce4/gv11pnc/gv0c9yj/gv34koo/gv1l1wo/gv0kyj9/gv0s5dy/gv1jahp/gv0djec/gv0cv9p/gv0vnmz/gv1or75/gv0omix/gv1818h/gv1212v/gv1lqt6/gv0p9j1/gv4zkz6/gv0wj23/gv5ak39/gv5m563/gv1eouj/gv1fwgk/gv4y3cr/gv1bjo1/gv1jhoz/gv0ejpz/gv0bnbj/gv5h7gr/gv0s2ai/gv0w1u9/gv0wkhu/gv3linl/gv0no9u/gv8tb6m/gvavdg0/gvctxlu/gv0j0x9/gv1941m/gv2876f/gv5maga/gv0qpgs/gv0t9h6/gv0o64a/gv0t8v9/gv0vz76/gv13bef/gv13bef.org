  Therefore, it's reasonable that with sufficient power, you could reach a stalemate since Fel Seed can't leave his exclusion zone.

Not unless you're the DM

You're still thinking of Fel Seed as a monster that runs off the same rules that every other monster does, and he just... doesn't work that way. He's explicitly DM fiat, he's "rocks fall, everybody dies" personified. If you get the upper hand, he pulls out a new trick. If you think you're stronger than him, then it's revealed he was holding back to toy with you. If you think you killed him, then it turns out that was only a puppet and the real Fel Seed is somewhere else entirely. He cheats constantly and shamelessly, that's what he /is/.

Keep in mind, we have more than just Juniper's attempt to go off of here. Remember this bit, from chapter 130?

  When the losses began to grow, when too many warders were dying trying to remove the wards throughout Thousand Brides, the Fifth Empire called in their ultimate weapon of last resort. They tore a hole through space and time, destroying Thousand Brides utterly and killing thousands of their own. Someone, somehow, convinced Aarde to get off his butt and confirm that there was no living thing left in the entire zone. I don't know who got the god to owe them a favor, but that was what they spent it on.”

  I frowned. “Okay ... so what happened? You already said it was a failure.”

  “Fel Seed came back,” replied Pinno with a humorless laugh. His eel-beard wriggled. “They had reason to think that Fel Seed would be completely dead if he couldn't regenerate his avatar, or move himself into a new one, because the explicit magic that's excluded doesn't appear to come with any governing intelligence to it. Fel Seed the entity is just ... well, someone or something using that magic for effective immortality and to take sadistic pleasure from the world. Even if another person came into the zone later on, once the magic was back, and began to practice it, they might turn into a monster, but they wouldn't be Fel Seed. Only when he returned, that's who he was, the same entity he'd always been, ready to retake the battle zone and rebuild his City.”

Fel Seed is pure DM fiat, you can't beat that no matter how bullshit your stats are.
