There are three narrative/meta concerns: First as you said, Fel Seed will likely be arbitrarily scaled up to keep it arbitrarily unbeatable. We kind of already saw this: they brought Bethel moving at hypersonic speed with time-dilated reasoning and planning, Fel Seed got the capability of exploding rock with matching accuracy and speed along with near unlimited void weaponry. If a Culture Mind came at Fel Seed, it would probably reveal biologically based anti-effector field fields at a critical moment.

Second, anything good enough to beat Fel Seed entirely risks exclusion. The rune magic anti-matter trick would probably get excluded after one usage and might break the rune spikes required to bottle souls in the process. Anything recursively self-improving (like the sort of stuff you would go for in an intelligence explosion) is clearly going to be prime targets for exclusion. Maybe if you pre-committed hard enough the DM would let a few exploits fly just long enough to use them in one or two fights before excluding them, but the DM probably wouldn't let you spend years stockpiling tricks and inventing stuff.

Third, stalling in a boring way will likely see new threats and challenges thrown at them, for instance see the timing of them finding out about the Cannibal. They stall and avoid the Fel Seed Fight too long, and the DM probably retaliates by adding some drama and/or time pressure.

Overall, the DM has done just enough to keep them barely alive and the fights interesting, so Mary and Joon were hoping (literally praying in Mary's case), that moving the plot forward would lead to something worthwhile. As Raven points out, this is practically magical/religious thinking, but when a literal god is manipulating things, this form of reasoning that is normally a logical fallacy might be your best bet.
