Right, but she died to a poison (?) that corrupted her soul data.

You wouldn't expect dying - and being sent to the afterlife - to fix your brain damage unless that afterlife also had some method of retrieving your pre-damage mindstate. Afterlife mythologies and systems, when they think about it at all, usually ascribe that function to the immortal soul (i.e. your memories and core personality are somehow backed up or expressed within a soul object, and that soul is later resleeved in the afterlife, like an ontologically basic cortical stack).

But the soul object is exactly what was damaged in Fenn's case, so sending her soul to hell would only be sending a blank slate, as far as I understand things.
