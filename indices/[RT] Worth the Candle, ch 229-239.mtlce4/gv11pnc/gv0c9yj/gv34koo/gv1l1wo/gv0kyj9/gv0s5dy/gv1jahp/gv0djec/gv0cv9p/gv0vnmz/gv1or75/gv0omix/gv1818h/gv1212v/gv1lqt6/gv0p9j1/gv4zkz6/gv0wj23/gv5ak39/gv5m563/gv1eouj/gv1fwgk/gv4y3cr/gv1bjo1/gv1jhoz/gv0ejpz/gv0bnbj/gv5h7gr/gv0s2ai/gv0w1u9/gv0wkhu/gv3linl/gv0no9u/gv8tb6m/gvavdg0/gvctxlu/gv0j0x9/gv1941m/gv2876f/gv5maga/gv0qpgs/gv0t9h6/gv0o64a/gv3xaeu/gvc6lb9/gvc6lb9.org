Wow, this was a long time coming, and yet, im still surprised we got here. Jun spent so long hyping up this encounter that it started to feel like a mythological encounter rather than a part of the world. Glad he got splatted by his own bs though. Finally got his comeuppance. And oh boy now for the DLC postgame content! Woohoo!
