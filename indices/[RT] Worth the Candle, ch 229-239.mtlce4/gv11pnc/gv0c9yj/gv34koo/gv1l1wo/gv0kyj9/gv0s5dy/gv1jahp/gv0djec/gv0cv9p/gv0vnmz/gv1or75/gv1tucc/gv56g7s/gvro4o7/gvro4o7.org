Given that Fel Seed represents Joon's depression and that there's been mention that the a Vorpal Blade is a possible weakness except that it belongs to Fel Seed, a possible solution would be to convince Fel Seed to commit suicide. Valencia noticeable did nothing in the fight since she's not useful at this level of combat nor is she useful for unlocking the door, hence its possible that she's actually the key to the fight in a Chekov's Gun sort of way. She can talk him into suicide, but only if Joon talks to her about his own depression which should mirror Fel Seed's.

As for the Vorpal Blade, it has two functions: one is whatever it does to whoever it hits, and one is the /vitality drained from its user/. The latter function allows its user to choose a degree of drainage as seen in the campaign in the real world, so Fel Seed can end himself if he chooses to spend all of his vitality. Even if they don't go for the suicide angle, it might also be possible to provoke Fel Seed to drain himself completely provided they give him a target that needs such power for him to kill plus the rage to make him do it.
