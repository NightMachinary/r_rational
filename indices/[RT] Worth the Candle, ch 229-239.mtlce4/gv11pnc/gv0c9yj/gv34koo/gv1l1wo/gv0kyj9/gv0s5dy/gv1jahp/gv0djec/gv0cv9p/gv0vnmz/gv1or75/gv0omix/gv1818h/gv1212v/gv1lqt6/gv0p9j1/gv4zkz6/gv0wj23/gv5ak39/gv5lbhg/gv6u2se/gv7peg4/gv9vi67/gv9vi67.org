This would work, if all things were equal, heck I like it, BUT we saw were Fell Seed comes from, he's not a clever DM ploy you have to figure out, he's the product of anger and despair attempting to spread it's own despair, with the thin veil of "They'd have to come up with something more". I'm reminded of Yahweh's challenge to Job. Fell seed is: "you lose unless you can make me not upset", or t continue the old testament theme "tell me my dreams and explain them".
