  I don't think her soul data is corrupted, I think the soul poison just attacked her body through her soul.

That's the same thing, though. Changing someone's body through their soul and changing their soul are the exact same operation, because the soul is the data structure which backs up of all of a person's attributes, and the world's physics engine moves to bring soul data and physical implementation into alignment over time.

Remember how the elf who taught Joon soul magic was able to make someone else into a physical simulacra of himself? And turn his servants into monsters?

That's also, for a more specialized example, why people without souls are ineligible to benefit from certain forms of magic.

  And regardless, I don't think soul damage hurts the anima exa that much, or people would corrupt souls instead of glassing them.

It was a rare/special poison, IIRC, but if the people of Aerb didn't have SOME moral objections to sending blank-slate souls to hell, then they wouldn't need to minimize and cover up accidents in the soul gestation and bottling plants that they use for power generation.
