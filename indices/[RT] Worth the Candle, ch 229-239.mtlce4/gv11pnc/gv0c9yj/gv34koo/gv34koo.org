Hyped for a Hell Arc, thank the DM it's not being skipped straight to the endgame!

Though regarding other Arcs that might be skipped... I'm still pretty convinced that the *only legitimate avenue to tackle Fel Seed* that's been thoroughly introduced but not explored yet, is *p-space / The Outer Reaches.*

I genuinely believe that Goldbug's insistence to threaten /a God/ with p-space, plus the Layman's recent appearance implying the DM has a pantheon, and everything else we know about the Plane of Concepts (not to mention Joon's likely affinity to such a place) are all implying that it's the best way to defeat a *"conceptually unbeatable villain."*

Because that's what Fel Seed really is, a concept. Not a consistent, physical or biological entity - He's just written to always win so he does. Don't bother fighting him, just go delete / alter the file directly.
