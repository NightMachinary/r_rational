Thread title is wrong, it's 229-230. My bad, but there's no way to change titles on reddit, so.

Note: the next six chapters are written and being edited, and should be out at a saner pace than usual for this serial (and will also likely be split up a bit for pacing reasons).

If you'd like to add something to the "Post Game Statistics" section, you can add it here and it will likely go in, with the caveat that I reserve the right to refuse anything I find sufficiently unfunny or against what I'm going for, and you would need to do any calculations to find the relevant number, because the math is the main thing that stopped me from making that section three times as long. Also note that it should include things that happened off-screen. If possible, show your work.

(Things I didn't do, because they seemed like they would take too much time to calculate: blood lost (in drops), urine produced, bones burnt, mana used, HP lost, entads used, time spent sleeping, etc.)

As always, much thanks to everyone who supports me on [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon]].
