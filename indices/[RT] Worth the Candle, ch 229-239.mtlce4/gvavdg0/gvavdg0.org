The weirdest part was that Fel Seed just killed everyone cleanly. I thought his premise was that he wants to torture everyone and maximize suffering, but when he has them at his mercy he just kills them.

It makes sense out of character: “Juniper is trapped and tortured for years” would make for bad reading. In character, it seems odd.
