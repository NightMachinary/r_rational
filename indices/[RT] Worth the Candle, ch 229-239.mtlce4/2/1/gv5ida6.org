The other main alternative on top of delete / alter (I'd believe a fudge like "conceptual unbeatability extends to immunity to conceptual alteration"; would be VERY interesting if the DM couldn't even do anything about it, but I doubt that) would be to find his counterpart, a conceptually unbeatable hero, and pit them against each other. Functionally an opposite act to the one that created Fel Seed in the first place.
