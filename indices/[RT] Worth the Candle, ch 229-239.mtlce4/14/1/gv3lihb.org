It seems likely to me that what happened in the Fel Seed encounter was the DM's desired outcome - e.g. the DM was railroading a bit. I'm operating on the assumption that the DM isn't some Fel Seed-like sadistic fuck, and has certain encounters and plot points in mind for Joon for some "positive" purpose. He gave them the meta hint that they should go forward with their Fel Seed plans with the Earth uniform, he can know what kind of plan Amaryllis and co. will formulate, and he could tweak how Fel Seed fights to get his desired outcome. The outcome of them getting to examine the gate and learn they need a password while being able to withdraw, without causalities, except for Joon, who goes to the Hells, which is the one big outstanding Plot Point not in the party's path, seems so unlikely to me that I suspect the deck was at least stacked a little in that outcome's favor, and perhaps a lot more than a little.
