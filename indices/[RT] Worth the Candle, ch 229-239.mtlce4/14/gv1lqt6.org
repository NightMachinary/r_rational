It seems like the conversation tree with Fel Seed was a bit under-explored... but given the 10 second limitation of Unicorn bones and the way that Fel Seed only cared about talking as a means to gloat and revel in his supremacy it didn't seem implausible that they didn't manage more of a conversation. I am a bit surprised that Fel Seed lacked a counter to Unicorn bone... perhaps he did and was hiding it, or the DM avoided giving Fel Seed a counter to let Juniper see how out-matched he was by replaying the battle over and over.

If the Key required was in fact the Key for Seven locks quest... well that just shows how arbitrary and gross the DM is. And the password was some BS as well...

I think Raven's comment about religious thinking hit the nail on the head, Juniper and Amaryllis went in with a detailed map of contingencies but ultimately hoping the DM either had some grand payoff or at the very absolute minimum subverted the original construction of Fel Seed as Rocks Fall Everyone dies BS, when in fact the DM had no master plan and let Fel Seed be exactly as BS as he was originally.
