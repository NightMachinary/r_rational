*Fel Seed: laughs* There are different kinds of infinity.

*Grak:* What? That's preposterous!

*Fenn:* Bullsh**!

*Amaryllis:* No, he's right. Under /some/ mathematical systems, there is more than one kind of infinity. *eyes narrow*

*Solace and the Locus: look at each other sadly, then shake their heads*

*Fel Seed: grins mysteriously*

*Bethel:* Great! So if we know what system he's operating under, we'll know what kind of infinity he's using. Then we can /finally/ crush him!

*Juniper: sighs*

*Valencia: pointedly* How many possible systems are there with more than one kind of infinity? And how many kinds of infinity are there across all such systems? More importantly, this assumes that we fight Fel Seed for infinite time, meaning forever. Even if there are different kinds of forever, I still don't want to fight forever. My mind would break down long before that. Wouldn't yours?

*Raven:* Let's just let him kill us again already.

*Fel Seed: grins triumphantly*

*Juniper: sighs*
