This is really clever and kind of plausible. And even raises the hilarious possibility that Joon in fact just defeated Fel Seed by getting killed by him, somehow (e.g. Joon is the only person on Aerb who has hit points, and therefore the only one who exacts a cost, and Fel Seed doesn't know the true nature of the vorpal sword and "puts everything" into every swing so he was always going to die as soon as he used it on someone with a character sheet).
