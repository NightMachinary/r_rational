Ideas to beat Fel Seed (none of which will work because he cheats):

- Seems like the only possible weakness he's shown is not being able to see through the unicorn bone loops

  - “You're doing something with time” x3
  - He was also happy to exchange a few sentences, so over time they could milk him for information
  - We need bigger unicorn bones. Grow a giant unicorn under time dilation.
  - Parallelise Amaryllis clones thinking by having her sit in Bethel under dilation and sync with clones to give them info or use entads to send them information. Then send out clones to report + die.
  - None of this actually helps unless being able to think carefully a lot helps

- The acid actually worked, *more acid*
- Why did they approach at ground level instead of flying straight down like they did with the portal guy?
- Manipulate Joon into a forge frenzy to make a counter-entad
- Breed more Loci
- Level up more

  - Bone magic for better use of unicorn bones
  - Every other combat ability he just eventually cheats
  - Increase companion loyalty maybe?

- Summon Shia Le Bouf

  - The other monster who cheats

- Is Fel Seed confirmed an enpersoned exclusion, or a person using a form of magic that is excluded? If later, Joon could learn it maybe.
- Use Spirit to mess with him. If hard to make contact, use Bethel to kidnap an avatar and restrain it, then use Spirit under time dilation.
- Find the soul magic exclusion and use it to respec

  - Spec druid to fight bullshit with bullshit
  - Maybe spec full social and go in with Valencia to Debate, Flatter or Romance Fel Seed into being a nice guy.

- Use whatever weapon is on Celestar against the zone
