Ah, true! I do wonder if exclusions need to actively threaten to destabilize the setting, or if they just need to have the potential to do so -- IIRC Doris Finch wasn't excluded until she'd really gotten to multiplying, skin / soul magic until they'd had a chance to taste the game-breaking exploits each provided, etc. Holding all your phenomenal cosmic powers in reserve to be unleashed at just the right moment feels a bit like pulling a fast one on the DM... but conversely, a DM that sees you prepping something really sweet and house-rule's it away 90% of the way into your prep time, before it can ever be unleashed, would be a massive wet blanket lol.

It does seem like relying on narrative too much leads you to a sort of calvinistic determinism where all outcomes are pre-ordained... and I feel the party erred to much in that direction, here, because they kept expecting to find that One Weird Trick that every DM includes in a seemingly-but-not-actually-insurmountable boss that would prove Fel Seed's unraveling. As it played out, though, it does seem like they stumbled into the exclusion zone massively underprepared. Similar to deciding what to do in dreams, I think the expected pay-off matrix would favor almost always erring on the side of "act as if there's no narrative force driving events", since if there is a narrative force, you're boned or victorious whether your prepare or not. I guess a third option could have also been to try switching the genre -- orchestrate a series of underwhelming lesser villains whose payoff lies in the genuine comedy of their defeat -- and then Fel Seed might also fall by the power of slapstick and wordplay. But that seems much less unreliable than good ol' fashioned preptime.

I'm skeptical of an "arbitrarily-scaling" Fel Seed, though, since it would make history and power-levels wildly inconsistent. If Fel Seed had the potential to reach Culture-Mind levels of offense or defense, he'd have already subsumed the earth in femtoseconds back when, pre-exclusion. Narrativium seems very NLF-y, as [[/r/whowouldwin]] might say.
