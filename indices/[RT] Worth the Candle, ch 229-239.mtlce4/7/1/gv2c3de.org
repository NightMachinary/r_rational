  Fel Seed seems pretty unbeatable, whatever his weakness is it's going to be weird, probably not combat orientated

My guess is none. He's genuinely unbeatable. So the thematic question is how you deal with something you can't defeat. So either its an acceptance thing, and you have to accept you can't defeat the final boss and quest and live a life regardless, or you call time out and talk to the DM saying it's unfair
