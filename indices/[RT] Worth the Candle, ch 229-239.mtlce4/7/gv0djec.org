Great chapters!

Random thoughts: * Uther = Fel Seed theory seems very unlikely * Fel Seed seems pretty unbeatable, whatever his weakness is it's going to be weird, probably not combat orientated * We don't see much of what Val is doing in the final chapter - presumably she just isn't that much use? * Gold magic wouldn't have helped, so not a great loss * The game over screen was pretty final, maybe implies the game system will stop working in the hells

Hell Arc: * What powers do you keep in the hells? I assume none. They have their own magics though. * Valencia can probably locate him after a while. Communication from Aerb isn't really possible, apart from by killing infernals * Uther never went to hell and back, but the infernals somehow managed to come up en masse with the Apocalypse Demon. Also via possession of non-anima. So there are a couple of ways out maybe. * The others could follow him down as there's a way to send people to a specific hell (says Captain Blue). So all companions (or just Fenn!) go to hell to help him out and Valencia watches over them from the outside. * Val can eat mortal souls as well as infernals. Confirmed whether she can eat the soul of a mortal in the hells? If so, her eating Joon could kinda bring him back up.
