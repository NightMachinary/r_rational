  Raven swallowed. “Fel Seed,” she began, then stopped. “We don't know how Fel Seed happened,” she said, measuring her words. “There wasn't a source, like the others, some magic gone awry or some entad that came out too powerful. He appeared in 34 FE, but ... we're not sure that there wasn't some kind of incubation period, that he hadn't gained his power, or that he was in hiding, and ... there were rumors.”

  “Rumors that Fel Seed was Uther,” said Amaryllis.

  "We'll have to figure out why Uther actually went there though.”

  “He's Fel Seed, obviously,” said Bethel.

  “No,” I said. “At least, I don't think so. Not just because he's Arthur, but ... /I/ made up Fel Seed. Maybe it would be best for us if he was Uther, because then I'd at least be able to make a personal appeal, instead of ... however we're supposed to beat him, if it's possible.”
