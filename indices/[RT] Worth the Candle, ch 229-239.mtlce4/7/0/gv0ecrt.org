  What powers do you keep in the hells? I assume none.
#+end_quote

You keep all pseudo magical abilities (bladebound and elon gar), but per the WB doc "magic is almost completely non-functional". Either all magic is weakened substantially, or only some specific magics work at all.

  Uther never went to hell and back, but the infernals somehow managed to come up en masse with the Apocalypse Demon. Also via possession of non-anima. So there are a couple of ways out maybe.
#+end_quote

Infernals can travel between hells and go to Aerb. Mortals can travel deeper into the hells by dying, but that's the only way we know they can move.

  The others could follow him down as there's a way to send people to a specific hell (says Captain Blue). So all companions (or just Fenn!) go to hell to help him out and Valencia watches over them from the outside.
#+end_quote

Val, Bethel, the Locus, and Pallida are completely unable to travel to the hells. Well, the Locus can maybe do it because she breaks all the rules, but don't count on it.

#+begin_quote
  Val can eat mortal souls as well as infernals. Confirmed whether she can eat the soul of a mortal in the hells? If so, her eating Joon could kinda bring him back up.
#+end_quote

She can't, explicitly.
