*Hot dogs conjured: 4*

One is wished for in chapter 114, plus "I'd used three of the hundred hot dog wishes already for testing, the first to make sure that they actually did something, and the second and third to make sure that there weren't combat applications." Any other hot dog wishes were off-screen and unmentioned.
