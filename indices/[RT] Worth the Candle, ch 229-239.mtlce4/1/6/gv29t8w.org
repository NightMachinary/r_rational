Total Deaths: 20

Ok, 20 is actually innacurate. There were 8, plus "about a dozen times in rapid succession" from c.183, so its up for you to decide if Juniper guess the count correctly or not. Anyway, from Juniper's perspective, this stat is only increased through the incredibly specific ability of unicorn bones, but given the save feature and non-perma-death settings exist, it makes sense to include it. There was also one moment were he might have died, but it didn't explicitly state so (brain damage from mome bats made him auto-reset), but I didn't count that.

Total Companion Deaths: 14 (Fenn 1, Raven 4, Valencia 5, Mary 3, Grak 1)

Same idea as above. Interestingly, most of these happened in the Fel Seed fight, yet they all seemingly survived in the end - while Juniper didn't die at all during the loops, but did afterwards. This does not include Solace (1) and Pallida (3), who weren't companions, but kinda were.

Total Skills Unlocked: 36

I could be wrong on this one because I only did a quick scan and may have missed one that happened off-screen and didn't show bolded text for it, which is what happened for Velocity Magic, but I don't think there were any others.
