Another stat idea is "Unicorn Bones Burnt" or "Quicksaves Made", which I think should be +12+ 14:

ch 133:

#+begin_quote
  As predicted, it was the ability granted to me by level 30 Bone Magic, but I had only a single test run with it, back before my conversion, out of a desire not to run through what was a terribly limited supply.
#+end_quote

Plus one more use of the bone in this chapter. 2 uses total

ch 156:

#+begin_quote
  That was when I began burning one of my three internal unicorn bones.
#+end_quote

3 uses total

#+begin_quote
  There was a second rat, because of course there was, and as soon as I got to my feet, stumbling among the broken and bloody finger-hair, I began burning one of my precious unicorn bones.
#+end_quote

4 uses

#+begin_quote
  I began burning my last unicorn bone at once, dividing my focus again.
#+end_quote

5 uses

ch 183:

#+begin_quote
  I started burning one of the three unicorn bones at the same time I pushed vibration magic hard enough to give me warder's sight.
#+end_quote

6 uses

#+begin_quote
  the unicorn bone was being drained way too fast by the repeated deaths. I started burning the second when I felt the first's power start to slip
#+end_quote

7 uses

ch 193:

#+begin_quote
  He tossed the leg he'd been holding to the side and lunged at me, moving ungodly fast, and as soon as he had grabbed onto my wrist, I tapped the ring on my hand three times, then began burning a unicorn bone.
#+end_quote

8 uses

#+begin_quote
  I waited until I thought I was close enough, then started burning a unicorn bone, touching it in the bandolier with my maimed hand. I had no idea whether it would actually provide any benefit, but fuck if I didn't have to try.
#+end_quote

9 uses

ch 212:

#+begin_quote
  I popped a unicorn bone from Sable and began burning it, worried that I was one wrong move from getting a roasting that I wouldn't be able to come back from.
#+end_quote

10 uses

ch 221:

#+begin_quote
  I didn't know how one was supposed to go about killing Rove, but the way I did it was to crash right into the enormous mound of junk as fast as I could go without killing myself, while burning a unicorn bone.
#+end_quote

11 uses

#+begin_quote
  I started burning a second one exactly as soon as the first was done, wanting to have extra chances to escape, or to react to whatever shenanigans he had waiting for me.
#+end_quote

12 uses

Plus 2 from this most recent batch:

#+begin_quote
  He attacked again, slow and languid by the standards of the speed he'd used earlier, and I had just enough time to pull out a unicorn bone and start burning it.
#+end_quote

13

#+begin_quote
  I reset the loop for a final time, dropping the bone as soon as I did, then pulling another one from the same extradimensional space. This loop was later, after the vorpal sword had broken Grak's major wards, but I was hoping that we weren't past the point of no return
#+end_quote

14 uses total.

Also, in chapter 50, he technically burns 2, but doesn't use their time powers, so I don't think they should count towards the stat:

#+begin_quote
  I threw the void rifle, which had been sliced through, to the ground and touched a unicorn bone just as muted pain began to reach me, and pulled on END as hard as I possibly could, then moved on to the next bone before the feeling of health and wellness could even begin to fade.
#+end_quote
