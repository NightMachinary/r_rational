I don't know if you saw in the #earlybirds channel, but I came up with a couple of ideas for post-game statistics: loyalty increases and entads acquired.

Just looking for the last loyalty increased notifications from each character, I see:

- Mary: 27 (started at -1)

- Fenn: 26

- Grak: 20 (started at -2)

- Doe: 23

- Val: 28

- Bethel: 18

- Raven: 5

So with that count, loyalty has been increased by 150 levels.

For entads acquired, I imagine you could just have something like "Entads acquired: [some absurdly high number indicating Bethel stealing a bunch of entads, plus Mary's huge inheritance]"
