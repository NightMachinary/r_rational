Nah, that's a fundamental misunderstanding of what Fel Seed is and how he works. You can't be stronger or faster than Fel Seed, because he's arbitrarily stronger than you. If Juniper had come in there with gold magic, Fel Seed would just be faster and stronger to compensate.

If Fel Seed's stats were written up in a D&D supplement, he wouldn't have an Armor Class of 999, because there might theoretically be a way to munchkin hard enough to beat that number. His AC would just be "the highest roll the players could possibly make + 1"
