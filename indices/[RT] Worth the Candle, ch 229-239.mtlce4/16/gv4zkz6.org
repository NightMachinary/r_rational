I loved the chapter. That said...

Fel Seed was mildly underwhelming compared to the sheer /presence/ of actual cannibal Shia LeBouf.

We've seen you write good horror, so I think this was on purpose, but I still want to outline the difference in perceived value for your readers between these two confrontations.

Fel Seed's first mention*s* are all name drops. No detail. And when we did get detail, it was dry. Necessarily dry, sure, but dry.

Actual cannibal Shia LeBouf's first mention is panic and an infodump; followed by a gradual trickle of information as His existence continues on as a relevant threat in almost all of the party's confrontations against sentients.

Then there's the issue of foreshadowing.

Fel Seed's probably going to win, barring deus ex machina literal or not, which is a possibility. That Joon died here was the only mildly unexpected outcome.

But Fel Seed was never presented as or presented as having a purpose as anything other than a road block.

Whereas actual cannibal Shia LeBouf *incoherent screaming noises*
