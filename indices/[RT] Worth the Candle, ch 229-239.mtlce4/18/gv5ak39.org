FS Brainstorm.

It's the dumbest thing, but 'You know his weakness' -> may relate to Juniper knowing that FS has the Vorpal Sword, and is its master, and how that thing relates to your character sheet.

Using the Sword takes the merest fraction away from you, across all timelines and basically everything. FS's connection to it is unbreakable.

Fel Seed's sadism and cruelty may be truly limitless, given a challenge, he may be literally unable to relent, even unto his own destruction. The rape monster cannot ever not rape, kind of thing.

Thus, terrifyingly, Operation Zap Brannigan (they had a preset kill limit, and I sent wave after wave of my own...) may be the solution.

A. Juniper discovers a way to return from Hell.\\
B. Working with Val/Bethel, Juniper makes that way routine.\\
C. Challenge FS over and over, falling to the Vorpal Sword again and again. (As perfect evil, FS cannot/will not ever not use his signature weapon.)\\
D. Ultimately the Vorpal Sword consumes FS life force, across all possible timelines and realities.

Unicorn bones or the equivalent may be able to make part C/D easier. 'FS spends a trillionth of his life force on the blade, not realizing that he is doing so in a trillion timelines' , kind of thing.

Main point of this plan is that FS would be beaten by his own cheaty bullshit, rather than any other entity bound by the game system. The Vorpal Blade, I'm theorizing, is 'on his level', as far as being malarkey goes.
