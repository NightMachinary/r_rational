I could be wrong, but Fel Seed isn't always winning because he's evil. The rules he's breaking to win have nothing (that we know of) to do with the societal rules he's breaking by being evil. The Fifth Empire basically nuked him off the face of the planet; that's about as no-holds-barred, win-at-any-costs as you can possibly get. And yet that still didn't beat him, because he's stupid OP.

That said, there could still be something to him representing the ultimate triumph of evil over good. And, if that's the case, Joon is exactly where he needs to be to prove that principle wrong, which may be all that he needs to defeat him.
