Also, the thing with Uther is that he always wins /by trying as hard as he can/.

If Fel Seed represents the unbeatable horror villain, Uther represents the unbeatable hero: he always wins because whatever he tries is always just enough; he can't just turn off laws of reality when convenient, but he always finds himself in situations where he has just the trick he needs, Batman-style.

So if Fel seed is genuinely immortal, I'm not sure Uther could beat him.
