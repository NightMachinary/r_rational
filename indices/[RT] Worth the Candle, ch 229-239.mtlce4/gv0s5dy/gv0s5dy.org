Well I can't say I'm surprised with how that went. We had every indication that trying to handle Fell Seed like a traditional adventure, using purely "in-game" logic and resources, was doomed to brutal failure. I'm still not sure what the "solution" is, but it's pretty clear that it doesn't involve fighting him. As for that last bit...

The "Helldiver" setting in Juniper's options menu was always something of a Chekov's gun, but it's the specifics of it that I really want to see. If Juniper doesn't keep his buffs, or worse, if his still living companions (especially Valencia) don't keep /their/ buffs now that he's dead, this could be rough. Probably not as rough as Fell Seed, but still a bad time.

I'm glad we'll be getting new chapters soon, because I REALLY want to see what happens next.
