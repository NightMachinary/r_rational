A commenter over on AO3 listed the tooltips in a comment to Chapter 8. I'll copy-and-paste the text here too:

  ◼ Ironman Mode

  Character death is permanent, actions cannot be undone. Once play starts, Ironman cannot be disabled.

  ◼ Hardcore Ironman Mode

  If you die in the game, you will never be able to play the game again. Once play starts, Hardcore Ironman cannot be disabled.

  ◻ Helldiver

  When you die, you will be cast down to one of the nine thousand hells of Aerb to be eternally tormented. Supercedes the death restrictions of Ironman modes.

  ◻ Dead-man's Switch

  If you would suffer a fate worse than death, you die instead.
