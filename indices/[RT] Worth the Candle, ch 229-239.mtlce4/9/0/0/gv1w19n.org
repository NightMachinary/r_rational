I agree, it probably is! I just found it noteworthy that other things are mentioned but disabled, like Fast Travel and the Mini-map, but saves weren't explicitly mentioned at all before now. Maybe somewhere there's a menu screen with a grayed-out "Save Game" button, plus some other stuff. Or maybe that part of the interface is inaccessible because there would be no point to it, and there's nothing interesting to be gained from this line of speculation.
