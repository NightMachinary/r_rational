Why no plan involved the Cannibal? As per the text:

/“Barriers won't work,” said Amaryllis as she put on the immobility plate. She was speaking fast, almost breathless. “Wards won't work. Obstructions won't work, raw killing power won't work, magic will be shrugged off or only partially successful, no known entad can stop him, and he scales to any threats./

It escalates as Fel Seed does, and kills everything around. There is more of Fel Seed around than party members. And if he goes in a rampage in the Fel Seed zone, it will be a release for the victims (if actually any are alive) and a threat to Fel Seed for a long time, plus they know how to contain/deal with the Cannibal.

Of course if Fel Seed cheats, then "I am actually invisible to the Cannibal, mwahahaha" is a valid technique.
