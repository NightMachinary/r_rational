Note that I did not say "destroy Fel Seed", I said pseudo-win by which I meant survive the encounter. If you survive, you can come back again or get stronger or at least not be tortured for eternity in the hells, which is surely something weighing on people's minds in this universe. Stalemate is just not losing everything.

My interpretation of optimising for living another day fits with what Joon wanted. He didn't want to fight, not really. He wanted to get to the stairs and find Arthur. He was explicitly trying to avoid Fel Seed and divert around him.
