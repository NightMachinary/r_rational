OK but surely if they had gone straight in at Level 1, everyone would've died or be gruesomely tortured for the rest of their prolonged lives. Not everyone died on the retreat, just Joon, so far as I can see. There are some methods that can stall or bypass Fel Seed as we can see from the unicorn bones and the druid-deity shenanigans. Therefore, it's reasonable that with sufficient power, you could reach a stalemate since Fel Seed can't leave his exclusion zone.
