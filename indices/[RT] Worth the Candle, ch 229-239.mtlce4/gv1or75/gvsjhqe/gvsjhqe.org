Devil's advocate: Fel Seed is the polar opposite of Joon. He's everything Joon isn't so he's having a "good" time, and has been for hundreds of years. He's an anti-depressive small world self actualizing god, only serving himself, and content to be "alone". He doesn't hate himself, get bored, or do really do things to shock others. He just does what he wants without much regard for it's impact on others, as seen by his actions towards the party even after being in contact for a long amount of time.

1. He's anti narrative: he doesn't enjoy making ever expanding or complex worlds. He enjoys his exclusion and turned it into boring desert. He makes terrible stories (torture, more torture, etc) and intensely railroads players in them for no payoff.

2. He's anti-system: there's no deeper tricks, hacks, or exploits to figure out. He just absolutely cheats and gets away with it. He doesn't investigate how it works or how others do theirs, he just wins.

3. He's anti-narrator: he doesn't try to be a outspoken villian, he's short on words and to the point. He actively stops Joon from speaking in the end by force.

4. He's anti-development: stuck in the exclusion for so long and no signs of evolution, not even doubling down like Blue. He's accepted that he's trapped, can't open the stairs, but is omnipotent besides that, nothing else to see here.

It kind of lines up thematically, but these could all be facades over the theme of him as Joon's mindset projecting strength/"normality" like Joon.
