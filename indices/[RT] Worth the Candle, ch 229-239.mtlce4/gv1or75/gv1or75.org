Okay, time for me to post my bullshit Fel Seed theory.

1. Juniper created pretty much all of Aerb. Everything in the world is representative of some aspect of Joon's personality.
2. Given #1, the most likely aspect of Joon's personality that Fel Seed can represent is Joon's own mindset (depression, cruelty, doing shocking things just for the sake of shock value) after Arthur died.
3. Joon is no longer in the same mindset that he was after creating Fel Seed, therefore, that mindset is not necessarily permanent.
4. Joon knows that Fel Seed is not in an enjoyable state, having experienced it, and he knows how to escape Fel Seed's mindset, because he did so himself. This is what is being referred to when the interface/DM says "you know his weakness."

So, the question becomes, how did Joon escape his cruelty and depression, and how can he apply that lesson to fixing Fel Seed?
