Maybe biological engineering can grant pseudomagical skill (blade bound techniques but for natural weapon, armor skill perks but for natural armor, dodge skill perks, etc.)? Of course the meta answer is the DM looked at all of Joon's abilities and plans and retroactively made Fel Seed strong enough to beat them but in terms of implementation biology with pseudo magical skill seems probable.
