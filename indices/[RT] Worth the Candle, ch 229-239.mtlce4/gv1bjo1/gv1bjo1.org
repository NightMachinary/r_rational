That was emotionally taxing to read. It's one thing to know that there's no way to beat Fel Seed, but since this is still fiction I did at least expect /something/ to work out.

I guess there's the Hell arc, but once that's resolved we're back where we started, needing to beat Fel Seed and not having a way to do it.
