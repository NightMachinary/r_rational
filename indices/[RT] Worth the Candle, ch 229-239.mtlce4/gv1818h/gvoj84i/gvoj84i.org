I assumed it was "you know his weakness [as TTRPG content]" - to wit, his design is weak because he's not just unbeatable but unfairly unbeatable. That is, he can't be beaten using the player-accessible / world-level mechanics of the game system.

Possibilities suggested in this thread for beating him /outside/ those mechanics: exclusion; appeal to the DM; using P-space.
