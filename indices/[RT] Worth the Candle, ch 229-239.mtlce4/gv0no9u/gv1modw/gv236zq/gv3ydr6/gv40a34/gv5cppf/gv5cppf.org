Did Uther ever actually enter and return from the hells? I'm pretty sure he didn't do so after dying, regardless.

Captain Blue could only make deals with the infernals because he was living on the prime material plane out of reach of the hells; if someone's dead, what are they going to offer the infernals that they couldn't just torture out of you?
