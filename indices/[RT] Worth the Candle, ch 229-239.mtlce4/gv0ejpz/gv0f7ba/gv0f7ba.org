  Is Fel Seed confirmed an enpersoned exclusion, or a person using a form of magic that is excluded? If later, Joon could learn it maybe.

The Library thinks he's the latter, since they said that if FS was killed, someone else might learn the magic. That said, Joon only gets the ability to learn skills on his character sheet, he doesn't have it on his current one, and he would need to find the soul magic EZ in order to change that (if an EZ exists at all)
