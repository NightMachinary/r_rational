  Why did they approach at ground level instead of flying straight down like they did with the portal guy?

This was my question. Why didn't they just fly a couple hundred miles up and then dive straight down? I'm sure Fel Seed has some defences miles up in the air, but he probably can't throw huge rocks at them there.

Narratively of course it wouldn't work, but surely that's something they would have tried instead of just giving up on the flying approach.
