Fell Seed is OP as fuck, holy crap. After this when Joon is in hell he will be like "eh, I've seen worse" ðŸ¤£

Here's how I would have approached Fell Seed:

- Find group clone magic, try a Fell Seed run w/ clones first. That way you might be able to find out about the door ahead of time.
- He takes his time when he's enjoying himself. Ask Valencia ahead of time to craft dialogue designed to get him to spend the most optimal amount of time monologuing. While he's doing that try breaking down the door. (probably won't work but he does enjoy playing with his prey so maybe?)
