I'm not certain that he does die in real life. Diamond Hardcore Iron Man Mode is supposed to do that, but the hovertext for Helldiver says:

#+begin_quote
  When you die, you will be cast down to one of the nine thousand hells of Aerb to be eternally tormented. Supercedes the death restrictions of Ironman modes.
#+end_quote

Helldiver supercedes the other death restrictions. I don't think they apply anymore. Which is fortunate, because otherwise Juniper's death would be permanent and the rest of the party couldn't resurrect him.
