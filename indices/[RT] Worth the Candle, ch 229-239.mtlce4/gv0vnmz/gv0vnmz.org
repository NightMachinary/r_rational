The "Fast Travel Used: 0" and "Save Games Loaded: 0" statistics caught my attention. I went back and found Fast Travel on the settings page from Chapter 8, but I can't recall saving or loading being mentioned anywhere (someone please let me know if it was). I wonder if there are more menu pages in the game layer that we haven't seen, and "Save Game" is on one of them? Saving is almost certainly disallowed, but maybe there's other interesting stuff there. Hard to imagine that Joon wouldn't have found it after all this time though.
