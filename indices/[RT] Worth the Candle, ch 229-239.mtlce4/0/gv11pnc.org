One of the things I love about /Worth the Candle/ is that it tends to avoid shortcuts and oversimplifications. If there's a way to generate disposable timelines and get information from their far future, the characters are going to use it, and we'll get detailed description of what transpired there. If there needs to be legal drama, we'll get an incredibly in-depth courtroom scene. An inhumanly proficient manipulator conducting therapy on a sentient house? The logistics of a necromancer's or a clone-maker's exclusion zone? D&D gameplay? The down-to-Earth reality of a depressed Kansas teenager? Any number of high-concept battle scenes? The story doesn't shy away from complexity, doesn't skip what needs to be described, and doesn't change what's happening to be easier to manage or present. It adapts to everything, and it does it right. (I didn't think Juniper fucking the deer could be presented in any way that wouldn't be farcical or weird, and yet /WtC/ managed that.)

So when the characters are venturing into the heart of the domain of the entity that has absolute control over biology and uses it to create things most depraved and monstrous...

I am a fan of horror stories of all kinds. I have read thousands of creepypastas. The in-universe journey through Fel Seed's exclusion zone was /exactly/ in line with my expectations, and I dare say I'm something of an expert on the subject. The gradual increase in horror, from corpses to tortures to monsters to torture-monsters to personalized torture-monsters. The token resistance from them, necessary to keep the characters /actively engaged/ with what's happening. The grimness of the journey, combined with a small hope of a success. Everything designed to maximize misery by presenting it in digestible, slowly escalating chunks, so that each new bit is appreciated. And, crucially,

  The front gate was open a crack, and I imagined that the whole thing had been built while we were on our way over, the gate, at least, if not the wall itself. The whole purpose of that front gate seemed to be the enormous doors, upon which were nailed effigies, one of each of us. They were all nude, as nearly everything had been so far, and there was writing below each of them. Bethel read it first, to examine it for suspected memetic content, and then I took a read of my own. It was name-calling, nothing more, and none of it was particularly true to each of us, nothing that cut straight to our hearts at our smallest insecurities.

For all that Fel Seed breaks the rules, the /domain/ of his rule-breaking is limited. It's a failure of many horror stories when the horror breaks constraints that keep it interesting, that preserve the suspension of disbelief. A haunted video game that inexplicably gets access to your personal details. A conceptual monster that suddenly affects physical reality. A slasher villain that won't die despite sustaining lethal damage. It could be done well^{1}, but all too often it's done in a lazy, predictable way.

Like everything else, /Worth the Candle/ nailed the Fel Seed exclusion zone. The decision to not describe the horrors in detail is an understandable one: it's not, after all, primarily a hardcore horror story.

Another thing I love about /Worth the Candle/ is fight scenes. In most stories, I tend to find them boring: repetitive, low on interesting and novel developments, impossible to usefully analyse, something I've seen a thousand times. In /Worth the Candle/, with its numerous and unusual magics all used together with esoteric effects in intelligent ways against strange and appropriately powerful foes? They're truly /gripping/.

And the resolution to the Fel Seed battle! It somehow both conformed to my expectations and surprised me, in the best ways. I expected it to be hopeless. I expected them to put up a fight. I expected them to fail. I expected this---

--- sort of offer. I expected deaths, I expected no deaths, I expected some sort of separation between Juniper and the rest of the party. Somehow, I didn't expect /all of that simultaneously/, and for the story to /continue past the Fel Seed failure/. This felt like the final stretch, that any continuation except into the Long Stairs to Uther would feel wrong... and yet, it works. It really does feel like the protagonist failed, died, and the story continues past that. Even though, presumably, it'll still continue "as usual", with Juniper the narrator.

Impeccable.

I think /Worth the Candle/ might be my favourite story ever, at least by the sheer scope of everything it does right.
