There was a short story recommended somewhere nearby (can't find it, sorry) in which a group of 12 (I think) people got each a unique power. There was a love-inducing woman, a person who did anything with perfect efficiency, a punch-harder, etc, and a person who could see a month into future.

The last guy built himself an information tunnel through time up to the end of the universe, where his future self's civilisation had ran out of energy. This information was sent back to his past- (present) self through all the relay points as being of top priority; and they started looking for ways of how to answer the Last Question.

  I place my hand on the door to the ballroom and stop. Images of my death flash through my mind and all my senses howl that something isn't right. Retreating my hand from the door I step backwards. My prophetic ability isn't without fail, but it kept me alive until today. I turn left, but a shiver runs down my spine. Next I attempt to walk back the way I came, but an image of my twisted and broken body appears there. In the end I take the corridor to the right. What's wrong with this place? Normally it's enough to change a single decision in order to influence the future and avoid the bad end.
