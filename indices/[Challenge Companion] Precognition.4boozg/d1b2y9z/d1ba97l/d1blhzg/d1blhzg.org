The Naruto story /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4202377][Next]]/ (in which Naruto has the two-minutes-ahead precognition of the movie) uses a similar style of description:

  Naruto scrambled to his feet, his eyes wide in fear. He hadn't been this scared since... ever. All around him, Narutos were lying in various positions. One or two were even spread across the length of the impromptu battlefield, organs splayed like the grotesque scribbling of a madman. Everywhere he looked, he saw his own death, and the dead bodies of his teammates. Before he could stop himself, he looked at the sword and saw in unyielding clarity the missing-nin who would perch himself atop it in less than a minute. Momochi Zabuza was a man whose very eyes were colder than the coldest of winters. Naruto focussed too much on the man, the hundreds of future echoes of his entrance blurring over one another. A thousand teeth grinned in a single mouth that was both covered and uncovered as the paths of fate tried to determine if the man would tear off the bandages over his mouth or not. Naruto had never seen anything like it. He saw too much.
