The protagonists of loop-centered stories /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ explicitly get a lot of mileage out of using trial and error to find and exploit "patterns"--long chains of consistent inputs from the protagonist that are able to force equally-consistent outputs from non-looping characters. The process of discovering these "patterns" is like navigating [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape][a fitness landscape]], but with the ability to go back downhill and try again after getting stuck on a local plateau.

Time-rewinding stories with such "pattern"-seeking behavior on much-shorter timescales include the /The Batman/ episode /[[http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman_(2004_TV_Series)_Episode:_Seconds][Seconds]]/ and the movie [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Next][/Next/]].
