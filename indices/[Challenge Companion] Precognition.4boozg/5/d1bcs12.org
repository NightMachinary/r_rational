I recently read this story (as it was the top post in [[/r/rational][r/rational]], and I hadn't read it when it was first posted 9 months ago)

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/][A very interesting take on precognition]] is used by one of the protagonists. So I'll put it here for those who may not have seen it.
