I always find closed loop time travel very interesting. For unavertable prophesy, you'd have to work with the requirement that the universe will not allow the transmission of information from the future that would falsify itself, which imposes a lot of constraints on what kind of prophesies make it through, perhaps enough constraints to make their laws more of a topic of science than a big gaping deus ex machina?
