There is this:

#+begin_quote
  There's a [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6283682/][guide to voting]] put together by forum participant Twofold.
#+end_quote

The gist is that after every chapter, the thread + Discord chat talk about what Hazou should do and write up one or more Action Plans and Training Plans to vote on, which get improved and refined over the next 2-3 days. If you want to vote for a plan, you make a post with a line that follows the format:

#+begin_quote
  [X] $PLAN_NAME_HERE
#+end_quote

Anyone can contribute, even if just by suggesting ideas for ways to phrase things or talking about what you'd like to see the party do. We'd love to see you over there :)
