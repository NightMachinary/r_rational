I was actually thinking on an even bigger variant.

But as far as I know, the reason the weight distribution slows down any weapon is because you need to force it to stop or reverse it's momentum after every attack. A sword is aerodynamic enough to do it without fighting it's own weight, but not a hammer.

There is also the reach to consider. Real life weapons assumed you had a maximum weight you could swing, so a hammer and a sword of that same weight will give the longer reach to the sword.

Another reason hammers weren't used much compared to swords was the stamina that took to use that. The bigger the mace, the more you would tire after just a few blows. There is a reason hammers are often made as power tools or even whole machines.

Now, back to our scenario:

Super strength means you could swing a normal war hammer like a kid's toy hammer as you have enough power to kill it's momentum. There is still a ceiling with the weight, as you would need equal or more weight yourself to counterbalance the thing, at the very least.

Super strength also means you could have a hammer with a handle as long as needed. Although you may want a counter weight on the other tip if it's too long. Maybe a quarterstaff with Maul tips on both ends? something to consider.

Finally, I believe our scenario accounts for super stamina, solving the third point.
