The problem with heavier weapons is that if they go over a certain percentage of your weight, as you swing them they pull you together.. You'd be sort of flinging yourself around.

Longer weapons are unwieldy, it takes longer to make them change direction because their weight get's farther from your hands.

  the reason the weight distribution slows down any weapon is because you need to force it to stop or reverse it's momentum after every attack. A sword is aerodynamic enough to do it without fighting it's own weight, but not a hammer.

The first part is correct, but aerodynamics have little influence on this swords are quick because their center of mass is close to your hand, in maces and axes they are on the tip.

A spear can get away with it because of the way it's used, if you tried to use it like a hammer it would be very slow.
