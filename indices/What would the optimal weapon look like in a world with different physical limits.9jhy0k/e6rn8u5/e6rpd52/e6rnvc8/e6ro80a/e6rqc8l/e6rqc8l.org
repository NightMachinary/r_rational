I think you'd need a bunch of space to swing a chain around. And nets move kind of slowly.

Polearms are nice in that they'll do more damage to a fast moving opponent.

Thinking about it a bit more, I'd add some barbs to the middle of the shaft and try to rig some kind of harness so that the polearms stay attached to the soldiers.

Then, even if the hero smashes through my front line, the polearms will catch on each other and make a thicket of interlocking oak poles, with 200lbs of dead weight at the end of each

Hopefully that would slow the hero enough that the remaining forces could just shoot him with arrows.

If the hero is so strong that even that stops working then there's not much of a reason to keep fielding infantry. Just retreat or surrender.
