Next: Normal opponents vs Super People. I'd approach this by iterating. Ask if a side needs to change, and if so, what they could do to counter their opponent.

Round 1: The super people discover they have super powers. And they're buff enough to take on a group of normal people using normal tactics. The super people don't really have an incentive to change. They're winning, so they can do whatever.

Round 2: The normal people are getting crushed, so they want to change. I'd guess that the problem is that the normal people can't get meaningful hits in.

To make a D&D comparison: The first 5 Kobolds won't kill a party of experienced PCs. So, a Kobold 'win' isn't killing. It's setting things up so that the PCs have to spend scarce resources. If they can do that, eventually the PCs lose. Otherwise, the PCs can kill Kobolds forever.

To apply this to soldiers, your Hero is going to murder his way through the first couple spearmen he sees. There's nothing the spearmen can do about that. Instead, their job is to hamper the heros so that the next line has a shot.

If I were a general, I'd do this by handing out polearms and armor with scary looking hooks on it. Sure, the PCs will punch through. But, the 1st round of polearms guys are there to try and hamper the PC's weapons, or catch their shields, so the 2nd line can stab.
