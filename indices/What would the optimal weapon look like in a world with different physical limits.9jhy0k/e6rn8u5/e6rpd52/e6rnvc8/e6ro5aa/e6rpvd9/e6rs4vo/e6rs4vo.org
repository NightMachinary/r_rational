  It's a hard question to answer specifically, or even creatively, without a lot more information.

I'm not really up for creating a super detailed and consistent scenario. But if you want a little bit more detail, how about these two scenarios

1. Offensive and defensive abilities grow proportionally to what they are on a normal human. A level 10 super would have to exert the same % amount of pressure in a hit to the temple as a normal human would to kill. Durability is just a hidden stat that somehow grows at the same pace as your "real" stats. DBZ esque, sort of.

2. People just don't have the "limiter" on strength anymore. Power, coordination, and reaction no longer hit diminishing returns the more you practice them, instead growing somewhat linearly.

For the record, I'm not really sure how scenario 2 would play out. Would the supers tear the acl jumping and break bones punching? For the sake of our situation, let's say no. We'll just say that for some reason it is much harder to cause self inflicted injury.
