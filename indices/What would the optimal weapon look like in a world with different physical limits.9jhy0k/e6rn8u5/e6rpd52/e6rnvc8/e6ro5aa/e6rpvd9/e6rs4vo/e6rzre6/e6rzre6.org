Leverage.

In scenario one, you have to keep in mind that absolutely enormous stresses are put on joints under even normal human activity. When you swing something at the end of your hand that weight is multiplied at your elbow and (possibly) multiplied again at your shoulder. Strength increases these stresses at a higher ratio than an even rise in durability would sustain regardless of whether scenario 2 applies.

And without careful technique, normal humans break their own bones punching and kicking normal people already. Logically, any degree to which they are reinforced to prevent this, will be a degree to which anybody else's ability to damage them decreases as well.

It's pretty easy to create a situation in which a level 10 super can't really hurt a level 10 super anymore, so the battle becomes one of exhaustion and attrition or...

How about pain? Do electric shocks hurt them the way they hurt us? What about extreme heat or cold? Do they have the same nerve sensitivity in, for example, their eyes, teeth, nailbeds, genitals, or (again) joints. If yes, focusing on those weaknesses will by the primary way to make them less interested or even capable of fighting. What about airborne toxins? Ones that can pass through skin? Does asphyxiation work if you can pinch or obstruct their windpipe?

In whatever way they are the most mortal, focus there, even if their only vulnerabilities are psychological.

Additional problem for scenario 2: It gets progressively more challenging to train. The masses involved and the equipment required get prohibitive pretty fast. The degree to which force delivered in a human handprint or pressure applied by a human footprint, grow to levels that outstrip most materials technology. Sharpness again.

Weapons have this same problem, as steel becomes as strong as cheap plastic. Past a certain point there is nothing more powerful than the strong, fast, durable supers' own fingertips and teeth and essentially they can only train with one another.

I don't have good stats for where that is.
