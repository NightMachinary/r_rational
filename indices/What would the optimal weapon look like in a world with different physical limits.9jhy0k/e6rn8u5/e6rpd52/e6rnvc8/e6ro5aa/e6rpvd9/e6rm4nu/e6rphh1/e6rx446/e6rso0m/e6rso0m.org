i think the weapons would stay mostly the same because the limiting factors of the weapons are rarely the strenght of the user, but the shape of the human body, (you cant make a weapon much bigger before it gets troublesome to move in crouded places or fight a battle without fighting in formation) the choice of weapons might change though, depends of the material available in the setting, if you can make an armor good enough to resist blows from an edged weapon from one super. and also depends on the context, inside a battle or outside of it.

I think if you are outside the battle and so long the superhuman is still fragile enough to be poked by weapons the best civilian weapon must be a rapier or something like it, if you make it much bigger it starts to bump into stuff and drag on the floor if you have it on the hip, and wearing it on the back is a bit unrealistic, they get really hard to unsheath and people/guards reacts badly to people waving around giant weapons around.

in battle, if you can make and afford superplate armor strong enough to defend against the blows of other superdudes you would have cores of juggernauts fighting with extralong halberds/polehammers, think medievals knights of foor but more hardcore, they are strong enough to wear armor so thick to make them impervious to anything but another superdude with a really big hammer like the ones they themselves wear.

in battle if you cant afford, or cant make, or the super dudes are strong enough that no amount of armor can stop their strikes you would wear armor strong enough to repel normal dudes, because you can be distracted or surrounded or simply have bad luck and have to tank a blow or two. as for the weapons i think that battles would gravitate towards the style of alexander the great with looong spears in formationas the core of the armies and more mobile elite forces armed with more normal sized spears/sword to fight in tighter quarters when the megaspears are not practical.

in unarmored duels, here you can go wild with the weapons because you dont have to wear it around everyday, it depends once again in the materials, if you can make spears strong enough not to be cut by a sword wielded by a superdude, then spears trumps all other weapons in unarmored duels they have reach to kill the other dude before he kills you, they cant be the ultra long spears because if the opponent enters your close proximity you are screwed, so something like a two meter + longspear, maybe with some kind of hand protection in the handle. if you cant make spears strong enough not to be cut by a sword, then swords, giant swords like a nodachi or a montante to have reach and they have the balance closer to the hand so they can be moved more easily than axes and poleweapons.
