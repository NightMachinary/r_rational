If you have someone who is outscale strong, but not much more durable or fast, they would likely use a large shield and a smaller weapon/shield. Just focus on bashing into their enemies and deflecting the attacks that get around the shield. There is no point using a huge weapon to give you even harder hits when you already kill people in one hit with anything else.

Alternatively, strong characters may use large sweeping attacks, such as a glaive that would be basically impossible to dodge. And give you so much more reach that you always get the first attack.

If someone is much faster, rapiers and needle like weapons become vastly more viable.

If everything scales up evenly (everyone is fast and strong and durable), then you won't see much difference in weapons. Maybe more ranged weapons as that sort of ability set would make thrown weapons have a huge range and still benefit from high strength.
