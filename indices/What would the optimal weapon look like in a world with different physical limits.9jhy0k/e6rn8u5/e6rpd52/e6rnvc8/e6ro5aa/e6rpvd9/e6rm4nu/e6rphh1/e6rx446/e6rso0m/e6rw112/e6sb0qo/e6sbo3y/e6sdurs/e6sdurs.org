For handled weapons wielded by humans, given strong enough tensile materials and quick / strong people, I'd say a hybrid of flail and very fine whip would be ideal, with an extreme reach, while being hard to see (=hard to dodge or conserving a maximum of surprise factor with stealth) and multiple strands covering a wider zone than a single strand.
