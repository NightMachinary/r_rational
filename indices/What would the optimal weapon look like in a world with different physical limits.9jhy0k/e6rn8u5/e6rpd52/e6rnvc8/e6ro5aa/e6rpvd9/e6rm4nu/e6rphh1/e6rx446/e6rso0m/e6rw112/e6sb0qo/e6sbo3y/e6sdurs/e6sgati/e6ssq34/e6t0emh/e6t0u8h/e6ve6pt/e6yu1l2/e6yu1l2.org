A gun? As long as it's strong enough to puncture skin and kill people, it's a good choice even against strong people.

Unless they're fast. In which case, you want a faster-firing gun that can hit anything. Or just has an AoE effect, so maybe a grenade launcher with a gun at the bottom for close-range?

Medieval weapons are outdated. Superheroes only use medieval weapons because +they're magical, and because (for whatever dumb reason) there aren't magical guns+ the writer says so.
