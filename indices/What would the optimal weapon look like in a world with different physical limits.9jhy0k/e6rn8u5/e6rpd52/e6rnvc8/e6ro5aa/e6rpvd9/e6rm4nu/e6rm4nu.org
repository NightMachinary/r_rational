My first thought is the use of chains, or string, or nets - some sort of binding weapon to hamper and control enemy movement. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdPKKXgKfMc][This video]] from the anime Iron Blooded Orphans showcases some of that; one gundam is using thick wires, or cables, to incapacitate, subdue, and prepare to destroy a technically superior mobile suit. [[https://youtu.be/xdPKKXgKfMc?t=7m8s][This is the link to the specific place in the video showcasing the climax of the technique, though bits and pieces of it are seen throughout the rather excellent battle sequence]].

(The Alaya-Vijnana systen mentioned at that point in the video is a biomechanical interface system designed to drastically increase human data processing speed, sensory input, and reaction time. The video shows a normal human defeating such an opponent by using these chain-weapons).

My second thought involves Naruto-style Genjutsu, which I don't have a better word for. Illusions meant to confuse and interfere with the enemy's senses.

My third thought involves space/time techniques. Offensive teleportation, teleporting enemies VERY high into the air so they get killed from the fall, or deep into the ocean, or into any other arbitrarily fatal set of circumstances. Then there's time-traps - literally phasing someone out of time at a fixed set of spatial coordinates, so, say, if you freeze someone in time for five minutes, they'll reappear later somewhere in outer space, somewhere further behind along in the planet's orbit.

Finally, there's portal abuse - phasing half of someone's body into a portal and then shutting it, instantly severing their body.

Finally, there are the tried and true real-world techniques of chemical and biological weapons, snipers, IEDs, drone strikes, etc.
