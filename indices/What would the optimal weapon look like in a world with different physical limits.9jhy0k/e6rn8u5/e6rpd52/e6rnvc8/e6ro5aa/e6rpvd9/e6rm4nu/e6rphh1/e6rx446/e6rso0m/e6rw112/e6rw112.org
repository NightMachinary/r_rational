Offensive Zorbing.

â€‹

Normal humans have weight limits. They can't carry large weapons and wearing heavy armor bogs them down. Not so for superhumans. Superhumans can encase themselves in ultra-thick armors while maintaining mobility. If it also comes with required secondary powers like superior reflexes, sense of balance, perception, etc., then an offensive Zorbing technique can be used: Encase yourself in a ball of solid [insert superior material here] and roll yourself towards your enemies to crush them flat.
