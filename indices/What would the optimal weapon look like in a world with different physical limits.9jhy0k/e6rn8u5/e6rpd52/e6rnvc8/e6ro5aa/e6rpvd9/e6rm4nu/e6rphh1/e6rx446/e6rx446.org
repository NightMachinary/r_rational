Those weapons are effective and similar things will continue to be effective. Because of physics, small area of impact with a high force just concentrates that force in one place making it better at causing damage.

Another thing is that weapon speed is mainly handled by how the weapons weight is distributed and it's balance, not necessarily by it's weight. Weight is important don't get me wrong, but the way it's balanced has a larger effect overhaul.

So a super human with a mace would be faster than a normal human with a mace, but slower than a super human with a sword.

​

In general weapons were always 1 hit win tools. Because RL is not a game and instead of losing hp you get wounded, which makes you worst at fighting or flat out incapacitates you depending on the wound. Unless armor is involved then it can turn into grappling.

What you'd see would be similar to HEMA, fights are quick and deadly.

​

The problem with increased strength is that if you don't increase mass both fighters would fling each other around as they parry each others weapons.

​

But to answer your question more directly.

​

It would depend on how much more powerful you were than the weaker enemies. In general I'd say a proper historical greatsword, it's got some reach and good crowd control, regardless of how much more powerful you were than the weaker enemies.

​

Fighting equals I'd say spears if it's a fight you are prepared for, and a sword if it's an ambush or an unexpected fight.

Spears are great at 1v1 they are very fast and have a big reach advantage, but you can't really conveniently carry them with you all the time.

​

Swords are in general great self defense weapons for several reasons like being quick, large blade, murder strokes, having hand protection and irl people will aim for your hand, and they can be worn, i.e they are side arms so you can always have them on hand.

​

If you know are going to fight, you'd want to take a proper battlefield weapon with you if you could. i.e spears, halberds, greatswords and the like.

And you'd bring a sidearm like a sword in case your weapon broke or you lost it, or you got into a closed space like a corridor. If it got really close quarter you'd want to have a dagger.
