This tended to be the case with WH40k. Because of the ability to hit at range, and the gameplay mechanic where one side got to swing first, as you scaled up the size of the battle it became that much more important to hit first. If I wasn't going to the be the one to hit first, I'd go to great lengths to make sure I couldn't be hit at all.
