This post makes a lot of sense, especially the low durability example. It brings to mind the Protectors and war-specced Moties - two of Larry Niven's nonhuman races: Creatures that were superhumanly strong, fast, and perceptive/reactive/accurate meant fights were generally over instants after they started: whichever side held the slight starting advantage - be it by luck, ambush, positioning, etc. - carried the fight as the initial attackers took out most of the other side with their opening salvo.

Enhanced intelligence (on all sides) also played a big role, as the tools and tactics employed rapidly outstripped the (super)natural advantages floating around. If the actors are smart enough to keep pushing the arms race tech envelope forward then I'd imagine the end result to be like the scenario humanity 'enjoys' today, just on a bigger/more violent scale.

For example, Niven's stories detailed how everyone using largely undodgeable laser weaponry and "unblockable" disintegration/gamma/whatever rays made the enhanced attributes of strength and toughness pretty superfluous.
