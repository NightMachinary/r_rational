You really need some specific parameters for the abilities re strength, speed, durability, accuracy, perception, reaction time. you get a totally different answer depending on which you maximize.

If you've got super strength and accuracy but not durability or evasion speed then just throwing rocks or darts will be extremely deadly.

If durability is high then its all about high penetration weapons and setting up the big blow.

If speed is high but perception isn't then guerilla tactics and stealth ambushes will be best.

If speed, reaction, and perception are all high but durability is low then it's a frenzied Kung Fu battle where everyone is zipping around jockeying for position, and the light long reach or zone control weapons are best.

So you really need to think about what powers populate this world and what tactics would evolve based on them.
