They'd probably use sticks with knives on the end. Humans used spears before agriculture, after agriculture, after horses, on horses, against horses, well after guns were invented (in fact this made spears more popular), used guns as sticks to put knives on, and at least one military still trains on bayonet use. Spears have been the right choice in a lot of contexts, so I'd expect them to be the best choice for most (but by no means all) permutations of worlds with different physical limits.
