Though, my absolute last tactic against literal goku would be to have the latrine pits dug unusually shallow and wide. Then put some decking on top.

Super hero jumps leave craters in normal earth and would definitely punch straight though a deck.

This wouldn't win the battle. But mundane forces won't beat literal goku anyway. At least we'll have ruined his day.
