With super strength, you'll probably want weapons which can leverage your strength into speed, so something like a halberd, greatsword, or heavy repeating crossbow would be a good way to take advantage of the strength bonus.

With super speed (but not strength), you'll probably want lightweight weapons which do a good job of rapidly delivering low-energy penetrating injuries, like a spear or rapier. Throwing weapons could also be far more effective with higher 'muzzle velocity' for lack of a better word, so darts and javelins might become a particularly good choice.

With faster reaction you'll want weapons which are lightweight and well-suited for parrying and piercing, such as a daggers and short swords.
