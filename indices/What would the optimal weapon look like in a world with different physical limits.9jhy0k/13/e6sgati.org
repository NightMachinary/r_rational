Upon further thought, I agree that the traditional melee weapons like swords/axes/hammers don't make much sense in a typical superhuman world, since human strength increases several times, but human weight does not. If the superhumans make use of their superior strength to use much heavier versions of traditional weapons, they will find themselves flung about by their much heavier weapons.

On the other hand, ranged weaponry may become much more common: after all, increased strength means increased weight limit means more ammunition can be carried. Bows and arrows may not be that useful since there's limits on bow strength, so throwing knives/axes may be more common since they rely on human strength.
