In an extremely general sense, sharpness is what's important: the combination of speed and cross-section. At hurricane velocity, a broken wooden board or a chunk of plastic is sharp. At the speed gunpowder propels it from the barrel, even a completely round musket ball is. The smaller the surface area striking a surface, and the more energy it has behind it, the sharper it is.

We have layers of tissue around our relatively delicate interiors in order to protect them. If those can be pierced, doing catastrophic damage to the rest is scary easy.

So, how hard are our superhumans and how fast are they? Strength, flexibility, dexterity, along with weapon and armor choice are all just ways to modify that basic frame. Blades (if they're hard and sharp enough) decrease surface area. Handles (if they're hard enough) provide leverage. Maximize the second, minimize the first.

On the other hand, if somebody is bulletproof then they're not just able to handle the piercing force of a bullet (great speed, tiny cross section at its point) they're also able to deal with whatever denting it causes kinetically that might bruise their organs or tear their skin.

If they can take a bullet like that, they can likely sustain whatever any basic blade might bring to bear. There's some possibility of focusing force on particular joints or bones that might cause them pain, aiming to bludgeon them with a large object in the hopes of bruising something, or just trying to sever something with a large and heavy blade like a big piece of sheet metal.

As a general rule, it's easier to destroy than to defend so somebody ultimately loses, but when and how is quite particular to where each combatants strengths and weaknesses lie.

It's a hard question to answer specifically, or even creatively, without a lot more information.
