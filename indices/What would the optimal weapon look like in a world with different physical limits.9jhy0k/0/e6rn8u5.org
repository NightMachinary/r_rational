If we're fencing, my goal is to either react a little faster than you, or move my sword so I get better leverage.

If you scale all of our abilities up evenly, the fight doesn't change much, it just plays out a bit quicker. If we were evenly matched before, we're still evenly matched. We're just pressing twice as hard.

But, things change when you scale one ability more than another. UFC fights are a good example. Putting on a lot of muscle will make you punch harder. But it doesn't make your skull any thicker. The result is that ultra-heavy-weight fights tend to be over in just a couple exchanges. There's not a lot of grappling. Instead, the [[https://youtu.be/AkxedzeBPHE?t=7m33s][first guy to get a clean hit wins]]. The light guys can go a lot longer, and tend to have prolonged exchanges where they each get punched tens of times.

Following that example, if I'm ultra-strong, I'd probably go for a spear. My logic is that the first guy to land a blow -- even a glancing blow -- will damage their opponent. So, I'd want range.
