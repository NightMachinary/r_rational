The question is open ended enough that that answer is probably "thrown tungsten projectiles".

​

If people are sufficiently difficult to damage and sufficiently capable of throwing things at high velocity this approaches a "railgun vs tank" scenario, and anything that has any chance of improving on or protecting against a pure kinetic impactor will be prohibitively expensive compared to a dude chucking a slug to the point that more slug-throwers throwing in volleys is probably better than one armored HEAT-javaliner form a supply-line point of view.

​

At a less insane scale, it'll largely depend on a few tipping points IMO:

1. Are there structural materials stronger than people? If there are chances are whatever conventional weapons and armor can be made out of those materials will determine what's effective (maces if the material can't hold an edge, for example) .
2. Are guns capable of defeating those materials man-portable? (if so the range of guns beats hand to hand)
3. Are the materials that can be useful as weapons and armor rare or common? (a sword has to be composed almost entirely of the wonder-material, an ax can have a hybrid wonder-material/lesser-material head and a haft made of something else entirely. Plate armor takes a lot of material, shields can be sized based on what you have, etc.)

History has examples of a lot of those in practice as availability of metals has played a significant role in the balance of armor vs weapons and such.

​

Another thought is that in the case where there aren't any structural materials stronger than people there can still be weapons made form the stronger parts of people (the bones of a warrior). Though ability to work those materials might be limited as anything you'd use to carve the thigh bone of a legendary fighter would presumably also be usable to kill a legendary fighter, so you'd likely get things more along the lines of clubs, and spear tips made from jagged bone fragments.
