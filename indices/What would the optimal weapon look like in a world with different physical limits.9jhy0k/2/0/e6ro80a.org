  To apply this to soldiers, your Hero is going to murder his way through the first couple spearmen he sees. There's nothing the spearmen can do about that. Instead, their job is to hamper the heros so that the next line has a shot.

If you've read Stormlight Archive this is basically what shardbearers do. They just cleave right through normal troops until exhausted, or met with an opposing shardbearer.

But, if we totally embrace the idea of "common soldier = fodder" are polearms still the way to go? Nets, chains, or anything that blinds combined with thick shields would probably delay longer, right?
