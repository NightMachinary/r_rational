I especially like the first bit of this, though it's just good fighting technique rather than specific to superhumans: Limit your opponent's range of movement. It's very hard to punch somebody, or stab them, or slice them, if you can't reach them. It's also hard to do any of those if you haven't got room to swing or aim. Dodge, incapacitate, subdue, and restrict to gain advantage against a stronger opponent.
