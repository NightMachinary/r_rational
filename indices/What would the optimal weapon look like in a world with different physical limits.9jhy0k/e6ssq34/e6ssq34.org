It depend on how much more powerful they are. I'm assuming you're ruling out guns and bombs and such.

At first, the armor and weapons just get heavier. Honestly, this will probably be all that happens so long as things stay within biologically feasible ranges.

But eventually, when jumping becomes high enough that combat enters three dimensions, I bet you're going to start favoring range weapons (especially thrown weapons) as well as any tools that allow you to glide and change direction in mid air - especially if your dexterity improves along with your strength. Dexterity improvements in general change a lot about optimal weaponry. For instance, if your dexterity is higher you will ditch the bow and carry a simply sling, since bows are bulky and their only advantage is being easier to aim. (And if you've got two very accurate super-human people with slings going against each other, it's probably best /not/ to jump unless you can dodge or block in mid-air). Once your throw is strong enough for air resistance to make additional initial velocity unhelpful, you'll ditch the sling too.

As we get even more powerful, maybe you'll eventually start being able to fly on your own power (with tools) by vibrating your limbs. For this to happen, the muscle, skin, and bones must become harder to deal with the incredible forces involved, and a lot will depend on the particulars of how this is accomplished. Armor and shields will become equivalent to cloth and cardboard. The weapons may start becoming too soft to really penetrate the skin, and air resistance will preclude the effectiveness of thrown weapons. At this point the limiting factor will become calories, so it pays to become fat (don't forget to bring super-speed metabolism) or carry a sack of sugar around. I think at this point if you don't use post-medieval technology you might as well just go hand to hand.

The importance of non-physical methods of killing will become way more important - poison, gas, radiation, etc.
