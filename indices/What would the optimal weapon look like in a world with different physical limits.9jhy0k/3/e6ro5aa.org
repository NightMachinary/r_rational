The problem with super human like battles is that almost every attack is a potential kill. Your muscles can continue to grow considering this scenario, but you can't train your skin to harden. So you are forced to either dodge or parry almost everything.

With that in mind, I would argue the best weapon would be either a Maul style hammer or a very unpredictable weapon.

If you can swing a Maul like a stick, you have a very fast weapon, with a decent reach. You can smash or deform the enemy weapon and/or shield with it. If your opponent decides to parry, their arms will start hurting within a few hits. It ignores most armors, as the plate will just cave inwards and crush the target's torso. You just have to concentrate on not being hit while raining blows on your opponent.

An unpredictable weapon on the other hand (say a three sectional staff or a kuma with chain combo) could impose an unfamiliar rhythm to the fight and confuse the opponent enough to make him take a blow and score a quick victory.

This is assuming melee weapons, of course. A simple gun can cover over a thousand meters in a second. Unless you're dealing with the flash, you can just aim and shoot the other guy down. Yes, there are bullet proof vests, but you're a super human. Just get a desert eagle.
