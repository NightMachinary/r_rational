  If magically enhanced bodies are stronger than any inorganic material available, then melee weapons just aren't very useful.

Even if fists are "stronger" than melee weapons, there's no getting around the fact that a fist holding a roll of quarters is going to have more mass than an empty clenched fist.

There's also the other function of brass knuckles: in addition to providing mass, they also concentrate force on a smaller contact area. If you want to apply pressure, decreasing surface area by a large factor is usually easier than increasing force by the same factor (a sharp knife requires a lot less force to cut than a dull one). Even if someone has a body that is materially "stronger" than inorganic material, laws of physics still apply, and weapons allow you to achieve non-strength properties like mass and shape that are going to affect how much damage your blows do.
