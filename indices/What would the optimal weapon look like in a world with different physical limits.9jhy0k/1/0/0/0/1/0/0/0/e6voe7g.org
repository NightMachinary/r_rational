In general there's a speed / weight tradeoff if momentum is held constant, but I think ordinary humans basically get more total momentum with heavier objects. Ultimately for us the max speed our muscles can move is ultimately more a limiting factor for gaining momentum than the actual power behind our movements. So a weighted punch essentially harnesses more muscle than an unweighted one.
