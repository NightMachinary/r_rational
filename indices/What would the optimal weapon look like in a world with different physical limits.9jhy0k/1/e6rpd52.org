I think one of the biggest factors is not just the strength and speed of the warriors, but the strength of the materials available.

Realistic strength, realistic materials: realistic weapons.

Super strength, realistic materials: honestly I think you'd see a lot of hand to hand combat. If magically enhanced bodies are stronger than any inorganic material available, then melee weapons just aren't very useful. On the other hand, that might have more grotesque implications. If the strongest available material is magically enhanced bodies, then it may be tempting to make your weapons out of bone.

Realistic strength, super materials: Probably doesn't make a huge difference to the actual design of weapons, but assuming relatively primitive tech levels, which I think is implied by the prompt, one possible result of this situation is increased political and economic inequality. Armor made from effectively invincible materials is an easy enough concept to come up with, and even if your sword is made of the same thing, penetrating that defense gets harder the better the materials are. If you can afford a suit of armor, you're invincible, if you can't, you aren't. There's a reason why the image of knights in armor is so tightly tied to feudalism.

Super strength, super materials: I think big dumb anime swords might actually be viable in some cases. If you're strong enough to wield it comfortably without being slowed down too much, and if the material is strong enough not to bend under its own weight, then you might as well scale it up a bit. Another thing I think people overlook when talking about super strength is that it isn't usually packaged with increased mass. So in a fight between supersoldiers, creating space is easy. You can jump away easier or push away your enemy easier than a normal person, so having a weapon with more reach is an advantage. If someone tries to get inside your guard, just jump away with your super strong legs, or push them back (ideally up and back so that they can't get leverage to fight you no matter how strong they are).
