In this case, the work is posted to AO3, which features the ability to download natively as part of site functionality. The only thing stopping anyone from epub download is that the file size is so big that their converter doesn't work and the download fails.

I do generally agree with the premise, but this is just a case of a provided feature not working like it should, so circumventing it isn't a huge deal to me. (I still don't want people mirroring the story, because that likely means that fewer people are seeing or clicking Patreon/Paypal links, and I don't have control of those mirrors so can't make sure that they're what I want them to be, and some are bound to be leeches, but publication is basically assumed to never be happening for this story unless it's self-published.)
