  Online piracy is the practice of downloading and distributing copyrighted content digitally without permission,

From wikipedia. Notice how charging for the original isn't part of it.

Nobody who matters actually gives a shit about the few cents per download, but if AW wants a future book deal, he can point at all his prior stories and say "I've got X downloads of this story and y unique views" which is the closest metric you'll ever have for free content. There's also the issue of if Rowling decides she wants to pull a Disney, AW can't take this copy down.

The only thing that makes the file /not/ be piracy is the fact that AW replied to my.comment after the fact to grant permission.
