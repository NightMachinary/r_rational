Back then, it was the first and only anime I live blogged. [[https://nerditis.com/tag/maoyuu-maou-yuusha/][I did not enjoy the experience]].

As a person who is thus most qualified talking about it, I'll say, I don't think it's fascist; it's less "oh, I will plan keep fighting this war because economy" and more "our two sides have been locked into this war for centuries, so if we want to phase them out, it has to be gradual". That seems sensible, because obviously if the new Great Demon King just came out and said "stop all fighting, the humans are now our friends!" after war had been the state of things for so long, she'd just be dethroned and replaced with the most bloodthirsty Infernal Warlord who can put his grubby claws on the throne.

However where the anime fails to me is in that it just has very bland economic notions, doesn't do much with its premise, and most heinous sin of all, it's boring as fuck.
