Yes, I guess with how it puts it it implies that it's an aggressor/defender scenario and that the Demon King has the power to simply surrender or call a truce but it does have more than that, it notes that if she just surrendered or was killed she'd get replaced and that the central nations view it as a holy war and wouldn't accept a surrender anyway. I guess it is still sorta fascist with only a few people being let in on the full story and allowed to help with planning, on the other hand most of what they do is above board, even if all their motivations are not.
