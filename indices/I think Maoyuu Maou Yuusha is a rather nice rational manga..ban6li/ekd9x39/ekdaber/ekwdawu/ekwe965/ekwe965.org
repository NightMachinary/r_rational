Is it? I think it's a pretty low bar, TBH. We try the first episodes of everything, every season; three crotch/boob/naked shots before it's done anything interesting plotwise and it's out (opening doesn't count, or we'd never watch anything); otherwise, it has 5-10 minutes or so to grab someone's interest before we move on (usually 4-5 of us around with fairly diverse tastes). Very occasionally, the heuristic fails and we miss something that later turns out to have actually been good (e.g. School-Live), but generally we end up following 3-4 shows a season, which is pretty manageable, after feeling like we've drunk from the firehose and given even all the "my little sister" etc shows a fair chance not to eliminate themselves.
