I mean, I understand your perspective here. I'm simply pointing out that fanservice, be it maximal fanservice a la a standard ecchi show or minimal fanservice for something grim dark like Youjo Sensen, isn't something I personally would consider a useful barometer for quality.

If lots of fanservice is something that makes you drop a work despite other things being present that you might enjoy, that's fair enough, and definitely a good barometer in that case. Everyone has things that make them hard-drop a show or story. Otherwise, the amount of T&A isn't really all that important.
