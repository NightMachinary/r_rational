I followed it in the past. After some time, it turned bland. At the beginning, I was excited with introduction of potato: how one crop can virtually solved food shortage. But with printing press following that, I felt unsatisfied. It's the same. The demon king acted as dispenser of new tech and not much else. Without greed, spite, or any base motive that drive her (or any good guys) acted big, the story just doesn't have grip.

Add to the mix antagonistic church that lacked higher motive, three-way romance of little consequences, poorly designed demon race, and unsophisticated quips between demon lord, her maid, and two hired girl maid, I quickly lost interest.

It /might/ have traits of rational fiction, but imo, it's a kingdom building story heavily muddled with un-thoughtful plot element.
