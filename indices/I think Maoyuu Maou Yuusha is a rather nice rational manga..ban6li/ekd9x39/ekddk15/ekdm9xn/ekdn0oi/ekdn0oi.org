Depends on the universe, really. Most fantasy stories with Heroes and Demons etc. (especially Japanese ones like the OP) are mostly stuck in the Middle Ages in terms of tech, with magic tacked on. Japanese fantasy writers are often inspired by the Dragon Quest video game series, after all.

The three-field system was already invented in the time of Charlemagne (742-814) and most farmers are aware farmland should be left to "rest" once in a while in the two-field system invented thousands of years earlier. Only really isolated villages, nomads and tiny islanders with no agricultural experiences would be unfamiliar with the most basic crop rotation technique like the two-field system.
