I read a fair bit of Release That Witch, but I think I was a bit spoiled by having read A Hero's War first. RtW seems to make things too easy. Projects get finished with improbably optimistic timelines and very few setbacks, everyone is constantly astounded by how the kingdom they're building is better than everywhere else in every way, etc. A Hero's War felt more like it earned its successes.
