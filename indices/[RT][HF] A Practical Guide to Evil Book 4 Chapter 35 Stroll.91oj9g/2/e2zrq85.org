Triumphant was the most famous one for conquering all of Calernia (might and ambition), Traitorous is the lethal joke character who betrays and is never betrayed (courtroom intrigue). I can see why they are the "exalted" of all Dread Emperors.

But what are the Maleficents and Terribilises exalted for?
