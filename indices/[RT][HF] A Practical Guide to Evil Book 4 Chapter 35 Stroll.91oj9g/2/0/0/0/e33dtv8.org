Maleficent II is considered the highest (if you don't count Triumphant, anyway) peak of Praesi influence on Calernia by most Guideverse scholars. At the apex of her reign the Empire ruled most of the League of Free Cities, sunk Ashuran war fleets repeatedly until there was an uneasy detente established and Praes controlled some of the most lucrative trade routes on the continent. It lasted long enough that there's still a bunch of Mtethwa loan-words in tradertalk by the time the series begins.

Terribilis I is the father of most the functional aspects of Praes as a state: codified nation-wide laws, the Imperial court as proxy for the otherwise constant low-key civil wars and Ater itself turning into the largest and most powerful of Praesi cities (it was previously a toss-up between Thalassina and Wolof). His reign wasn't a golden age in the traditional sense, but it was long and stable - which is arguably much rarer, in the Wasteland.
