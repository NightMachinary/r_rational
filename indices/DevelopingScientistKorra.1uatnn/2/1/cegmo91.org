What was scary about everyone losing their bending? Korra was scared because to her being the Avatar and a bender is the core of her identity. But aside from that, it's hard to care. Amon was threatening to turn their world into /our/ world. What's so bad about that?

I knew there wouldn't be a good explanation for Amon's power, and I didn't mind the bloodbending thing, since it's not like any of it makes any sense anyway. In my fic, things will be handled a bit differently. If I ever get there.

As for my essay, I stopped after the first 20 pages. It could use some pruning. I do think that looking at what made TLA work and why LoK sucked is really instructive, so maybe I'll find somewhere to post a series of articles on the subject and link to it on [[/r/writing]].
