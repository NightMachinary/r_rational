It's clear if you pay attention to the show that the benders connect to their spirituality by bending. That's why they have such a visceral reaction to Amon's threat. It would be like convincing a Christian that you can and will remove their connection to God. You're supposed to care because you empathize with the characters, even if you don't necessarily care about bending. Maybe the story didn't do a good enough job of making you care about the characters, but that's a different issue. I hope you keep Amon's backstory as a bloodbender. It made him a more interesting character.
