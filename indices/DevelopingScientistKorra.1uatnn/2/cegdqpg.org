Could you possibly post your 200 page essay somewhere? I came to similar conclusions after watching the show, but didn't put forth the effort to write it all down.

Your idea is Awesome, though I think the core story of tLoK needs a major overhaul too. Anon was a far scarier villain than Lord Ozai (though maybe not Azula) because he was a threat -- not just to all benders, but to all /bending/. Worse, he had a compelling case. There really were major, unfair differences between benders and non-benders, and I was super frustrated all the last half of the show as they ignored these interesting plot threads.

Then I got really upset when they revealed Anon's power to simply be a high-level chakra block via bloodbending. There were so, so many things wrong with this (I'm sure you got the same impression) and it may be better to change it completely. Personally I'd tear out that entire backstory with Anon's brother, father, Adult!Aang, etc., and let Anon be the scary, mysterious and dangerous villain he was at the start of the show. I'd make his power derive from the spirit world instead, as an emergence of a power activated by the horrific imbalances from a century ago (which makes sense -- they always say "keep the world in balance" but never have truly severe consequences for not doing so).

Don't worry to much about the writing itself. The motivation to produce quality content is more important than the quality of the content most of the time, and you certainly have the understanding to be a great storyteller.
