That definitely does not work with the currently intended tone or plot. I also don't think it would save my characters from basically being shit (I really need to stop treating the source material as inspiration). I need a significant change to what I'm doing with my story, not just a different framing device.

At least I'm satisfied with my actual plot, even if I don't know how to get my characters involved with it in a meaningful way. I'm thinking maybe I don't need to if the characters and setting themselves are sufficiently cool, but I'm failing to pull that off so far.
