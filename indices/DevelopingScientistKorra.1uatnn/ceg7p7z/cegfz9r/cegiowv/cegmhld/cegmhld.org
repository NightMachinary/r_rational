Yeah, that's all true. I'll probably have to bite the bullet and make some significant changes to her character or to her surrounding.

But doesn't "I'm bored and want to have an adventure" often work for characters? But I suppose they stumble into an adventure fairly quickly.

Or maybe turning her firebending test into a longer arc and more difficult struggle that takes much longer for her to complete, whether that's a few chapters or just a lot more words in the first chapter, to give more of an opportunity to get to know Korra and see her in action trying to accomplish something important. Could that work?
