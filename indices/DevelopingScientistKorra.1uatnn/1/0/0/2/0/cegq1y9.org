I think I'm going to go with stagnation. Once the airbenders got to a certain point of advancement, they slowed down and got very focused on the things they already knew. Science became more of an individualistic pursuit, much like canon airbender religion, and only a few actually worked toward progress in understanding of the universe and the human condition, while most were content to live hedonistic lives traveling and baking etc.

They thought they were untouchable. They didn't really pay attention to the fact that the Fire Nation was in a golden age. They didn't care (for the most part, although airbenders are very individualistic, so take that as you will) that the Fire Nation was invading the Earth Kingdom. They didn't appropriately acknowledge that the comet gave the Firebenders great power. And they didn't humor the possibility that they would storm the Air Temples en mass to begin a long and bloody campaign of genocide.

Of course it didn't help that they expected to have an Avatar to protect them in a few years.

Basically, you can have all the knowledge in the world, but without proper perspective, it's useless.
