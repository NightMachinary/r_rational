The main thing is that most episodes have a "lesson" because it was that era of children's TV. I want to keep this up, but I don't want all of the lessons coming from Aang. Now that I think about it, though, Aang does learn a lot of spiritual stuff in canon, so it's alright to make him learn rational stuff in this (and of course the philosophical overlap). Also, as I posted elsewhere, I'm considering making the airbenders not rationalists themselves, but the scientifically advanced descendants of a scientifically active society. In this case, Airbender students would learn science, but not how to do science. What Aang does know about how to think rationally comes from Gyatso and is outside of the regular curriculum.
