This sounds great. I love social science fiction about the scientific community (Dresden Codak is one of my favorites).

I'm actually working on an A:TLA fanfic that I'm calling Avatar: The Last Rationalist in which Aang is the last of the highly rational and scientific airbender race. I look forward to confusing people by having different BS pseudo-scientific explanations for bending etc. with you.
