Yeah, I agree completely, and I'm really not sure how to do that without making a large break from canon, which I'm trying to avoid doing in terms of character, plot, and setting in the early chapters. But canon sucked, so maybe I should stop imitating things that sucked.

There's your rationality lesson for the day. Don't imitate things that suck.

I should say that I do not intend for Korra to become very smart, just smart enough for her to be able to be a protagonist in a world that Professor Quirrell would conquer in a week, tops. The primary appeal of TLA is the characters and setting, and I'd like that to remain true of my fic as well. With sufficiently well-drawn characters and an interesting environment for them, a plot and promised awesome can be drawn out for a long time e.g. [[http://gunnerkrigg.com/?p=1][Gunnerkrigg Court]]. The problem in canon is that Korra has no very interesting or sympathetic goals and not very much happens to do, nor is she very important to anyone except as something to manipulate. Which I mostly retain. So, duh, I should make a much bigger break from canon.

And now to rewrite everything. Again. Maybe. Anyone have any ideas on how to make the beginning more interesting without tearing everything up and starting over with a radically different story?
