The big problem with Korra (both here and in canon) is that she's really got no motivation. That's not so unusual in people, but it's sort of makes for problems because she's stumbling from thing to thing without any real direction. What does Korra want? Freedom, mostly.

The reason the original series worked was that in the first episode we set up the premise: the Fire Nation is evil and needs to be stopped. This provides motivation to Aang throughout the entire series, and the series ends with the Fire Nation being stopped (with some moral ambiguity stuck in).

What's the premise in Korra, at least the first season? The equalists think that benders have put themselves up onto a pedestal, and some of them are getting violent. And Korra ... doesn't seem like she gives a shit about any of this. She joins up with the probending league because she thinks it would be fun, and mostly gets pushed from place to place by her coterie of advisors - she doesn't have much real agency.

So what I'd do to fix that is to put her on one side of an issue, and have that be her driving force. Maybe Korra is a scientist herself, more interested in how things work than in bending. Maybe Korra is an equalist herself, one that sees the injustices of a society where some are simply born better than others. Make her the Professor X to Amon's Magneto, two people on the same side of an issue who disagree on the means of getting equality.

Right now, Korra is whiny, hotheaded, stubborn, and bored. Hotheaded and stubborn are fine character traits, but Korra's whining makes her annoying, and her boredom makes her boring. She needs redeeming qualities, probably curiosity and compassion, and they need to be shown in the first chapter before I stop giving a crap about her. She needs some sort of drive, something beyond just "I'm bored and want to have an adventure". That's probably the toughest part, because she's the Avatar already and in a position to get almost anything that she wants /unless she's put in conflict with one side or another/, and it would be better for her to start the story with an opinion on whatever matter you're putting front and center.
