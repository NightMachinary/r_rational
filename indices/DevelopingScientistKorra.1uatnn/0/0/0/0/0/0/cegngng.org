N, you're right. I actually try to get Korra interested in the issues of Republic City with an OC Equalist who works at Tenzin's island and a bombing of a hospital in the failed second attempt that I linked to above, although I can't say that I handled either very well. It wasn't enough, either. Even after convincing Korra that she needs to get involved, she lacks the ability to involve herself. I couldn't figure out a way to keep Tarlok from owning her the instant she got involved with his task force.

I'm becoming more convinced that turning Korra's firebending test into something much longer, more involved, and challenging needs to happen, both to make her sufficiently interesting that I can slow things down, and to make her sufficiently competent and thoughtful that I can have her learn.
