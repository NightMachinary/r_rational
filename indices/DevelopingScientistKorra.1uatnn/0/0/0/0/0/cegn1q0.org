In the monomyth, this is the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth#The_Call_to_Adventure][Call to Adventure]]. "I'm bored and want to have an adventure" /can/ work for a character, but it's pretty rare to have that and not also have something that propels the character forward into the action. Luke Skywalker is probably the most famous example of someone bored with his life and surroundings and wanting an adventure, and he gets called into action when he gets the message from Leia off the droid. Luke shares a lot in common with Korra, actually. However, I think it's going to be hard to get it to work in a series that's all about politics when the main characters is almost entirely apolitical to start with.

That's just my opinion though.
