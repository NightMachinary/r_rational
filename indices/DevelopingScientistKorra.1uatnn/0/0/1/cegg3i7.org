So, fuck it, I was trying to avoid this, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9660282/1/Book-4-A-Matter][here's]] the aborted second attempt at this story, which I haven't destroyed yet so that I can use it for motivation to not suck at writing. Just to give some sense of what I was trying to do with the story before I realized it was all going to shit and I needed to start again.

Again, I'm really looking for sharp, specific, intelligent criticism, which is why I'm posting here. Clearly my own intelligence alone is not up to the task, or at least not up to the task in any non-horrifying time frame.
