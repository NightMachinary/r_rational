Sure, it would suck for benders. But for a non-bender like me who lives in a world that gets along fine without bending, it's a little hard to get too upset. The characters can't act like becoming like /me/ is the worst thing in the world and expect a great deal of sympathy in return.

Of course, it would have been nice if anyone had even bothered to /say/ why losing their bending was so terrible. It's not so hard to figure out, but if the narrative never addresses it....
