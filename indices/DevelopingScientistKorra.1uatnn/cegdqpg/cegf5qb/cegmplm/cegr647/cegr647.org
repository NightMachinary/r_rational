The ability to remove bending is /terrifying/. Most of the people with a bending ability use it on a daily basis. It's part of their identity, and usually part of their livelihood. Pretty much every member of the police force is a metalbender - Amon, in addition to being an excellent fighter, can destroy a bender. He just goes up to you and presses a thumb against your forehead, and suddenly you've lost your job lightningbending at the power plants. And it's not just that you lose your job, it's that bending is part of your culture too, it's something that you've used in sports growing up and probably learned from your parents. If you're a firebender, you use your bending to heat your tea, you use it to keep you warm on cold nights, and suddenly that's gone, and the loss is just going to be this empty ache within you.

Maybe you don't read that from the series, but I believe that's what they were trying to express. If you need an analogy, it's like someone could just come up and change your race, gender, or sexual orientation without your consent and against your wishes.
