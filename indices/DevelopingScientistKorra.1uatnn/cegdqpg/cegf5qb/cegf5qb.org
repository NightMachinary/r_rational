I actually really liked that Amon derived his power from bloodbending. He's got a compelling case, he's scary dangerous, and he's a threat to the state of the world ... and behind the mask, he's a bender, a hypocrite, doing things for his own reasons and pulling the wool over the eyes of the people who follow him. As far as character flaws of villains go, he's really got a good one, and it makes him an interesting villain with more and more layers the further down you dig.

The two biggest problems for me were that:

1. After Amon was defeated, the equalist movement basically just evaporated. He had /legitimate points/, and while it's definitely a crushing blow to morale for the equalists, nothing actually changed to address those points, and the discontent should still be there.
2. Everyone just got their bending back, which cheapened the loss of bending, one of the most dramatic points of the first season. It was like making this big deal over a character dying, and then seeing that character brought back to life in the final episode through some bullshit, just so that the story could have a happy ending.
