I want support your efforts with this fic. And maybe you already considered this idea but what if you made another character protagonist? I could see it working for Amon (maybe in the-last-ringbearer-style) or maybe Asami (who would have to fight benders without bending). Korra would then be more like a puppet who happens to be the Avatar.
