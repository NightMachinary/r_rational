As for Asami, if you want Korra to learn science over time, you could have here be naturally intelligent and inquisitive, but live under stifling bureaucracy that doesn't want her to waste time learning academic things when she should be learning traditional Avatar skills.

She gets hit by a moped carrying 130 pounds of rich science major with an evil scientist father.
