Well, there were the themes of the characters having to learn to handle their problems their own way, taking advantage of their own strengths and thinking for themselves, such as how Korra decided to undo Wan's decision and how Tenzin learned to stop comparing himself to his father. Korra also became less attached to her identity as the avatar and decided to save the world for her own reasons as a human being, though that did lead to the Deus Ex Machina. There was also the theme of the spirituality of the world in modern times, which was addressed by Korra's development over the series of thinking a bit more before taking action and how Korra considered whether Unalaq had a point and decided to keep the spirit portal open. I'm expecting this theme to get developed even more in the next season as people start to have more regular interactions with spirits. Mako had a bit more character development than in the first season such as how Mako's loyalty to Republic City came before his loyalty to Korra and his job as a police officer led to him looking into Varrick's involvement in the bombing on his own, whereas in the first season he was mostly just saving the city to help Korra. Korra had some development of course (though I'm not really a fan of the way it was handled in the spirit world) and Tenzin had some pretty good character development, in my opinion. It had its issues, of course, but it was still much better than the first season.
