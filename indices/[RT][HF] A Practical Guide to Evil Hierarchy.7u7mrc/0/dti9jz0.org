Anaxares is quite possibly my favorite fucking insane character. He's been brainwashed/raised into believing all this servants and fancy living shit is awful, and then he's forced into it and it's driving him even crazier and it's so amazing to watch this train wreck in action.

He kind of reminds of of Worf. Worf was raised on stories of Klingon honor and followed them religiously, when it turned out the entire empire was super corrupt and he ended up being the only honorable one left. Poor Anaxares is the last true scion of Bellerophon.
