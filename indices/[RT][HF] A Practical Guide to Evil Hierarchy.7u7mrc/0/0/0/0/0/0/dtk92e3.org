But "jews control the world" is not a social value, it's a factual (for lack of a better word) statement. It is a statement that is fairly simply true or false. Believing that all men are equal on a moral level is an opinion, and that is by no means the same as a factual statement.

You could look at it this way: If Anaraxes existed in modern society, and started murdering monarchs because of his beliefs (which he probably wouldn't but you get the idea), and explained that he did this because he believes that all men are equal, he would be charged with murder and sent to prison just like any other political murderer. If someone starts murdering jews because he thinks they control the world and he is not ok with that, then it is very possible that he would not be put in prison, but instead be evaluated as insane, and sent off for treatment.
