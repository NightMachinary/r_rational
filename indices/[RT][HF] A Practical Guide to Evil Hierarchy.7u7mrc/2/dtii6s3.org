I like how Anaxares perfectly depicts the league of free cities. On the surface he is supposed to lead and coordinate them. To arbitrate their disputes and different ideologies.

But look deeper? At the end of the day, each city does as it wants and acts according to their beliefs. The Secretariats are confused that he does not answer their scrolls? They send a scroll to ask how to send scrolls. The Tyrant has "surrendered" his rule to the Hierarche but he rules nonetheless and the others now this.

The Nicea's wish his support? They give him a damn Palace. Bellerophon sends a diplomat without any power and a delegation of kanenas to follow the Hierarche. Stygia sends a magister to ask if he wishes slaves, the Atalantians go on about their crusade and righteousness and Penthes shows itself to be a rulership mess with many Exarch claimants (which is what Black did to disorganize the city and is also why we have seen so little of them).

And to make everything worse, Anaxares refuses to exert even the bare minimum of control he can. I'm reminded by Anaxares thoughts from the prologue:

  Named or not, one could not change the face of the Free Cities.

The League of /Free/ Cities stays free and true even if it "unites" under a ruler.

Edit: Spelling.
