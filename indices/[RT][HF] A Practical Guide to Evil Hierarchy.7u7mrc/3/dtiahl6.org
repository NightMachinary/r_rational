So, the guy whose Role is to be the neutral arbitrator of the group of cities that aren't able to cooperate does nothing to regulate their behavior and just lets them do whatever they want to. Seems to make sense. I wonder if his character development will further parallel the sociopolitical situation and relationships of said cities.
