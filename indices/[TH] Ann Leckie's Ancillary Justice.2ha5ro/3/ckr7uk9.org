As far as the gender thing, I think it's reasonable. It's specifically mentioned in the book that different cultures have significantly different gender markers, such as length of hair and such. Relatively, earth has a monoculture as far as gender signaling goes.

Also, to do what you said you would need a good set of tagged data. Maybe the AI has access to this, but maybe not. Also, as far as I can tell, the AI is an artificial mind, but not a computer. I don't think she has access to the computer-interface to her brain. I don't think she can just write code and run it on herself, if that makes sense.
