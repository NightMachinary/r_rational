We happen to be living in a time and place where people will consistently and for free run around and tag themselves in their own data which they will generate and upload to the internet for free and in such huge quantities that we have major difficulties processing it all. Perhaps this has biased me and my perceptions.

There are a lot of plausible explanations about the gender thing (ex: her programmers specifically programmed the inability/lack in to help alienate her from most major non-Radch societies and keep her distinctly Radch; or her programmers didn't care and did no real work and the AI has no ability to do such work herself; or there is far greater cultural balkanization in the far future and everything didn't descend into melting pot monocultures as the modern day seems to be doing (in spite of all the e.g. plot points about how e.g. Radch Station AI or Mianaai would recognize the habits and behaviours of one specific planet and detect fakery, and the plot points about Radch culture remaining largely invariant over a millenial timespan in spite of supposedly absorbing and being changed by constant annexation); or maybe all the computer science people were eaten by Grues in 2050 and their knowledge lost to the ages forever, or slightly more plausibly there's been some sort of Butlerian Jihad against computers and comp-sci like in Dune everywhere except the Radch military because they want to maintain a monopoly on thinking machines, and the Radch have a tiny cadre of programmers who design for the military and stations but do not innovate and do not allow their creations to mould or change themselves.

There are /lots/ of really good possible explanations one can make up; the lack of picking a /good/ one (and instead rolling with 'every AI is mysteriously no good at this one specific task that it probably would help them to be good at, and furthermore they've been bad at this for literally thousands of years of experience and practice, and finally the specific task is one natural humans have done forever and also have in the real world developed computers to do back in the previous decade') therefore offends me. It's not a dealbreaker, but the specifics of the plot point bother me.
