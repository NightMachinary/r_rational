I blogged about the book soon after I read it, [[http://www.deathisbadblog.com/themes-in-ancillary-justice/][here]]. I'm kinda unsure about etiquette at this point. Do I just leave the link here? Or should I post the entire text as a comment? It's pretty long, but I want to engage people on it, and I assume anyone reading this subreddit would rather comment on it here than at my blog. Suggestions?

(note that the post has spoilers of the entire book)
