  There's no following chapter for seasons 9 or 10 because there was no massive stupidity in there to mock. I think there were four or five mockable episodes that I never wrote up, but check this out: Ten /years/ of this show, 213 episodes, and I can count on one hand the number of episodes worthy of mockery. (Granted, I can count on my fingers in binary.)

That's up to, what, 63 episodes? That's 30%.

Eh, still better than most shows.
