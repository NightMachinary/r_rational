Max of 31 on one hand, actually. (1-2-4-8-16 from thumb to pinky.) Point being, the ten chapters that I did, plus 3-5 others that I could have but didn't, and that was it for really stupid episodes. Sure, there were a few moments of non-brilliance here and there in other episodes, but none of them were so big or so frequent within a single episode that they deserved a chapter.
