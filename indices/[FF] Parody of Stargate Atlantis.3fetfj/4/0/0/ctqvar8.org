Most of their solutions feel a little Deus Ex Machina-ey, too, like how they magically adapt to the Asgard beaming nukes tech they had never seen before (Ancients didn't have it) just in time to make that fight still plot important.

That and the fact that the Ancients are the most [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors][Neglectful of all of the Neglectful Precursor races in fiction.]]

They're so bad, that that TvTropes entry has a whole subcategory /just for Stargate SG-1/. They make the race that invented the Mass Effect Reapers look calm and forward thinking.

I think almost every major plot point and doomsday device in the series is in one way or another based on the utter incompetence of the Ancients:

- Goa'uld salvaged Ancient Tech and used Stargates.
- Dakara Superweapon
- Anything to do with Time Travel ruining everything.
- Replicators
- Project Arcturus
- Serita (The creepy Ascended stalker guy's world).
- The Wraith - created, lost to, then didn't smite the shit out of when they enabled godmode.
- DNA Resequencers left lying around, allowed Anubis to Ascend.
- Anubis lies in order to get ascension, gets sent back as immortal superbeing with knowledge of Ancient Tech. Daniel gets ascension through heroic sacrifice, does more heroic sacrifice, gets depowered and dumped naked and amnesiatic in front of his friends. We're getting into abuse here.
- Hallowed are the Ori.
- Speaking of which, Prior Plague, Supergates, psionic powers and the San'Graal. Plus the universal brain washing machine.
- Everything that happens in Destiny, if that show had ever happened, which it obviously did not.

  So, the prosecution suggests we extend the verdict to Guilty, guilty, hypocritical Lawful Stupid Energy Being scumbags. Thankfully, the Ancients turned out to be so neglectful they actually left behind the keys to creating the sangra'al, a device capable of destroying themselves. All in favor of capital punishment?
