  So what? You've failed to present any single reason why I should care.
#+end_quote

Ah, I'm sorry, I was assuming those were already agreed.

You should care because enthusiastic authors are more productive than sad ones. I guess I wouldn't care about the output of an /irredeemably awful/ author, but hey, Erfworld Part I happened once, I could see Rob Balder pulling it off again someday.

You should also care for standard human empathy reasons. Happiness is good, misery is bad, "do unto others as they would have you do unto them plus an extra 10% kindness to account for modelling errors" etc.

  If the author will take every criticism personally, that's a fault with your hypothetical - and ridiculously sheltered - author.

I'm saying it doesn't matter who's "at fault". You have control over your own actions, not about the personality and decisions of others, so you should do the actions that will lead to good outcomes given what you predict other people will do.
