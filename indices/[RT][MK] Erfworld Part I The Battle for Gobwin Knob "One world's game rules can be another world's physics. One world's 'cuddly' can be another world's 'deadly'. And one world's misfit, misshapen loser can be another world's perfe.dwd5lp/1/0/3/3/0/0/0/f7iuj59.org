  There's nothing wrong with criticism of a story's flaws, the problem here is in the delivery. "The art is awful" is low value criticism delivered without much apparent thought or insight.

Would you also ask someone to tone it down if they said "The art is great". Because that is exactly as valuable and contains exactly as much apparent thought or insight.

I'd argue that while remarks like these (positive or negative) would be even more valuable if they went into greater depth, they are still valuable as-is. They still help me form an opinion about a story.

There's strength is numbers too. If everybody had to write at least 10 pages of detailed analysis before being allowed to post an opinion, the numbers of opinions we'd see would be extremely limited.

In other words: While the value of such criticisms may be low, it is still positive. While it is good to encourage more detailed criticisms, simply asking people to stop altogether doesn't increase utility, it decreases it.

  and it certainly wouldn't be constructive to the person who did the drawing

  Good negative criticism is important, especially to newer authors but framing the delivery can make a huge difference.

I think you're barking up the wrong tree here. Story recommendations, or dis-recommendations, aren't aimed at the author. They are aimed at potential readers. The author already knows their own story, and if they are looking for writing advice they are in the wrong place, there are other threads for that.
