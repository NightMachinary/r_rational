  Authors are going to seek discussions of their works, and be hurt by some of them; that's just a fact about the world.

So what? You've failed to present any single reason why I should care.

  You have to consider the predictable consequences of your actions, even when those consequences are also caused by other people's (predictable) mistakes.

If the author will take every criticism personally, that's a fault with your hypothetical - and ridiculously sheltered - author.

The argument for... Sorry, my english fails me, all I can say is 'coddling' is... baffling, really. People have the right to give and receive honest criticism. We're doing a disservice to authors and ourselves by treating 'potential encounters' with authors as if I was making fun of a 5 year old's scribbles.
