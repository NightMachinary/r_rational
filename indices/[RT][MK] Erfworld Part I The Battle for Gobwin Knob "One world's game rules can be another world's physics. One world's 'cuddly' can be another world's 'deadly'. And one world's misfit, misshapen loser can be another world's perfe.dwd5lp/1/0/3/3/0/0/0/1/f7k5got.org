  In other words: While the value of such criticisms may be low, it is still positive. While it is good to encourage more detailed criticisms, simply asking people to stop altogether doesn't increase utility, it decreases it.

I didn't ask anyone to stop. I said:

  There are better ways to say the things that you're saying.

Replying to your other point:

#+begin_quote
  I think you're barking up the wrong tree here. Story recommendations, or dis-recommendations, aren't aimed at the author. They are aimed at potential readers. The author already knows their own story, and if they are looking for writing advice they are in the wrong place, there are other threads for that.

It won't be the case for this particular story, but authors definitely do read whatever is posted here about their stories, sometimes because it's mentioned in a comment, sometimes because they track back a spike in traffic, and sometimes because they posted the story themselves. I think a general principle should be that you should speak about /anyone's/ work as though they were a real person on the other end of a keyboard somewhere in the world. You don't need to not say negative things, but if you're going to say negative things, then you should try to be kind about it.

So yes, I hold negative criticism to a slightly higher standard. I probably wouldn't have mentioned anything here given the above comment, but it strikes me as the unpleasant, needless negativity that I would rather not have in the community, especially when set beside similar comments that don't have the same stink.
