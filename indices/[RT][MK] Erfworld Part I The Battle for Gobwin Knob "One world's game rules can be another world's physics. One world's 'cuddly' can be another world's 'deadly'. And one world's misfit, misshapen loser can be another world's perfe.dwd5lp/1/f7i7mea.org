/Erfworld/ is the story of Parson Gotti, a typical loser protagonist with a dead-end job and a dump of a home who is obsessed with tabletop wargames. One day he gets isekai'd to Erfworld by Wanda Firebaugh, a spellcaster in the city of Gobwin Knob, as a last resort attempt to stave off defeat at the hands of the Royal Crown Coalition. Luckily for Parson, it turns out that the physics of Erfworld run like a tabletop wargame, so his expertise is exactly what is needed. /Unluckily/ for Parson, he has never played this particular system before, and the coalition's armies outnumber Gobwin Knob's 25 to 1. Now he must quickly learn the rules and find as many exploits as he can if he is to have any chance of fulfilling his role as the perfect warlord.

/Erfworld/ was been brough up on LessWrong twice. Eliezer Yudkowsky read it after hearing it compared to /HPMoR/ and declared that, while not exactly rationalist ficiton, /Erfworld/ was Munchkin fiction, which is close enough that I think deserves to be posted. Unfortunately, as discussed in those links, /Erfworld/ jumps the shark /hard/ after the first volume. Hence why the title only refers to part 1; that's the only part I'm recommending. In fact, I'd avise against even reading the epilogue to book 1; [[http://web.archive.org/web/20190720093819/http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf.html][the comic's original run]] on /Giant in the Playground/ ended with Parson throwing the sword into the volcano after declaring his intent to be a player, and I think that's the perfect place to finish things. Just let it end on a high note.
