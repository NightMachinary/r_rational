As a point of pedantry:

"Will not be completed" is overstating what the author has said. It's been "permanently discontinued as a webcomic," which does leave open the possibility of it being revived and completed as a print comic, or as something else.

From the page you linked:

  - Future updates (should they occur) will be accessible only by Date-a-mancy [to our extended family of supporters and friends]
  - Future books (should they be made) will be published and sold by traditional channels
#+end_quote

That said, "will not be completed" does seem to be the most likely outcome.
