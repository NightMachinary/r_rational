As OP mentions, there were a lot of changes in direction, tone and focus after Book I. While I still enjoyed Book II, my interest in Erfworld overall faded with time.

I kind of understand why this all happened. I think the intent was always that the main story-line of Parson Gotti was intended to be a comic. With the loss of the original (super talented!) artist and trouble recruiting another, it became hard to continue. So the author instead turned to some of the other characters, filling in their backstory (hinted at in the original storyline) to try to keep the content production going, and giving the fans a reason to stay interested (and keep subscriptions going).
