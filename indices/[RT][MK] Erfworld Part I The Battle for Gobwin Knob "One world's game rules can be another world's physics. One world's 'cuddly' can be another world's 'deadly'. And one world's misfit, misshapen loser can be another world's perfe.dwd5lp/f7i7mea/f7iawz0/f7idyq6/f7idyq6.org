- As early as book 2, the "comic" becomes a text novel with occasional comic pages.
- The art for book 3 is awful.
- The story keeps introducing ever more characters I don't give a shit about.
- The plot slows down to a crawl; Parson takes 80 pages to get through one goddamn door.
- The metafictional angle gets dropped.

Need I go on?
