There are lots of small and medium sized problems as the story moves on. But there were two parts that seemed like big problems to me. One problem with is that Parson becomes increasingly aware of the atrocity of war, but his motivation is not explored after that. He embarks on a campaign that destroys entire kingdoms, and brings them back mind-controlled. And his motivations and doubts are never really explored. He destroys the sword, and then acts exactly as he would if the sword were still around. We don't really see the main antagonist's motivations either, and we really need to even if Parson doesn't.

The other is that entire arcs seem superfluous. The Olive Branch story, the Transylvito Arc, and the latest stories just don't seem necessary. I really enjoyed the one with the Hippiemancer talking about language, but as an editor I would cut the lot and tell him to publish supplemental materials later.
