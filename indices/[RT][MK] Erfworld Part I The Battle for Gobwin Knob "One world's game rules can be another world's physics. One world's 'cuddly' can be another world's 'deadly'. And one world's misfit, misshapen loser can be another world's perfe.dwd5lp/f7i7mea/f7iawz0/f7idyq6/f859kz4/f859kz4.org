The world-building and concept were great. This is an isekai game world with an actual hex map, turn enforcement, production mechanics, and so on. It had enormous promise to start with.

Fate shenanigans and mechanics that were kept obscure from the readers resulted in a series of deus ex machina plot developments. The story became increasingly frustrating to read, especially as additional characters and settings were introduced without original plotlines being resolved.

There were some occasional moments of heroism and brilliance. This webcomic had a lot of potential.
