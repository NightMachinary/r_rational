  I think a general principle should be that you should speak about anyone's work as though they were a real person on the other end of a keyboard somewhere in the world. You don't need to not say negative things, but if you're going to say negative things, then you should try to be kind about it.

If a potential author is going to be hurt by a innocuous commentary such as 'The art sucks' or 'The art is awful' I suggest he steps outside of any place which could criticize his work.

People don't deserve to have their feelings 'respected' to this ludricrous extent. How should he have phrased it, pray tell:

'The artist tried really hard, and he is a good person, but the art was shy of my unrealistic expectations.'? 'He accomplished something, and that's better than doing nothing, but alas, the art is awful'?

Besides, the authors need to learn to separate criticism of their work and criticism of themselves.

I'm sure Brandon Sanderson is a swell guy, and has a great work ethic - But his books are just terrible. His worlds are inconsistent, his protagonists, in anime fashion, make other team members redundant, and people who praise him for 'internally consistent magic' ignore the asspull magic powers that save his MC's ass as the plot requires.

Did I hurt his feelings? Or did I gave a unfavorable opinion on his work? Should I have cushioned my criticism in faint praise as in - 'Man, he would make a great D&D dm, for all the morality in his world, despite all it's differences, still maintains a close resemblance to ours so you could play around in it, and not worry about the icky parts of social dynamics he ignores?'
