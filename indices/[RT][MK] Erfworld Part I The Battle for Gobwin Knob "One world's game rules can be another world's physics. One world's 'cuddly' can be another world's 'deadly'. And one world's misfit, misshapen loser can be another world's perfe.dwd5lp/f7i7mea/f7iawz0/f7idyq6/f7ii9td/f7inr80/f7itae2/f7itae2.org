There's nothing wrong with criticism of a story's flaws, the problem here is in the delivery. "The art is awful" is low value criticism delivered without much apparent thought or insight. It /barely/ informs the reader whether or not they'll think likewise, and it certainly wouldn't be constructive to the person who did the drawing. Similarly, the tone isn't what I want from negative criticism.

Some of /my/ takeaway from that meta thread:

  Maybe this post could be described as, "criticism tends to skew negative so try to adopt a moderate positivity bias to counteract that when writing critique"? Good negative criticism is important, especially to newer authors but framing the delivery can make a huge difference.
