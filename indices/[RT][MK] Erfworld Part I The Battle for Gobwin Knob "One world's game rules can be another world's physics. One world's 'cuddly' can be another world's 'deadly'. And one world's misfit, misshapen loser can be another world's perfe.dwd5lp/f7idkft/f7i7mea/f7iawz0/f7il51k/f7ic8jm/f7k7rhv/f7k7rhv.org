Book one is a single scenario with a narrow scope and pretty clearly defined stakes and characters. There's a big moment at the end that feels earned and properly led up to.

Books two and up have a lot of play and counter-play, but it's never clear that any of it means anything or is actually working towards anything. There are so many moving parts that there aren't 'big moments' anymore so much as just the resolution to whatever the current crisis is.

And boy there are a lot of different crises going on, all at the same time.
