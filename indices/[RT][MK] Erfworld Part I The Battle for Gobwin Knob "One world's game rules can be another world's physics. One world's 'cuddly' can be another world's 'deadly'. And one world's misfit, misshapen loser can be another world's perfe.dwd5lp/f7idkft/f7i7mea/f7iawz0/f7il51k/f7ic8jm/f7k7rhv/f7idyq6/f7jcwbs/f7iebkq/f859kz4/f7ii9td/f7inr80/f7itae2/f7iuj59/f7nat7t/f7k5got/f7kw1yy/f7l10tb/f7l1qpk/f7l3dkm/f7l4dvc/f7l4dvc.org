  You should also care for standard human empathy reasons. Happiness is good, misery is bad, "do unto others as they would have you do unto them plus an extra 10% kindness to account for modelling errors" etc.

I would be offended if I was treated with such kid gloves to what shoddy artwork I produce. Seems /you/ are unable to understand the difference between criticism of one's work and one's self.

This is patronizing, and absolutely infuriating. I'm not a child who needs to be coddled from the world, and I wouldn't treat anyone like one.

So, I'm gonna say it here - the world owes you nothing but harsh lessons. Adjust your expectations accordingly and you'll grow, or don't and you won't.

  I'm saying it doesn't matter who's "at fault". You have control over your own actions, not about the personality and decisions of others, so you should do the actions that will lead to good outcomes given what you predict other people will do.

If I produce something, it's out in the world. 'Because I feel really bad' is not at all a reason why it should be shielded from criticism. Grow up. Get a thicker skin. Learn to roll with the punches and improve. Otherwise, you'll become the worst kind of delusional artist.
