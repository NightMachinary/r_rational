I'm actually kinda annoyed the forums are gone. That was where I first found my taste for webfiction, where I got linked to the Wandering Inn off of someone's fanfic, and ultimately why I started writing my own work. Erfworld and its community were hugely influential to my creative life.

I understand that the decision to pull the forum from public use is their call, certainly, but I do still wish they hadn't. Even if only just to make all the amusing fanfic stories public.
