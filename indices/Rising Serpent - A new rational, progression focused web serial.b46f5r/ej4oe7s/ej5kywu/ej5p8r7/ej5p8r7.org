Some grammer errors I noticed: Needs a space between wore and he: "Myr recognised it as being identical to the one that Vell wore.He surmised she must be another of these “Five Spears of the School” Vell had mentioned." (Ch 6) Needs period: "He didn't like the comparison between him and a Lord either, the last thing he wanted was to have any common ground with the Serpent Lord" I'm enjoying the story so far!
