I'm really enjoying what you've posted so far. I like the little nods to the tropes; through moments where it's made clear that you know how these stories normally go, and that it's not going to go that way. I'm not sure it needs to stay so on the nose forever, but in the first few chapters it's good to see that it's not going to be that sort of story.
