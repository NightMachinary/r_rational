I'm late to the party here but I thought I'd add my two cents for what it's worth.

I've read through to chapter 5 and come away with a strong impression. I love the system but I'm disappointed at how rapid fire it was revealed.

We cut from the protagonist's very short childhood to their already extreme competence inside of the first couple of paragraphs. I'm here for the growth, why did you cut it out?

I get that the big bad is meant to be much more powerful still, but without a concrete demonstration of HOW much more powerful I've only got the protagonist's word for it.

On top of this the protagonist hasn't really got a character except for 'revenge'. Which was a little dull and unsympathetic even when the Count of Monte Cristo did it. It's certainly very passionate but I don't understand anything else about the character other than that he's very angry.

Finally the dialogue. Everyone talks like they're writing a letter. 'Um' and 'ah' and 'er' are part of how people talk. I understand that the style of speech is meant to be old fashioned, but old fashioned speech still had slang and misunderstandings etc. It's jarring for a dirty child and a bodyguard in a poor district to engage in witty repartee.

I'm sorry to be so negative about this. I find this story particularly frustrating because it's so close to being something I could fall in love with. The chi system is fun and has potential for lots of clever trickery. I wish you the best with your writing.
