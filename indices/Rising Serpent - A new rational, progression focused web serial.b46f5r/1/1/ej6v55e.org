I only know of a few OEL Xianxia to recommend:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/][White Collar Cultivator]] was pretty good with an everyman character isekaied into a generic wuxia world and with him digging into the mental differences between mortals and cultivators. He's basically using common-sense and his mastery over bureaucracy to stay alive. Unfortunately, WCC is dead so you might not like the abrupt ending.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]] is a fantastic story about a man from Earth who seeks out to scientifically investigate Qi and wants to completely rebuild cultivation society into one where everyone isn't back-stabbing each other all the time. Ends up spending a lot of time with him torturing....er....teaching his (involuntary) disciples.
