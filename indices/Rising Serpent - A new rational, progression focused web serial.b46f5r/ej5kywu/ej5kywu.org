Nice. I see you are writing about a chapter an hour, I did some quick math and [[https://xkcd.com/605/][in a few days you will have a standard length novel ready!]]

Looking forward to reading a rational progression fic, I like the idea of the genre but everything I've read so far has been either passable (Cradle, Sufficiently advanced magic) or had absolutely atrocious writing quality (Everybody loves large chests, Savage Divinity, and (shudders) the Legend of Randidly Ghosthound.

Any non-translations you'd recommend?
