Between /themselves/ Rellagia has a gentleman's agreement not to use Awakened in their militaries. But that doesn't mean that they can't use Awakened to defend against someone using Awakened to attack them. They may well have an Awakened Defense Force in waiting, for just such a contingency.

.../and/ they probably have agreements with each other that, no matter the situation between themselves at the time, the moment an outsider tries to use Awakened in a military conflict without Cause, well, then that's Cause for /all/ of their Awakened Defense Forces to /hammer/ on the aggressor who broke the rules.
