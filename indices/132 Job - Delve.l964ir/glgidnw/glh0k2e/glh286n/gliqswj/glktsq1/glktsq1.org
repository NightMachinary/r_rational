Oh, yeah. This whole not-using-Awakened-in-wars agreement sounds to me like something that can only happen between countries who are friends, and who only ever deploy their armies in the country-wide equivalent of brief sparring matches - that is, they'll all march out, yell at each other a bit, deal some survivable injuries to the other guys, then the generals all get together, decide who 'won' and make any appropriate minor tweaks to the official borders.

It's /not/ the sort of agreement you make with anyone who is /not/ a friend.
