while i think the chapter itself was well written, unless something comes directly from this it'd be more suited to an extra side-chapter like in PGTE. Then again idk if EE has a full-time job like SS does, and if so idk how much free time each has. (even if all were equal, can't fault someone for not writing faster than they're able)
