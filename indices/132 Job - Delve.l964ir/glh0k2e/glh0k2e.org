Lovely chapter, but I do hope Rain-King and Amelia-Queen plus Ivan are keeping close by. Though they actually don't have enough firepower to protect the camp as well. Gar, Brovosi and Mr. Drill-a-man-from-behind could take the whole team out in five seconds.

And the whole Ascension camp in a minute. Not that they have been given reason to escalate but if they feel backed in a corner/threaten/shamed, they can blast their way thru all of them without Amelia to stop them. (and Amelia is currently optimized for static D against monsters)

They have an imperfect read on them. But Brovosi was the first person to instantly deduce that Rain must be a dynamo, because of his language acquisition, can see thru Ivan and doesn't even care to hide that fact. Rain's standoffish approach was foolish, he should just be inviting them over for drinks and make friends.

I don't really see how Rellagia could get by with unawakened formations and is not already conquered by the Empire. Exponential power scaling makes this seem not feasible.
