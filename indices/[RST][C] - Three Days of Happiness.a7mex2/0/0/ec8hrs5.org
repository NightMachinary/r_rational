vgperson is one of the most quality and prolific translators/authors I've seen, which the readability of this story attests to. I haven't read all of their works, but everything I have is excellent. [[http://vgperson.com/][Their homepage has links to everything else they've done]], probably the most well known of which are the translations of the horror games Ib and The Witch's House.
