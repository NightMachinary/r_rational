You can play Goat Format on Dueling Network, all you need to do is go to Unlimited and advertise for Goat Format, and people will show up in a couple minutes. But there is definitely not much variety in that format, there are like 3 competitive decks and 70% of those decks are the same.

As for your problem, I don't think it's much of a problem. Why? Because, in the anime it's plainly apparent that people can manipulate the probability of their draws. Therefore, decks that would normally be unviable, become viable. Why would a character not simply use the most well constructed deck at any given time? Simple, if you want the Heart of the Cards to work for you, you need to be using a deck that you genuinely love, not just the most competitive one. Something like that.
