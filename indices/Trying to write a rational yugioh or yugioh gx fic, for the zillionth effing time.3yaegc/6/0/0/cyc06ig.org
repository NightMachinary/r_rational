I'm just gonna say that your problem doesn't feel like a problem that can be solved with a fanfic, of all things to try to solve it with.

  And trying to create a fictional metagame that's actually fun is like fantasizing over a game that doesn't and will never exist.

Have you tried it? Game design can be fun! Of course if you don't try to create it, it'll never exist. Same goes for fics, though; it's not like any fic you write is going to overthrow the dominant paradigm of YGO meta or anything, so...?

  Since I don't enjoy the real life game in the ridiculously broken form it has been constantly forced into since the very beginning, it's hard to be enthusiastic about a version of the game that I would really like if I could actually try it in real life, but can't try in real life.

Again: it REALLY sounds like what you want to do isn't write a story, what you want to do is design a game.

So... design a game, then? It's honestly NOT that hard to come up with a game more balanced than YGO, because you, unlike Konami, are not constrained by market forces demanding that you make molochian tradeoffs of fun for profitability. Seriously, give it a shot!

That said, there's definitely something interesting to be said for the fact that literally every single person you EVER meet in the yugioh anime has their own archetype. No realistic card game could possibly be so diverse; there's definitely something going on with that. Maybe it's worth exploring? Maybe in your version of the setting, people create their own cards and just get the cards verified and encoded into the game by some sort of superintelligence-equivalent-entity that lives in the duel monsters dimension, who's responsible for maintaining competitive balance?
