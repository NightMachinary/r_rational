In the show, the rich people carry away all the victories as well (why else is Kaiba the champion?). The only way the protagonists can beat them is by the power of magic, or through rare cards they acquired via special circumstances. The original show's protagonist admits at the end that he is straight up cheating every game via magic. Add to that the fact that people regularly create cards to personally benefit themselves...

It's also clear that you have a strong personal dislike of the actual yugioh community and don't perceive any skill in the actual game you're trying to write a fic about. As such, what kind of skill are you hoping to see in your protagonists? The original "king of games" regularly exploited the rules rather than used skill to win challenges; you might want a game where out of the box exploits are more possible, perhaps a game where some degree of real action is important like the "entertainment duels" of Arc-V.
