After extensive brainstorming and countless scrapped ideas, I've come to the conclusion that Mage Wars probably just doesn't work for a rational yugioh fic. I've thought about what you said. I think the idea of the rational protagonist who realized that the game isn't that great might work for a rational Yugioh 5d's fic, but that isn't the story that I was hoping to write. In other words, I'm still stuck at the drawing board.

I recently found out about a custom yugioh format called "Newgioh" which looks really awesome, and much more balanced and fun. I don't know how long it's been out or how easy or difficult it would be to find opponents for it though.

I'm also starting to wonder if part of the issue I was having trying to use Mage Wars is that LCG's just don't fit with the story of Yugioh, because asymmetric access to cards is perhaps a fundamental part of the series world-building and characterizations. After all, each character has at least one or more key cards that represents their personalities and their playstyles. If everyone had access to Dark Magician or Blue Eyes White Dragon, then the roles of Yugi and Kaiba in the story might be kinda different. I don't know.

Ideally I would prefer character express their personalities through their strategies and playstyles, and not just the thematic flavor of their cards. But then it becomes a problem trying to explain why characters don't try out other kinds of strategies more often. Why is the only character in the series who uses 7 different decks Sebastian from Yugioh Gx? Why does Kaiba only use strategies that heavily feature dragons, especially the blue eyes white dragon? It would be one thing if dragons were his favorite kind of strategy, but for it to be the only kind of strategy he likes at all just seems like really really unrealistic characterization. Unfortunately, it seems pretty hard to disentangle yugioh characters from their decks. If Kaiba made and played a no-dragon deck even once, and he enjoyed it even a little bit, it would not be Kaiba.

So I'm still stuck. The general idea of the kind of story I want to write is in my head, it's just that whenever I try to fill in the details it turns into something else or falls apart. I'm hoping to write a rational adventure story in the style of card game animes like yugioh or cardfight vanguard, either as a retelling of yugioh or as something else, but without magical luck-manipulation like the Heart of the Cards or Psyqualia, and with realistic characters who have the freedom to experiment with different decks and are allowed to like more than just their favorite strategies. And whatever game ends up being used for the story, I want it to be one that is more skill based than luck based, and more skill based than money-based. And I don't want the game to be just a plot device, because if it's only a plot device than it's hard to justify having things boil down to a game-based showdown.

One of the other problems with realistic characterizations for this sort of story is that real people who play games like magic and yugioh and Mage Wars at a competitive level /barely talk while they play/. They're so engrossed in the game that there's no room for actually talking to your opponent during the game, because that would be distracting. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to make a no-talking game be exciting or dramatic enough. Imagine what the duel between Yugi and Pegasus in season 1 of yugioh would be like if the duelists didn't speak at all during the duel. Or the duel between Yugi and Yami Yugi at the end of season 5. I'm not sure it would be boring per se, but it would be a lot less dramatic and probably less interesting.

I'm really not sure what to do at this point. I really want to write this story, but I've been getting stuck on this countless times in the past year or two, and it's gotten really REALLY frustrating.
