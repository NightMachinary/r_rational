Wow. I totally forgot about summoner wars and battlecon! And even if you take into account that some of those are expansions and not core sets, that sale also cuts the prices of all the more expensive games nearly in half. I'm really glad to know there are other options now, and I'm not sure why or how I forgot about summoner wars and battlecon. As far as I know, when mage wars first came out in 2012 it was the only game that fit that criteria, but it's been 3 years since then and I failed to update after seeing Summoner Wars, because I wasn't paying enough attention, I guess? I stand corrected. Thank you!
