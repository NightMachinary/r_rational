I don't know much about yu gi oh but if the metagame had to evolve to get to a certain point, you could take sort of a diachronic approach and have the characters in the story invent the decks that have shaped the metagame in real life.

I also think it would be interesting to think about what the heart of the cards is. Maybe the weird machines they use to play in the anime have a component that is receptive to brainwaves like an EEG and can be hacked by them. People have no idea but the machines have been selected to be more receptive to certain brainwaves over generations because the duelists are superstitious, so they pass them over to their kids and build the new ones similarly to the "lucky" ones they've seen. People who build the "lucky" machines get to transmit their technique after a legendary duelist topdecked with them, etc.

So the machines have been naturally selected so that thinking thoughts about wizards will make one draw wizards, etc. It isn't reliable but certain "modes of thoughts" (like good thoughts, maybe) are more efficient.

I dunno, maybe everyone figures it out and the new meta you talk about is the one where everyone always draws whatever they want ? Dunno how well it would work in yu gi oh but it makes me think of the three card blind format in magic : the gathering.
