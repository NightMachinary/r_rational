Firstly, you do not need to have the card game be fully rational. There is something enticing about a protagonist who is the only person to figure out that the card game sucks and shouldn't have this big a place in society. I mean, a game like monopoly is really lacking in fun, but everyone plays it because it's a cultural phenomenon. Someone who loves Dual Monsters would want to fix the problems, but would keep running into walls as other people shun the very idea of changing the rules.

One of the big differences between the Yugioh TCG and the game in the show, is just how rare cards are. Kaiba is willling to search the whole world for a Blue-eyes white dragon. We got one in every starter deck. The anime makes a lot more sense when you realise that people spend most of their adult lives finding cards to complete their decks. Professionals keep track of all new cards and are sure to travel to distant tournements if they offer up specific cards. Ordinary folk just visit their local game shops. Kind of like rebuilding a vintage car.

The real life trading card game has also really changed over the years as more cards have been added to combine. The original starter decks consisted mostly of normal monsters. The dragon deck was strong because, if you had a Lord of D. on the field (ATK 1200, DEF 1100) and activated the magic card flute of sumoning dragons, you can special summon two dragons from your hand. In other words, you'd need four cards to pull of this strategy, two of which are pretty useless outside of it. Summoning Exodia is a matter of being patient and very lucky.

When I started playing Yugioh on the DS (nightmare troubadour), a lot more interesting strategies became available and you see a lot more interesting decks. Using cards like Level Limit Area B or Gravity Bind to keep anyone from attacking, in combination with using Needle Worms to empty another's deck, Flame Princess to deal lifepoint damage while healing, or use toons to attack through your enemy's monsters. You should only have a few cards that you NEED for your strategy, trying to build in redundancies. Excodia is summoned by keeping your deck limited to 40 cards, stalling well, and having a few back up cards in case some Excodia parts are destroyed.

When I picked up Yugioh 5ds, the whole game had changed again. Three times as many cards as before. Very strong decks include lightsworn monsters (easy to summon creatures that hit hard and fast) or batteries where you can get three 3000 ATK monsters on the field with a few easy moves. Insane redundancies have become the norm, with synchro monsters being a clear example. Basically, you have monsters with a 'synchro' subtype. If they're on the field, you can combine monsters and look only at their levels. Synchro a lvl 4 and lvl 3 monster to get a lvl 7 monster. It's basically a more general form of fusion. Summoning Excodia involves deck suicide, only putting cards in your deck if they can lower the amount of non-Exodia cards in your deck. Like three copies of Toon Table of Content, which you can all retrieve in a single turn as long as you have one.

The biggest change I'd make to the game, for fanfiction, is to remove all explanation text from the cards. Duelists simply have to know/memorise what each card does or figure it out by experimentation. That makes it a lot more difficult to play with somebody else's deck and explains why people tend to stick to the cards they know.

Also, a side deck is pretty essential.

Soooo.... I really like Yugioh. Both the anime and the real life game. If you want to discuss anything game related, you're always free to DM me.
