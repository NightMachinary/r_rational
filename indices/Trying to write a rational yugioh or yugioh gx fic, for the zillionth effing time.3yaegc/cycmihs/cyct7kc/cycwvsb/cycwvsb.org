There's also the entire Fantasy Flight Games' "Living Card Game" lineup, much of which is actually quite good. It's not "buy one core set and you're good forever" cheap, but it's not Magic either. I would gladly read an Android:Netrunner manga, with all the bluffing, out-thinking, and difficult decisions. (Though not an A:N novel, for the aforementioned reasons.)
