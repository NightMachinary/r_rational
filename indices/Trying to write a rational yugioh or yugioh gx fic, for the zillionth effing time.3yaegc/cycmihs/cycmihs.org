  Unfortunately, there are ONLY TWO tabletop customizable strategy card games that exist which aren't ridiculously expensive to play competitively and where player skill actually matters

Not that I would suggest using a real card game; that was just my gut reaction. It is very hard to make a comic about strictly-defined boardgames, because of the pace and barrier to entry, and considerably harder to write a novel about it, because of the lack of visual aids to track game state.

YuGiOh the early anime & manga effectively played like a squad tactics game, with victory defined [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewRulesAsThePlotDemands][not by clear-cut rules]] but by whether your mecha-gorrilla's armour can protect him from my acid rain long enough for it to topple my demonic monolith. Pokemon with card game trappings. That seems much easier to write and much more entertaining to read.
