Go the opposite direction. From what I understand, the heart of the cards is supposed to be similar to Spiral Energy in that it rewards duelists that "believe". So make your story /actually/ rational, rather than /mostly/ rational in a way that confirms expectations, and examine the Heart of the Cards as claimed. Is there really such a thing? If so, why has nobody seriously examined it or questioned it? How does it work? For the love of Bayes, /why/? And, finally, how do I use it to win, maybe not just in the game? The existence of such a thing implies some very odd things about the cosmology, especially if you're using shuffled decks instead of some kind of randomizer. Why would someone that can pull that kind of crap be sitting around doing it to /card games/?

As for the game, I think I agree with [[/u/storybookknight]]. Change things to make the game fun. Same way the anime did it, same way MoR declared that things like the fidelias charm didn't exist, that kind of thing.
