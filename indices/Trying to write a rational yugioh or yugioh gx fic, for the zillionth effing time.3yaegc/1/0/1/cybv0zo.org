That's fair. I think the anime skates by by simply not having enough space with which to actually show enough cards for it to have a metagame that can be analyzed and outdone by the fans.

Another option is to take a meta from a few years or decades ago rather than using the current meta. Might require some archaeology. For example, if I were running a similar thing with MtG, I'd probably restrict myself to a meta from back before Urza's because it seems like the meta hasn't dipped back below turn-4 kills since then.
