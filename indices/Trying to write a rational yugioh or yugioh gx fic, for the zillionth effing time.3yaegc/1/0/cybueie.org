But that then leaves the issue of making up a completely new metagame from scratch. Metagames can be very complicated, and making up an entirely new one might not be feasible if I'm trying to make it in any way realistic whatsoever.

Then again, Mage Wars Academy, while lacking in diversity, might not be too difficult to conceptualize a fictional metagame around. But that doesn't have heart of the cards. In fact it doesn't even have shuffling. All cards in your deck are accessible at any time in Mage Wars Academy.

To be honest, I'm not sure I actually /can/ answer all those questions about the heart of the cards. If such a thing exists, the only possible explanation I have been able to think of so far is that the matrix lord likes to play card games, and when they discovered the existence of sapient beings in their simulation, the matrix lord created some special algorithms for one of the card games that humans created which the matrix lord liked, in order to spice things up. But that seems really narratively unsatisfying. Especially since if the matrix lord is smart enough to even make and mess with a simulated universe like that in the first place, they should be smart enough to put in a better game. If they don't like how much of an impact luck would otherwise have on the one true children's card game, why wouldn't they just create a better one true children's card game where luck doesn't have as much impact, and insert that into the simulation, rather than creating a patch to fix the luck factor (the heart of the cards)?
