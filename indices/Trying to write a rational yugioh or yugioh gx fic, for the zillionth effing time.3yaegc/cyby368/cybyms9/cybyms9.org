1. retelling of yugioh gx with a rational Jaden Yuki as the protagonist.

2. retelling of the original duel monsters series with a rational yugi as the protagonist

3. A Mage Wars story similar to Cardfight Vanguard with a coherent version of the ability "psyqualia", covering three or four "seasons":

   I: a Duelist Kingdom-ish arc

   II: a "Battle City"-ish arc

   III: the part where the main characters go to Etheria (that's the world Mage Wars takes place in)

   IV: I was thinking this would be the concluding season in which the events of the first three seasons are resolved. In my head I was originally imagining this as Etheria and Earth are on the verge of war, but war is averted at the last moment by a representative of our world playing the card game version of Mage Wars against a representative from Etheria (since Earthlings don't have magic of their own, and therefore can't participate in the original Mage Wars proper. This would of course be much to the distaste of a lot of people in the governments of Etheria and Earth, as well as a lot of other people. It would be really awesome and funny to see how the militaries of the world would react to being told that the fate of the world depended on a card game).

4. A real-life modern day setting with no magic, just a group of friends who travel around playing their favorite game, going to tournaments and trying to be the best they can be, plus a bunch of plots, adventures and drama they get tangled up in. Kinda like the original beyblade anime was, except with a rational protagonist and without an equivalent of the bit beasts.
