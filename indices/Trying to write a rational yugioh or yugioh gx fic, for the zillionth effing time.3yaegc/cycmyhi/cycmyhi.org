In mine the card game is going to have limited impact on the plot. In the original manga it was more about evil egyptian spirits anyway.

I've only written two chapters. I do plan on finishing but I care too much about the quality so I think I'll write a few "practice fics" first. I have done rather a lot of planning but the beginning is sort of open so it's hard to get stuff out there.
