It's ok. The idea could possibly work. Maybe the constructed part of their decks could be kinda like deckmasters or commanders. But the issue i'm worried about now is that if you make it partially constructed, doesn't that run the risk that the constructed part of your deck won't be compatible with the drafted cards?
