Yeah, it sounds like it has a chance of working and being fun, but I honestly don't know if it would actually work or not. And I really don't know what the gameplay for that format would be like. It would be cool to try in real life though.

I really wish that a competitive deck in the regular game didn't always cost $300+. Figuring out how to write this story would be so much easier if there were cheaper competitive decks.

Also, if I do go for MtG as the replacement for duel monsters, that leaves the question of how it would relate to the plot. Maybe I could have it as just a plot device, I suppose.

Using mtg might be the best idea overall, but I'm worried that I won't be able to be enthusiastic about it enough to write a good story. I"ve barely played mtg the past couple years, and I haven't enjoyed it the last few times I played because of too much luck and money involved and not enough player skill, and not enough freedom to customize and still be viable. Part of it is that I invested a lot of time money and effort into Magic before I realized that the regular 1v1 version of the game wasn't that exciting to me and for the most part it was pretty much the only format anyone plays besides commander, the game had significant imbalances built into it (although they were no where near as bad as yugioh) and buying enough staple cards to play competitively cost a small fortune at least. It got even worse when they got rid of legacy format, then started to destroy modern format. From what I hear, Standard format has more viable decks than modern, which is absolutely ridiculous. And standard is a huge money sink that only really wealthy people can afford to play sustainably.

Writing this fanfiction probably necessitates getting back into MtG. And I just can't get back into MtG. The majority of people I remember having ever met who played magic agreed that people who played control decks were poor sports, and I was relentlessly ridiculed and verbally attacked for my strategic preferences by a LOT of the people I played against online, and even my real life friends got really mad at me for playing control.

And I'm not sure I have the energy to invest anything more in MtG than I already have. Maybe if I had written this fanfiction years earlier while I was still into MtG...
