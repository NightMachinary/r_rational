  doesn't that run the risk that the constructed part of your deck won't be compatible with the drafted cards?

Yes, and how people deal with that is part of their "personality".

- Some people bring solid-but-generic cards that fit into every deck reasonably well. Counterspell, mana elves, lightning bolt, swords to plowshares, assorted dual-lands, that kind of thing. Enhanced kitchen-table Magic, but given that a well-placed bolt or counter can win a game, potentially very effective.
- Some people bring a mostly-self-contained strat and ignore the randomness as much as they can. Like, they'll bring the core spells for a blue control deck or a pile of synergistic elves or the core of an entire combo, then fill in the cracks with miscellaneous stuff from the draft.
- Some people bring rare key cards and hope that the draft gives them what they need to finish one of their awesome combos. Like, they'll show up with a Polar Orb, a Necropotence, a Black Vise, a Tolarian Academy, and a Yawgmoth's Will, and hope that they get enough of the right cards to build something that wrecks face.

And then you have everything in between, and then inside that what kinds of cards people prefer when they bring sets. Getting the tuning right would be a huge pain, but I feel like it could result in solid gameplay. That said, I haven't done more than brainstorm here. Veeeeery theoretical.
