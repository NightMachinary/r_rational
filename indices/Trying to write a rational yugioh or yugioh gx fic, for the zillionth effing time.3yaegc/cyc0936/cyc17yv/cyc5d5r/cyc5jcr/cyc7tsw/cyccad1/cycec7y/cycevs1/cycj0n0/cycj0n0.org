  I really wish that a competitive deck in the regular game didn't always cost $300+. Figuring out how to write this story would be so much easier if there were cheaper competitive decks.

I went to a tournament at one point where the winner of the degenerate game used a deck made entirely of common cards: plains, Healing Salve, and Feldon's Cane. He just decked his opponents the hard way.

On a different topic, I will comment that I tried to write a story like this some time ago and abandoned it a short ways in. You've got two choices: write it as a Yugi-oh game (or, in my case, MtG), where you name the cards and actions and etc, in which case you have massive exposition and it's utterly opaque for non-players. Alternatively, you can just describe the fact that a Pegasus leaped out at the enemy, but don't mention that it's a 1/1 Mesa Pegasus with Flying and Banding. If you do, though, you're not writing MtG, you're writing generic fantasy with card-based flavor to the magic.
