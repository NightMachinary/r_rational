Maybe. But then the whole idea of it originating in ancient egypt doesn't work, because there aren't hidden trap cards in MtG. Though I suppose in some ways it might be more thematic. After all, a LOT of the earlier yugioh cards seemed more medieval-fantasy themed, so the whole ancient egyptian connection would have seemed to be pulled out of the author's a** if it weren't for the millenium puzzle.

MtG still has the problem of money overshadowing skill by a lot, but it's definitely not as bad as it is with yugioh.

In MtG, how well-built a deck is has a bigger impact on game outcomes than card access, card access has a bigger impact on game outcomes than in-game skill, and in-game skill tends to have a bigger impact on game outcomes than luck, though I remember reading somewhere that games are lost to mana drought and mana flood a third of the time, and I've experienced quite a few games of magic like that and it is very frustrating.

Unfortunately, even the best deckbuilder in the world probably wouldn't be able to make a competitive deck without at least $300 to burn, but someone with at least $300 can just netdeck.

And while I kinda like mtg, it's not really very exciting to me anymore. I was burnt out on MtG quite a while ago, and I've tried to go back a few times because it seems to have such a stranglehold on tabletop gaming culture and it's apparently a really useful way to meet other tabletop gamers because EVERYONE plays it. Maybe I would like it if I picked it up again. Maybe I should have stuck to limited formats like booster draft and sealed deck, although then you can't really customize your deck as much.
