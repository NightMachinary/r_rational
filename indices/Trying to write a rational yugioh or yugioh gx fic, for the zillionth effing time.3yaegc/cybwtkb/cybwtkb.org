I'm sorry, but the way you wrote this post makes me feel like you don't like Yugioh at all, and you're writing this more to prove a point than you are to make a legitimate piece of work???

I'd love to be wrong about this guess of mine. Tell me why you want to write this so badly that you've obsessed for a year about it?
