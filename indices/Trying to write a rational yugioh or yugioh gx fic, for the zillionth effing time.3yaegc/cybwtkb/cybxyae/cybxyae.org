I like the yugioh anime and the manga, and I really like the premise of high stakes card-battles, and my memories of watching the yugioh anime are very nostalgic to me. It's just that when I tried to play the real life version of the game it was so unbalanced and there was so little freedom to be creative and there was so much less skill involved and money and luck were too big of a factor by comparison...Aside from the whole heart of the cards thing I really like the premise, I just kinda became disillusioned with the real life game because its flaws make it not very fun and there's very little freedom to customize your strategy and still have it be viable or even playable.

And when I try to imagine an anime version of the metagame or something analogous that could actually be realistic and be balanced /enough/ to have a sufficient amount of skill, strategic and playstyle diversity that a decent rational yugioh retelling deserves, I come up short. I don't think Kazuki Takahashi knew anything about what metagames are or how they work, and it shows.

For instance, in the show there are only 4 copies of Blue Eyes White Dragon in existence, it has no special effects, and it's 3000 attack points are supposed to be a really big deal. This should mean that effect monsters tend to have lower attack/defense than normal monsters, but that was never really true--not in real life and not in the anime. And the show never involves any siddecking. The shadow duels are never shadow matches. This means that a villain who is at all familiar with yugi's deck could just make a hate-deck and defeat yugi with it easily, since he can't sidedeck anything. Except that would only be true if Yugi (or any of the other characters) actually had a coherent strategy instead of "I play this random card because the plot demands it, and not because I actually had a good reason to put it in my deck."

Long story short, I think the yugioh tcg is a game that could have been really good but isn't because the people who make it screwed it over. And trying to create a fictional metagame that's actually fun is like fantasizing over a game that doesn't and will never exist. Since I don't enjoy the real life game in the ridiculously broken form it has been constantly forced into since the very beginning, it's hard to be enthusiastic about a version of the game that I would really like if I could actually try it in real life, but can't try in real life.
