You have it backwards. The only reason I would want to design a new format or an entirely new game altogether is because I want to write a yugioh or yugioh-ish story. But I have trouble being inspired or enthusiastic about a game I can't play, and likewise for a game that I can play that isn't fun at all for me.

I think you're getting confused about what aspects of yugioh I like and what I don't like. I like the basic rules of the yugioh game. I like the anime. I like the story. I like the idea of high-stakes card-battles. I like a lot of the cards. I think the game had a lot of potential. I don't like synchro monsters. I don't like xyz monsters. I don't like pendulum monsters. I don't like the direction and form the game has taken because of all of the intentionally broken cards. I don't like how little skill is involved in it, and how much more of an impact luck and money makes. The Yugioh TCG didn't HAVE to be that way. It could have been a lot better. Konami could have made it balanced and made skill matter more, but they didn't.

And if I will never have the chance to play a format, then I can't get sufficiently enthusiastic about it to write a story about it like I want to, which means there's not much point in designing that format.
