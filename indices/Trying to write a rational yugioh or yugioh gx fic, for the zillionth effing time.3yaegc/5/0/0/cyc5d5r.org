AFAICT, Magic gets a lot better if you play one of the random draft formats. I just got back into it after going to college, but the people I know that play a lot without burning out (or burning money) tend to play a ton of limited and sealed.

Maybe make up some kind of in-between format, where you bring ten cards and draft the other twenty, or bring fifteen and can use up to eight? Potentially a nice middle ground, and allows some comboing, but you have a tradeoff between running your nicely tuned combo and building something that actually works with what you drafted, and another between bringing cards that'll work generally and cards that need you to draft particular other cards, and so on and so forth. "Did you hear? X brought a /Stasis/!" "What?! You think he's actually going to use it?" "Yeah, he's nuts."
