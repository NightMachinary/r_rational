That sucks. I've been through burnout before. :/

And, yeah, from what I can tell, major-format bring-a-deck modern Magic is nowhere near as good as it was way back when. I hear that the oddball variants, things like Commander and 2v2 and Limited and Sealed, are still good, and that's probably what I'm going to end up playing. Not much chance I'll get beyond playing with my friends as far as real constructed decks go.

If you can't write the fic replacing YGO with MtG, then try to write it with YGO or something YGO-like of your own devising. Might take some advice from this conversation anyway; unless the game is really fundamentally different I can't see why the same format wouldn't work there too. And building your own YGO-in-name-only is certainly a worthwhile proposition. You can't do worse than the original author, especially if you've played TCGs before.

Anyway, I need to go to bed. Maybe come back with more ideas tomorrow.
