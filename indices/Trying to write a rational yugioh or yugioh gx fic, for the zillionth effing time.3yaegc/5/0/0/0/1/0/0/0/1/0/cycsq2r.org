But the original yugioh introduced the rules of the game as part of the exposition. And a LOT of people play magic the gathering. I'm not sure that it would be that difficult to explain if I were using MtG. The rules of MtG are not really that complicated, it's just that it has a TON of cards that are exceptions to the rules, and there are a lot of interactions that have to be memorized to play competitively. Or am I missing something?

Also, maybe the other players who had $300+ competitive decks just didn't know how to use them right?
