Build the format more like sealed than limited, then, and the semi-constructed portion was brought in to compensate for the more limited selection and maybe to maintain audience interest. Deck preference will still be a thing. Everybody is going to have their own sets of cards, possibly a much smaller set but that's OK because it increases the relative value of (and attention given to) the cards they bring and their effect on the game. Having a couple copies of /Stasis/ means you /can/ run a Stasis deck and if you do it a few times you'll end up with a reputation, so you clearly have enough power. Also, people do all draft differently. Finally, vary the ratio of random to constructed to suit your needs. If you really want to go nuts, change when the draft happens. For example, have a central huge pile of cards (which you hype up as much as possible; One Deck for the Card Emperor on his Card Throne), then every game starts with a two person draft out of a pack of cards from the tournament pool. Judging drafts is still am issue. Solve it with the same kind of automation that YGO already uses?

Why the dominant format is a random one is a more interesting question. Maybe it's because people believe enough in the heart of the cards that they preferred the more random formats? Maybe it was done during something like the Combo Winter and the constructed format just never recovered?

Honestly, I want to see if I can run this with MtG IRL. It feels like it's just crazy enough to work. And sorry for brainstorming at you. I have a bad habit of running with things even when it departs hugely from the original topic.
