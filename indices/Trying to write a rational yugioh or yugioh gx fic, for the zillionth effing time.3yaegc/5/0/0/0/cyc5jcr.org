But why would anyone have any incentive to play an in-between format like that? And it doesn't make sense for a yugioh story. In yugioh the characters have their own decks which they use on more than one occasion. Their deck preferences are a part of their character.

And furthermore, if I go that route, duelist kingdom and battle city completely fall apart. Everyone would have to get into small groups to draft cards before every tournament, and some of the tournaments are too big to do that. Where are you going to get a table that can sit 30+ people at a time?
