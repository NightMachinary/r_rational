I would suggest doing what HPMOR has done, and limiting the scope of the fic. In this case, a single tournament, which can be beefed up in complexity from canon. In Magic The Gathering, it is canonical that thousands of people can show up to a single open tournament. Even if people had to fly themselves out to a remote location, for a big prize pool like Pegasus offered in canon, you'd probably get thousands of players. Alternatively, Pegasus could send out an open invite to anyone who's ever qualified for a major tournament, past or present, and subsidise airfares. This allows you to have 3-4 stages, each whittling down about 7/8th's of the players. Stage 1 goes from however many you start with (a few thousand) to a few hundred, Stage 2 goes to Top 64, Stage 3 to Top 8, Stage 4 determines a winner. All of a sudden, you've got as many different stages of the tournament as Duelist Kingdom and Battle City combined.

People would have an incentive to play any format you came up with because of the prize pool. Canonically, Duelist Kingdom offered several million to one of the winners. This could be changed to a several million dollar prize pool that's weighted towards the winners, but pays out to Top X, but winner-takes-all tournaments have occasionally existed. StarCraft II had one for a $100,000 prize.

Magic: The Gathering Pro Tours that incorporate draft usually incorporate drafts after many of the players have already been eliminated via a sealed deck round, but even then, that's not necessary. The reason that tournaments do this is because of a lack of staff (you'd need one judge for every table of eight players drafting), and the expense of hiring them, not because they don't have the space. Drafts are 8 people only, so all you need is a lot of 8-person tables, which can be regular tables put together. This is trivial for a man who is paying millions of dollars to run this tournament in the first place. But again, you could start with Sealed Deck, where everyone's just given 6 packs and registers a pool on their own.(or to prevent cheating, Pegasus could hire some people to register the pools beforehand, and engage in some sleight of hand of his own where he ensures his favourites, like the protagonist, get good card pools) Draft can come later if you think it strains credulity for Pegasus to fly in hundreds of judges.

You should do some research into competitive MtG if you want to write this. A couple of the questions you've asked indicate to me that you could use more familiarity with the formats available and the tournament system. Look up info about MtG Grand Prix tournaments; they have often had 2,000 or more players in recent years. If your major gripe with Yugioh is that they have no idea how competitive CCG's work (which is true) you'll need to do some work to learn enough to fix this problem in a rational MtG fic.
