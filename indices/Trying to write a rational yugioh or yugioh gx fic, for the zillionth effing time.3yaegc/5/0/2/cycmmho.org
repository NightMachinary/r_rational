  Though I suppose in some ways it might be more thematic.

Theme is entirely under your control. If you decide to use a real-world card game for your fic, there's nothing stopping you from renaming [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386298][Wrath of God]] into [[http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/391][Orbital Bombardment]], or [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247347][Insurrection]] into [[http://mangafox.me/manga/wizard_s_soul_koi_no_seisen/v02/c007/20.html][Hades' Plunder]], or instants into traps. Readers who know the game will see right through it anyway.
