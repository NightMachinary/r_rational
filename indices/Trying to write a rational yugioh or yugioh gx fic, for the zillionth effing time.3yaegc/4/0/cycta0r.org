Thanks. I think this was really helpful advice. In that case, I'll probably stick with Mage Wars, since that's what I like most and am most familiar with. The next question is whether to use Mage Wars Arena, Mage Wars Academy, or my own version? If I use Arena, I would have to cheat past the long game length somehow. Games of Arena normally last 1-2 hours. Maybe if I don't show the whole duel every time? Maybe I could show the opening moves, move the perspective to things taking place outside the game for a while, and then say things like "They had been at it for over an hour, and things were finally coming to a head" or "So-and-so was losing badly," and then describe the current state of the game, or something.

Alternatively, I could go with Mage Wars Academy. The thing with that of course is that the card pool for that is rather small at the moment, and there are very few options for viable decks, so introducing characters with their preferred playstyle might not work that well with Academy. However, Academy is simpler and easier to explain than Arena. Hmmm...
