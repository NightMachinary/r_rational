The only thing I know about either of those games is what you've said, and I don't know much more about Yu-Gi-Oh. But from only that information, in your place, I'd might go with Academy. Simplicity is important in a written story. Blackjack is way simpler than any collectible card game, but try to sit down and describe the exact state of play at any moment. You're already going to need like half a page to describe all the relevant information, especially if the character has been counting cards. If you describe every play instead of describing the whole thing at once, then how much do you expect me to remember? I'm going to be constantly looking up to confirm the state of the character's hand and the field, and I'll probably have to draw a picture to follow it already... This is a much bigger problem for you than the specific minutia of the game you choose.

So, go with the simple one, and invent your own cards to fill out the roster. You can then just say "Oh, yeah, the metagame developed in such a way that this deck was viable. It's a pity Yugi couldn't use that really clever, broken strategy you just thought of using a card his opponent just used, but it turns out there's totally a hard counter just offscreen. He was stuck with what I'm telling you that he has, and his rational creativity would have to be within those bounds."

That gets you a diverse set of decks, and whenever someone says "metagame", you just wave your hands. You could never explain the full metagame anyway, so you only need to discuss it enough to convince me that it exists - which is way easier than making it actually exist. That same trick also makes it possible to use Dual Monsters, which already has the necessary diversity. As long as you're following the rules whenever I'm watching and you have a plausible-sounding excuse for the general shape of things I don't see, it doesn't matter that the real world Yugioh metagame is completely different.

I don't think that's even cheating at rational fiction. The author is allowed to define the problem however they want, as long as it is defined sensibly.
