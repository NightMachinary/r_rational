My interpretation of "The Heart of the Cards" is that it's magic.

Magic is repeatedly shown to exist. The millenium items. The shadow riders. That time Yami Bakura used a card with ropes in its art to tie up a security guard. Whatever the seal of orichalcos is.

So what does Atem mean by "The Heart of the Cards"? Probability manipulation magic. It's his ability to nudge reality into letting him draw the cards he wants. Maybe people who form emotional attachments to their cards are better at controlling them with luck magic. It's flimsy, but would fit with the strange name.
