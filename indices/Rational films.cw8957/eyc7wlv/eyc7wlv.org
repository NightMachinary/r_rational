A bit of a left field suggestion, but /The Draughtsman's Contract/ by Peter Greenaway is, on one level at least, a whodunnit where sufficient evidence is supplied to solve the case, but the film itself doesn't present a solution or indeed an investigator. You just have to follow along and make your peace with your own solution, without being told by a voice of god that you are right.
