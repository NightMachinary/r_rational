I recommend this a lot, so I'm probably biased. But Lucky Number Slevin. There is approximately one place where someone makes a stupid error for the sake of the plot, and it's believable. There is a /substantial/ twist ending, but it's a Fair Play Whodunnit; the characters don't have all the information to see the twist coming but the viewers do. The character's motivations are not really proportionate, but they're consistent and believable.
