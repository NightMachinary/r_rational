I recently saw [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Yesterday2019][/Yesterday/]] and it pretty much qualifies, not necessarily for the protagonist being a rationalist or anything, but definitely for the premise. All around a fun movie, if only because it made me imagine myself in similar situations repeatedly afterwards.
