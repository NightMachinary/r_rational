Decently rational:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Annihilation2018][/Annihilation/]], science fiction. Follows an expedition into an anomalous, slowly-expanding area which formed around a fallen extraterrestrial object. Rare case of the movie being better than the books.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenCloverfieldLane][/10 Cloverfield Lane/]], psychological horror. After a car crash, the protagonist wakes up in a bunker. Its owner doesn't let her leave, claiming that the outside world was "contaminated" while she was unconscious.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Circle][/Circle/]], sci-fi/psychological thriller. Fifty people wake up in a room. Every two minutes, a device kills one of them; either whoever the majority of them votes for, or a random person. What follows?

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwistedTheUntoldStoryOfARoyalVizier][/Twisted/]]. Well, it's technically /a play/, but it's still a live-action moving-pictures work, so is there really a difference? ^{/s}

Somewhat rational:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer][/Primer/]], science fiction. A consistently-written & complex time-travel conflict.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinInTheWoods][/The Cabin in the Woods/]], horror. Clich√© premise leads to a very rationality-esque deconstruction. /Worm/ : Superhero fiction :: /The Cabin in the Woods/ : Horror fiction.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmMother][/I am Mother/]], science fiction/thriller. After an extinction-level event, a lone robot raises a human girl from an embryo in an underground bunker. Notably competent portrayal of AI.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissSloane][/Miss Sloane/]], political thriller. Follows a very competent and ruthless lobbyist as she attempts to pass a challenging bill.

[[/r/rational][r/rational]]-adjacent:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pontypool][/Pontypool/]], horror. A group of people operating a basement radio station in a small town start receiving reports about worrying incidents during one of their broadcasts. Features one of the best examples of a memetic threat I've seen outside of text-based fiction.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Resolution][/Resolution/]], horror. I'd suggest going in blind. A supernatural entity is trying to orchestrate a horror story in reality.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Oculus][/Oculus/]], horror. The beginning (first ~30 minutes?) features a decently munchkin attempt to defeat a powerful hostile supernatural entity, but the protagonists take leave of their senses shortly thereafter.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoureNext][/You're Next/]], a deconstruction of slasher movies with a competent protagonist.
