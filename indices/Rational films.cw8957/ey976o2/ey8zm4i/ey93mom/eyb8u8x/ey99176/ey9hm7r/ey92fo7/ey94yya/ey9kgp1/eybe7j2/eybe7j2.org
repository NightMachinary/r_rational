[[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219289/][Limitless]] - Has pill that make the user smarter, but has positive presentation of being rational. [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g3z62J7bCReHB7Zyo/rationalist-movies-spoilers-for-the-film-limitless][Some old discussion in LessWrong]].

I think [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752][Ex Machina]], [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/][WarGames]] and [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709][Her]], all have good aspects in portraying AI (none is perfect).

Maybe [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778][Contagion]] and [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384][Apollo 13]] can fit also, as the characters and decisions are mostly rationals (although they not very fictional).
