There's actually an [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0653684/][episode]] of Murder She Wrote that may have been inspired by that play/movie. While no one on the jury, not even Jessica, leave to investigate on their own, they do wind up realizing that the real situation is more complicated than the police & prosecutor thought and that's all I can say about it without revealing the rest of the plot.
