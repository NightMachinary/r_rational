The premise for Annihilation is fundamentally irrational. The behaviour of the people isn't rational even when outside the anamoly so they don't have an excuse.

There are no rules to the mutation which basically means that it becomes deus ex for whatever the writers feel like.

What part of the movie did you think was rational in any way?
