/Primer/, /Circle/, /10 Cloverfield Lane/ are usual recommendations.

/Moneyball/ and /Catch Me If You Can/ are both intellect and hacking based, both true-ish stories.

There's a whole genre of "people in a room" which is pretty popular for indie films for the obvious budget reasons, and most of them will /tend/ to be more on the rational side if they have any problem solving at all.
