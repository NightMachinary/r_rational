I was thinking of it. I loved that movie, not sure if I'd call it "rational" just because it's not necessarily the kind of movie that usually would /not/ be anyway. It's basically an investigative court thriller, set in real time, so it's hard for it to be very fanciful. Still, beautiful investigation of human psychology, bias, and justice (though apparently, not very faithful to what the /legal/ system says in theory: jurors aren't supposed to further investigate evidence!).
