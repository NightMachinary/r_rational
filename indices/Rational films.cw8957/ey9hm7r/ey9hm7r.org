*The Edge* is a 1997 American survival film writen by David Mamet, directed by Lee Tamahori, and starring Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin.

Hopkins plays an eccentric fashion designer billionaire on an Alaskan photo shoot. He's a skittish fellow, an intellectual who isn't used to the wilds of Alaska, but who is confident he can figure out how to survive if given the need. And boy, is he ever!

CHARLES: You know, I once read an interesting book which said that, uh, most people lost in the wilds, they, they die of shame...Yeah, see, they die of shame. â€˜What did I do wrong? How could I have gotten myself into this?' And so they sit there and they... die. Because they didn't do the one thing that would save their lives.

BOB: And what is that, Charles?

CHARLES: Thinking.
