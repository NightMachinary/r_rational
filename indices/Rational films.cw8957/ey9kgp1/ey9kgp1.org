[[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100519/][Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]] is a fairly faithful adaptation of the Tom Stoppard play. It has characters who know only that they have been summoned to see the prince and do their best to figure out who they are, the nature of their world, and what's happening around them as they are railroaded through the plot.

Gary Oldman, Tim Roth, and Richard Dreyfuss give a really memorable performance that I think would appeal to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] crowd.

EDIT: Someone happens to have [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YHHHEg3ioc][uploaded it on YouTube]] if you care to give it a watch...
