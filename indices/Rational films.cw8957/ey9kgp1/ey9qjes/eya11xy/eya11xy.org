I always felt like R&G were more than passengers on the plot train- they were desperately searching for a way to exert some sort of agency and be more than spectators of their own lives and bit players in Hamlet's story. The movie has a few scenes without dialogue that weren't in the play, where the characters do various scientific experiments or just wonder or delight at various bits of their environment that don't make any sense rationally. I walked away with the impression that the characters were rational and did the best they could with the tools they had, but they were caught in a situation where science and rationality couldn't help them... so they did the best they could with philosophy. Here are some of the scenes that come to mind:
