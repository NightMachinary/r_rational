I think when I started I had a five page worldbuilding document and a two page outline (of which we are now about one third of the way through). Outlining too much can make you unwilling to change course when it becomes apparent that you should, so I tend to shy away from doing it too much. My primary tool is to instead jot down extended notes on things that are mentioned, and keep track of things that have been mentioned, and how much weight has been placed on them, along with the intended payoff for them.

Quick, reflexive plotting is a DM skill ... for a certain type of DM. Some people do the DM thing using only modules, never deviating from what someone else has written or making only small "localization" changes to fit it within their campaign, and I don't think that those types of people deal with plotting enough to get that good at it.

For someone like me though, tabletop games have a much more sandbox feel, and no plan survives contact with the enemy, so you either continually suck as a DM when things run off the beaten path, or you get good at spinning up a new story out of whole cloth when the old one falls by the wayside because the players did something unexpected. You get used to racing just ahead of the plot, building a bridge just before the players cross it, and figuring out when to bring back threads that were dropped or put on hold. If you have a long-running game that's been going for a year, you have this entire arsenal of characters, places, and items that you can call back to with some regularity, and if you have copious notes that you only use a tenth of, there's always some new revelation. So yes, I would suggest DMing if you can find a group, because part of tabletop gaming is improv, and part of the DM's job is to improv a plot.

And this is all /so much easier/ in prose, because you have a better read on the characters, there aren't out-of-character moments that derail the plot, you can ensure that you're actually going to get to payoff the things that you set up instead of just letting them languish, etc. (And if you're not writing serial fiction, you can use your authorial time travel powers to retroactively insert clues or foreshadowing, if you need to.)
