I also suspect it works because Brienne spends her entire day in places where they can string up LEDs to their hearts content. Because I did consider if this was an idea I could appropriate for commercial purposes, but if you spend 8 hours a day in an office or a factory, you do not just need to be a firm that sells light armatures designed for "Fuck-off" levels of Lux, you would have to be experts at persuading peoples bosses to redo working environments...

Which, of course, then spawned a secondary idea, but thats an entirely separate question. There has been a lot of research on productivity and office environments, but.. I do not recall any that tried to just turn the place bright enough to grow wheat in winter. It might have quite considerable impact if there is a lot of undiagnosed SAD in the workforce..
