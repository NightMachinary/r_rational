This is my current regime:

- Get better sleep.
- Take 300mcg of melatonin an hour before a reasonable bedtime.
- Take vitamin D supplements.
- Do lightbox therapy for half an hour in the mornings.
- Spend something like a half hour exercising every day.
- Install f.lux or equivalent on all screens.

So, yep, got a 10,000 lux lightbox, and I've either adjusted to the intensity of it so that it's not giving me headaches, or I've figured out the right positioning. I am somewhat back to normal at this point, having thrown every solution that I could at the problem short of CBT, moar light, or moving somewhere that's not so dark.

The big problem, now that I can do something other than just staring blankly at a screen, is that it takes a good chunk out of my day when I'd rather be writing.
