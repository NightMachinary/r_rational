Uhm. I am not exactly sure what all this says about the soul-mage they are trying to recruit. He remade at least twenty souls in his own image. Or, at least, told the party that. I mean, I get doing soul-surgery on his fellow inmates.

- If they are all the kind of people who earned an elven-life-without parole sentence, they were probably extremely unpleasant company - but turning them all into self-forks when they are all also still stuck in the prison, or alternatively, heading for the hells?

Possibilities :

1:Liar, liar, pants on fire?

2: The soul is too complicated to do free-form personality modification, and there was only one person in the prison that would cooperate after being patterned into a prisoner.

3: Some magical reason to have lots of similar souls on hand.

4:Just really, really narcissistic
