To be clear, Eliezer's solution wasn't a more powerful lightbox (in terms of lux to your eyes at any instant) but rather to make each room into a lightbox you could exist inside, so that you were always experiencing the effect of artificial sunlight, rather than only experiencing it for 15mins per day. (AFAIK, despite having way more bulbs, the room isn't as bright as a 10000lux lightbox---but it doesn't need to be. That intensity is only required because of regular light-therapy's short duration.)
