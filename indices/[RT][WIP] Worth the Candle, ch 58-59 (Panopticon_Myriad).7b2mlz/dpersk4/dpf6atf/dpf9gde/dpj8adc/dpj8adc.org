I'm curious: how much outlining did you do before you started writing WtC? I can't imagine writing at the speed you do if you're having to also pause to refine the worldbuilding and plotting, so how much of that is already locked in place?

I mean, obviously you're getting a speed boost from having built up all the “source material” for the worldbuilding in the context of running RPG campaigns. But that still doesn't explain the speed at which you're doing the plotting.

Unless... it does? Is quick, reflexive plotting a skill you can build by DMing, the same way that dialogue is a skill you can build by participating in improv? Is DMing something you would recommend someone who wanted to get faster at coming up with satisfying plots?
