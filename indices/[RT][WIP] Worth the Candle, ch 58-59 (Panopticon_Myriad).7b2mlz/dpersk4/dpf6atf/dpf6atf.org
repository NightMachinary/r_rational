You write this?

I've been catching up the last month and was horrified when I caught up!

Thank you so much for a really awesome story where the characters actually go "huh, that's funny..." when something doesn't add up, and it often leads them somewhere!

Are we ever going to find out how exclusion zones work?

Oh, and is he ever going to read up on what the magical fields actually do instead of going from his old conceptions (referring to his thoughts that high levels of blood magic rarely has useful stuff in the high tiers. I mean, what if the high levels lets you control your own blood the way Magneto controls metal? Just keep tapping it and have telekinesis!)?

Oh, and I'm loving what you did with magic systems, still hoping he'll find something that can be exploited to hell and back (high level revision magic lets you make a savepoint? Dun dun dunn! Control magic has an infinite-capacity insect control spell? High level mental or social stats lets you understand and persuade people on the same level, and with a similar terrifying effectiveness as a superintelligent AI? Logic plague on your enemies! Your cause is now their cause)

TL:DR; Thank you for an incredibly awesome read!
