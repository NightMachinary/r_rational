So how about some massive speculation based on chapter names hey?

Chapter 38 is called Panopticon, which wikipedia tells me is an institution built so that one person can observe any/all of the inmates without the inmates knowning it.

This might be a reference to a DM watching June and co. but more obviously to the facility /originally/ being a panopticon controlled by the mind of one entad, which may no longer be true. Did the facility start as a panopticon with one warden that has since split into multiple wardens as the party theorises?

But after the party discusses the possibility that there are conflicting minds operating the defenses, the golem immediately appears to parley, becase they were being observed. They are lead to assume that there are factions and that the female golem did not intend to carry a void bomb to them, but this isnt confirmed.

Potentially all the variants/minds within the entad and all the inmates are controlled by the soul mage, which is where I am trying to fit the name of chapter 59 into it.

Do sentient/sapient "entads" have a soul that that might be subverted by a super-powerful soul mage? When they improsoned the best soul mage in there, they probably took that into account in the defenses. So its probably not the elf in charge of everything unless they could gain control of the entad without soul magic.
