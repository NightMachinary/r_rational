[[https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1heqvd/you_should_know_about_rational_wiki_site_devoted/][Here's]] what [[/r/skeptic]] had to say about them a bit ago.

Tone in that thread hovers around "Meh" as far as I can tell.

The weird thing? [[/r/skeptic]] is /all about/ pretty much every topic on rationalwiki. They should be all for it, but the tone is just so condescending for some articles that it /even bothers people in the in-group./
