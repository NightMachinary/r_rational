  Wiki pages are supposed to be about giving impartial, unbiased information on the topic in question

Not correct. Wikipedia aims to provide impartial and unbiased information but other wikis are not required to share those policies, some wikis such as Conservapedia and Uncyclopedia deliberately provide biased information.

From what I can tell rationalwiki doesn't have a policy of being respectful for those it talks about. The sarcastic humour and snark mocking the cranks and pseudoscience in its articles is probably both deliberate and a significant attraction for it's readers. If you want unbiased information go to Wikipedia.
