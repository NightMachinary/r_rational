First of all, it can certainly be "unfair" to cite facts, when they're a carefully selected choice of facts, deliberately designed to give an unfair impression, expressed in the worst tone and manner possible, so as to bias you.

E.g. if someone asks you "Who was Martin Luther King, Jr?" and you respond "Some convicted criminal", that would be hilariously unfair to Martin Luther King, even though it's citing the fact that he was convicted by an Alabama court because of the bus boycott.

Secondly, rationalwiki to my experience doesn't give a damn about facts, except when convenient. Specific wrongful facts in their 'LessWrong' article that I pointed out in their discussion page were left uncorrected for months, and all I received was scorn for defending their target of choice - nobody argued that I was /wrong/ or that the article was right, they just didn't give a frigging damn.

Rationalwikers don't care about /informing/ the readers, their purpose is to bias them instead. They'll do that with tone and with scorn and with the occasional fact, yes. (Of course this may be my bias talking. I guess it may be that they're horribly unfair only in regards to the issues that /I/ know about, and they're absolutely fine on all the rest.)
