I would do blog-trawling, and assume that some business people were doing the real investment and testing.

Depending on which magic effects were available/possible, I'd try to invest my money one step away. (If you see that airliners are going to appear, you don't invest in "shipping/transportation", you invest in "tourism/travel". Ships got their business displaced, but hotels got a pure boost in business.)

If [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/rods.htm#immovableRod][Immovable Rods]] were plentiful and cheap, I'd invest in satellite companies. If bags of holding were common, I'd invest in things that are only expensive because they need shipping. If teleportation circles were available, I'd invest in tourism/resort things.
