Imagine that you are a very strong person, and you have four immovable rods, one for each hand and foot. When you press a button on one of them, it locks its position relative to the earth.

Using all four rods and some coordination you can climb them like a ladder.

If you are very strong, you can /accelerate/ upwards instead of maintaining a steady pace.

If you are superhumanly strong, you can just use your arms, and reduce it to two rods instead of four.

If you are superhumanly strong and very coordinated, you can use only one rod instead of two by using a "hopping" motion.

If you replace the person with a machine, then you have a reactionless drive for your spaceship.
