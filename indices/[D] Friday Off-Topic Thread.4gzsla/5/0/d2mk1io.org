I'd consider the economic impacts of magic. In order of how important things are:

- craftable (or easily accessible) reusable magic items
- imported (or rare) reusable magic items
- common single-use magic items
- character abilities
- rare single-use magic items

For each of those sets of magic sources, I'd look for the following effects:

- magical healing and resurrection (preferably of more than just combat wounds)
- teleportation and other travel spells (preferably safe)
- scrying and other information spells
- infinite energy sources (preferably with high power/weight ratios)
- everyday needs
