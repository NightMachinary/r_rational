*No knowledge of Log Horizon is required to respond to this post.*

I'm in the process of writing a Log Horizon fanfic, the basic premise being that the akihabara adventurers figure out a difficult, but feasible way to cross back to the real world.

Seeing as I'm heavily limiting how often people can cross, I don't need to deal with the full scale of the social fallout. Still, people are going to react to people who vanished from their homes while playing an MMO suddenly returning with functional immortality and fantastic magical powers (not to mention the whole different-species thing.)

So to pose my question, how would /you/ act in that scenario?
