Hmm...are you sure that's what OP meant?

Anyway, if that is the case, Knowing myself and my current means, I'd most likely learn about it from the international news. Probably a social media platform of some sort. In which case, I'd be way too late to have any actual, meaningful impact on the situation in general. So I'd move on with my daily life, much as I do now, discuss how jealous I am that some other nerd out there has MMO based powers instead of ME with my equally nerdy friends, and then pray to the God I don't believe in that the people who have more power over the situation (namely the adventurers and the people/agencies that are going to be involved with them) don't do something irredeemably *stupid*.
