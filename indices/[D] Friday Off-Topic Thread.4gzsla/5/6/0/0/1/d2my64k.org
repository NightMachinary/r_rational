I did mean that your perspective is as a (mostly) unconnected observer-- you may have knowledge about the game, and you definitely knew about that one time where literally tens of thousands of people dissapeared while playing a game, but you're not directly connected to anyone involved. (Although you probably know a friend of a friend involved-- it affected one in every approximately 7500 people in Japan, mostly people around the ages 15 and 20, and the proportion is probably similar in the US.)

Thanks for your response, by the way.
