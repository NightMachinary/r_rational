I'm a bit late here, but who am /I/ in the scenario? Am I one of the fantasy adventurers suddenly back in the real world? Or am I an average person at home who sees news of said adventures of the real world? Or am I, say, a family member of said adventurer?

I'm not really trying to be pedantic. My answer would just be radically different depending on who I am.
