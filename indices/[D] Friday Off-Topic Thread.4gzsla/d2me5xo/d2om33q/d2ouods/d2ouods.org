It's more feeling guilty for wanting things because expressing that desire is something I would construe as manipulative. I'd be fine asking for a hug, but if it's for a reason deeper than wanting affection -- for instance, as part of an apology which may or may not be sincere -- I'd feel bad for doing so. It's something I'll need to work out for myself.
