Yes. I don't like to think of myself as the kind of person that would do that in normal circumstances, but it becomes an issue (well, I say that, but it's really only mildly irritating) because I have the awareness of my emotions and mental state to tell, at least when I'm not in the midst of a conversation (it's less an issue in the immediate sense like that unless I give myself time to think), when the reasons behind my unconscious behaviors is that I want something, and I feel guilty for that.
