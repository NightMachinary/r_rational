You know, being mindful of my emotions and thought processes is usually fantastic, but it does get kind of irritating in social situations sometimes. I end up in a sort of decision paralysis because I realize that, knowing the reasons that I feel the way I do, saying a certain thing would be manipulative, even if it's true to how I feel.

I don't know if I got my point across very well there, but eh. Needed to vent a little.
