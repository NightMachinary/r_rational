I had this idea for a setting or overarching theme for a story. However as it's very unlikely I'll ever write it myself, here it is for you to dissect:

As we know (I think), a sufficiently advanced civilization could create sentient lifeforms similar to us as in terms of mental aptitude. Be it as simulations or actual lifeforms, doesn't really matter.

So the protagonist of the story lives in a world where gods exist mainly in the myths of their people, but suddenly there's hint of the existence of gods, maybe through the discovery of magic or bugs in the laws of nature or whatnot.

A lot of stuff happens and in the end the protagonist is having a chat with (one of) the gods and demands an explanation as to why they would create lifeforms and then leave in all this suffering and inefficient design.

Answer: Creating worlds where lifeforms just barely passing for sentient develop "naturally", is pretty much the extent of the power of the gods. The gods themselves cannot reproduce except by cloning, which, on a cosmic scale, is a really bad idea. So creating lifeforms, which develop into a higher civilization, which spawns new gods, is their way of reproduction with variety.

In case of simulated worlds, the resulting new god would probably need to be lifted into the next-higher tier of reality to avoid a Matrioshka effect where the simulation necessarily needs to be smaller in overall processing power, but that's details for the gods to worry about.
