Question: I've never really interacted with [[http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page][the rational wiki]]

I've mostly interacted with you fine gentlemen/ladies/undefined starfish aliens here. What I want to know is, how reliable is said wiki?

Context for this: A friend of mine who's more spiritually and new age minded than I, posted a link to a video by a Leonard Coldwell, which claimed that every (yes, EVERY) cancer could be cured in 2-16 weeks or even less. I looked up the guy and found him on the rational wiki, being torn down as a fraud and whatnot. I'm just curious as to how accurate this is, as I don't have the time (or emotional investment) into doing a proper investigation of investigating someone that perpetrates, or is purported to perpetrate, scams successfully. It's notoriously hard to parse the good data from the bad.
