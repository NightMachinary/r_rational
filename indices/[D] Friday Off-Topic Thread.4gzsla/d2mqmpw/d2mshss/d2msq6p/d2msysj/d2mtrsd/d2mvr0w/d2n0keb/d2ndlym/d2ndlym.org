  Does overtly having an opinion or bias make the information less correct?

It makes it utterly misleading.

E.g. I notice that rationalwiki's article on EY completely fails to mention that his ideas on the danger of AI are shared by people like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk.

By having the article sarcastically say that "no one else had previously noticed" this problem, it conveniently omits the famous and intelligent people that noticed the problem and agreed the problem exists when it was brought to their attention... and thus transforms what ought have been a compliment (Eliezer Yudkowsky helped bring an actual problem to attention) into an insult (Eliezer Yudkowsky is imagining non-existing problems)

It's all about the misrepresentation. Someone can use even truths to deceive and misrepresent.
