  It's not really unfair to cite facts, is it?

It's about the way you cite said facts. Look at any standard, wikipedia page. Even though pretty much everyone can agree that Adolf Hitler was an asshole, you're never going to see "Adolf Hitler was an asshole" written there. Wiki pages are supposed to be about giving impartial, unbiased information on the topic in question. Which isn't really something that particular page does. While it isn't as overt as you might expect, there's still a clear opinion presented on E.Y and his work by the article itself. Something which shouldn't be present in any self respecting wiki article, let alone a /rational/ wiki article.
