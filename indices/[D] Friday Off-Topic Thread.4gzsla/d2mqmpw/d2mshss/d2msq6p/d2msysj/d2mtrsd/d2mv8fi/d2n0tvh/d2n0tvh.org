  Secondly, rationalwiki to my experience doesn't give a damn about facts, except when convenient. Specific wrongful facts in their 'LessWrong' article that I pointed out in their discussion page were left uncorrected for months, and all I received was scorn for defending their target of choice - nobody argued that I was wrong or that the article was right, they just didn't give a frigging damn.

  Rationalwikers don't care about informing the readers, their purpose is to bias them instead. They'll do that with tone and with scorn and with the occasional fact, yes.

Hm. Your name appears in a ton of the talkpage archives. I think it's hard to say that there was no argument -- especially given sections like this: [[http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Talk:Roko's_basilisk/Archive2#Utilitarianism_-_complete_mess]]
