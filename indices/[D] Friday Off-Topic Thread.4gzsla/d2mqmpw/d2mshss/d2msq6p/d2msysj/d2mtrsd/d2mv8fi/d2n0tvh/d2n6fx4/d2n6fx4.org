Yes, given a ton of discussions, as you say, sometimes there indeed are arguments. In many other cases there was only scorn and disinterest in whether I was right or wrong.

EDIT: And even in the example you gave if you read carefully you'll see that my core objection (that utilitarianism isn't relevant to the article) was not addressed, and the person who responded was engaging in a different discussion (as I mention in the comment there "I'm discussing the article and its validity, and you're discussing decision theory. We two are in two different discussions"). As a result the Utilitarianism section in that page still remains a complete mess, and is still utterly irrelevant in its context. The only point of that section was to drag as many unrelated ideas into that mix and mock them all. What does 'utilitarianism' or 'shut up and multiply' or 'dust specks vs torture' have to do with Roko's basilisk? Nothing at all but by golly if we pretend they do then we can tarnish them by association, and thus bias readers against those ideas too.

If you figure out that the whole point of Rationalwiki is to bias readers in their preferred direction rather than unbias them, then their writing style and editorial choices all make sense.
