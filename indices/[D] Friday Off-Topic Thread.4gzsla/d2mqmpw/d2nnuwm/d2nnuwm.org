I would say, don't trust anything you read there unless you can verify it independently. The site is highly oriented towards a certain type of humor, and if an exaggeration is "funny" enough, it tends to stick around. They follow a rule of SPOV, which has more to do with the snarky point of view, as opposed to skeptical point of view.

That said, it's worth noting that many crazy sounding ideas are in fact crazy.
