From the second chapter (edited for English):

#+begin_quote
  "In the early 1300s, a potions master tricked several witches to drink a potion that made them lose their bodies. He then proceeded to force their spirits into bodies he created for them--bodies sewn together from animal parts, or so the sources claim.

  "However, what is of interest for us is the law made in the aftermath of these occurrences. To help the victims of this madman, a law was created stating that anyone forced from his body could not, after gaining a new body, be hold accountable for what he did before gaining that new body."
