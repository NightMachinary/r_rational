Some stories...

Recently read for the first time:\\
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013][Benefits of Old Laws]]/ (/Harry Potter/; 145k words, ongoing): Upon his resurrection, Voldemort regains his sanity, exploits a centuries-old law to avoid prosecution for his past crimes, and seeks to resuscitate the Noble House of Slytherin by adopting Harry as his son.\\
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11626470][Crime and Commitment]]/ (/Worm/; 132k words, ongoing): Various changes--the Travelers don't leave Boston, Taylor decides to breed larger insects, etc.\\
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11449804][A Propensity for Wrath]]/ (/Worm/; 129k words, ongoing): Taylor gets the power to sense emotions in others and to imbue objects (mostly weapons, armor pieces, and rings) with her own emotions (wrath = explosive force, love = healing, etc.). This has some interesting interactions with Gallant's emotion-sensing power.\\
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11450150][Seed]]/ (/Worm/; 207k words, ongoing): Taylor gets Blasto's power, and conducts some very interesting experiments involving clones of Butcher, whose power is a special one in the cycle of shards. Other changes also exist (e.g., Coil and Accord are allies in control of Boston).\\
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11224198][Intrepid]]/ (/Worm/; 320k words, ongoing): A story somewhat-confusingly split between the viewpoints of Taylor and her three bullies, of whom each gains a power.

Recently re-read:\\
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]]/ (/Harry Potter/; 406k words, complete): Fun action with a female Harry.\\
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718][The Hogwarts Strike Team]]/ (/Harry Potter/; 219k words, dead): Harry and Hermione go back in time in order to thwart Voldemort's failsafes, which made Britain uninhabitable after his death.\\
- /[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1536152][Manager]]/ (/Worm/; 219k words, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/21698846][ongoing]]): Taylor can mix-and-match powers between people--including herself. (Less interesting than I remembered it from my first reading...)

Currently re-reading:\\
