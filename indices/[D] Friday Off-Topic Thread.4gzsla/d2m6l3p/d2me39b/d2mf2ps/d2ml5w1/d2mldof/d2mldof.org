Yes, the singular =you= is very irksomely ambiguous as well--I sometimes find myself forced to specify =you (plural)= in text conversation. Unfortunately, any alternatives to =you= have been completely squelched into "archaism" status, as you demonstrate, and their revival seems unworkable. On the other hand, =he=, =she=, and =it= are still perfectly acceptable alternatives to the singular =they=, so =they= can still be killed in favor of them.

If =thou= is dead and can't feasibly be revived, then =it= is still feebly kicking.
