Not inherently offensive, but LGBT people often have to deal with people saying that it's a choice, so it's stepping on some toes. People who have traits that are not chosen by them and of which they are also proud don't like the suggestion that it might be a choice. Although your story is fictional and in fact is exploring a /different/ world where it is a choice, it may step on toes.

It's all in the execution. Done well, it would not be offensive. It could in fact be really well-received, if for no other reason than that it shows that the world would be really different if sexuality was truly a choice. Done poorly, it would be in bad taste.

For example, if you wrote a story in which people could change their physical sex with a pill, and the entire story was how awful it was to use this pill and how people should keep their birth sex or else it's unnatural, you should expect to get some flak. However, a thoughtful meditation on the nature of sex, gender, and socialization would be great. Done well, I don't expect you'll see problems.
