I'd guess it to depend on how specifically the pill functions. E.g. if it allows people to modify their sexual preferences in general, then people would be switching between “gay” and “non-gay” all over the place). Or if all it did was “default” to heterosexuality, then it wouldn't do much to heterosexuals at all, aside maybe from nudging them closer to 0 on the Kinsey scale.
