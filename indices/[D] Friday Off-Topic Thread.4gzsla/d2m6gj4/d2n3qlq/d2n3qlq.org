I think you should do a bunch of consultation with LGBT people about this. I know I would have taken a pill like that when I was a teenager, but if I had, I'd want to un-take it (or take the "antidote") now. Not just because of the reduced stigma but probably partly as a result of the struggle of activists before me. I also think you should make sure you include or allude to figures like Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera and Storme DeLarverie, because they are often conspicuously absent from modern LGBT narratives set in the 70s.

Maybe talk to [[/r/lgbt]] about it?

Also I'd like to second what [[/r/OutOfNiceUsernames]] said about making sure you consider how a lot of people would NOT want to take the pill.

Probs include or allude to queer-acting, queer-coded or gender nonconforming kids being forcibly sent to gay conversion camps by their parents too, that's a thing.
