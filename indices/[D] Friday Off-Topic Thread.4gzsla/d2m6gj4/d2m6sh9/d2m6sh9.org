It's not offensive in and of itself, but it's important to understand that emotions run high about this kind of topic and a lot of lgbtq people are understandably defensive of the validity of their identities. So basically you're kind of entering a minefield in territory you aren't personally familiar with. I'm not going to tell you not to write this story, especially since it has the potential to be really interesting, but I think you should practice empathy as best you can.

I'd be happy to try and answer whatever questions you have, but obviously I can only give you my perspective as a transwoman and lesbian.
