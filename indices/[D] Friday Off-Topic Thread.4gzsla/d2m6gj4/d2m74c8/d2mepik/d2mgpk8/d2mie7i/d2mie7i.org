  If you call any case of offending someone that had a better net utility than the other options 'necessary' then I can agree.
#+end_quote

Pretty much. It would have to be better than doing nothing and also better than the other alternatives I can come up with.

#+begin_quote
  It seems like you should be using a statistical distribution of the likely audience here.
#+end_quote

That's too much work for too little gain IMO. Keeping it as one homogeneous group of "people" is too imprecise, I couldn't think of a way to make three or more useful and well-defined groups, and a continuous function based on the probability that they will see it is too much work.

  Even if reading something offensive to others brings vast swaths of personal utility to yourself, you still avoid it simply because it is offensive to others?
#+end_quote

"Avoid" was too strong of a word. It's a negative trait, but that's not enough to categorically reject something.

Also keep in mind that this breakdown applies to more words than just "offensive", and that the relative values of the points can change as a result of that. For example: I'm having a conversation with another person and I want to know whether or not it's "engaging". I would care about myself and the other person a lot, the bystanders a little bit, and basically ignore the wider population and cultural standards.
