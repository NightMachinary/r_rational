Yup, completely agree with this. There was a scene in one of the early X-men movies where someone says "Have you tried not being a mutant?" Like, that's funny, but there's literally no drawback to having the ability to turn things to ice, and there's also no reason that you ever have to reveal it to the public if you don't want to. And some of the powers /suck/ so it makes a lot of sense that they would want to not be a mutant anymore.

Further, it never really made sense to me that the United States government declared a war on mutants rather than just bringing them into the fold with heavy incentives. Given the expansiveness of comics, I'm sure it's been done at some point, but come on ... why in the world would the government see someone like Multiple Man as something other than an asset? Just pay the man! (This annoys me even more when the X-men exist in the same universe as the Avengers.)
