Kind of, not really. The fictional history of the Weapon X program changes a lot and it's gone through a lot of iterations, but they do lots and lots of clandestine work that's probably based on real work done by the United States like MKUltra. Mind control, brainwashing, etc. They also engage in trying to create their own mutants, or stealing the power of the mutants they find.

And that's all fairly believable; rogue military agency doing its own thing without oversight happens all the time. But what puzzles me is that the /other/ parts of the government, which in most continuities know about mutants (since mutants are apparently feared and hated all around the world) aren't trying to scoop them up. Or corporations, for that matter. Most mutants have huge practical, mundane applications for their power, above and beyond their combat abilities (if any). But it's only the clandestine, shadowy, military organization that pursues them, and then not through the conventional means of just paying them money or getting them whatever legal or personal help they need.
