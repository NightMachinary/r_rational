  frankly, it sounds too much like a fully general counterargument against anything which people used to believe, but is now unfashionable.

It's more that the definition, and interpretation, of a psychological disorder has changed:

“A mental disorder is a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a *significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.*”

That last part is important, as it offers an objective metric by which to judge the difference between someone who likes to wear a wolf costume for, say, sexual adventure, and someone who likes to wear a wolf costume to roam in the wilderness and live with wolves. The former is a kink, the latter might point toward a mental disorder.

One can argue that being homosexual in a culture where homosexuals are jailed or stoned to death might constitute a "significantly increased disk of suffering death, pain, etc," but that's obviously the result of their surroundings. By most metrics the definition simply does not apply to those in the Western world.
