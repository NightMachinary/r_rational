  So is the counterfactual premise of there being a way to no longer be gay irredeemably offensive?

A way to no longer be gay? Maybe not. A pill that medically "fixes" gayness, even in bisexuals? In the vast majority of ways it would be presented, probably. It's taking as its basic assumption that homosexuality is something that is "medically curable," ie, defective, abnormal, unhealthy, etc, even if you don't intend it that way. This plays way too much into the narrative of the anti-LGBTQ community to not press many people's anger buttons, to the point that any nuance might be lost, or never even given a chance to be seen.

My suggestion would be to have the pill either flip one's sexuality, or make anyone who takes it bisexual so they can "live straight." This still allows all the moral arguments about sexual identity and social pressure and so on, but also allows you to widen the scope of the argument a bit toward people who maybe want the pill for reasons other than to "renounce gayness."

Or would that change things too much from what you envision?
