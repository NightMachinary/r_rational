Can people travel from meatspace to Elder Tale as well, or does it work only in one direction?

  how would you act in that scenario?

Barring the option of visiting Elder Tale myself, I would be curious about the travellers but also apprehensive of them. Meaning, that I'd be avoiding any direct contact with travelers I don't know anything about while also trying to evaluate how much the travellers I /did/ previously know have changed in personality and moral views. Would try approaching them for cool stories if they turned out to be bros and not homicidal maniacs.
