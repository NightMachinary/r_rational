As a physicist, step one would be to get so much grant money that I could swim around in it like Scrooge McDuck. Step two would be to find a volunteer with magic powers.

Clearly "magic" is acting on our universe if it's disappearing people from their homes. What kinds of apparent physical laws can magic violate? Can we track side-effects of magic in the form of light/particles/gravitational waves/nanobots? If so, are there interesting patterns to these side effects that can tell us more about magic? What are magical objects made of at microscopic scales? Can we put magic in a quantum superposition? Does magic respect the lightspeed boundary?
