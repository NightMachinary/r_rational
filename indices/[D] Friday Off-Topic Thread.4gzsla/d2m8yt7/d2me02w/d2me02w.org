As a returning game character: Amass all the power.

As a commoner: Try to get in on the magic. Find out what I can about the returnees. Most likely they have swarms of people who want to serve them. If not, I will be among the first. More likely they will, in which case I'll try to make my way to the game world (If that's possible). Read up on everything about the game, of course.

Also, as a politically active (but unimportant) person, I'd try to get my party to react rationally to all this.
