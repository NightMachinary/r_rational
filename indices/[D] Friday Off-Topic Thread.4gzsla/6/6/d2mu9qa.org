  - Manager (Worm; 219k words, ongoing): Taylor can mix-and-match powers between people--including herself. (Less interesting than I remembered it from my first reading...)
#+end_quote

I tried this way back when and never got to the end (and it has since grown immeasurably). The author had let exponentials write him into a corner.

- The Worm-verse has a shitload of powers, and a shitload of people.
- In a given person, each combination of powers produces a different result.
- Any given combination of powers produces a different result depending on who is carrying it.

And all these things were really cool when Taylor and Tattertale were playing around with 3 or so powers... But as Taylor stole more and more powers, and met more and more allies, the number of possible combinations went through the roof. I'm only willing to read so many pages of people being granted different powers and showing off new effects.
