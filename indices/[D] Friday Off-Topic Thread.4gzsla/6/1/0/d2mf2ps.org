The objective of language is communication /without/ ambiguity. Pretending that a plural pronoun can refer to a singular object (e.g., "Everyone doffed their hat as the King approached.") is just as /absolutely disgusting/ as pretending that a plural verb can agree with a singular object (e.g., "England are expected to beat France in this year's World Cup.").

There's no reason to use =they= when better alternatives exist. =It=, =ze=, =he=, =she=--all are /actually singular./
