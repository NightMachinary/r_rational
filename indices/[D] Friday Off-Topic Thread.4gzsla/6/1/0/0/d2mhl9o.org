The singular they is more natural and more commonly accepted than any artificial pronoun like "ze". The dehumanizing connotations of "it" are unsavory, and "he" and "she" bring us back to the issue of definitive gender.

Ultimately, prescriptivism and descriptivism are both incomplete - prescriptivism ignores that descriptivism is where rules come from to begin with, while descriptivism ignores that some type of prescriptivism is necessary for anyone to have any idea what the hell you're talking about. You have fallen into the former fallacy; the only reason that "they" would be considered "a plural pronoun" is because that's how it's used - except that that's /not/ how it's used. The singular they is quite old, was not intended as any kind of political statement, and is invisible to everyone who hasn't politicized the issue. To the contrary - the attempt to abolish the singular they is a political statement.
