Upvoted for Crime and Commitment. Just read up to the most recent chapter and really enjoyed it. It starts out looking like a stomp fic but then escalates and enters the cycle of cliffhangers and daring plans that dominates Worm. Also, an awesome villain that has a power that seems like a joke but can take on heavy-hitters.
