I like it quite a bit, but I'm disappointed that Taylor got combat utility out of her power too. I came for Taylor the consultant, not Taylor the jedi.

Combined with her Cauldron contacts, that gives her such a leg up over every canon challenge that things are getting worryingly easy. Hopefully the foreshadowed threats will materialize sooner rather than later.
