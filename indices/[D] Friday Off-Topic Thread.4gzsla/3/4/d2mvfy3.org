I've been listening to pop music at work recently, anywhere from like 2011-Now. Simply because I genuinely enjoy a large portion of the music and, more helpfully, since the songs are so blastedly popular, I know them already. And I find I enjoy songs I know significantly more than songs I don't. As in, I've literally noticed that my enjoyment for Song X has grown as I've grown more familiar with it. It's a thing about me. Also been jamming to a bunch of Taylor Swift, Linkin Park, Boys Like Girls and some other trashy, pop-punk stuff from back in the day like old MCR, All American Rejects, etc.
