I'm personally very close to being a technical pacifist, but I can understand your point here. This is addressed somewhat in game, however; I'm not sure if you played the whole game through or if, like eaturbrainz, you played halfway through it.

It can come off as a broken aesop to some people, though, that much I can acknowledge.
