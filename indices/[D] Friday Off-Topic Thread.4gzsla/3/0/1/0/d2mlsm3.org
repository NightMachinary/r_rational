Yep! It's my favorite game by far and has been since I played it. It's been pretty impactful on the way I think about things (nearly as much as reading the sequences of Less Wrong was).

It's pretty inspiring. It pretty well codified how I already felt about some things, and... I feel like it made me a kinder person.
