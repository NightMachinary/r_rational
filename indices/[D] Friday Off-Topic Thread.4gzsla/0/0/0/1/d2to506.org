I find myself curious about whether it's possible for us to meaningfully predict whether the dysphoria is inherent, or whether it's tied to the current effective-irreversability. I've heard one (body-uncomfortable) person express the intention to do self-violence to physically address the issue, and another body-comfortalble) person express unhesitating interest and curiosity at the prospect of trying a body of the opposite sex.

--To compare it to a less/poignant example, I find myself (baselessly) wondering if it's like hair. If you have long beautiful hair that you spent six years of care and maintenance to grow out (and preferred it to having short hair), and then one day someone cut it off while you were asleep, you would feel as though you had been stabbed, and be deeply upset about it until you had finally returned to your previous state. If you had remote control that could change your hair length at any time, though, then you might go for months at a time with short hair without discomfort, the preference for long hair temporarily outweighed by the change of scene feeling, the way you could otherwise casually have a ponytail every so often even if you normally preferred having braids (and would be upset if you weren't allowed to have braids).

--Hmm, I ended up imagining a story which starts out with everyone changing to a different novelty body every week/month/year or so, then after a maintenance sabotage (or evacuation requirement to a different planet, or anything preventing foreseeable future use of that technology) people starting to feel discomfort and creeping horror (and presumably regret) at the thought of being stuck in their current bodies for the rest of their lives.

Now then, what might happen to a society when all or the majority of participants feels that way..? (I'm put in mind--though not directly relevant--of a story idea of a cloning machine accident, a city ending up entirely filled with clones of the same person. Some keep trying to act the same way as before the accident, some form small groups with polarised behaviours, each acting as a single 'person' with each body taking the role of a mental aspect, and some polarising into the same aspects but instead forming organisations filled with other clones following that aspect. (The climax is when the organisations get swiped out from under their anti-government leaders by clones who have borrowed the governments' resources to become even more compelling representations of those aspects than the leaders who set the organisations up.))
