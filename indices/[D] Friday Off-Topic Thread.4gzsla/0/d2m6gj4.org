I need a sort of "offensiveness check".

I have a short story that's most of the way written which has, as the central premise, that in 1970 a pill was invented which changes homosexuals and bisexuals into heterosexuals. The story is then partly an alternate history of the gay rights movement and partly a meditation on personal identity, social pressure, and terminal/instrumental values.

Part of offensiveness is in terms of presentation, which I'm doing my best on. I'm more worried about the other half, which is things that I just don't understand as being offensive. And I don't really mind offending people, I just want to do it for the right reasons.

So is the counterfactual premise of there being a way to no longer be gay irredeemably offensive? Is the idea that some people would choose to be straight and others would choose to be gay offensive?
