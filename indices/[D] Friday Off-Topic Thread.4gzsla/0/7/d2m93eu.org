  in 1970 a pill was invented which changes homosexuals and bisexuals into heterosexuals → some people choose to be straight and others choose to be gay

I think the only way such a story would be(come) offensive just with this is if the story's narrative was making it so. For instance, if a premise like this was used to tell:

- how of course /all/ gay people would decide to change their preferences if given the valid chance, or
- how the only people who refused to take the pill were also mentally ill, or
- that the majority of gays took the pill and now the population in general had the right to ignore the rights of the rest or to re-evaluate them as being mentally ill, etc.

  And I don't really mind offending people, I just want to do it for the right reasons.

You can't do that as you can't be non-offending in general --- it's like rule 34, there will always be someone offended by it, no matter what “is” is.

Regarding the offensiveness of modification of traits that define a person's self-identiy: if we use an analogy for this, then the answer comes as obviously negative as well. Is a premise of people changing their gender (species, from organic to inorganic or synthetic, etc) offensive by itself?
