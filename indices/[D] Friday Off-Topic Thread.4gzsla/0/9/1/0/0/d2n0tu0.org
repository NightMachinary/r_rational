It doesn't make people more or less masculine/feminine, it only changes sexual orientation. So if you're an effeminate gay man prior to taking the pill, you'd be an effeminate straight man afterward, and if you're a masculine gay man you'll end up as a masculine straight man.

As for hormone therapy ... it's tough, because we don't /actually/ know what causes sexual orientation or how it might be medically altered, which is part of why the story is just going to leave the mechanism blank. There are some scattered reports of people changing sexual orientation during transition already, but so far as I'm concerned the actual science is thin on the ground (there are some contested papers on the matter, I believe). It's not going to feature in the story at all and the question will be left as an exercise for the reader.
