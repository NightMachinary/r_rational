  offending people unnecessarily is bad
#+end_quote

That depends greatly upon one's definition of 'necessary'. If you call any case of offending someone that had a better net utility than the other options 'necessary' then I can agree.

  One non-audience-member is less important than one audience member, but there are millions of them.
#+end_quote

It seems like you should be using a statistical distribution of the likely audience here. In other words you should sum over each human's (potential offense * likelyhood of reading.) That takes everyone unlikely to be in the audience into account in the same way as those that are probably in the audience.

#+begin_quote
  I know that I avoid things that unnecessarily break my cultural standards for "offensiveness" even if I'm not offended by it, and I assume that other people do too.
#+end_quote

This seems illogical. Even if reading something offensive to others brings vast swaths of personal utility to yourself, you still avoid it simply because it is offensive to others? Certainly there might be risks associated with other people finding out, but at some point the benefits must outweigh the costs. Unless of course that has simply never happened to you?
