  Define 'Offensive' in either objective or at least intersubjective terms first.

I usually split words like "offensive" (and "annoying", "attractive," "compelling", "provocative" etc.) into a few pieces when thinking about them. It doesn't describe what the word itself /truly/ means, but that's not the part of the language that I have problems with.

1. Would this offend me, personally?
2. Would this offend the audience/bystanders?
3. Would this offend people who would /not/ see it, if they actually did see it?
4. Does this match a culture's standards for "what is offensive", regardless of the answers to 1, 2, and 3?

#1 is pretty much a moot point here, but it acts as a proxy for #2 since we are likely to be part of the audience.

#2 is probably what people care about the most, as offending people unnecessarily is bad, and the audience is a large number of people.

#3 is a safety check, in case you're wrong about who will see the content. One non-audience-member is less important than one audience member, but there are millions of them.

#4 is a bit odd, but it still affects people's behaviors. I know that I avoid things that unnecessarily break my cultural standards for "offensiveness" even if I'm not offended by it, and I assume that other people do too.
