Define 'Offensive' in either objective or at least intersubjective terms first. Until then I can only really say that /I/ don't find it offensive. But I don't find anything offensive, and ∀x(∃y(ishuman(y)∧findsoffensive(y, x)) so...

  So is the counterfactual premise of there being a way to no longer be gay irredeemably offensive?

#+begin_quote
  Is the idea that some people would choose to be straight and others would choose to be gay offensive?
#+end_quote

I'm fairly certain that this would legitimately be the case in said scenario, and I think it's ethically reasonable to explore the likely outcomes of a thought experiment through writing regardless of whether people find it offensive.
