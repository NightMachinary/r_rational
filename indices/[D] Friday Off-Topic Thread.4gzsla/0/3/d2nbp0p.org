Interestingly, this is less counterfactual than you might think. The deaf community has been rocked by the advent of cochlear implants, which is for most purposes a cure for congenital deafness. Some in the community feel that it is a form of genocide, wiping our their culture because "normal" folks consider them impaired, while others consider it a godsend. Those two groups don't get along well, and there's been a rather large cultural upheaval among the deaf community ever since cochlear implants became possible.
