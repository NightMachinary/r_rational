  The DSMV, at one point in time, did in fact list homosexuality.

The DSM did indeed list it as a disorder, way back before 1973. It was removed from the DSM-II, though some form of it remained for another version or two. Today it's widely understood as the outdated perspectives of the past affecting clinical perspectives: whether people consider it a disorder is not the same thing as it being one.

By whose justification? Certainly not mine, and probably not yours, but the question is about common perceptions.

By most accounts, the modern, Western argument for removing foreskins is a medical one. The data doesn't support the perspective, as far as I'm aware, and the religious or Puritanical roots of the practice aren't often brought up, but if you actually ask people, it very much is considered by circumcision advocates as a positive health decision.

Even putting that aside however, the problem with comparing things like foreskin and small breasts with homosexuality as a "socially created condition" however is that they're not nearly as tied with identity and agency, and not nearly as politicized.
