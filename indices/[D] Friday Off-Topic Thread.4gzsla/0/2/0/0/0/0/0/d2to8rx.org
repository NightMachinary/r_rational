Catch-22 comes to mind (though it uses a converse instead of a contrapositive, fallaciously). "Willingness to fight as part of a nation's army (significantly increased risk of all those things) is a mental disorder! Applying for discharge on the basis of a mental disorder shows that you must be sane! (And thus not eligible for discharge.)"

Edit: A better example might be {a waiver that you have to sign to enter} which disallows you from entering.
