I'm gay and I do not find it offensive. I would take it for the same reason most straight couples do not choose to adopt: I want to be able to have children with the person I marry who have traits from both of us, and I'd like to be able to do it without asking permission from a third party, and barring centuries of discovery in genetic engineering overnight that's impossible for me. I think I'm a minority in that respect. If I could choose freely I'd be 50-50 bisexual until I'm ready to marry, then marry a woman.
