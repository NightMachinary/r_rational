  How do their intentions or motivations matter if I'm dead?

I mostly agree with this one. You can really only afford mercy when you're not weak. To the point where the other party isn't even a threat to you. Otherwise you'll always run the risk of them hurting you or those you love. I'm very much against letting my enemies live.
