Without going into too much detail (should you decide to play it the rest of the way through), it helped solidify the concept of taking an approach to social situations focused more on reconciliation. The themes of kindness even in the face of those who mean you ill in particular resonated with me, because the game makes it clear that everyone has reasons for why they act the way they do, from common enemies you fight throughout areas (It's said that magic [the way they attack] is their way of expressing themselves, like body language) to those who are fighting you with the intent to do harm.
