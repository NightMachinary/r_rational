They made 3.5 of these for /Gundam/! /DWG1/ was somewhat lackluster, in my opinion, but still fun. /2/ was pretty good, but had a very irksome inter-character friendship system that relied a lot on random chance. I can't think of any complaints for /3/. (I haven't yet gotten the 3.5^{th} game in the series, /Reborn/.)

I have next to zero experience with main-series /Dynasty Warriors/ games, but I /think/ that the /DWG/ series (except, glaringly, /DWG1/) has one very major additional mechanic that makes it better than the main series: the ability to use dash combos infinitely until your boost meter is depleted and must be recharged (or until the ace manages to boost out of your combo). The lack of this (in addition to nigh-impossible one-on-one ace fights) is what really made /DWG1/ annoying, in comparison with the other /DWG/ games:\\
- Mash =square= and =triangle=, killing all the grunts around you with a massive combo\\
- Stop mashing =square= and =triangle=, and wait for your mobile suit to stop swinging its weapon\\
- Hit =cross= to boost to the next group of grunts\\
- Repeat\\
While, in /DWG2/3/3.5/, it's like this:\\
- Mash =square= and =triangle=, killing all the grunts around you with a massive combo\\
- Hit =cross= and =square= to Dash Attack to/through the next group of grunts\\
- Hit =cross= to stop the dash combo with an Emergency Dash--or just keep hitting =cross=/=square=/=triangle= to continue the dash combo\\
- Repeat\\
It's much less repetitive, in my opinion.
