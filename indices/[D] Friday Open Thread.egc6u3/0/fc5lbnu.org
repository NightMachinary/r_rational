[[https://i.imgur.com/5x2kMlt.jpg][WHO WOULD WIN in a competition between my dog and my cat?]]

Let's say they compete to knock each other off the above log, because they may be rivals, but they're still friends :]

[[https://i.imgur.com/c5jbLC8.jpg][PIPSQUEAK (DOG)]]:

+ Heavier (12 lbs)

+ Heavily armored

+ Longer reach and teeth

+ Far more fighting experience (14y)

- Not as limber as in youth

- Nuclear sclerosis may limit vision

- Most teeth removed

[[https://i.imgur.com/uucxPom.jpg][MONTE (CAT)]]:

+ Cat, with cat-like reflexes

+ More versatile and pointy claws

+ Very sneaky

+ Can do a pull-up

- Poor depth perception and field-of-view

- Smol boi (7 lbs @ 8 months)

- Easily distracted by rustling leaves, passing birds

(PS, Monte was on leash here, I just magic-wanded it out)
