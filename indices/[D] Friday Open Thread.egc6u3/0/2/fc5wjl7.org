  - Smol boi (7 lbs @ 8 months)

Cats can continue growing to their adult size until like 18 months, so it could just be that. However, generally cats are expected to gain about a pound a month, so you'd expect more like 8lbs rather than 7lbs.

One of my girls is 7.5lbs at /five years/. Sometimes cats just turn out smaller than average.

Smol gurl is the second cat I got. She and the first cat were each at about eight months when I got them, the third was at ~2ish years, and the fourth was at probably right around 5-and-a-half weeks.

Rescued that last one from the side of a highway, she was literally on the actual road and probably would've been run over within the next 3 minutes if we hadn't stopped the car and scooped her up. Her being too young to be separated from her mother led me to do a great deal of research into raising a tiny baby kitten, so I learned (for the first time since getting the first cat in 2012) that a cat is still technically considered a kitten until 12 months, and that you should still be feeding them kitten food until then. Kitten food has more taurine in it than adult food because kittens need more taurine than adults since they're in a growth stage.

Maybe my smol gurl wouldn't be quite as small if I'd known to feed her kitten food for the first four months of having her, rather than putting her directly on adult food.

The third one turned out to have already been fixed when we took him to the vet (we assume he was abandoned since he was starving with ribs clearly and distinctly visible), so Smol Gurl is might be the only cat to have been spayed as late as 8 months. I had the youngest spayed at 3 months. Spaying earlier apparently leads to a larger adult size.

So if Monte isn't still eating kitten food, and if he hasn't already been neutered, then those are things to think about. I'm not making assumptions about whether or not you've already thought about those things, I'm just putting it out there because I didn't know those things myself until my fourth cat. If he's already neutered and still eating kitten food, then, hey, sometimes cats is just smol.
