Ha! Love it!

Incidentally, Monte is overwhelmingly better at fetch than Pipsqueak. We're lucky to get the latter to run after anything we throw (he also has 0 prey drive when it comes to squirrels, birds, etc.), but the former will retrieve toys, bottlecaps, etc. for hours, dropping them in my lap with a meow for them to be thrown again.
