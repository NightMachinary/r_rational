  What sort of handicap do you think would be enough to even the match
#+end_quote

I won't vouch for the validity of any of these ideas, but they are ideas.

Change the rules:

- Violence allowed
- Or, only valid threatening behavior is licking
- Play in a trench, animal must escape instead
- Put beds on the log. Adjust comfort to even the odds (give Monte a box, Pipsqueak a pillow)
- Put food off the log. Adjust tastiness to even the odds.

Change the game:

- Frisbee retrieval (size disk appropriately, or make it out of dog treats to undo Pipsqueak advantage)
- Sumo wresting (flanking allowed)
- A race (Monte likely to get distracted)
- Soccer (mass advantage for Pipsqueak)
- Likes on Social Media (both your animals are very cute)
- Coinflip (inherently close to fair)
- First to successfully crack P=NP wins (everyone loses)
- Animal fashion modelling (everyone wins)
