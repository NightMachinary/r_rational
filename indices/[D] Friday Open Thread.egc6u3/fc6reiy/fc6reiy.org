I'm behind on the latest chapters of Animorphs: The Reckoning. I know this is heinous as it was always the update I looked most forward to seeing. Can someone please comment something to the effect of "OMG magicweasel, the chapters you've not yet read are awesome, you really should get on it" so that way I can read them.

In related news I've been sorting through my bookshelf and made a pile of books I need to read. I think I'm going to try and read them (all?) in 2020.

--------------

In further related news my 2020 is going to be hectic:

- Trip to LA / SF in Feb (hit me up anyone who wants to meet up with me, CouteauBleu and SvalbardCaretaker can both confirm I didn't murder them, or if I did murder them I replaced them with bots based on GPT2 of their posts)

- Probably going to have to apply for a promotion in Feb too, and government jobs take about 12 hours of work to apply for (I actually have a decent chance of getting it, like, 25% probably??)

- French boyfriend coming to visit for March

- Studying part time from Feb-June

- ~Month in Paris in July

- Studying part time from August-November

- Want to finish Vampire Flower Language Volume 1 (about 7 chapters uploaded)

- I have a full time job, by the way

... actually that's not so bad. It's really the first three months that are going to be hectic.

--------------

Finally, this is the year I really have started putting beeminder goals for like everything. I realised I haven't played the new pokemon game as much as I wanted to because I was playing Tower Defense on my phone instead, so I have literally made a beeminder goal for playing the new pokemon game, which is cray, because I'm like optimising my leisure time because that's apparently how Type A I am now?

--------------

And my motto that I've had since the middle of November and will have through the end of 2020 is "No Fucks Given". I got it from an enamel badge I bought, and it's proving instructive.
