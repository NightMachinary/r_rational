The DM has added winks and nods in the form of anagrams and puns all over Aerb, so it isn't implausible they would add them to an Earth sim.

Given all the other oddities (Cidium being over a million years old while Aerb is only 30,000 years old) and improbabilities the DM has pulled off (Aerb versions of Juniper and friends living out lives nearly identical to their Earth counterparts), it wouldn't be that hard for the DM to either simulate a midwestern town with a weird name in isolation as opposed to a full Earth or to simulate a full Earth with a fabricated midwestern town and then put an anti meme effect on the town's odd name.

If Joon switched through various derogatory nicknames, I wouldn't consider this theory, but he uses the name Bumblefuck even in contexts that aren't derogatory. Still given the quasi-SI nature avoiding using a real town name makes sense.
