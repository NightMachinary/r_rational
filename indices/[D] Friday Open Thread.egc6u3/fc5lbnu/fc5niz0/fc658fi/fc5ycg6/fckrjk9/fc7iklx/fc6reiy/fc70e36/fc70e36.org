  Can someone please comment something to the effect of "OMG magicweasel, the chapters you've not yet read are awesome, you really should get on it" so that way I can read them.

It's not clear what chapter you stopped reading... so I might spoil something... the animorph's efforts to communicate to the rest of the world has pushed the conflict with the Yeerks to a global scope, to the point that the Animorphs struggle to find ways to meaningful contribute, until a few more Elimist/Crayak shenigans gives them a few key opportunities. Esplin (Visser 3) continues to be devious and several canon elements are introduced and remixed in creative rationalist ways.
