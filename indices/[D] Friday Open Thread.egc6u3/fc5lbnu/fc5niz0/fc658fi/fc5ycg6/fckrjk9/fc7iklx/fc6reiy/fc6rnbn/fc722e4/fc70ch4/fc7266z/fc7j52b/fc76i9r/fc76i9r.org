Does it count as suffering if you enjoy it? I feel like if this was only physical pain, this would be an easy out, or just find the least sentient creature that is capable of feeling pain and go to town on them. Without the emotional pain part, I don't think there would be any good reason to use human suffering which would kind of remove most of the conflict from the magic system.
