So I've been toying around with an idea where magic, at its core, is kind of evil/bad, the rules for which are that "mana" can only be obtained by causing suffering. This brings up a lot of interesting questions about how to get mana in the most moral ways (probably self-harm) and how exactly you'd go about measuring suffering. Which brings us to a scenario I have for yall, let's say you sneak into someone's house in the dead of night, waterboard them for hours then dry them off, use magic to delete their memories of the torture, and put them back to sleep. They'll probably wake up exhausted with something like a super bad sore throat but that'll be the extent of their suffering (I'm probably oversimplifying the potential physical dangers of waterboarding here but I'm having trouble thinking of another way to cause intense physical/psychological suffering without also causing severe injury). Where does this rank on the immorality scale? It obviously isn't a moral act (unless maybe you juxtapose it against the costs of letting the Bad Guys win because they're willing to do worse stuff to gain more mana), but is it worse than torturing animals? What if the person agrees to be tortured in exchange for money/something, is it still immoral? Is it immoral to only torture "bad" people, essentially going the Dexter route? It should probably be noted, that by wiping the victim's memory of the torture, you are preventing a steady trickle of mana that would come from their lifelong trauma.
