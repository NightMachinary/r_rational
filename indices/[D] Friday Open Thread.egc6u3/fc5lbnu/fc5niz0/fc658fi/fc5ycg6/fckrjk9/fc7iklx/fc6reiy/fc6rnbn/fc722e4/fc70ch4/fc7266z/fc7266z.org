> Is it immoral to only torture "bad" people, essentially going the Dexter route?

Yes,although you could say it's lower on the immorality scale than torturing innocents, since if someone really needs to torture it's better than it is the worst people.But It still rates very low on the morality scale and you should really make sure its the only way, and preferably not do it at all.

I'm not going to say that you should never torture people for power since your specific scenario sounds like it could lead to some situations where that is actually the best choice, but I will say you should act like that's the case since otherwise you are likely to rationalize yourself into doing horrible things instead of finding out a better option.

Especially since its doing bad things for power, humans generally can't be trusted with doing bad things to get power to do good things.Instead you could just get someone that is a big masochist and or turn yourself into one and then get mana trough self harm, and enjoy it.Like in Efflugence [[https://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8579.html?style=site]]

Or you could maybe cause mild inconveniences to lots of people instead depending on how mana scales.
