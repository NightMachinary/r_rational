[[/u/VapeKarlMarx]] Sorry for the double reply and direct ping, but in case you are not aware of it, there is a IMNSHO an epic creation myth for your faction: Ashtosan the grey necromancer. Audio tale with the just released prequel is here: [[https://youtu.be/wSGek9VitHQ]] (there's 2 other videos in that channel that tell a creation story of a settlement of intelligent undead from the POV of a generally law/good inclined adventuring party that also includes a morally ambiguous necromancer whose origin is in the linked tale). OP is username [[/u/FelixLaVulpe]] (giving credit/making search easier for someone else, my apologies if pulling you in somewhere unfamiliar) and inspired my original post about the faction with his outline of what the settlement ends up as here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/6dhjd5/of_undead_understanding_the_dead_exodus/di2wtch/]]

I'm very uncharacteristically still up early in my local, so apologies in advance for typo's, unwanted pings, and or any offense (It was unintended).

Edit: (a typo) & Hey, even if they are undead and working toward The culture AKA "full luxury automated queer transhumanist space communism". I'm going to assume you take away their founder, think about history of political development in light of their circumstances starting from an enlighten dictator who didn't plan on (whatever removed/transcended them) for more than five minutes and then decide on a starting point for the slow superintelligence they are. They have the browning motion of humanity, clade distinctions an conflicts of interests, the new lore adding material components to making intelligent undead provides a significant market undead for rare goods down to the level of everyone who has a missed relative, there's a lot of "merely human" stories as grist for your mill they try to make their way from a immortal, possibly sense deprived, or hoping to be sense deprived, (think intelligent zombie or skeleton) middle aged lower classes, to The Culture.
