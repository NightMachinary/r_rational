The endpoint of the story, or the endpoint goals of the faction?

The rationalist faction is probably going to want to make peace with the other factions. There will be plenty of kings, officials, adventurers, and even ideologies opposed to cooperation. Nevermind that they are undead, those who live by war don't want an end to war. Of course, the undead thing is an easier sell. Instant conflict, as you said. Resolving the sources of conflict can be the interesting part of the campaign.

I'd end the story itself when a major barrier to cooperation is removed (violently or otherwise) and leave the end state of the universe to the imagination of the players. As for the space communism, maybe getting outside the light cone is a challenge they'd approach.
