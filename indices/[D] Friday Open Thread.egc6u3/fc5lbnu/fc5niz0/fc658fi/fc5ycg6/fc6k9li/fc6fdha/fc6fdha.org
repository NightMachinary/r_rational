In addition to what others have mentioned, I think that any rational storyline in the DnD setting needs to deal with the gods. If everyone is happy in the afterlife, why do you want immortality on the material plane? Could a better world happen in which the focus were to convert everyone to the dieties that had the best afterlives? This could easily result in either the characters finding themselves dissatisfied with the available afterlives, finds that the afterlives don't quite work as advertised, or that a supermajority of the gods are against undeads and will actively oppose them in their dream for an undead utopia. Any adventure that involves battling gods can easily become dramatically satisfying, though you need to be careful in how you define gods and their powers.

Suppose I was in the OOtS campaign I would have major objections both to the dwarven afterlife(modelled after a christian view of the nordic afterlives in which it's aweful to die not fighting) and for the Snarl.
