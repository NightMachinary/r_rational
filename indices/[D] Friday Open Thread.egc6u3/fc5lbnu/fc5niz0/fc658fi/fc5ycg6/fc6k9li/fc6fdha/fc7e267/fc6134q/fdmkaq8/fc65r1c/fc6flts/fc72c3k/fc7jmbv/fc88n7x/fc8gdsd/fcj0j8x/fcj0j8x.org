The prisoner's dilemma only holds up if cooperating with that particular person is worth the risk and you have a reason to believe that they will act rationally too. Living followers of an undead hating deity probably won't. And medieval peasants that can't survive on your land and aren't able to produce anything you value other than corpses may not be worth cooperating with.
