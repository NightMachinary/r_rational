What are your rational faction's values and goals? Being rational doesn't mean being good. Or Good, which might matter to the various gods of the setting. Also, even if they are rational they might still lack crucial knowledge about all kinds of subjects, like medicine, psychology, the scientific method, or who knows what else.

For example if your rational polity decides, given the information readily available to them, that convincing religious mortals aligned with nations and powers with incompatible values is not worth the effort and/or if they only care about the life and happiness of a certain subset of people, then it would make sense to ally with the Evil gods and religions against the Good ones that have undead smiting as a major part of their doctrine. But said Evil gods and religions may also ve actually evil, simply having agreed to not bring suffering to the citizen of Rationalia as part of their mutually beneficial pacts.
