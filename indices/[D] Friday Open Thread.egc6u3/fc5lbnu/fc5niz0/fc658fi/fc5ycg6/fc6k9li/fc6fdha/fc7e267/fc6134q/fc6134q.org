think. whats availible, how can we use it? what are the options? what costs will you pay to get what you want?

for D&D, dont forget the warforged as another option that needs no food or water. and in general 'everyone hates you' is a much bigger problem, because it implies adventurers wanting to murder you more often. possibly high level adventurers.

for adventure... you always need more materials to make things with. some materials are from dangerous monsters, and now the undead need to hire adventurers to get things for them. could even be an open bounty.

the next problem, is what is luxury to the dead? why, they could just lock themsleves in a tomb and stay hidden for a hundred years or so. boring, but safer than being exposed to everyone hating them. and for that matter, would it be better to move to another plane? the githyanki went to the astral where they dont age, or need food or water.
