What is the ultimate endpoint of a rational story? I am making a DnD campaign and I am trying to make a rationalist faction. They are undead so they don't have to die or worry about food,efficiently rational. The regular fantasy kingdoms all hate them, instant conflict.

I can't develop a plot that is both emotionally and narratively satisfying about it though. Everything ends up with full luxury automated queer transhumanist space communism. Which is rad, but not a dramatic adventure. Or if I turn the rationalism down, it just gnaws at the back of my mind they could be doing better
