  Let's say they compete to knock each other off the above log

I missed that at first. I say definitely Monte, b/c a dog approaching a hissing cat will reflexively do flanking behavior. Pipsqueak will fall off the log. Claws hurt, and we don't forget that fact even in friendly competitions. I'd probably lose to Monte for the same reason.

Also Pipsqueak looks wizened, far too wise to terrorize a youthful cat over a contest that he can easily forfeit by jumping down. An older dog is smart enough to pick his battles.
