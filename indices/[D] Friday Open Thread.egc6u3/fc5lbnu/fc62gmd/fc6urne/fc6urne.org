That does seem to be the consensus from those I'd asked. What sort of handicap do you think would be enough to even the match (to, say, each side winning 5/10 times?). What if Monte had an eye patch on? Or was mildly intoxicated (say, to the equivalent of a human at BAC 0.08%)?

You are right in that Pipsqueak would forfeit first. Monte tries to play with him as he would with another cat, but that's not a language the pup understands. So he mostly just runs away ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
