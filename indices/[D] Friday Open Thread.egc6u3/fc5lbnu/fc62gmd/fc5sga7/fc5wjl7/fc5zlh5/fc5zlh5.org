Ah, thank you for the advice :] in this case I'd say he's more a smol boi right now, and in comparison to the pup -- everyone seems to think he'll grow up to be quite big, and from looking at charts e.g. [[https://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/10.2460/javma.255.2.205][here]] he may have a few more pounds in him yet.

Otherwise, he was castrated pretty early and is on a (fairly regimented) AAFCO All Life Stages diet. I think that should be sufficient for development and growth (my partner's not a nutritionist but has rotated through a veterinary nutrition block and they seem cool with it).
