I think bodyweight is more important than others are giving credit to here.

- Assuming they're in a one-off competition, I'd give it to the cat 3:2.

- Give each of a them training on the combat log every day for a week and I'd give it to the dog 3:1.

- Bloodlusted (but still not /actually/ hurting each other), I'd say dog 10:1.
