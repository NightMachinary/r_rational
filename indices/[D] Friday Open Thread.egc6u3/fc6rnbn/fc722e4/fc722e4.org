If you're allowing animal suffering, you could probably just install capture equipment around factory farms and end up with more mana than humanity would know what to do with.

Actually, this might be a pretty nice world. Assuming you can objectively measure suffering, if you could make sufficiently precise suffering detectors, you could use it for all sorts of applications. You could walk into a store and buy a mattress that is proven to reduce suffering by 21 microfloggings a night versus their nearest competitor.
