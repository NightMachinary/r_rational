Yup, that gets discussed sometimes. Three issues, in increasing order of importance:

- It's really hard to estimate the expected value of that kind of intervention.

- It's political, which will alienate people (which reduces donations). Right now a conservative, a libertarian, a communist and your grandma can get together and agree that more mosquito nets would be nice, yay EA. Not so if EA starts to be about e.g. establishing a carbon tax, or redirecting military budget towards foreign aid.

- It's a crowded market. We can expect all the low-hanging briberies have already been done, and now you're just committing your piddling strength to a zero-sum tug-of-war. The biggest EA wins are where nobody else gives a shit.
