The town definitely isn't literally called Bumblefuck. Even if his town were a simulation, which seems like a bit of a narrative dead end, it would have to be a poor simulation, or at least one highly divergent from ours, to have a Midwestern town be called a derogatory term for Midwestern towns. If that were changed, the whole origin world or simulation would have to have a series of other changes to support it, which isn't in the text.

He does call it Bumblefuck highly consistently, but I think that's a function of AW not wanting to name the town but having to refer to it relatively often. It does sometimes feel like sour note..it feels bitter to call your town that a few times but fully pathological to call it that every single time. Not really inconsistent with the characterization, though.

Any word on when the next chapters will drop?
