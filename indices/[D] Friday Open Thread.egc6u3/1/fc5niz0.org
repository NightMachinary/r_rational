Some miscellaneous thoughts after (an out of order) rereading of Worth The Candle:

- Joon eats Elk strips while at the barren jewel hotel. Many chapters later we learn that elk are extinct but an entad called the Jade Elk mass produces Elk which are slaughtered for their meat.

- Rereading old comments, I saw someone speculate that Joon's Earth is a simulation also because his hometown is literally called Bumblefuck. I thought this was an over literal reading, but on reread, Joon consistently refers to it as Bumblefuck not just as a description, but also as a literal proper noun, so this is a more convincing than I first thought.

- I can see several places were the Outer Reaches anti-meme might have cut off conversations and line of thought. In particular, the discussion with Heshnel's group that turned violent might have had a major and critical discussion because it is so similar to the Dungeon Master. This could be why Valencia was thrown off so hard and it could have influenced the direction of the conversation in a way that pushed O'kald and Evertt to violence and left Joon's team with no memory of it.

- side note: I think I missed if they checked: can spirit magic effect/sense Valencia? (If not she can't help them with the Outer Reaches stuff).

- I can see in hindsight I can clearly see how Joon doesn't give Fenn enough credit or take her serious... but this definitely doesn't justify Valencia, indeed it seems like something they could work out and change their habits.

- All the stuff with Bethel's threats are painful to read in hindsight...
