Your rational undead faction is a slow AI; a growing corporation; a growing area of positive growth or a cancer. It just dep[ends on perspective. Every other faction is made of people they could add to their numbers and using land they could desecrate (making it better for undead), so whatever their goals they will want to expand, possibly slowly and through legislation, possibly through portals and blitzkrieg, if your friends are like minded, and you care for big video gamish plots you might have a sobering story by making them a faction to be put down or assisted in taking a neighboring kingdom/ the world/ the plane.

If you want them as a semi static but no reed richard is useless faction make them slowly expanding: demesis near them will be conquered between stories with any stored treasures and cohorts lost, nearby villages with contacts are still there when re-visted, but have been coqured or co-opted and some notables died in the process. The grey steppes (or whatever you name them) are welcoming to those who can survive and do not abuse the mindless undead on their periphery (those that they have not yet recovered from their first death, as the process does take time and skilled undead, but who provide a cheap first line defense and will eventually be returned as incorporeal intelligent undead if struck down)

You don't need any big plots: their slow meticuliously planned campaign of expansion, and the contracts between the quality of un-life within their border, the pain outside an the horror of the expansion should give you all you need. As enemies every perosn is competent level appropriate threats in a optimized OODA loop, as patrons they are welcoming, generously equipping, scarilly prepared, and very tight on operational details as the players (assumedly) are not yet undead so their loyalties are questionable.
