  I guess this is more metaethical I figure any sufficently rational actor would end up being good.

Could you elaborate? Also, you could always have them not be "sufficiently" rational for that. Just more rational than most of everyone else. Have undeath seriously hamper with innate compassion and instead have their society based on enlightened self-interest, with that translating into literally not caring about the peasantry of foreign nations insofar those people can't help them in any way that would be worth the effort.

Or else, make them act rationally good in ways abhorrent to outsiders. Like, obviously the life of a wild animal is one of suffering, so a spell that sterilizes all non-magical non-sentients in an area is the best and most efficient act possible to lessen net suffering. And since without animals, the need for food, the ability to smell or taste, or the same ability as humans to appreciate natural beauty, plants aren't really needed, there is zero reason to work on containing all the negative energy that is blighting the earth due to blatant use of necromantic magicks.
