I guess this is more metaethical I figure any sufficently rational actor would end up being good.

You are right that good and DnDâ„¢ Good are probably two separate ideas and that was kinda what I thought would be fun to explore with the faction.

Cause think about any of the Good gods still invovled in the blood war. An afterlife of good where you do have to worry about demon invasion still seems kinda iffy.

An immortal existence of playing chess with other skeletons could easily be preferable.
