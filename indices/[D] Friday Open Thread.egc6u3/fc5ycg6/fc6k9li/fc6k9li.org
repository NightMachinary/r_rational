Rational doesn't mean intelligent, well-informed, powerful, etc. In DnD terms, being strictly rational is more along the lines of having 20+ Wis. I don't think an undead rational faction is so different from the trope of a single high Wis mastermind lich/necromancer with endless hordes of undead.

Also, why not have FLAQTSC as a goal? Tonnes of DnD campaigns have the ultimate endpoint of 'the party ascends to godhood and saves the world'. It certainly makes a lot of sense for a faction to strive towards imposing their idea of utopia on the universe.

As for the dramatic adventure, consider the perspective of the min-max murder hobo treasure goblin. Burgle kingdom treasuries of rare magical artifacts, manipulate fools where possible into profitable trade deals, cheese dungeons where ever possible for sweet loot. All this for the purpose of gaining power, preferably discretely, and eventual apotheosis.

Overall, I don't really see how a rational faction would differ so significantly from a typical fantasy faction beyond the high Wis aspect.
