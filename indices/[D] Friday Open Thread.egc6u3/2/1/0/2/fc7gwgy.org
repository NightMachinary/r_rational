If that's the case, better to just give the account to a trusted friend and/or arbiter that can change your password so that the process is reversible. Either way is a form of precommitment, but while a reversible version is a lesser precommitment, it potentially preserves something that has some value to you. Besides that, there's a risk that after three months or so you find yourself just making a new account, or get used to browsing without an account, or otherwise adapting to the inconvenience, in which case it would be better to be able to go back to an old, established account. (I would probably give your account holder a timeframe before which you should absolutely not get your account back, as well as a questionnaire to your future self in case you decide, for whatever reason, to pick the account back up.)
