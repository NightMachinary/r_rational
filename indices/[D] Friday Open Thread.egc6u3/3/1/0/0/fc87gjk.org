Yes, you can make all kinds of interesting scenarios. I personally would have more fun in a complicated scenario i.e. the good gods don't have the mojo to do something about the abyss/hells, the good gods have to accept abyss/hell because the evil TM gods help them against the ancient ones or smt.

I do wonder what happens with an atheists soul in such a setting?

I am amused by the idea that reality is a big harvest field and the gods continued existance relies on a flow of soulfood. Haven't seen legacy of kain, do you recommend?
