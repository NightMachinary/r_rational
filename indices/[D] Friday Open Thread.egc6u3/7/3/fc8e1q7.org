In /The Ur-Quan Masters/, there is mention of a device called an 'Excruciator', which works by directly stimulating the pain nerves of the wearer, leaving him/her/it in constant, excruciating pain (hence the name) but not actually harming him. There, it's used as a defense against hostile mind control (since anyone trying to control your mind also feels the pain you feel) but it strikes me that, in the world you postulate, a mage may well go around wearing an Excruciator in order to increase his power...
