So as of right now there's the Sasuke betrayal and the atkatsuki as the general issues the story needs to resolve, right? I really want Naruto to lean into Kurama like he did in canon, I think that bond is still really rational. Has to be munchkinable.

Also I loved the sharingan/gates revelation, that shit is the pinnacle of taking canon and making it rational.
