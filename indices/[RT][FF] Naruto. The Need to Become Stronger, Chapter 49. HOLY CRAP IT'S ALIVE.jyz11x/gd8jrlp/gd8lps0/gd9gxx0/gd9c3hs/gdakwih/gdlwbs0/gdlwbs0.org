Whoops, I forgot to reply to this.

Sasuke and Akatsuki loom pretty big on the horizon, yeah. But there are also broader issues like Naruto's attempts to teach his peers how the world really works, the Ninja system being messed up, Sakura being kidnapped etc. As far as I'm concerned every major character has their own arc that comes complete with their own issue which the story needs to resolve (Unlike canon which just... never does. The Hyuga clan etc.).

Good news: Kurama definitely has more of a role in coming chapters. I can't have Naruto rely too much on ol' Kura-chan though because that would violate rational fiction's #1 rule of not being allowed to solve problems by just being massively OP. :P

I'm glad you liked the Sharingan/Gates stuff! Explaining canon weirdness is always a challenge, but that makes it all the more rewarding when it works out.
