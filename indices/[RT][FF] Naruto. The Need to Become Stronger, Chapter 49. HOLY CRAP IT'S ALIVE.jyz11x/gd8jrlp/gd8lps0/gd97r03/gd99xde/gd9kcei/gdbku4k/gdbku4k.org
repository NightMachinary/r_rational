Isn't the thing you dislike about LUTD something that only really happens initially, when the stakes are low?

Also, I assume when it comes to your criticism of MfD, your issue is with the survival of specifically the MC's team? Can you really blame the writers of a quest because their players managed to play well? Anyway, at least one character that matters to the MC did die and drop the floor from under us.
