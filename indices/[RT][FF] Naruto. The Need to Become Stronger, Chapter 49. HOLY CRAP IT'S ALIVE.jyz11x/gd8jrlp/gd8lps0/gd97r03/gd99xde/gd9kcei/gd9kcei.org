I'll second the Waves Arisen recommendation - it's still my all time favorite Naruto fanfic aside from my own. I really admire how good the author is at moving the plot along and conveying emotion with just a few words. Definitely something I've tried to learn from.

(I recently reread chapter 22, the attack on the Mist, and hoo boy did I like words a lot back then. Some of those paragraphs are thicker than my forearm. Sheesh.)

I also recently reread [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654967/1/Black-Cloaks-Red-Clouds][Black Cloaks, Red Clouds]], a fanfic from Tenten's POV. It's dead, sadly, but I did like a lot of the interesting concepts and the sense of having multiple sides each with their own perspective. I stole some ideas from this fic so I figure I owe it a rec, even if it does have a few flaws (for the love of god author stop having characters "murmur" everything. Just use "said" like a normal person.)

I liked the concept of Marked for Death but I feel like it gravitated more towards just being a regular fic since none of the characters ever died despite the premise. It's also, uh, a *lot* to read, especially if you try to read the reader inputs as well to understand why decisions were made (seriously don't). I loved [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-308#post-5665240][this scene]], though!

I found Lighting up the Dark to be a little too silly to really count as Rationalfic. The whole concept of a "Nine-Brained Demon Fox" is something that's better suited for an Omake IMO. More importantly, I maintain that realism is a prerequisite for rationality, because otherwise the whole optimization aspect doesn't really work. Sure, Naruto basing his strategies on manga stories is funny, but it makes it feel like character decisions and outcomes are based on rule of funny which kind of defeats the point. I think one of the reasons why people like my action scenes so much is because the characters treat them like actual life-or-death situations.

But, that's just my two cents!
