Thanks for the rec. I read the first few chapters, but so far I feel like there's not nearly enough plot tension. I mean, chapter 1 has a scene where nothing happens except Asuma and Kurenai get together and it literally ends with Naruto going "well, that was boring and pointless". The next few chapters are the same.

The extra world building also seems a bit redundant: Lots of random "as you know..." scenes that only serve to slow down the story and prevent it from going anywhere. A hundred years of history are added... why? It still ends with the Third being in charge and Naruto being the Kyubi's host etc. And it doesn't fix any of the stuff that makes no sense such as Naruto growing up as an orphan, so what's the point of it?

I'm afraid I might be starting to sound like a dick so I'll stop there, but I have to admit I'm starting to feel really confused. Why does NTBS keep getting rated lower than stories like these? I looked up a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDOumXUQsn6qrRtqE-0R-DXULllAW_gTi_7z6nvS0oU/edit][list of top Naruto fanfics]] the other day, and not only was NTBS not mentioned, but the "gold standard" for Naruto combat scenes was... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9599662/6/Team-Seven-Shinobi-At-War][this Sakura vs Mizuki fight]].

I must be doing something wrong, but I'll be damned if I know what.
