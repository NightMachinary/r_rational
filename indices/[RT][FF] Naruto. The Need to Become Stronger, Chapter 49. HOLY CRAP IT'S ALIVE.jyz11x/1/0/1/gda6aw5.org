Not exactly a /rational/ fanfiction, but definitely a crunchier, harder fiction that I don't know I've seen mentioned on this subreddit, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9250029/1/Shinobi-Team-7][Shinobi: Team 7]] is easily the best Naruto fanfiction I've read. It's discontinued, with a reboot currently being put out by the writer. It adds history and culture to a world that desperately needed it - without feeling anchored in exposition - and the prose is frequently delightful, which is so rare in fanfiction.
