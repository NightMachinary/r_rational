I didn't read all of LUTD so I can't say for sure, but the last time I checked was somewhere during the Chunin exams. The characters were doing wisecracks while throwing deadly weapons at each other and explaining their moves, anime-style. "Actually, you thought I was gonna do X, but I knew that you knew I would think that so..." I really don't wanna complain about it too much, but I don't think that stuff is rational.

When it comes to MFD, I am genuinely impressed with all the work and effort they put into the world and how consistently they managed to update it. Especially considering all the user input they have to compile on top of that! But, it just isn't the story I was expecting to read when I first saw the premise. I thought it would be a death world fic, with characters set in a super realistic setting where the readers have to think like actual ninjas to survive. Instead, it kind of became a slice of life fic, with the main character changing personality from scarily efficient killer into a goofy anime protagonist with a weird list fetish. :p
