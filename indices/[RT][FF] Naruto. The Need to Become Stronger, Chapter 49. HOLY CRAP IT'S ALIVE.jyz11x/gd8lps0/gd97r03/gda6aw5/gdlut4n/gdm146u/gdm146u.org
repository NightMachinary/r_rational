I think it meanders in the beginning, but I think that's true of most Naruto fanfiction, especially the ones that start in the academy or before it. In S:T7, I at least enjoy the writing, you know? The childhood stuff can be cartoon-y fluff, but I'll take this particular brand of non-child over some of the weirder brands of non-children that are present in so many Naruto stories.

I also happen to really enjoy a lot of the world building, even when it's tenuously connected to the present story. I would say the lore helps bury the foreshadowing, in some regards. For me, there's a sense of verisimilitude that it earns by making the characters so small in their own world. And the characters feel more like people for it, with deeper prejudices or different roles than in canon, and I think that's achieved at least in part by the world. Naruto feels significantly more like a person with a slightly above average intelligence and a learning disorder, than he does in most stories and that really appeals to me. For my tastes, the little details add up to something more than the parts.

I wouldn't say it adheres to canon despite the world building. It's kind of a moot point, with the story being abandoned, but there are interesting (to me) changes that could have borne fruit. The Senju and Uchiha are both alive and thriving, Jiraiya half-ass teaches Sakura the rasengan, Itachi is the hokage for much of the story's length, Orochimaru is a warlord legally recognized by the Daimyo of Land of Fire, Zabuza's rebellion seems to have succeeded, the Akatsuki (Pein and the Zetsus, specifically) have some interesting departures from canon, Tsunade becomes their tentative guest, etc.

Plus I'm a sucker for any story that tries to make chakra in a Sanderson-esque magic system, which the story flirts with near the last chapter.

As for the rest of your comment, I don't know? Different strokes for different folks? I've not read the story you linked, nor did I write the list. I can say, very comfortably, that I think most Naruto fanfiction is terrible. A good chunk of it is really, really bad, in my opinion. That said, whatever the criteria it is that qualifies a story as a thing I like, Shinobi: Team 7 clears that bar.
