I did, but apparently my office strips out a lot from wordpress; I don't see the font changes that confused me when I view it at home. I also see a lot more ads, including through the text as I scroll through the story. Maybe you're updating the font in javascript somewhere and my workplace is blocking the script? That would explain it.
