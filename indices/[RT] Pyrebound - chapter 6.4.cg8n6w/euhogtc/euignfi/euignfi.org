Really? We had an early issue which I thought I'd fixed, due to how I copy-pasted from LibreOffice. As it is, each update should be in two fonts: the gloss before the hr should be in WP's default font, while the story proper is in Palatino Linotype. I did this mostly to set the content apart from the commentary more, though it's probably not necessary, and also because it was less of a PITA to fix that way. Do you happen to have any specific examples in mind?
