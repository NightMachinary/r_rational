Ah. As creator, I don't see ads or any such disparities. Thanks for bringing it to my attention, and let me know if you find the issue. I viewed the first few chapters in markup and manually stripped and reformatted them, so I might have to tear some hair out if it's one of those. This sheep does not like mucking around with HTML, no sir.
