Part of the issue here is that I have a bit of a mental hang-up about taking money from someone without giving them something tangible (tangible in a sense that they own a copy legally in this case.) I get really nervous when people just offer me money. I do understand that I am offering entertainment value, but my instincts in this case are not exactly rational.

Perhaps I should work on that.
