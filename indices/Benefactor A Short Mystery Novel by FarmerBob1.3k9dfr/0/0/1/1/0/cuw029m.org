I understand your principles but for me Reddit is almost entirely a tool I use to find things I want to read, commercial OR non-commercial. I basically think of Reddit, particular [[/r/rational][r/rational]], as a place I go to point me at things that have a much higher than likely chance of being interesting. Probably on some moral or principled level what you're doing is the right choice. Maybe only people other than the author should be posting links to commercial writing. It certainly might come off to some as gauche if you did post links to works that you charge money for. I think Eaglejarl might have gotten some crap when he made a commercial version of 2YE even though he still had the free version available for download for all of us who followed along.

That being said, my comment is meant to be a "show of force" to demonstrate that there is at least one (or more, if it gets upvotes) reader in the community who cares more about getting quality works than avoiding authors self-advertising on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] for things that cost money.

By making my comment, I create a counteroption to that guy who was like "thanks for not posting your commercial works" for people to upvote. That guy is reasonable and expressing a reasonable opinion, but I care a lot more about finding works over preventing self-promotion than he does, so I have a different opinion.

I hope that my comment gets many upvotes so authors feel more comfortable submitting content they think fits, but costs money. This way, my life is better because I will be able to more easily find things to read.
