I enjoyed reading this! It's a pretty short read but was worth the 99 cents. Bear in mind that it's a kindle ebook so you'll need a computer, a tablet/phone with kindle app, or a kindle to read it. The prose was solid and I didn't notice any typos.

This is the second time I read this story, since I think I read a free version of it once. I liked the way each character was explained, and the last bit narrating the mystery's solution was satisfying.
