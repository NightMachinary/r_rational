  Part of the issue here is that I have a bit of a mental hang-up about taking money from someone without giving them something tangible (tangible in a sense that they own a copy legally in this case.)

Amazon is not a good choice then - all 'buyers' get is a license to read the DRM-encumbered copy until Amazon decides to withdraw that, which they may do at any time, for any reason, and without a refund.

I'd strongly encourage you to publish in open formats, and use a DRM-free store or something like Patreon to charge for it.
