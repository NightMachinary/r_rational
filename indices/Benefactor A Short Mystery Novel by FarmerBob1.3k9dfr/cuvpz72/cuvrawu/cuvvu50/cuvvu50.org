I understand your attitude, but would prefer to see links like this rather than not see links like this. I'm making this post explicitly because I would like to encourage authors who have written works to share them, even if they cost money to read. In this case, xamueljones happened to find it, but in the future I'd like not to have to rely solely on his (excellent) curation.
