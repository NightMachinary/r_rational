I'm slightly confused why FarmerBob1 didn't post this link himself, but in the case where it's due to author modesty, I'm posting this.

If you ever wanted to give FarmerBob1 something back for his writing, this is your chance!

EDIT: For anyone who is curious, there are a number of differences between the Amazon version and the one FarmerBob1 posted online. The Amazon version has gone through a very thorough editing process and FarmerBob1 included several more details to flesh out the story and make it more engaging. The web version, I would have given 4/5 stars and the Amazon version 5/5 stars.
