I'm glad you're enjoying it so much :) Some Gen 6 and 7 pokemon will show up, yeah, and when 8 comes out I'll probably mention stuff from it, like I did with Alola.

Hoenn's legendaries are more of a specific event thing, they're not normally just wandering around like the storm birds are, so thankfully they don't have to worry about them: in fact they're actually mythic pokemon who get "downgraded" to legendaries during the events of the game, in terms of how the people in the world view them.
