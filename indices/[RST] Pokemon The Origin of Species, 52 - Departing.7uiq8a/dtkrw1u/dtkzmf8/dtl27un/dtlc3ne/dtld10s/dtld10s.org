That was the other thing I was thinking about, where maybe they did score super high on IQ tests, but it was because their brain was like a quantum computer that happened to be supremely well suited to IQ tests, or because they borrow processing power from people around them (though obviously a scientific study would keep the alakazam isolated from all but dark people with a control that used non-darks to see a difference), but they have like no personality of their own, or are lacking that sentient...idk what to call it. curiosity, self-awareness, creativity...i have trouble conceptualizing sapience...
