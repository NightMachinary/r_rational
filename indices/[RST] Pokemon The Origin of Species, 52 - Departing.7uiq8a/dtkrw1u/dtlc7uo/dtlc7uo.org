[[/u/GMan129]]'s got it right: whoever wrote the pokedex for Alakazam clearly did not understand/care how IQ works in their effort to make it seem impressive. A lot of the pokedex entries are full of flat-out impossibilities, so this isn't uncommon :)

More importantly, if Alakazam were really that smart the pokemon world would look massively different. Since it doesn't, I have no reason to think they are.
