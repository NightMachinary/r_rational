Well, wasn't that a ominious ending?

This could easily be a turning point of the story, in which Blue undergoes some traumatic event that deeply changes him, like everybody dying horribly due to his mistakes or due to Team Rocket, sending him into a downwards spiral of hatred/vengeange that will make him become a Tyrant Champion that only Red can depose, at which point Red will have became the hero he wanted Blue to become, someone that can keep no secrets and still win anyway.

Nah, that will never happen. Right?

Right?
