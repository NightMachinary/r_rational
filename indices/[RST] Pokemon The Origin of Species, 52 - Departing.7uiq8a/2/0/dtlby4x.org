  I just finished reading, I got to say that I'm not used to seeing people actually settle things rationally when emotional stuff comes up, it almost never happens in fiction, even though maybe it would be much better if it did.

As long as it doesn't swing too far in the opposite direction and everyone's emotional stuff always gets resolved in one quick and easy conversation, I think it would often be better too :)
