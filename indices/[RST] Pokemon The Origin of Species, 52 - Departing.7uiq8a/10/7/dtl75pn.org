The bit about the five of them pulling into a taxi confused me. The previous sentences only mention four people - Blue, Aiko, Glen, and Elaine - so it took me awhile to realize you meant to add Red and Leaf back in to the people going to visit Aiko, who was not in fact at the same location as the other three mentioned in the same breath as her.
