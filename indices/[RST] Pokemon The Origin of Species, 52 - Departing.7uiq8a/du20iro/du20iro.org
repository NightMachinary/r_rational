Between Red potentially being "recruited" by Sabrina, who unless I'm massively misremembering is known to be part of the Mewtwo project, Red's power to (temporarily... so far) strip safety conditioning off of Pokemon, and Mewtwo's presumably massively scaled up psychic potential... Hmm. I'm starting to become very concerned that literally no one has asked how safe using this power is for humans yet. So far the closest we've gotten is Leaf insisting it would be dangerous for Pokemon, and Red seeming to be a little aware of (and trying to manage) the risks involved in what he's doing. But so far no one's red flagged this as potentially a potential society destroying mega problem yet if it becomes misused, presumably because (so far) it's completely temporary.

But those safety guards Red is lowering exist for a reason, and Red isn't the only one with psychic powers. I guess probabilistically you could assume he can't be the first one to come up with this idea, and the world hasn't ended yet so therefore its harmless, but that's really flimsy logic. No one's really gone through the process of ratifying any potential disasters before jumping straight into Red using it directly to improve the performance of his own starter. What if it weakens the conditioning over time? What if it strengthens a Pokemon's mind against currently used conditioning techniques, making it harder to train them? No one thought to, say, catch a couple dozen Rattata, let the Pokeballs automatically train them up, and then push their conditioned to the breaking point over the course of several months to see what the (honestly not even particularly) long term effects are?

If Red is the first one to think of this, and then he goes and tells a bunch of people (despite Aiko's insistence to the contrary, he hasn't been silent about it so far to anyone who just happens to ask), who tell a bunch of people, and other psychics hear about it? If that happens you better hope it really is that safe. Otherwise you'll have a bunch of trainers ignorant to the potential side effects, all using it on their Pokemon, which would be a disaster in and of itself even if it doesn't cause any other form of major (that is, permanent) disruption.

And back to Mewtwo. Why do I suspect this ends with Mewtwo learning about this and using his massive psychic ability to deliberately "de-safety" trainer's (non-Dark I suppose) Pokemon on a wide scale? Even just in, say, a building sized area over a temporary time, dialing up this ability to eleven could cause pretty massive problems.

And wow, if Red didn't have ethical concerns (and little motivation towards trainer battling), what's to stop him from sending out a "tanky" Pokemon, in hopes it won't die, and then deliberately dial up the "release instincts" dial on an opponent's Pokemon as high as it will go to make them look like they lost control, and therefore get them disqualified? Actually, is that even a thing? I imagine it would have to be. Do that to a Gym Leader and watch the political backlash roll in... Well, I guess one reason he can't do that is he's not that great at connecting to Pokemon he's never seen before as an offhand action yet.
