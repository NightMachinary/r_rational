I think it's best to ignore it because...IQ isn't generally a thing where, say, there's 200 questions and you get 150 right so your IQ is 150.

Instead it's based on standard deviations. So in order to reach 150 in the first place, you need a couple thousand people in your sample, because otherwise that score will only have a fraction of a person in it.

In order for there to exist a single person with an IQ of 1000, you'd need more people than there are atoms in the universe. For 5000...I can scarcely imagine.

I suppose that you could excuse it by saying that some people imagine Alakazams as having an IQ of 5000 because they are 50 times smarter than the average human (whatever /that/ means), but...if that's the case, than my hypothesis is that Alakazams are either aliens that descended on a still-primitive earth, created pokemon (and maybe humans), and parceled out all the incredible technology that we see in the Pokemon world to some unknowable alien end....

Or the world is just a simulation and the Alakazam are like Agents from the Matrix.

/edit:/ or maybe in the Pokemon world, average IQ is set to 10,000 instead of 100. That'd make it pretty funny actually. Though I would feel bad about enslaving a race of creatures with an average IQ of 50....
