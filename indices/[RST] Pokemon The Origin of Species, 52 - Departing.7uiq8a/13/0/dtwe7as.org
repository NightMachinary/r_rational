Glad you're enjoying the story so much! I'm totally fine with anyone using the setting and whatnot for their own stuff, and don't really have any opinions on the changes: do whatever works for you and your players! My only recommendation for the mystic powers in human bloodlines is to try and make sure any you introduce have a weakness associated with it, the way psychics are more at risk from ghost/dark attacks and feel the pain of the pokemon they merge with, and the way dark people can't use teleportation and are somewhat distrusted by society.

As for Renegades, there are some groups that are against the death sentence for it, but not ones that have a lot of political clout: think of Renegades as how our world treats terrorists and you'll have some baseline for just how much they're reviled. The rest of it comes from a sense of deep /betrayal./ The world only works as one where mankind is trying to survive against the monsters all around them: to use those monsters against your fellow man marks them as the worst kind of villain, in a lot of the fiction of the world.

What might help is a better idea of the Renegade trial process, which goes something like this:

1) Someone is accused of being a Renegade. The accuser tells their story to a ranger or police officer, who puts out essentially a warrant for the accused's arrest.

2) If they fight or try to escape when charged, they're assumed guilty and often killed on the spot.

If they get away:

3) They're marked as a Renegade officially, and anyone who sees them can get a reward for killing or capturing them. Hunters are trainers specifically allowed to train their pokemon to attack humans, and may be employed by the League if needed.

If they submit:

3) A hearing is called with the original accusers and the accused. Four additional people need to witness against them along with the highest ranking Ranger available. A number of factors go into the process.

4a) If their pokemon directly attacked another human, they're tested to see if they have been trained to do so. If they have and they are not a registered Hunter, this is often considered strong proof, and they are quickly condemned. If the danger to humans was not due to a direct attack, this is skipped.

4b) A psychic is often called to weigh in as one of the witnesses, particularly if it does not appear pre-meditated. If they're Dark or there's reason to believe they might have trained to resist psychics, this is skipped.

4c) Ranger and witnesses ask any questions that might reveal that humans were not put at risk intentionally. The person's background is recited and taken into consideration too. If they have a criminal history, this is often a mark against them. If they have participated in any notable wild pokemon incidents, this is often a mark in favor of them.

5) There's a vote, which is often accompanied with official paperwork, but sometimes that part is done later based on potential hectic nature of circumstance.

6) If the decision is not unanimous, they are released but put on probation, their pokemon held by the nearest city until they go through some safety courses to ensure whatever incident led to people believing they were a Renegade is not repeated. If the paperwork is delayed and what was originally a unanimous vote is no longer unanimous, protocol differs based on region: in some a new hearing is called and the process is repeated with different judges and Ranger, in others the accused is released. The Indigo League does the the former.

7) If it is, they are branded and the nearest Leader is called in to execute them. This is done differently in different regions and is ultimately the Leader's decision. Most put them to sleep first through some thing like sleep powder or jigglypuff singing. An overdose of sleep powder can then be used, or lethal injection of some poison. In the past it was more common for them to be trampled or burned or electrocuted to death, but most modern cities frown upon such brutal tactics, unless the Renegade caused a significant amount of death and destruction.

8) If their pokemon directly attacked a human, they are given to Hunters to retrain or killed if they were particularly vicious or deadly. If not, they are given to next of kin as in a normal death.

9) If at any point in the future one of the accusers recants their testimony or a witness admits to being bribed or pressured, an investigation is launched and heavy jail time and reparations to the family imposed. This is excessively rare, happening no more than a handful of times a year worldwide, compared to the average of two or three Renegades accused per year in any given region.

Hope that's helpful!
