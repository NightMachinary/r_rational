Hello there! First of all, [[/u/TheGreatTactician]] took the words from my mouth

#+begin_quote
  I just want you to know that every time I see a new chapter of this story, it makes my entire day. Seriously, I actually spend all month waiting for the next update, only to repeat the process. Keep up the nice work my dude.

Secondly, I wanted to ask you some questions. You see, I'm GMing a ptu campaing and I intend to use your world, mainly because it is awesomelly well built, coherent and connected, and is able to give a sense of the dangers of living along such creatures. It is true that I will make some changes in the name of gameplay (capture rate, welcome back) and other just because we (the players and I) like it, such is giving some pokemon intelligence or adding mystic powers to some human blodlines.

Why I'm telling you all of this? Well, first because I would like to know what you think about it and if you have any suggestions, second... because I would like to ask you some things I've found out I would need to know. For example, one of my players dislikes the fact that there is death sentence over renegades, and asked my if there is people that opposes it, how many, what kind of groups, etc.
