I just finished reading, I got to say that I'm not used to seeing people actually settle things rationally when emotional stuff comes up, it almost never happens in fiction, even though maybe it would be much better if it did.

Also I'm more and more worried about the upcoming cruise, knowing what happened in the anime... or at least I was until I realized that Blue was not going, therefore removing an eventual dilemma about teleporting, although the other dilemma about the other people still stands and it actually gets asked in the story, pretty interesting.

I'm still worried a bit.
