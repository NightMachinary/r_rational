The Viridian Forest chapters were hellish enough; I'd rather not see walking/swimming calamities like Groudon/Kyogre around. Even worse if they're actually more intelligent than average. Rayquaza may be strong, but one killing cur... uhm, ice beam will bring it down!

To say nothing of the generation 4 legendaries.
