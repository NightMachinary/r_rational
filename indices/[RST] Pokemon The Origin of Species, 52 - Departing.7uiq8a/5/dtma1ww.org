I just want you to know that every time I see a new chapter of this story, it makes my entire day. Seriously, I actually spend all month waiting for the next update, only to repeat the process. Keep up the nice work my dude.

Assuming that Generation 8 (or however many more gens come about while you're writing this story) come out before you finish your story, will their Pokémon and regions and such exist in your story's universe? Will we ever get to see the group interact with Gen 6 and 7 Pokémon?

Now I'm wondering how other regions handle disasters. Kanto is tame compared to Hoenn or Alola I'd imagine, considering the former has deities that constantly battle to eternally drown/drought the world, and the latter has actual beserk and amoral deities running amok and doing whatever they please. Not to mention Ultra Beasts. Now I want to see Red interact with Ultra Beasts and see how he as a researcher would react.Have you considered writing an in-depth type of "History of the Pokéworld" based in your universe? You know, with history and how society and culture in different regions differ-stuff like that?

Anyway, sorry for typing so much. I just really love your story!
