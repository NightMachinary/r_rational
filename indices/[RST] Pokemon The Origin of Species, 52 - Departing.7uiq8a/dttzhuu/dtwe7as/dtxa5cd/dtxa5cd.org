Wow. I was expecting an answer, but this is awesome! The trial process will be very helpful when the time comes, thanks a lot.

I am still thinking about how to handle some pokémon been intelligent. Maybe there are just few like those, and choose to be alone. The interesting part will be the more... Godlike legendaries, as I'm not sure what you will do with them (the creación trio, the lake trio, the swords of justice...) and what their relationship with humans. I always envisioned the aqua and magma teams as the result of some old cult (kinda like the most radical belivers at petalburg)

I think that is all for now. I wish I were better at english so I could make deep reviews of the chapters. In any case, keep up the good work!
