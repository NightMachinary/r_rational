It is temporarily on hold while I work out what to do with an Earthside subplot that would be interpreted very differently today than when I planned it. I have adopted a strategy used by a number of other writers of working on multiple projects, so if I get stuck on one I can keep writing and get my flow back. If it helps, this story takes place at the same time as the very end of Journeyman's flashback narrative in Chapter 45 of Maker's Ark, which will be relevant soon. (That's why he's gone)
