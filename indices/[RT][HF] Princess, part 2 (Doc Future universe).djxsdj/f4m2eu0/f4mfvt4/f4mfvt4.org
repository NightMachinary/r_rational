"Princess" is a prequel, so there shouldn't be plot spoilers for Fall. The serials "The Fall of Doc Future" and "Skybreaker's Call" are complete novels with appropriate endings. "The Maker's Ark" is a sequel that is not yet complete. The stand alone stories on my "Stories" page that do not specifically refer to the Maker's Ark also give closure.
