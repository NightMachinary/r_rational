I dont think this is the end of act 2. To me it seems like the start of it. To me act 1 ended with Vermillion. This has been them apart before coming together. We still have 4 more gyms. Saffron is kind of covered, but there is still Fuscia and Cinnabar to at least visit. Of course HPMOR really threw a cork screw arouns this point, so who knows.

The Rocket Casino getting exposed doesnt necessary end Giovanni. His greatest strength is his organizations resources.

Plus Mewtwo escaping doesnt suddenly expose him. He will likely go into hiding for a while, potentially by Cerulrean while the Renegades attempt to track him, creating a backdrop for the upcoming story since this will lead to increased activity with most not knowing why.
