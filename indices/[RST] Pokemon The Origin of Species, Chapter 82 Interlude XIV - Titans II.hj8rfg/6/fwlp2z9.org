Love the expansion of the Lore with the Unknown and more development of the Hoenn characters. Wally is a psychic and Unknown expert, plus the other 2 showed up. We also know their journey started 3 years ago.

We get explanation of what exactly the MegaStones are, and it makes sense. And we see them triggered.

But I feel like Steven might not be long for this world. The situation between him and Wallace as champion is unclear. Although I guess Walace may have just been an older champion who took over the Sootopolis gym as many of the Kanto leaders have.
