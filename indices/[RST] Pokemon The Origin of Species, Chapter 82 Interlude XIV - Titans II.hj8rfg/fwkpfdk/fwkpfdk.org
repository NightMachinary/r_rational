Hey everyone, welcome back! I made some tweaks to the first 5 chapters with help from a reader, particularly to update some of the parts of the story that were outdated by the advancing progress of the pokemon games.

I also added [[http://daystareld.com/short-stories/][a couple short stories to my site]] that aren't pokemon related, if you're interested in reading any more of my work :) Enjoy, and as usual, all feedback welcome, either here, on my site, or the [[/r/rational]] posts!
