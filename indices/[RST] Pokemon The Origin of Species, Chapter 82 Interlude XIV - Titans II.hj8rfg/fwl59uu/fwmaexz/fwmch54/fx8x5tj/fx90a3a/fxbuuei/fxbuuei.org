They have done the Grass/Ice stone one already in Gen VIII, while Pokemon XD let Espeon and Umbreon evolve when levelled-up with a sun or moon shard in the bag. The fan-made Pokemon Tabletop United RPG gave them all stones, though they gave Sylveon the Moon Stone (it's already very much associated with the fairy type through Clefable) and had Espeon and Umbreon evolve with the Dawn and Dusk stones respectively.
