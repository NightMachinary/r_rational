The worst bit about all of this is that Dr. Light keeps thinking “if Sabrina were here, I could ask her to make a decision”; she thinks it at least twice. Well, if Sabrina were here, she would say that Mewtwo is /lying to a psychic/, and he's kept quiet about it, so they should kill him right now. Instead, Dr. Light only has the outdated records of their outing, and believes he will be all collaborative, so she let him out of the box.

This is so frustrating.
