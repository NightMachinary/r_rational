Just caught up with this story, first time commenting.

If people from other regions are about to catch their legendaries, that sure puts a lot more pressure on the Kanto people to catch theirs, too. It's a good thing people from Kanto are participating in the fight against Hoenn's, but will that incentivize the Hoenn people to not ask for/allow help with new titans? Just because Maxi blew it with Groudon doesn't mean a real champion would fail with a Regithing.

It amused me to imagine how obvious Dr. Light was grabbing the remote.

I predict that the Rocket Casino's new pokemon is a rotom in a broken coffee machine. But he's sleeping. He sleeps a lot, which is why it just looks like a normal broken coffee machine. The clogged, soggy grounds are what make it a ground-type. Thanks for playing.
