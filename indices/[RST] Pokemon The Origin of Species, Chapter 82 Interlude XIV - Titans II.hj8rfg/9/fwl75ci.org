So the gap between when our colour trio falls into the collapsing floor and we find out what happened to them isn't two months, it's three. Maybe more, if we get a "Titans III" interlude next. At least it's confirmed some people fell all the way to the bottom and made it, but also there are renegades running around (as expected) killing all civilians (not quite as expected). Even then, everything they do in that basement is going to be utterly dwarfed by the rest of the chaos in the whole Groudon/Kyogre situation.
