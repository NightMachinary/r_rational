Late to the party, but if our trio manages to capture Rakin and he talks or Red reads his mind, they'd know all about Giovanni (and by extension would know more about the Yuuka-incident). Leaf already has ample reason to mistrust him already (being psycic-read by his hidden assitant). If they'd make it out alive, they should get a team of rangers, corner Misty and then get her cooperation in branding Giovanni as a renegade.\\
(she covered up his murder after all, by pretending she did it herself)

Sabrina can't help convince Red otherwise or clue them in to the Mewto project, since she's presumably helping against the Aquarium Fish and Groudon. (though Elaine might be misinformed, Sabrina could have teleported anywhere really)
