Basically just ignore all the sizes in canon because they're all stupidly small in canon, almost no pokemon is taller than I am at 6'3" which is just absurd.

As for evo stones, they're naturally occuring, and I see them more just assisting in evolution rather than instant-touch-evolve :) Trade evolving isn't a thing.
