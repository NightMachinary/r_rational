  Rayquayza will neutralize the fight

I kinda doubt this will happen. Aside from Steven and co. already downing Kyogre (with Groudon's help) and being in a okay position to take down Groudon now, Rayquaza might not even be needed. But more than that, Wallace and Wally's segment seems to indicate they're moving to /stop/ Rayquaza from coming, and that "prophecy" at the end of it seems to indicate DaystarEld adapted Rayquaza into something that comes when Groudon and Kyogre comes to /eat/ everything.
