I'm guessing that Mewtwo is capable of just flying away at this point. Flight, check. Recover, probably check. Getting a head start on the pokemon that might shoot it down, check. Just need to deal with the remote kill switch.

And given how Giovanni wants to surround Mewtwo with failsafes, I can't say that leaving is the wrong choice.
