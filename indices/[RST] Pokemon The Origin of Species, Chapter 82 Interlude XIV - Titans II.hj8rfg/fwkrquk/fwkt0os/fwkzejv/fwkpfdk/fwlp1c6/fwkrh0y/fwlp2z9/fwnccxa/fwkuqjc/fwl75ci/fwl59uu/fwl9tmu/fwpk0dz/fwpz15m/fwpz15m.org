Virtually guaranteed not to be the Sinnoh region Rock-type Leader in the flesh, but still kinda funny to see.

  [Ramin's] golem takes a chunk of concrete in each hand and smashes them down to crush the ribcage of the man and the head of the woman.

I wonder if Red felt that. What with the possibly-fatal fall, I'd think Red's first action if he stayed alive and conscious (and checked Blue and Leaf was alright) would be to check everyone in range to gauge the number of survivors. So feeling something as weird as relief then death (as opposed to shock/horror/resignation then death, or straight-up unexpected death, from being crushed by building materials) might have outed Ramin already, even if he's Dark.

Of course, with Ramin planning to continue killing, he's pretty much guaranteed to be outed by Red eventually if he keeps up his psydar for any appreciable length of time.

  Even if [the magnetons/magnezones] don't draw the ire of the sea god, their magnetic levitation is hard to sustain for long, and he has no way to recover them once they sink underwater.

Surge really could've used a couple of balloons there, if not to keep his pokemon levitating then at least to keep them near the water's surface once they drop and help spot them easier from above water.

  Latis
#+end_quote

I was thinking about the timeline of the battle against Kyogre. Birch said Brendan and May were traveling at the speed of a jet (plane), and assuming that the speed of sound is about 340 m/s (pulled off of Wikipedia, assuming dry air at sea level and constant temperature 15 degrees Celsius), even a Mach 0.5 would be 170 m/s or 612 km/h. The fact that they were over the sea suggests they came from Southern Island, the latis' in-game home, so if Hoenn scales to Kyushu (and with a bit of fingertip-approximating the distance scale bar on Google Maps) that'd put the distance between the island and Sootopolis at 200 km at max? (Steven reached Groudon and Kyogre after teleporting to Sootopolis and flying a few minutes. Presumably the coast of Sootopolis is also where Groudon walked off from?) As a rough estimate, that'd mean it took Brendan and May twenty minutes at most, and probably less, from when Birch was watching TV and calling reinforcements to reach the clash, assuming they didn't need to do something else on their way.

So it took most of the other (lower-case) elite trainers less than twenty minutes to drop whatever they were doing, teleport to presumably Sootopolis (or maybe somewhere to the east of Route 122, since people seemed to have different teleport points), and then fly in to join the battle. These people work fast. Guess it's to be expected in a world where Pokemon can make things go to hell at the drop of a hat though.

Also, Surge probably should have told Brendan and May about his magneton/magnezones that he left as area controls. Assuming that the two are also attacking Kyogre while it's out of range of the landlocked pokemon, they might accidentally get too close to Surge's pokemon and run afoul of the "attack any pokemon that approach" command.

  and [Wallace] fights the urge to pull out his phone to take a picture.
#+end_quote

I feel like he should've taken it anyway. Documentation being the difference between science and playing around, and all that. I think it would've helped corroborate whatever outlandish story he would've had to tell later, which he probably would have to tell if he intends to take the blame for unleashing the Titans.

  Someone once set a recording device at some ruins for days until they captured enough samples to turn into a haunting song of sorts (someone else then took the sounds and applied enough autotuning to actually make pretty catchy club music).
#+end_quote

Yeah, I say that captured the essence of pure musicians perfectly. I wonder if this is also a reference to some particular Ruins of Aleph/"cave music" remix though.

  everything about the unowns
#+end_quote

Now that opens up a whole can of interesting worms.

Firstly on just how language developed on the Japan-based regions, since unown letters presumably far predated the warring states era where Japanese was the official language before giving way back to (spoken) Unown (though the games' dexes have also raised a similar question). Secondly on people of that far earlier era apparently knowing enough about this power of the unowns to write it down, presumably using it for themselves, and why that's no longer the case. Were the trapped Regis the result of something natural, or something intentional? And if the latter, something human, or something non-human? (This is me bringing up the question of the motivation behind the Storm Birds' attacks all over again...) And lastly, is the Regis already being free in Sinnoh an indication something similar happened there in the past? Like, say, an attempt to quell one or more of the Creation trio, or perhaps even the big G (big A?) himself.

  "No, Doctor, I am quite well. I believe I'll take a walk."
#+end_quote

Now that was a smoothly made request, that played on sentimentality and might just open up a sure path to escape, as Dr. Light realizes in her thoughts following this. All those years of yearning for freedom, and this might be it.

Lots of pivotal things taking the chance to play out with this cranky wake-up tantrum of Hoenn's weather trio.
