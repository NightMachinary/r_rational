Yep. I think ALL eeveelutions are like this, to be clear, even if the game hasn't quite caught up to doing the obvious thing and just made the "moss/ice boulder" replaceable with a Leaf/Ice Stone and "high friendship at day/night" replaceable with Sun/Moon stones and "knowing a Fairy move" replaceable with a Shiny Stone.
