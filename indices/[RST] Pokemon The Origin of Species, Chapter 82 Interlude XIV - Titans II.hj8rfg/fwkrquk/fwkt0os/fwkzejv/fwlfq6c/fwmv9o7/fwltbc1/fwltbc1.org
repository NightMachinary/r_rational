Well, I don't know. Team Rocket really hasn't put him through all that much grief, tbh. They've locked him away for 10 years, and they've distrusted him from the start, but none of their action have been positively cruel or unwarranted.

Dr. Light has already said that "Killing it might set this project back a decade" and that this event is an "opportunity". In that mindset, if M2 were to lay his cards on the table - to say that he knows about TR's betrayal and suspects their involvement in crippling him, and yet he is still explicitly going to try to stay on good terms with them - I'd give him a good shot of an amicable conclusion. Unless Dr. Light, even after hearing that, still decides to push the big red button, in which case TR's lives are forfeit and M2 will just go apeshit.
