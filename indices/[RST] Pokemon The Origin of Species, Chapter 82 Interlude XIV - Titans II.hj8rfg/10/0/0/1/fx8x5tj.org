My head-canon, which I suspect is what [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] has gone for here, is that the various Eeveelutions (and perhaps other stone-triggered evolutions) can all be naturally achieved in the wild from prolonged exposure to certain environmental stimuli in their habitat, with the stones merely providing a concentrated and determining dose of the same effect, which is convenient for trainers who don't want to spend months living in an active volcano for the sake of a fresh-faced Flareon.
