I really like how now only is Hoenn in a completely different stage of its plot, but it's also a fundamentally different story, about archaeologists racing to deal with mythology monsters, which is completely out-of-context to the main story about leadership, evolution, and psychology. But it's still allowed to interact via earthquake, because that's an in-genre threat back in Kanto. Super clever stuff.
