RIP Doctor, it was nice knowing you. I wonder if M2 can prevent the switch from triggering purely by mechanical telekinesis means? If it's a button or an actual switch, could it be held from being activated (as if jammed)?

Thank you for the amazing chapter as always! Every plot thread is so gripping I can't even decide which I'm looking forward to the most.
