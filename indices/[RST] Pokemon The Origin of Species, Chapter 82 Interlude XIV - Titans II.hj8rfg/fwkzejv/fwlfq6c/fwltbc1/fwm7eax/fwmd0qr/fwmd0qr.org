Well, if my kiddo, badly trained, might intelligently attempt to destroy humanity and had a good chance of succeeding, I might be a little understanding. The only reason the Endbringers of Worm and the Legendaries here do not immediately destroy humanity is because they are uncaring forces of nature. If Groudon, rather than getting anywhere near Kyogre, first headed straight inland to kill off humanity first, while Kyogre flooded in behind him, there would be zero counterplay - and everyone knows this, as background to growing M2.

How easily might M2 kill humanity, if he desired to do so?\\
- He can mind-control and mind-screw any pokemon within a seemingly immense radius, through solid objects, without notifying targets unless they are trained psychics.\\
- He can shield his mind perfectly from mind-reading.\\
- He has a psychic blast strong enough to kill a kangaskhan.\\
- He is intelligent enough to prepare himself adequately before striking and ally himself with friendly trainers.\\
- He can Recover his telomeres to prevent aging and Recover his brain to prevent decay due to buildup of plaque. None of the other legendaries seem to have an age limit, so why should he?

As in the movie, he might capture pokemon himself and become an immensely strong psychic trainer, which he might use as a stepping stone to capturing weaker legendaries. The thought of a free M2, with a team of legends, arbitrarily deciding to destroy humanity, must weigh heavily on TR.

Should he be unable to kill a legend on his own (which would be a stretch given his anime and in-game appearances, but might be the case here for narrative purposes), he might simply leave for some rock across the sea, get an internet connection, and do research on the governmental structures of the various in-universe countries. What could an intelligent being with arbitrarily strong psychic powers do to a wholly unsuspecting world leader? What secrets might M2 extract from trainers' minds?

Yes, I can definitely understand TR's perspective here.
