Live the continues development on the Legendaries.

So based on the comments, the Titans roam around Sinnoh already? I am curious how that would effect things as their lack of pressure is less likely to cause a Tier 3 event, but being unstoppable forces means they cant be directed away from a city that they can just walk through.

Have you had any thoughts on Sinnoh in general? Such as the roaming legendary birds from Platinum? I imagine the Lake Spirits and the big 3 are largely inactive on modern Sinnoh society, but beyond them and the other trios there is still Heatran, Shaymin, Cresselia, and Darkrai.

Plus the Battle Frontier in concept of this world intrigues me.
