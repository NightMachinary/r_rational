I feel like the climax may be left unseen for now and ww return to our group. We know Rayquayza will neutralize the fight, and we can get details from the news or Oak. The personal stories of the others isnt this story.

As for Mewtwo, it wouldnt do to give away all of it's capabilities so early. Plus it adds to the unease of its escape if we dont know how or where it went.
