I wonder what you would do with the DPP storyline... Hoenn is easy to adapt, "this beasts are OP and only using others like them can get them no not kill us all" is already in the games and you just gave it the scale it needed. But then we have Cyrus "I beat the shit out of the trio responsible of keeping the gods of this world in check and used them to make an artifact that allows me to summon and control the embodiments of spacetime until the god of the 5th dimension got mad at me". That would require a lot of changes (or moving it to the sci-fi future)
