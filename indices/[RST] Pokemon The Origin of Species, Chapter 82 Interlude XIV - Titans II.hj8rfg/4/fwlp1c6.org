I think this is the part of the story that signals the end of the second act and the beginning of the third. Stakes are raised, major pacing changes, villains playing their final trap cards... I'm excited. Everything's coming to a head. Mega evolutions being uncovered at the same time as Team Rocket, Titans and Rayquaza being uncovered at the same time, the Latios duo entering the frey, and of course, Mewtwo's finally going to get his due. I don't believe Kyogre actually died here, I have a feeling Daystar will make that more dramatic when it happens. As the pokemon power levels begin to get ridiculous, the humans are going to get left behind by a lot. Megas and the Latios will help somewhat, but its already been established that these legendaries completely sweep through armies of the world's best trainers, and many of the legendaries coming out now are implied to be even stronger. I'm a little worried about the Giovanni plotline here. He was built up to be a capable and prepared villain, but now he's both lost his gamble with the Hoenn myths and lost his prized possession. And its going to be hard for him to be a threat when you have multiple unbeatable legendaries around. Which brings me to my last point - How do we fit this big shift in story with the all the bits that came before it? If its a struggle for even Giovanni to maintain any sort of threat power, its going to be very hard for me to believe our protagonists being able to do anything. Blue is the only with with decent combat abilities and he's not even half way through his badges. Blue's whole motivation is becoming a strong enough trainer to kill a god, and right now he could barely handle a couple of renegades. And that's because the main characters don't feel anywhere near the end of their storyline, which is weird considering these sorts of catastrophes usually indicate you're nearing the end of the story. Or maybe that's not correct and this Hoenn thing is going to be resolved and everything is going to progress from there. It's going to be really hard to increase the power level from Groudon and Kyogre.. unless maybe Lugia becomes a thing? You do have almost 20 chapters to wrap it up (assuming you're going for the clean 100). On the otherhand, I do like the aprubtness of this random event. I don't know if you timed these chapters this way on purpose, but it feels very fitting right now that world wide disasters don't give a shit where you are in your "plotline".

Also am patiently waiting to see mewtwo fuck some people up. I don't think I should be rooting for him but I kind of am anyway
