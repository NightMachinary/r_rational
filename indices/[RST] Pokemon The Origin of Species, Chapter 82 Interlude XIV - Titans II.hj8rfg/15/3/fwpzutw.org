#+begin_quote
  no, there is no wind, and even if they were it wouldn't be shifting them all in different directions like this
#+end_quote

"they were" -> "there were"

#+begin_quote
  never far enough to risk touching each other
#+end_quote

Not entirely sure, but I think this was meant to be "never /close/ enough to risk touching each other"? And the opposite would've been phrased more naturally as "close enough to risk touching each other"...I think.

#+begin_quote
  A constant weedling in the air
#+end_quote

Probably meant "wheedling"?

#+begin_quote
  if it wasn't raining
#+end_quote

"wasn't" -> "weren't", technically. Apparently that's the more correct conjugation of "be" for any past hypothetical/subjunctive form, though using "wasn't" for first-person past subjunctive occurs commonly enough.

Also in chapter 14 Leaf's joke on Red's "unknown unknowns" comment was "What, you think there's more than 28"? Which probably should be 26 with the revelations of this chapter. (She's going to be so surprised she's right though, assuming the fact comes out.)
