I know exactly what you mean. As I read your message I was planning to reply with a comment that echoed your last line.

  But somehow the author makes it work. The story of creation is based on cliches & rules. And we've already seen Cat subverting the story (with the Lone Swordsman), I think we'll see more of that including, hopefully, breaking free of cliches...

Except, now I think about it, Cat's ultimate victory will be the biggest cliche of all.

What do you think?
