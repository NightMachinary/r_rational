Excellent analysis. Thanks for explaining that important distinction. It gives me a new perspective on the most recent Villainous Interlude -(Chiaroscuro) where +Heiress+ the Diabolist understands the Villain's story more deeply than anyone else and recongises that Cat used the story against her; she (Akua) wants to dig deeper grooves for Villainy.
