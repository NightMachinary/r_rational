Well it's cliche /to us/. Not to get into a rant about how basically nothing is original, but the fact is that especially when focusing only on the broader strokes every story has been written to the point of cliche, subverted, and those subversions in and of themselves written to cliche. It's how stories survive, because there are universal themes we can relate to and pass on. So we have an infinite amount of "Cinderella stories" while the story of "Og found a log" has been lost to time, no matter how much more factual and less cliche filled it might be. (To go meta for a second, while the implementation is unique in some aspects, this is hardly the first story that leans this much in the fourth wall, and it clearly borrows much from D&D, though of course D&D is hardly completely original in it's stories, creatures, and mythologies) I include all this because of the fact that for us stories /reflect/ reality, if sometimes through a warped mirror.

An important distinction here is that Cat's ultimate victory is not cliche /in her world/. Because there, stories are instead /weaved into/ the fabric of reality, and cliches are better known as Names and Roles. It is a land where the grooves have been worn to ultimately favor Good over Evil because good has always won. And Good has always won because not enough have considered that Evil could win, and keep their winnings. No stories are told of the Villain who lived happily ever after, the Tyrant heros could never fell. So the grooves got worn in Good's favor. The Bard opposes Cat so much precisely because she wants to break the cliches, escape the grooves. While an anti-cliche antihero that is wiling to break the very founding the world to make it fit her vision of a better place is something of a cliche to us, the fact that it is so foreign to basically everyone but the Black Knight (and arguably Apprentice in a metaphorical sense) is key to the conflict. Both sides Hero and Villain willingly follow the path of the Story even when they try to use it for their advantage. Cat's victory would force a new story to be written, a new set of cliches to start to form.
