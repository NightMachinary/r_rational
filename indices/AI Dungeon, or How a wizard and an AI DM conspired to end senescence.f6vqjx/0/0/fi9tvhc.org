I was just giving it a go for fun, but how well it fit together really surprised me.

I did have to make one revert at one point when it lost the plot and went in to an infinite loop, so it's not really perfect or something you could make a 'real' game with yet, but still- very interesting. The fact it's apparently modelling situations to some degree is pretty crazy.
