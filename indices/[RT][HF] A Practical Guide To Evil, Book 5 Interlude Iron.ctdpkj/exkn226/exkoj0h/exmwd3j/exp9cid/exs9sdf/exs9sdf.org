Interludes are regular chapters, I was talking about his feeling of "deja vu" for the introduction of the three spymasters, which was done in the "Fatalism" series of "Extra Chapters" (not interludes).

I presume EE wants to keep extra chapters as a "bonus" so that they aren't strictly necessary for the enjoyment of the main story, but supplement it.

Hence, any introductions made in the extra chapters will be done again if the characters show up on the regular chapters.
