Hi, [[/r/Baccano]] mod here. Klein is right; there's no legal way to /stream/ Baccano!...but there /is/ for at least viewing it: if you have Netflix and live in the USA, you can still [[https://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Baccano/70204951][rent the DVDs]] via their rental service. Also never hurts to check one's local libraries.

Anyway... I found this post since I track the 'baccano' keyword on Reddit, sorry to intrude. I also write Baccano! fanfiction (I share both on AO3 and FF, though AO3 is where the fandom is more active and you're more likely to receive comments) so I'll try to leave a review soon.

*Also, a fair bit of the best/A-tier Baccano! fanfiction is /only/ on AO3, never been published to FFN. AO3's formatting is superior too, if you're looking for something less limiting.

(From a quick cursory glance-over, it sounds like this is entirely based on the anime with no knowledge of the light novels? Obviously a lot of it is a direct blow-by-blow of episode 7, quoted directly in many instances, but also: he's referring to the other alchemists -- like Elmer and Fermet -- as if he barely knows them, which doesn't make sense. Plus, the thing about his wife and child...he has a living descendant in 2001. And also "which is how I ended up on the AA in the first place..." That's simply not true.)

(Obviously it's fine if you've never read the light novels +you should though, they're great+, I'm just verifying that's the case).
