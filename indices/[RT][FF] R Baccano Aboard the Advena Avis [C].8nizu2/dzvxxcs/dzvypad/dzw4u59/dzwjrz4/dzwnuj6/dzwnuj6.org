Oh that's true; you have to wait for the invite link on AO3. Still, I'm sure everyone would be happy to see you post over there (I'd rather not copy your fic in your stead; I mean, I'd obviously have credited you, but I would rather not).

Ah, right. I'm the sysop of the Baccano! Wiki, so I do apologize where the information there is lacking; I became an admin of it about two years ago, but there's still so much that wasn't on the wiki that I still have yet to get to.

Ooh, I may have jumped the gun through inference when it came to the 'wife and child' mention (cursory glanceovers aren't great for comprehension...). Since I saw no mention of a descendant therein, I'd inferred from the fic that Szilard was meant to have no living relatives left. ("I mourned my family...")

Unfortunately I have no idea as to Szilard's family situation in the 1711s. I /can/ tell you that Bilt (his living descendant in 2001) is already an elderly man when he makes his debut. He's said to have never met Szilard, but his grandfather served as Szilard's assistant for some time in America (before returning to the home country of the Quates family).
