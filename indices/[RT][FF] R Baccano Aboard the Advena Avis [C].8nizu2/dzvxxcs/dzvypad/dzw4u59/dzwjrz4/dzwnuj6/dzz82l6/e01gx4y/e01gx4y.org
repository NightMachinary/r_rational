Ooh, rare to encounter another Naritaverse peruser in the wild. Hello! Yes, we're all still waiting for Vamp! VI to return from the war...so I'd definitely agree you should catch up to Baccano! LN22 (not to mention, LN23 could be coming out this year).

I admit that out of the four, Durarara!! is the one I'm least invested in. I still really /like/ it, and care about it, but if I had to rank them by way of preference (something I'm normally not keen on doing), it'd go something like: Baccano!, Vamp!, Etsusa Bridge (it's more like they're tied with Vamp! having the edge), and Durarara!!. There's a good write-up a Baccano! fan did on why Baccano! appeals to her more than Drrr!! does, and I find myself agreeing with multiple points...

Oh man, you really should read Etsusa Bridge. The first volume, at minimum, because the first volume is /really dang good/. (I recommended to a fellow on the [[/r/LightNovels]] Discord server that they should start with EB or Vamp! for their Naritaverse ventures with emphasis on EB, since it's complete -- he came back and said it was the best LN they'd read yet. I was so happy!)

Oh yeah, Hariyama-san is definitely not part of the Naritaverse (a strong tell being that it has ghosts, which aren't really...a thing/addressed in the Naritaverse) but I've enjoyed what I've read of the fan-translation anyway. Read all of volume one, still patiently waiting for each volume 2 update.

(Speaking of Hariyama-san, Ginjima for Best Dad).

Etsusa Bridge is mostly 2019-2021, actually, with the beginning scene taking place in 2014. And you've got it right about Baccano!, except that the 2000s era is from 2000-2003, not 01. (For clarity, the 1700s are: 1705; 1710; 1711 | and the 1930s: 1930; 1931; 1932; 1933; 1934; 1935. 1936 if you count the second drama CD. There's also the 1927 mini-arc).

(Also, Vamp! is set 2004-05 so far).

And that's right -- there's no specific order one needs to read the series in, as they don't have dramatic influences on each other's plots. But there sure are a lot of cross-references -- and one or two of them /do/ subtly influence the other, actually. The first that comes to mind is [[#s][Durarara!!/Baccano! 2002 arc]]

I'm in too deep. I love this 'verse.
