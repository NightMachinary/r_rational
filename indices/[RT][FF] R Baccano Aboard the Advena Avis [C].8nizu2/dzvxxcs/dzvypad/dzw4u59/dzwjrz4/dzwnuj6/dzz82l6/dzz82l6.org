I'd really like to see more Vamp! novels, but I should really finish the existing Baccano novels as well. I liked Durarara!, but the anime was enough for me in that case, and that the novel series (Durarara!) extends beyond that point seems unnecessary, albeit with a different cast. Etsusa Bridge doesn't quite catch my interest from its description, but I've never actually given it a try.

I know that Hariyama-san and the Center of the World isn't technically in the Naritaverse, but I'd like to see more of that translated as well.

If anyone unfamiliar with the Ryohgo Narita's works is reading this comment, the key fact is that 4 of his novel series all exist in the same universe. Vamp! is obviously vampire related, but with enough originality and trademark Narita craziness that it's nothing like a typical vampire series. Etsusa Bridge takes place around 2025? Durarara is early 2000s. Baccano storylines are in the early 1700s, 1930s, and 2000-2001. Character interaction is fairly limited between the different series, it's mostly just passing references.
