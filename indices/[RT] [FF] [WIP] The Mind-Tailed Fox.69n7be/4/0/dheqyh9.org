Thanks for the typos / words that probably don't belong in this universe -- I'm pretty bad about skimming over canned phrases that don't make sense while proofreading.

You're right about a lot of the early inconsistencies. When I started writing I was trying to follow the plot of the manga pretty closely, and a lot of the strangest things (the ridiculously low number of new Genin, graduates not being told about the test, Sasuke being sure Kakashi isn't around, etc.) are there because that's what happened in the manga. Some of the lines of dialogue are even lifted straight from the translation I was reading. I think in retrospect this was a mistake; there are just too many things in the manga that are impossible to explain away if you think about them carefully.

When I'm done (or earlier if enough people complain) I'll probably go back and fix up the the most glaring inconsistencies introduced by slavishly following the manga.
