Thanks!

It's interesting that both of you brought up the slow pace. It didn't really feel that slow while writing, but now that I'm thinking about it, it's about half a novel by word count and not all that much has happened. I should probably stop introducing more long-running subplots until I've made some progress on the existing ones.

A related problem is that for every paragraph of action I end up including 1-3 paragraphs of analysis, often from multiple viewpoints. I find that kind of thing fun, and it's arguably the point of the fic, but I think that does put the onus on me to keep the plot moving forward in the smaller number of action scenes I have to work with.

(Also, I'm glad you like the Kyuubi; he's my favorite voice to write!)

Fic recs: I mostly read rational or rational-adjacent stuff you're probably familiar with if you're on this sub (Dungeon Keeper Ami, The Two Year Emperor, Chuunin Exam day, etc.). One fic I like a lot which isn't very famous is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/79107/1/The-Story-of-Magus]] . I read it when I was younger, and it was one of my first introductions to the "what if all the stereotypical NPCs were real people with real motivations" genre.
