My main worries are:

- People get bored when it feels like nothing is changing.
- I probably am not going to actually have the wherewithal to complete a multimillion word epic, and I'd rather get to a stopping point rather than just abandon the fic in the middle.
- I think it's hard for people who are reading along as chapters are released to keep 10 different long-running subplots in their heads for months and months, especially since some will go multiple chapters without any updates.
