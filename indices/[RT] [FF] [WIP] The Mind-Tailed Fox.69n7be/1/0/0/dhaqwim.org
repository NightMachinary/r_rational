Whilst the slow pace would be pretty much untenable in an actual paper novel, I've always felt that one of the strengths of online writing is that you can introduce things slowly and take your time in a way that a paper novel would require multiple books to manage - and of course, you'd have to tie the story down into "arcs" to fit those books. The writing's enjoyable and those points will presumably pay off eventually, so what's the hurry?
