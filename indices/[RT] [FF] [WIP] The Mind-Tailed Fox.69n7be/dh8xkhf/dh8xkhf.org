Have only read the first chapter so far, but I quite like the writing. I think this is a really elegant way of doing the brains-for-chakra trade-off.

One plot problem I'm worried about is that if the kyuubi really is released if Naruto is assassinated, it will try to make that happen. And, being smart, it will either succeed or I'm worried there's a plot hole.

Instead, maybe there's some better conditions of the binding - like maybe the kyuubi is only released a few percent of the time if Naruto is assassinated, but is always released if Naruto dies of old age (not that it would tell anyone else that fact).
