Why not just go with that? Kyubi wants Naruto's trust for some reason, and is trying to manipulate him. As for why Kyubi doesn't just try to get naruto to kill himself to release him, introduce costs to the kyubi for release. Like, he gains some of the knowledge and skills of his hosts while he's inhabiting them so he doesn't necessarily want to be released right away. And if they die too suddenly or violently he'll go into an irrational frenzied state and start mindlessly rampaging after being forcibly ripped from the mind of someone who was dying horribly. Instead of making him a superintelligence just give him the power to steal the knowledge and skills of his hosts.
