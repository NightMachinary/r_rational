Okay, all caught up. Seems great, I love it. The characters are all great, the pacing is a little on the slow side (unless you plan to have things go sideways fast), but this is fine with me unless it causes the story to get discontinued before a good stopping point.

My uncertainty about what the heck is going on with the seal is still a problem for me. Come to think of it, wouldn't dying to Mizuki have been sufficient? The recent talk about demons provides a class of alternate explanations, but we have little information and there's lots of possibilities. Because I don't know what's really going on, there's tension, but the tension feels a bit pointless. If we're going to go too much longer without a reveal, I think I'd have preferred a partial reveal (e.g. fox POV, Minato POV) at the beginning to at least cut down on the possibilities.
