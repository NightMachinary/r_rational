Yeah, I think you're right about me mishandling the Kyuubi situation. I think there are at least three properties that a "good" mystery subplot should have:

- There are a few obvious potential answers that people can mull over and compare. (There can also be non-obvious answers, but you want readers at every level to be able to have fun thinking about it, and you don't want there to be like fifty possible answers.)
- The search space narrows over time, and every time it narrows there are important implications for things the reader cares about.
- A clever reader can actually solve the damn thing before they're just straight-up told the answer.

So, yeah, 0/3 at the moment. I'll do some thinking on how best to patch it.
