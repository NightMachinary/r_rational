Probably a bit late to the party here, but my personal head canon is tht the reason the Kyuubi is helping Naruto get smarter because there is a way for Kyuubi to add Naruto's mind to it's collective when he dies. It would add an interesting twist to the tale; it would add to the whole 'naturally occuring AI' theme Kyuubi and other demons bring. Perhaps the Nine-Tailed Fox didn't always have nine tails? (And would also add an interesting, never before seen reason for Kushina to be in the seal with Kyuubi)
