Thanks!

I'm also worried about plot problems caused by the Kyuubi being too smart. You'd expect a superintelligence that's trying to trick a small child into getting himself killed by people he knows to succeed almost immediately. There are some complications -- Naruto is guarded, anyone powerful enough to defeat his guards is more likely to be smart and also to know about the Kyuubi, if the Kyuubi tips his hand too early and the Hokage knows he's actively trying to escape it would get much harder, etc. etc. -- but I eventually decided that I did need to tone the Kyuubi's power level down a bit to have the conflict be plausible.

A structural problem related to that is that it's hard to write a superintelligence that's weakened in several crucial ways but doesn't want to share what they are, because if you just write that directly it comes across as a superintelligence that's acting irrationally or inconsistently. I'm planning for Naruto to discover more about the details once he understands how seals work, but if I were to go back and write it again I would put the excuse for him learning the actual rules the Kyuubi is operating under much much earlier in the story so that it's clearer what's going on.

(Another related problem I've had trouble with is that it's hard to write good dialogue between Naruto and the Kyuubi, because good dialogue usually involves conflicting personalities, and it's hard to see why the Kyuubi wouldn't just interact with Naruto in whatever way made Naruto happiest and most pliable. You can handwave some of this away because human psychology is bonkers and it might actually be correct for the Kyuubi to occasionally create conflict with Naruto for manipulative reasons, but I'm still struggling with it.)
