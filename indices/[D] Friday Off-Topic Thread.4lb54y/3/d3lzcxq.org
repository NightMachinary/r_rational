Merely noticing your own irrational thought processes is not sufficient to make them stop, it seems. The US Democratic primary is making this amply clear to me. My observation here is about the thought process, but obviously political mutant spider babies and all that.

For various reasons I rather dislike Hillary, but the server or the FBI investigation are not why I formed that opinion. However, at this point that investigation is starting to look like the only thing that could possibly cost her the nomination, and all the [[/r/politics]] discussions about the Democratic primary seem centered around it. So... I didn't notice it happening, but it seems like my brain went from "I hate her so much and it's because of what a horribly corrupt incarnation of the bribe devouring status quo she is" to "I hate her and it's because she's an arrogant criminal who must never have security clearance again." And I know perfectly well that people are good at rationalizing things, and also that those narratives do not contradict, but... I can't put a finger on when the transformation occurred. Somewhere along the way my brain decided to have the exact same feelings but to justify them in a different way.
