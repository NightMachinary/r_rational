I think the big story of (ir)rationality is with the DNC. The DNC runs the risk of losing the general with electing Hillary, and they don't run that risk if they nominate Bernie. Rational superdelegates who only want the party to win should vote Bernie, but I doubt the establishment will be that rational.
