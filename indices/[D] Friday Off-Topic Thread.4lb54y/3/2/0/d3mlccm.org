There are other costs to Superdelegate votes, too. Let's say that Clinton (as expected) wins a majority regular delagates--she wins more states, more overall votes, etc than Sanders. As the Democratic Party leadership, you lose a LOT of face if you say "hey Democratic Party members, we've decided that even though a majority want Clinton, we're going to run Sanders instead. Primaries were fun, but now adults are talking, okay?" or something. Basically, the Superdelegates can't afford to do anything other than give all their votes to whoever has the most regular delegates in terms of long term party health. Imagine the furor if they defied the will of the party membership! This is also the basic reason the GOP won't just be like "Hey guys, we quickly rewrote the rules of the primary when nobody was looking, and now Mitt Romney(or whoever) is the nominee instead of the candidate the people want"-- the primaries serve an important purpose, which is legitimizing the candidates selected by the parties.

How catastrophic is it /really/ if the Republicans win a /single/ Presidential election, versus completely alienating the entirety of your own party? Even if you hate Trump! Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Sanders clearly can beat Trump and Clinton clearly can't. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the Democratic Party leadership is unified and makes a decision together on how to allocate their superdelegate votes. Let's say they want the best for the party instead of for themselves. Let's say they have the power to make Sanders the nominee, and backlash from Clinton for having a fairly won nomination taken away from her won't hurt them. Even granting all that, it seems pretty clear they have to follow the will of the party membership if they want anyone to take the process seriously. Could you imagine the amount of protest voting and the total shitshow it would be? The Democratic party might go through one of those "splinter into 5 parties and reform" things that happen occasionally, or just lose a bunch of elections etc.

There's a lot more to "The Democratic Party winning" than "having a very slightly higher chance of winning this Presidential election, once"--trading institutional credibility for a local win like this would be a dangerous move.
