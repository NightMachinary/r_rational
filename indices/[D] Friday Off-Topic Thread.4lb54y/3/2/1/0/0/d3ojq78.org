It's arguable whether being highly interested in creating as beneficial a situation for your family as possible is corrupt, at least from most people I've talked to. And I don't think that it is somehow impossible for people, even technically people in power, to simply disagree with me. It's just that, as far as I have been informed, the situation here in the US is not so fortunate. I don't doubt that Hillary's rhetoric has won over many people, and that some supers elevates genuinely agree with her. I just have been convinced that their primary motivation for voting for her is unrelated to that agreement.
