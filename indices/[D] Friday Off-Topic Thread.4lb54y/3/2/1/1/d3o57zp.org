Indeed. Hillary is actually running a somewhat rational campaign if you consider everything from her point of view. She has no interest in doing anything but enriching herself through the Clinton Slush Fund (I won't call it anything else, because only 10% of the money donated to it goes to charitable works)

Far too many people trust her than should, so she's taking advantage of it. She's investing in the ignorance of the masses, which is normally a very good bet.

However, I think that Hillary is so unlikable as a person that she will lose to Trump. Trump is roughly as unlikable, but he's telling people he's going to fix things. Hillary is basically saying everything is fine and more of the same would be good for the country.

Bernie would make a better Democratic contender because he actually has a personality. Whether or not he actually believes the impossibilities he spouts is not so certain.
