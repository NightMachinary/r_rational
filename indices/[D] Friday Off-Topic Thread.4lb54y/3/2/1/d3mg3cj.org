Superdelegates are being fairly rational, it's just it is vanishingly rare for their goal to be something as group-centric as 'have the party candidate elected.'

Generally, superdelegates (and the majority of politicians, state and federal) act with stark self-interest, or slightly less commonly interest for their immediate family. It is generally personally profitable for them to vote for Hillary, since Hillary has the most wealth that she can distribute to them in return for their votes, and is the most willing to do so in return for those votes.
