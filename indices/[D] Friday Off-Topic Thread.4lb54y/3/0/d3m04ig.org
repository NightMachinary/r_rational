In the permutation of hindsight bias where you say "I knew that" after learning something new and intuitive, you can't remember your previous state of not-knowing. Based on that, I'd say the change occurred immediately after you processed the new information.

If you find yourself hating or disliking someone, imagine you in their specific circumstances and sharing their values (interpreted charitably). What do you do? Often I'd do something differently, but that's because I know different things. The resultant image of the hated person may be off-base, especially if they're actually evil, but more probably it's more accurate than your previous model. You can always update in light of events that occurred after the specific event you imagined.
