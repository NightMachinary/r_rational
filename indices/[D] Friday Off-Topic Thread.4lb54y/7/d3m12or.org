Some Worm fridge horror. Coil's power supposedly allows him to split the timeline at will, while he has single mind controlling his body in both branches. He can later destroy any of them and split again.

Consider an alternative description. Universe is constantly branching so that every possible configuration is explored. Coil's power 'only' allows him to retain the mind-synchronizing connection between his two selves in branches of the multiverse that naturally occur at the moment he does the 'split'. When he 'destroys' one branch, what actually occurs is that his mind state stops synchronizing. One instance of him goes on happily believing that he has actually destroyed a disadvantageous branch, while the other quickly realizes the horror of having to deal with the consequences of his actions multiplied by the amount of times he did this to himself, coupled with grim certainty that the other him will forever remain ignorant of the truth and will keep doing this.
