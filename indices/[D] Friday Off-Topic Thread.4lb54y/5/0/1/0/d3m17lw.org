Generally when I hear scenarios like this, I assume that the intent is get to the heart of the question that I was asked. It's like if someone presents you with the trolley problem; you /know/ that the question isn't about trolley mechanics, so answering as though it /is/ shows bad faith (in my opinion), because the questioner almost never wants an elaborate roleplaying session where the setting is described in excruciating detail, especially since additional details are only going to make the scenario conform to the original intent of the question anyway.
