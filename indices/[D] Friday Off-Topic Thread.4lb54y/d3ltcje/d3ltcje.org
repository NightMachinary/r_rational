An interesting question: *[[http://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/373830][When did the Roman Empire fall?]]*\\
- 395: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I][Emperor Theodosius I]] dies. The empire is divided between his two sons into two portions, administered from Constantinople and from +Rome+ Milan.\\
- 476: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer][Odoacer]], commander of the WRE's +barbarian+ Germanic mercenaries in Italy, deposes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_Augustulus][Western Roman Emperor Romulus August(ul)us]] and declares himself King of Italy. Though he pays lip service to the previous Western Roman Emperor, Julius Nepos (who fled to Dalmatia after being deposed in favor of Romulus Augustulus), he refuses to allow the latter's return to Italy.\\
- 480: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Nepos][Julius Nepos]] dies in Dalmatia. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_(emperor)][Zeno]], his eastern counterpart, abolishes the Western court and holds /de jure/ sway over the "united" empire from Constantinople, though he has little /de facto/ control over the West.\\
- 565: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I][Emperor Justinian I]] dies after reconquering large areas of formerly-Roman territory in Italy, Africa, and Spain. His successors soon lose these gains to Germanic tribes and to the Sunni Caliphate.\\
- 636: The Sunni Caliphate's forces annihilate the Eastern Roman army in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Yarmouk][the Battle of Yarmouk]]. The ERE abandons Syria to Muslim conquest, and soon loses Egypt and Armenia as well.\\
- 1204: Constantinople is conquered by the leaders of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade][the Fourth Crusade]], who establish [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Empire][the Catholic "Empire of Romania" (or "Latin Empire")]]. Competing Greek claimants to the title of Emperor are set up in Nicaea, Epirus, and Trebizond. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Nicaea][The "Empire" of Nicaea]] eventually destroys the Latin and Epirote claimant states, regains Constantinople, and proclaims a restored ERE, while Trebizond remains independent.\\
- 1453: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople][Constantinople is conquered]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_the_Conqueror][Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottomans]], who proclaims himself Caesar of Rome.\\
- 1461a: Mehmed II conquers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotate_of_the_Morea][the Despotate of Morea]], the last independent remnant of the Nicaean ERE.\\
- 1461b: Mehmed II conquers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Trebizond][the "Empire" of Trebizond]], the last independent remnant of the pre-1204 ERE.\\
- 1806: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor][Holy Roman Emperor Francis II]] dissolves the HRE, as Napoleon threatens to conquer it and transform it into a France-dominated federal structure.\\
- 1917: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia][Tsar Nicholas II]] abdicates the throne of the Russian Empire. Russia formerly was seen as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Rome][a "Third Rome"]]: The great-great-grandfather of Ivan IV "the Terrible", first Tsar of Russia (as opposed to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow][Muscovy]]), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Palaiologina][was]] an Eastern Roman Emperor, and Muscovy was instrumental in bringing (Orthodox) Christianity to Russia, just as Constantine brought Christianity to the Mediterranean.\\
- 1922: The Grand National Assembly of Turkey [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_the_Ottoman_sultanate][abolishes the Ottoman sultanate]].\\
- (Some other date that the pollster didn't consider)

So, what are the prerequisites for being able to declare yourself the Emperor of Rome?

As weird as it seems even to me, I'm inclined to think that the most consistent answer for the /final/ end of the Roman Empire is *1922*.\\
- Religion: To say that only Christians can be Roman Emperors is ridiculous when the Empire was pagan for centuries before Constantine and Theodosius.\\
- Legitimacy of claim: To say that only non-usurpers can be Roman Emperors is ridiculous when there were zillions of usurpations even before the Empire split.\\
- - (There are, of course, /degrees/ of legitimacy. If [[http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Empires][the rules of /Crusader Kings II/]] are taken as a /vaguely/-accurate example, actually controlling most of the title's historical territory is necessary to proclaim yourself ruler of it, but you'll have a hard time conquering enough land to do so without either declaring holy wars or having already inherited a claim on the title. Nowadays, any "historical territory" or "hereditary claims" of the Roman Empire would be laughably weak, after so many centuries have passed--unless Turkey can be called the Empire's republican successor... but we're talking about the Roman /Empire/ here, aren't we? Such a digression!)\\
- Culture: To say that only Romans can be Roman Emperors--that the Roman Empire can be usurped only from inside, and any usurpation by an invader is illegitimate--to me seems like a slightly-stronger argument (in favor of 1453), but still rather arbitrary, since the Roman Empire contained sizeable populations of many cultures.

Alternatively, if continuity is required, I'd go for *1204* as a /temporary/ end to the Roman Empire, before its Nicaean restoration, since none of the claimants seem to have had particularly-strong claims before that time. This opinion may be influenced by the Fourth Crusade's treatment in the Historical Improvement Project mod for /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings][Crusader Kings II]]/, which outright destroys the "Eastern Roman Empire" title and fragments it into claimant states whenever it loses Constantinople or is held by a non-Christian.

Unwritten rules of the +cape+ Reddit scene: Length limitations on comments! At what point does a wall of text cease to be interesting and start to be annoying? [[http://np.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/4k7mxz/heres_the_thing/d3d3qp9?context=2][;-)]]

On a related note, I recently discovered [[http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp][the =details= HTML tag]], which is a nicely-simple way of condensing content ([[https://www.dropbox.com/s/grz9dqbhwlsrek5/Italia%20structure.html][example]]). Also, I enjoy being able to condense references into links on Reddit, rather than being forced to include them directly as plaintext on Facebook. It's like speaking in three dimensions (if paragraph-based transitions between topics are the second dimension)!
