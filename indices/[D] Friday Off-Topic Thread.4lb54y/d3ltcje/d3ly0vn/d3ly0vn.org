I've always thought of it as 1453, when Constantinople fell, which is also conveniently about 1,000 years after the WRE fell. Until Constantinople actually fell, you had a large territory that for the most part was a direct successor (politically and legally) to the Roman Empire, and the people and nobles living there identified themselves (and their state) as Roman. /They/ thought they were in the Roman Empire, if nothing else.

I think there's a good argument for 476, though--this is definitely the fall of the WRE, at least. After this, Rome had basically lost control of Africa, Mauretania, Iberia, most of France, Italy, etc. Europe and many of the other civilizations touching the Mediterranean were plunged into a thousand years of war, darkness and barbarism. Although the ERE/Byzantine Empire was known as the Roman Empire after 476, in retrospect we don't call it the Roman Empire. We call it something else. It certainly isn't the same, even if it's a legitimate successor.
