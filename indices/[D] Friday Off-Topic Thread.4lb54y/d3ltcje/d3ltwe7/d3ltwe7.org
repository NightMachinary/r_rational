My personal rule for comment length is five paragraphs, though I try to also make sure that I have something to say, and I'll go longer if I think that it's something people actually want to read (or I just really want to talk about it). I think I can also get a lot of mileage out of breaking up the wall of text with bullet points or charts.

That said, a lot of the time people don't put the work into making their text pleasant and readable, which can really drop my enjoyment substantially and make me click away. This can be especially true on subs like this one (and [[/r/magicbuilding]]) in part because few people have either the training in technical writing to make technical details readable, or the training in prose writing to deliver exposition well. Worse, sometimes people seem to have only gathered some surface level understanding of what makes text easily readable, so they include section breaks and bullet points willy-nilly. (Alternately, there are places like [[/r/tifu]] or [[/r/talesfromtechsupport]] where people have no idea what makes for a good story and do their best /impression/ of a guy who is telling an entertaining story without actually accomplishing their goal.)
