I tend to write walls of text only if specifically prompted to (e.g. by people asking for detailed explanations of things that can't be easily explained tersely). The best way to make walls of text more readable is the use of formatting to break sections up - if you're going more than half a dozen paragraphs or two dozen sentences on reddit, you basically should always break that up into smaller pieces using subsections and titles or something.
