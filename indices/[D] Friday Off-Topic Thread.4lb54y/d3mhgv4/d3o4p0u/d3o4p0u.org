Cost-benefit analysis is required. How much would it hurt for the assassin's face to be known vs. how difficult it would be to kill those that know the secret. As mentioned by others below, it can go either way, depending on the story.

For example: If magic is involved, and the assassin will die to a curse in a week if they do not keep their identity secret, then from that assassin's point of view (given that they are an assassin and are already known to be willing to kill people), it's rational in almost every situation.
