If the murderer decides not to kill you on the spot, it's highly unlikely that they would come back later to do it. It would be easier to kill you immediately, in most scenarios.

Factor in the unreliability of witnesses, and the near impossibility of forming a good enough mental picture of a person within a second or two, and it makes little sense to kill the witness.

Further, your decision to call the cops isn't really relevant. The thing that matters in what your would-be murderer /thinks/ that you did / will do.

This isn't to say that a scenario couldn't be crafted where it would be in the assassin's best interest to kill the witness later; it would just take some extenuating circumstances.

I'm... I'm not helping you plan a murder, am I? I don't want to have to explain this post to a judge.
