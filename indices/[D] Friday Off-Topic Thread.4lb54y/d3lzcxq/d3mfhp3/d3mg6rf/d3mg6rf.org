I asked a question some months back about North Korea, and why don't we see a broad coalition of countries like China and the US just go in and put a stop to them before they get Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles to go with their nukes? The answer I got that made the most sense was... 'Rational' from /whose point of view?/ The worst possible outcome may be Nuclear War/The Democrats losing basically everything, but that's not a certain outcome even if noone does anything. Meanwhile, proposing an attack against North Korea/openly turning on Hillary carries a considerable cost in political capital for anyone who does it, especially if you are among the first to do so. And if you are in a position to make that decision, you probably got there by being a shrewd politician who does not altruistically throw all your cards on the table whenever it seems like someone somewhere should.
