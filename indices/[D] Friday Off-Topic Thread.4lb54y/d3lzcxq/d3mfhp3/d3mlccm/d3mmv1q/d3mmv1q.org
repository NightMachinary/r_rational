The DNC/superdelegates have an easy way out. They say they can't run a nominee that's under FBI investigation and looks pretty much guilty of an infraction that bans her from seeing secret material ever again.

(The justice system should treat Chelsea Manning and Hillary Clinton in the same vein. Not completely similarly, but they are guilty of basically the same type of thing.)
