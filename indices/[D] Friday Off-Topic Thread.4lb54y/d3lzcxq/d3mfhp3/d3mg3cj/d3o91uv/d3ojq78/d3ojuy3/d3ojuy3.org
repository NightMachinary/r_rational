I suppose you're just more cynical than me.

Personally, I think that if you are a Democratic party insider, it's not surprising if you support a popular, long time Democrat over somebody who only joined the party last October and has spent most of his time since then publicly insulting you.

I mean, it's theoretically possible that some superdelegates are motivated by naked self interest, but it is by no means required to explain their observed behavior.
