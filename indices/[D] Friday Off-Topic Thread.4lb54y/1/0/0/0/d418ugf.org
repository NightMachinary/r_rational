It always ends up as a discussion of what exactly constitutes continuity of the Roman Empire. For example, if the empire was still whole and the WRE never fell, but they shifted to speaking Greek, you wouldn't say "well, this isn't the Roman Empire any more". Heck, there was a huge religious change away from the Roman gods to Christian monotheism, and even with this big change we still thought it was the Roman Empire.

So, it /is/ true that the Byzantine Empire (which at the time, was called the Roman Empire) spoke Greek more than Latin. I don't think this is a sufficient-on-its-own reason to say they're not the Roman Empire any more--at least for me. If the Empire was whole and gradually changed language to speak Greek, I'd still think it was the Roman Empire, so that means if I think the Roman Empire fell in 476, this alone cannot be the reason.
