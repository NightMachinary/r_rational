I've started building an RC airplane (kinda like those RC cars you'd often see as a kid) with an electric motor. It's actually not too expensive (under $200) to get the parts for a plane with a 3-foot wingspan and 10 minute flight time (including controllers, antenna, etc). Putting a camera on it to hook up to VR goggles would be more expensive, so I'm not doing that.
