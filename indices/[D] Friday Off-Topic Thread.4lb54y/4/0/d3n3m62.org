The opening arc of HxH is a rather interesting beast among shounen because there are barely any actual battles that go on. Instead, almost every obstacle they face are more puzzles than fights, and that's something I seriously appreciate. Even a lot of the later fights are mostly decided by strategy than strength. So I would see that it is significantly more rational than the average shounen.
