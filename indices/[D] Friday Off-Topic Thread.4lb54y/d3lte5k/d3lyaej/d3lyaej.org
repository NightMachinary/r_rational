Apparently Starry Night mixes well with anything?

  Part of me thinks that this is just going to replace or add on to a lot of the filters that are already in Photoshop and the like.

Call it a filter, call it whatever you want. The results in the album are things I would be willing to hang on my wall. It would definitely be nicer if it were to reach the point where anyone could get those results in a single click, but as long as it's easier than making such images by hand, it's progress.

Imagine a world where "I want image X reimagined in the style of artist Y" isn't something you have to commission an artist for.

Speaking of which. I'm curious what the legal copyright status on images altered in this way would be.
