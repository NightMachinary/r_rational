I'm guessing you all have seen this, but I found [[http://imgur.com/a/ue6ap][this album of deep dream generated art]] to be really interesting. You can make your own [[https://dreamscopeapp.com/][on this site]], [[https://deepart.io/][or this one]], or [[https://github.com/SergeyMorugin/ostagram][grab the code from github]]. Part of me thinks that this is just going to replace or add on to a lot of the filters that are already in Photoshop and the like. But a different part of me thinks that maybe this will actually be useful for creating art, though I think you still need to get composition and balance right, and it does take a little bit of time and practice to get good results.
