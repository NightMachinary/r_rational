Depends on what you're talking about. If it's just [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses][Leave No Witnesses]], then that's fairly rational; witnesses can contact the authorities, they can positively identify you later on, and they'll be called in the event of a trial.

But the more extreme version, where the assassin expends enormous amounts of resources trying to chase down people who know his identity ... that's quite a bit harder to justify.
