Depends on the situation, I'd assume.

If the time and hassle of killing the witness outweighs the cost of having the witness blab, then the witness gets to live, yay!

Example A: A foreign assassin in ancient times who will be able to escape back to his home country before the witness is able to get help will probably let the witness live.

Example B: The eldest prince murders his father and is found out by a guard? The guards got to die. Later, the prince claims the guard killed the father, and that he heroically avenged his father's death.

There are a bunch of variables though. Is the witness psychotic? Probably safe to let them live because no one will believe them. Will you be convicted either way? Mine as well let them live. Is there a decent chance that the witness could kill you, if you attempted to kill them? Probably should run away.
