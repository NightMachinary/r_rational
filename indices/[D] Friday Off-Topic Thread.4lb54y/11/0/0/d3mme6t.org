I'm speaking about random person A. Like you are in a hotel, walking to your room, you hear a gunshot and see a man come bursting through the halls. He runs into you and you see his face in full. Only for a second or two before he gets up and escapes.

How likely is it that you get murdered later because you saw his face (and let's assume, for the sake of the argument, this is before you make a decision about whether to go to the authorities or not)
