As far as I can tell, nothing's really that much of an improvement over the typewriter, dpeaking in terms of getting stuff written. We've had plenty of usability reforms, but creative writing hasn't really been helped by technology like art has been by pen tablets or music by digital audio workstations.

But hey, if you find something that proves me wrong, feel free to tell me!
