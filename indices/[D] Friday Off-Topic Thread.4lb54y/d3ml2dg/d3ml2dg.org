I've been watching the show Hunter x Hunter again since my Roommates haven't seen it. I have to say, that show is actually a lot more rational than most other anime's i've seen. The question I have to ask you guys here though, is this. Do you think the show itself is rational? There's a couple times where a bunch of stuff that happens is kind of stupid, but overall I find the stupid stuff to be minor enough to overlook it.

What do you think?
