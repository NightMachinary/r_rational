It wouldn't even be that bad. Coil was very concerned about that kind of scenario happening, and was very careful not to put all his eggs in the same basket in case he was forced to shut down a timeline by external events. So every "bad turn Coil" would just find themselves in a slightly shitty situation, wonder why they ended up with the most useless superpower ever and then go "Meh, I'm still rich and at the head of a massive criminal empire, so who cares".
