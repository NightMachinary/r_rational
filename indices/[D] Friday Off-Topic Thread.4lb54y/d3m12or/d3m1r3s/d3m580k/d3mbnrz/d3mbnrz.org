If there were infinite parallel universes, all with capes, then Khepri could have mindslaved infinite versions of every cape to help deal with Scion. This is not the case, instead what we have is a lot more like a finite series of universes that were shaved off from the rest of the multiverse and then had Shards scattered throughout them, with most landing on Bet. And from that point onwards they did not split into new universes.
