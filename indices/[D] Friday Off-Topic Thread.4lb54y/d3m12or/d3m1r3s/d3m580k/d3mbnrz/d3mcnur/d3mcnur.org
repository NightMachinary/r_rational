You're correct about the number of parallel universes being finite.

But even it it wasn't, the Clairvoyant isn't /that/ strong. Khepri did not gain instant awareness of every person (or, for that matter, landscape) in the multiverse. She had to specifically look for things, things she at least vaguely knew where to find. She ended up with all the capes from her own world she'd already heard of, but not e.g. the bizarro capes from the Traveller's interlude.
