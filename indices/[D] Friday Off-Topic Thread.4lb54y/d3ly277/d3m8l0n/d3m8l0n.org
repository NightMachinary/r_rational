I don't think I should press the button.

The demand is that someone dies.

1. Ceteris paribus, I think I should rather die through inaction than kill through action.
2. Ceteris paribus, I think I should rather whoever survives this experience come away with the emotion of "someone died to save me" (or perhaps ignorance of the situation, if they weren't told) than the emotion of "I killed someone to save my own skin" (whether remorsefully or remorselessly).

Postulated exactness of the duplication aside, we're different people /now/. And certainly more so as the hour goes on. So I'm not sure the idea of us being the "same" person should alter my choice. (It does mitigate a couple of things though, like the death-fear of not being able to continue what I've started, and the question of whether the life of the person I'm saving is "worth" more or less than mine.)

--------------

Would I hit the button if my duplicate /would/ hit the button?

I'm not sure that changes the answer. As postulated, that's his only difference from me, so it'll be moot after the hour anyway.
