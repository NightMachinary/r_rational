Suppose you're trapped in a room.

There's a similiar room nearby, with your exact duplicate inside.

Your room has a button, the other room doesn't.

Press the button, and you will be immediately released, but the other room will be filled with deadly neurotoxin, and your duplicate will die.

Do nothing, and after an hour, your duplicate will be freed, but the deadly neurotoxin will fill /your/ room.

Will you press the button?

What if the duplicate is not exact, and the only difference is that he or she will choose differently, in your situation?
