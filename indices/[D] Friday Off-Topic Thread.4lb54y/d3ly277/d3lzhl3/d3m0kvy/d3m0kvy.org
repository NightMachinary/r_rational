Hmm. The clone in the room with the button knows more about this situation than another one, and has access to a weapon, however limited; on the other hand, the evil scientist could have messed with another clone's brain, therefore he would appear less threatening to the scientist --- lack of explicit access to a weapon only helps here --- and the scientist is more likely to underestimate him.

So, out of four, probably the clone in the room without the button in the second situation.
