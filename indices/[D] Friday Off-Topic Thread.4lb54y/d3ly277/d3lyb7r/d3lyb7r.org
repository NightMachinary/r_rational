If I have an exact duplicate in an identical situation, there's a bit of a conundrum here. He'll do exactly what I do, since he's literally me in literally the same situation, right. So if I tap the button, he's tapping it at the /exact same time/. Do we both just die then? The question isn't clear. There doesn't seem to be a situation written out for "neither of us hit the button" or "both of us hit the button simultaneously" which are the only two possibilities here.
