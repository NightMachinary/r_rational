I'm experimenting right now using [[https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style][this github code]] (and some ice packs for my poor overworked laptop).

I haven't gotten nearly as good results, either because the gallery has pruned a hell of a lot of failures, or because they've found a better combination of parameters (what weight to give to each image, whether to care about minute elements or only about major trends etc.). It's a work in progress.

Shame it takes so damn long for an image to be computed. It slows down my progress considerably.
