Interesting... Yeah actually that was my first impression too before my brain rectified it to adorable. Whats interesting is, come to think of it, my brain always does that. Cthulu mythos monsters, writhing mats of incect life... Actually if you asked me to describe the properties that comprise 'cute' at this point id probably just say in scales with wrigling and number of eyes.
