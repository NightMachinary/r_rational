The "art style" makes the lips look distorted in a way that looks like scar tissue or mutated flesh. Same thing for the skin, though less pronounced. He looks like there's an eye in his mouth. The shadow and the fingers on the bottom left make it look like something's growing out of him. Plus he kinda looks like he's in pain.

On the whole, I think the deep dream mixing doesn't work that well with photographs of people. At least, not with close ups. Buildings and landscapes benefit more from the eerie feel the filters give to an image.
