Yeah, I've been thinking of getting [[http://i.imgur.com/uTLN2CP.jpg][this one]] of my son cleaned up and framed (there are some problems with the base image that make it poorly composed, which luckily shouldn't be too difficult to fix in Gimp, even though I suck at image editing). The real reason that you won't get great results in a single click, and probably for quite some time, is that photographs and paintings have different artistic "rules" which would be fairly difficult to teach a computer. Also, most photographs are now taken by amateurs who only have the most basic understanding of what makes a photograph good. Also also, the computer doesn't understand what's important and what's not, which is one of the reasons that it often screws up facial features in the filtering process.

Copyright ... is a /really/ legally grey area. They're almost certainly derivative works, but that only helps you a little bit, especially if one or both of the base images is open source or public domain.
