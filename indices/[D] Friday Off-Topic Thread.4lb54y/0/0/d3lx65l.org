I've been goofing around with it a bit lately too (e.g. see this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/4jkr1c/horseshoe_bend_at_sunset_1024x682_oc_os/d380m1q?context=4][reddit comment]], some [[https://i.imgur.com/kFOjsbw.png][graphics]] for [[https://i.imgur.com/pP1zBNt.png][presentations]] I've done on paleo stuff to get a more old-timey look -- though I just had a better thought: cave paintings! -- and profile [[https://i.imgur.com/6yCcHjq.png][photos]] on [[https://i.imgur.com/eNS0wkQ.png][social media]] -- sometimes it turns out really [[https://i.imgur.com/FxQzOZj.png][nice]] and other times quite [[https://i.imgur.com/btAmB9A.png][frightening]]). It's a really neat gizmo and I see myself using it for a while yet!
