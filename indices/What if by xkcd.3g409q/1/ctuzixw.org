I love the what-if posts but Randall has clearly taken on more than he can chew since the update schedule has gotten completely bonkers. Even after a several month hiatus, he is apparently not doing regular weekly posts anymore.

I realize that as a consumer of his products (and one who doesn't even pay at that!) I have very little right to complain about scheduling, but I honestly wish he would go to a less frequent but more regular schedule.

All that being said, perhaps one of the best comics for rational fiction type stuff.
