Thanks!

Edit: and I found a typo in the very sentence that I was looking for:

#+begin_quote
  Like an old drop in a densitometer, like a free balloon over eighteenth-century France, like a small defiant bubble in the sky, the “Thunderbolt” floated.
#+end_quote

Should be "oil drop".

[obviously my memory compacted the sentence since I first read it]
