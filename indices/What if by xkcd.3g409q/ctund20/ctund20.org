I guess this blows away that Poul Anderson (I think) story where a spaceship saves itself by reaching the level it floats in a gas-giant atmosphere.

I only recall one line in the story now, /"Like a bubble in a densitometer, the <name of ship> floated"/. Utterly ungoogle-able. Anyone remember this one?
