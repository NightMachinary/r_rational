An immortality idea - Possible now, but a very long shot. More realistically doable in the next 100-200 years, though still a long shot then I'd say.

To start out with, a lengthy six paragraph intro. Fair warning in case you want to skip the justification for the approach, and get straight into the approach.

biology is hard. As a biologist it is staggering the amount of mathematics actually involved with understanding systems like the genome let alone the brain. The interdisciplinary interplay between biology, is necessary to understand something is incredible. Math, chemistry, and physics are all necessary to understand what is going on and be able to learn more. You can get summaries, but that's different from really understanding something. You need a large number of people working together to understand these interdisciplinary subjects, which makes understanding something as large and complex as the human life span a daunting task.

I'm not an expert, just completing undergrad, but the amount we have yet to learn about the genome, let alone gene expression makes me think progress on that front is going to be very slow.

We're not particularly close to understanding aging. We don't have a good idea of how gene expression changes with age. Gene expression is difficult to study in part because we don't understand the human genome completely, so the epigenome is more difficult to study because of that. Then there are ethical limitations on human experimentation (which we really do need to have) that slow research down. Even if we were to get rid of those ethical considerations human beings are not good model organisms. We have small numbers of kids with generations times at minimum of around 13 years. Consider to study a single gene generally dozens of generations of an organism are observed.

Working with model organisms can speed up studying homologous areas, but there are inevitably large differences between human beings and say /C. elegans/ that studying the nematodes will simply not be applicable. In effect, I think it is going to be more than 100 years before we make serious progress on understanding human aging let alone doing something about it.

Given that I think aging research is going to be slow and I'd like to see something happen in my lifetime, I think it would be better to narrow the area of research one is trying to do. The brain is the interesting part related to consciousness. "Well duh," says everyone, but bear with me. Narrowing our focus further; For our immortality purposes, we aren't interested in genetics or gene expression in the brain, We are interested in the connectivity and signaling.

If there are zero signals ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential][action potentials]]) in your brain, you're brain dead. If there are no connections in your brain you are also brain dead, considering with no connections there is no way to pass a signal, and in effect no signals can be passed.

Pardon the large intro, but I hope it gives context for my approach.

I think to take a shot at immortality in our lifetimes we need to focus on generating new connections with the brain from outside of the brain. I think that given that the connections made, and the signaling patterns that result, are what ultimately make up consciousness, we might be able to extent some part of our consciousness outside of our skull and into a neuronal circuit in vitro. Something like a cell culture.

The main sticking point is can you actually use or somehow interact in a meaningful way with a neuronal circuit grown outside your brain? This is tricky and would require a lot of research, but requires far less work than a total understanding of aging.

The advantage of this approach is that we don't necessarily need to understand anything about aging or consciousness. We just need to understand enough to introduce a new connection to our nervous system and then grow that system. We don't have to necessarily understand how the circuits we've connected to are growing and work. We just have to know enough to initiate development.

The general approach is basically to let the developmental processes that resulted in our brain happen again outside of our skull while we are attached to this developing nervous system. It may then be possible to imprint ourselves onto this developing in vitro nervous system, such that when the body that houses our skull dies the nervous system dies we suffer something more akin to brain damage than death.

If we were able to utilize enough of the in vitro nervous system for our conscious processes before our body died we may have then been able to train the system to house our consciousness. Whether such an existence would be worthwhile is another question.

tl;dr It might be possible to exploit developmental processes rather than wholly understand them, and thus allow for some continued existence after our normal life span.
