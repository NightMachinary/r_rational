If you look at the efforts of organisations like SENS to achieve longevity and eventually immortality, they agree with you. Biology is hard.

But fixing the things that break does not require an understanding how that thing came to be and the intricate processes that led to it breaking down (and especially no need to understand how you would edit a human to not break down in the first place).

It just requires observation of a problem and working out how to fix the problem (temporarily is fine, as long as it can be repeated or superceded).

Building a car that runs forever is very hard. Keeping a car in working condition is comparatively easy.

Aubrey DeGrey of SENS often speak of "longevity escape velocity". You develop some techniques to fix some issues and give people some extra years. During that time, medicine advances and some more things become fixable, granting some more years. Since technology develops exponentially, we can expect even more breakthroughs during this time, granting more years. And so on. Eventually the technology to prolong your life (or rather, prevent your death) is constantly available within your latest lifespan, effectively granting immortality without actually turning any human into an immortal.

This aproach feels to me like the most realistic to work anytime soon.
