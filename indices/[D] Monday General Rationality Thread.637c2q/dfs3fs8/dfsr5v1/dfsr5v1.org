It's an interesting concept. I assume you'd need good VR and full body paralysis during transition so that you don't end up jostling the mechanism (unless it's small enough to be wearable?), then you'd need a good brain tissue culturing system that isn't going to break down over the long term.

You could also ensure the new brain tissue comes with built in cybernetic electronic devices (sensors to allow you to send mental commands and control virtual / robotic bodies, memory modules to allow eidetic memory, transmitters to form non-biological communications links from one spot in the tissue system to another, and so on), and genetically engineer the stem cells it grows from with better ability to survive cryonics in the event that it is needed, avoid neurodegenerative illness, and survive better without normal organs.

It's sort of like the brain in a jar idea, but it doesn't have to be shaped like a human brain normally is, and would more closely resemble the neural cultures we can realistically experiment with.
