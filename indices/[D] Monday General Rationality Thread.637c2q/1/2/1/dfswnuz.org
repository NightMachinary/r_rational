Sorry for the double reply but this looks like an IRC chat. I'd be interested in joining in to explain some of the idea a little bit more, but then again the idea is pretty much in its infancy.

So on the matter of continuity, I know that just creating a connection won't cause any sort of continuity in consciousness to occur. The idea is that one is able to create a connection (My guess would be figuring out a bit more on how the corpus callosum integrates the two hemispheres and trying to patch connections in a similar man around that area) and then using that connection training the neuronal circuit in vitro.

Over time(years) the idea is eventually you'll be able to train the neuronal circuits in vitro to take over functions and also being able to train memories into them. Ideally over time the in vitro part would make up the majority of one's consciousness so that when the body dies it's only brain damage. You would have to find some way to actively use those in vitro neuronal circuits and imprint what you wanted to retain on them.

There will of course still be the issue of the in vitro part still aging, but if somehow (big if) you manage to accomplish some sort continuity in consciousness between the first two systems you might be able to repeat the process with the remaining entity Ad infinitum.

It's a pretty shaky idea, but it's an idea.
