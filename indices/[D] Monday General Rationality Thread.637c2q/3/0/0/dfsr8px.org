Thanks for the feedback! I really appreciate it!

But: it's so cheesy!!!!! Argh. Might have to do though, it's actually been growing on me. Since, you know, "Seeing Red" is literally what the vampire is doing.

I was trying to think of more red puns/idioms since if I'm going to do three "volumes" I'll have to think of three of them. Blood Red works pretty well for either the second or third volume (first volume: Red is human. second volume: Red is a human augmented by vampire blood. third volume: Red becomes a vampire). Plus probably a third title to use for the set. But I'm really getting ahead of myself....

List of Red Idioms:

- Rolling out the red carpet

- Red card

- Be in / out of the red

- Red flag (oooooo)

- Blood red (a gimme)

- Red hot (whoever wants to write tingler fanfiction of it has my blessing to use this)

- Red herring

- Red handed

- Red eye

- Red tape

- Red-letter day

- Red light

- Paint the town red

- Red cent

- Red meat

- Red sky at night, shepherd's delight / red sky at morning shepherd's warning

- Red tide (no)

- Red alert

- Better dead than red (ha ha ha ha)

- Red light district

- Red mist (apparently UK slang for being really angry?)

- Red dog (apparently an American football term. Not being American... is it well known? it can probably be used for some neat symbolism since it means: /a defensive tactic in which the offensive player who receives the ball from the snap (usually the quarterback) is charged at by multiple defensive players/ - also, Red does adopt a dog in the first book)

- Red wine

I can /probably/ get a second title from one of those depending on what actually happens in volume 2. I've laid down a few things in volume 1 that might come up.
