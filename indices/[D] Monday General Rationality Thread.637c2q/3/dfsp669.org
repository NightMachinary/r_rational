My rational gay vampire romance is very nearly finished! I'm so excited. I don't have a title yet which is killing me. I made a GIANT list of possible titles, including every single one no matter how bad they were, and I hate almost all of them and the ones I like don't really tell you anything about the story.

Note that to make things even /more complicated/ the story is also the first “volume” of three. So I'm looking either for a title that could be for all three volumes (which together would make one full-length ~100-150k word novel) or just for this volume.

Also anything with the word ‘vampire' makes it sound really low rent but the title probably should tell you to expect vampires??

Anyway... I'm desperate so I'm going to post my list of ideas here. No more Sunday Writing Skills Thread so this will do???

Themes: Fitting in, learning about a new society, making a relationship work, being in over your head, relationship between two different people, new customs

Other thing to note: the "point of vision" character (the human who falls in love with the vampire) is named Red. My boyfriend suggested a bunch of titles with a pun on that and they make very little sense if you don't know that.

Also it's set in the 1940s, mostly Corsica (France) but also Rome and Columbus, Ohio.

*Possible Titles*

- Victorian Flower Language

- Speaking his Language

- Vampire Languages

- Symbolism

- Deeper

- Understanding

- One's Sorrow Two's Mirth (or something else from one of those counting rhymes)

- Seeing Red (Gimmicky but there's an upside: can do a series: Seeing Red / Blood Red / Red Carpet or something using idioms with red in them)

- Red (could be just the title of the three volume story made of the above)

- A Platinum Tree (Somewhere I read you should title a story based on a line from the story, or an object that appears in the story. A character being given a platinum tree as a gift is what starts everything going on a downward spiral.)

- Lemon and Lavender (Lemon and lavender also falls in there (what I made the vampire's cologne smell like after googling popular 1940s colognes), it seems like the sort of thing that kind of could be like symbolic?)

- Electrum

- When In Rome (so cliched)

- When In Rome, do as the Vampires

- Do as the Romans/Vampires(???) Do

- Gift Horse

- In the mouth (way too sexual but maybe that's a good thing? .... no)

- -->It is necessary to howl with the wolves (a literal french equivalent of “When in Rome”)

- Howl(ing) with/like the Wolf (I really like that "when in rome" in French is "howl with wolves when you're with wolves", because wolves = predators = vampires, but the universe has werewolves in it, so using a wolf-oriented title in a vampire book might be weird??)

- ---> À la guerre comme à la guerre (“at war is as at war”: French equiv of “All's fair in love and war”)

- Love and War (central conflict is a Vampire War, but this title has been taken a lot)

- À la guerre (no english speaker will know how to pronounce this, probably: "guerre" more or less rhymes with "fair", at least in my accent)

- All's Fair

- At War

- At war

- At war is at war

- When at War

- Custom (current favourite: all chapters have one-word titles, /Death Note/ style, and it's a great double meaning: custom = job, custom = behaviours both of which are important here??? - but it really doesn't tell you what to expect from the story (vampires, romance))

- Strange Ways

- His Ways

- Learning the Ropes

- Present

- Presentation

- Gift

- The Gift

- Vampire's Gift

- Hearts Fangs and Abs (I suggested this as a joke on a thread here a few months ago)

- Pounded in the Butt by Vampire Worldbuilding (this is a serious suggestion)
