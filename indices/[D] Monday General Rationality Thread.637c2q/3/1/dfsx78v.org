I'm ambivalent on puns, personally, and tend to only like one word titles when they're nouns that both specify and are specified by the book (e.g. Mars, or Thud!, or Luminosity), but I understand that other people like one-word titles when they're thematically or emotionally resonant (e.g. Twilight, since we're talking supernatural romance).

If you want a one-word title, then, I'd suggest either something that is key to your book but is otherwise rare, or something that is evocative of the mood of the book (Of your list, Electrum seems most powerful in this sense. If there's a metaphor for alloying silver and gold in there somewhere, that could be cool). Totally alternately, what's your first (or possibly last) chapter title?
