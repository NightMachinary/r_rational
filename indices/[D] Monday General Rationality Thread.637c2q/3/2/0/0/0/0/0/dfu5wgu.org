I don't think Chuck Tingle has even parodied /Twilight/, so I can't set my sights too high, can I?

Seriously though, this is a personal project, so I don't really care about being featured anywhere in particular. My "far-fetched achievable goal that will make me feel like I have achieved something impossible" is to sell 100 copies on Kindle. My "lofty contributing to society goal" is for this story to be popular enough on this sub that it starts to remove the stigma associated with the romance genre in the community and contributes to a trend of more diverse rational fiction (in terms of genre). I don't suspect I'd achieve either of them, but they're the lofty dreams I fantasise about sometimes.

My realistic goal is for my husband and boyfriend to read it, and for my bff/sort-of-coauthor and me to squee over the fact that we've finally achieved our childhood dream of having something novel-ish written based on our mythology. And that I get to feel proud for starting a project and finished it. And those are virtually guaranteed!
