The annoying thing is I haven't read any romance myself, so I can't really comment on the genre. I listened to [[http://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/covers-i][a podcast about it]] last month, and it really spoke to me. I think the scorn that romance as a genre generally get is tied up in history and the patriarchy and all of that.

You think of stereotypical pulp sci-fi and it's generally "just as bad" as romance in terms of how shallow it is - man goes to mars, shoots a blaster at the bad guys, beds a green-skinned woman. But pulp sci-fi doesn't have the same level of scorn as pulp romance does. It's interesting to think about.

Anyway... getting a bit sidetracked. I'm hoping that my story hits the romance notes. I always wonder whether it doesn't have /enough/ romance. But the entire thing is centred around them trying to make their relationship work despite everything, so I hope it does.
