  Oh no! I totally forgot to read what you sent. o.o

It's OK; beta reading is doing me a huge favour, so you are welcome to do it at your leisure. Besides, I've fixed a whole bunch of stuff since I first sent you the link, so everything's good.

Thanks for your feedback on the titles. Those four are definitely among the strongest, along with probably Seeing Red. I'm concerned that /Lemon and Lavender/ does not really relate to the story, that /It is Necessary to Howl with the Wolves/ might make people expect werewolves, /Custom/ doesn't tell you to expect vampires or dudes kissing each other, and /Pounded in the Butt by Vampire Worldbuilding/ might get me into copyright trouble. Meanwhile /Seeing Red/ is very... pulp/corny.

I guess nothing is ever perfect, is it?
