  [...]

  *How do I copyright a name, title, slogan, or logo?*

  Copyright does not protect names, titles, slogans, or short phrases.

There is also this CO document that straight-up called [[https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf][Copyright Protection Not Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases]].

(For bonus points, make /that/ the title of your next story. >:P )

I look forward to the megadollar Hollywood adaptation of /Pounded in the Butt by Vampire Worldbuilding/. >:]
