Here's all my chapter titles because why not???

- Opera

- Procurement

- Flight

- Corsica

- Chestnut (dog's name)

- Lucia (character's name)

- Elodia (character's name)

- Ritual

- War

- Sardinia (chapter is one sentence long because I'm ~artistic~ like that)

- {untitled}

- Homecoming (actually I might call it Columbus instead)

- Dogwood

- Reunion

Just realised I use names and places a lot as chapter titles, so having Red in the title of the novel is less weird. I think a few of these chapters might get combined though as they're very short (probably Corsica and Chestnut, maybe Lucia and Elodia I think). War/Sardinia/Untitled used to all be one chapter (War) but I split them as that single chapter was 25% of the word count.

Electrum unfortunately does not really suit on any metaphorical level :(. It's more related to the general worldbuilding and even then only tangentially and the reader is not going to get any information about the significance of electrum in the first volume.

Didn't choose one word titles for any particular reason. I was naming chapters as I went and most of them were one word, so I just ran with it.
