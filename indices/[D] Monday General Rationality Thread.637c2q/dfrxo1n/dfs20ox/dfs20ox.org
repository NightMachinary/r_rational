  in order to be twice as intelligent, you would have to invest a lot more than twice the effort.

I'm not sure what evidence you could possibly be basing this on.. Do you have evidence that might support this such as animals with larger brain to body ratios requiring exponentially more resources from their brain than should be expected for their relative size? Because that would certainly draw my attention (though how much that would apply to a different computational medium would still be unclear) however I can't seem to find anything indicating this is the case.

I certainly hope you're not trying to use humans as your evidence given we can't even change our hardware (and can make only relatively tiny software changes) and on an absolute scale we have quite little hardware variation compared to other species, plus attempts to increase IQ tend to be rather lackluster and work best on who score lower due to lack of familiarity with mental problems of that sort. Also given how much difference a relatively tiny advantage in social intelligence can make among humans I'm not sure the "absolute" increase in intelligence needed to make something seem incomprehensible to us would be very much.
