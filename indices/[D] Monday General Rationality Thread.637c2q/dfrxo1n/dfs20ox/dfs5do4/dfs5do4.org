Well, Intelligence is not a very well defined term, and I don't have a rigorous proof for my claim (that intelligence is not linear).

I could try to explain my reasoning about it. In the most general sense, I consider intelligence as the capacity for problem solving ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence][Wikipedia sort of agrees with me]]).

A lot of the interesting problems are of the NP complexity class. That means that in order to become better at solving them, you need to invest an exponential amount of resources. This is true regardless of your hardware/software choice.

In a more abstract sense, I think that the most interesting aspects of intelligence (such as creativity and self-awareness) are poorly understood, and we have no reason to believe that simply throwing more computational resources will increase them.
