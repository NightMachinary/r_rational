What I found interesting is the cooperation that groups built. When the German and Belgian flag intercepted, they cooperated to make a hot dog thing. When PlaceHearts overlapped with FTB, FTB added a heart to their design. Somehow, PrequelMemes managed to write out their entire script, and there have been some big artworks. Even in this no-rules setting, cooperation beats out disorganization, easily.
