People created their *own* central authorities with monopolies on legitimate violence. You had to run changes through your own faction or territory owners, or the faction at large would revert your changes. Indeed, there were even super-factions that regulated the efforts of individual factions. For example, [[/r/ainbowroad][r/ainbowroad]] was closely watching the area around helix, and required permission before modifying or creating stuff around it. I had to check into their discord to make sure the [[/r/parahumans]] sign expansion was OK.
