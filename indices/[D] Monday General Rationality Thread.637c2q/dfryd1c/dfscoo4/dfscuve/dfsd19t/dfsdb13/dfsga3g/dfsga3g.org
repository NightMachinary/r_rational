  By that definition, we (that is, americans) currently live in an anarcho-capitalist state, because there's nothing preventing someone from renoucing their citizenship and leaving the nation.

There is, the "exit tax". Exit from the US isn't free, a final submission to the authority of the US government is required - followed by, in all likelihood, going on to live in an even more authoritarian state in terms of property rights, unless you're taking up seasteading.

Total exit rights would constitute to renounce your recognition of the government and to leave at any point in time with no confiscation of property.
