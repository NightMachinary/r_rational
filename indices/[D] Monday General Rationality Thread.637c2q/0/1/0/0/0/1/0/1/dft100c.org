  Now, I'm aware that the anarcho-capitalist solution is to have some sort of private organization to enforce privacy rights. But those private organizations will behave exactly like the united states, in that they'll require a payment in return for protection. And if any private organization can reach a sufficient level of clout (or even just make agreements with other, similar oganizations), they're perfectly free to modify perform rent-seeking behavior like demanding their own exit fees, as, after all, in a free market companies will "change what the market will bear" until which point it's in your best interest to stop dealing with them in spite of that.

I have a problem understanding anarcho-capitalism, because I immediately think that the organizations providing security, privacy and property rights services (with enough clout to provide quality service) would also have the option to decide that there will no longer be a free market on those services within their region of control.

Why let your customer exit if you don't have to? Once you have monopoly or near-monopoly on force in a region, why would you allow any other players? Why would you allow people to cancel their subscription? Why would you allow dissent?
