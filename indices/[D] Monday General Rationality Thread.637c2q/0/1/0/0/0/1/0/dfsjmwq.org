note: I use the 2nd person quite a bit here. I'd like to clarify that it's not addressed at you, [[/u/BadGoyWithAGun]] specifically, but an arbitrary "you" instead.

  There is, the "exit tax". Exit from the US isn't free, a final submission to the authority of the US government is required
#+end_quote

So then the US is anarcho capitalist so long as you're sufficiently wealthy for the exit tax to be nominal, or sufficiently poor for it to be nonexistent?

  Total exit rights would constitute to renounce your recognition of the government and to leave at any point in time with no confiscation of property.

The existence of "property" is a collective delusion. A useful collective delusion, for sure, but something is only "yours" so long as someone else doesn't take it. Or more specifically, something is only yours so long as you have some mechanism that prevents people from taking it, like, for example, a state. If you leave a non anarcho-capitalist state for an anarcho-capitalist existence, you're effectively giving up all property rights regardless. The "exit tax" isn't a tax on your property, as once you stop residing in a state, you no longer have any enforcement mechanism to retain it. The exit tax is a voluntary agreement with the United States that stops it from taking /all/ of your property, instead of just some of it.

Now, I'm aware that the anarcho-capitalist solution is to have some sort of private organization to enforce privacy rights. But those private organizations will behave exactly like the united states, in that they'll require a payment in return for protection. And if any private organization can reach a sufficient level of clout (or even just make agreements with other, similar oganizations), they're perfectly free to modify perform rent-seeking behavior like demanding their own exit fees, as, after all, in a free market companies will "change what the market will bear" until which point it's in your best interest to stop dealing with them in spite of that.

  followed by, in all likelihood, going on to live in an even more authoritarian state in terms of property rights, unless you're taking up seasteading.
#+end_quote

If "being surrounded by authoritarian states" disquailfies a state from anarchocapitalism, then it's entirely impossible to have anything resembling anarchocapitalism because any relationship between three people where one of the people is coerced by the others makes an authoritarian state.
