  Not strictly true. Anarcho-capitalist states permitting X does not mean that the presence of X implies anarcho-capitalism.

I was speaking in conjunction with the "hierarchical authority" part. That is, [[/u/BadGoyWithAGun]] said that hierarchical authority can be a part of anarcho-capitalism, so long as conditions x and y are filled. I was pointing out that allowing for a heirarchical authority with control over legitimate violence dilutes the meaning of anarcho-capitalism to the point where ancaps might as well just choose a new term.

Essentially, my argument goes like this:

1.) Take a broadly anarcho capitalist landscape\\
2.) If some group creates a hierarchical authority, voluntarily or otherwise, they are no longer anarcho-capitalist, but instead their own type of government (Whether tribal, feudalistic, democratic, or whatever) that is surrounded by anarcho-capitalism, rather than being ancaps themselves. The [[/r/place]] equivalent is factions who decide to work on projects in the middle of the chaos.\\
3.) From here, as demonstrated by the pixel arts that flourished across [[/r/place]] replacing the chaos or single-person projects, established factions will outcompete and either incorporate (convince people to join in making a piece of art) or subjugate (immediately replace changes made by free agents) the surrounding unorganized people.

tl;dr: anarcho-capitalism gets outcompeted
