yeah, baconreader didn't have it, although evidently the offical reddit app did.

But in short, it was a 1000x1000 pixel canvas, where each account created before april 1st could place one pixel every 'x' minutes, where 'x' was common through all accounts, but was changed multiple times over the project. (First 'x' was proportional to the number of people on, capping out at ~10 mins, and then it was changed to 5 minutes.)

Because of that time requirement, placing anything virtually mandated cooperation between people. The larger the group, the larger the item they could work to create, although there were diminishing returns as bigger items attracted more vandals (See: the OSU! near the bottom right-hand corner.)

Groups tended to coordinate either on their home subreddits, specific place-based subreddits linked to on their home subreddits (what [[/r/parahumans]] did), discord channels, private messaging anyone who flipped your pixel when you tried to do something new (I did a /lot/ of this), or just basic pattern recognition (for example, the flags, the rainbow road, the green lattice, and most infamously, the all-consuming blue corner.)

If you look near the center of the map, above and to the right of the american flag and the rainbow, there's a squirtle holding the portuguese flag, and a kangaroo on a box. Between those two items is the "read parahumans" banner I wager most of the [[/r/rational]] people who frequented [[/r/place]] worked to create, expand, elaborate on, and defend.

The whole thing was a lot of fun, so it's a pity you missed it.
