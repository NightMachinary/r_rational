I think you're underestimating the pre-existing condition of people doing those things /on purpose/, purely for fun. What I saw was a bunch of people wanting to form factions as quickly as possible and start building storylines, especially those reenacting the button. There was a huge roleplay element to it in the "primative tribal" stages which shouldn't go unmentioned. The bigger argument is the meta-problem of rampant botting advertisements, IMHO.
