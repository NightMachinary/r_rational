I think you're overestimating how much of a limit exponential problems are here. Remember that people find out ways to use clever tricks to solve problems that ought to require far more computation at the cost of not being 100% certain they found the best possible solution.\\
It's of note that the travelling salesman problem has been solved for millions of cities within less than a percent of the optimal solution. The point is that the AI doesn't need to be perfect, that's why machine learning uses heuristics, once you only require solutions that are good enough many seemingly insurmountable problems become manageable.

Just because there may be problems that require exponential increases in intelligence doesn't mean they are the sort of thing that is going to significantly matter in the context of an AI foom.

As for just "throwing computational ability" at intelligence improvements, well nobody is seriously proposing that most performance breakthroughs are due to software improvements. Similarly the idea is that human level AI will make improvements by changing it's software which for something with an ability to hyperfocus on tasks indefinitely at vastly accelerated speeds compared to a human could occur quickly.
