Bostrom's /Superintelligence/ has a whole chapter on the balance between optimizing power and recalcitrance, and I think he lays out a strong argument that the difficulty curve really depends on the system in question. You can't simply say "intelligence is not linear" without knowing anything about the system implementing that intelligence, and we don't know enough about what artificial intelligence solutions will look like to say whether or not adding more intelligence is as simple as adding more processors.
