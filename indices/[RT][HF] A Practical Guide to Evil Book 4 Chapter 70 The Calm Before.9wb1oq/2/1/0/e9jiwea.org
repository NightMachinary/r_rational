So i'm willing to buy that if Cat fought at the level she did against Skein then she would have dealt with Urulan. What i dont buy is that the interpretation the text is selling to me is that it was clear she wasn't going all out and that Cat is mistakenly making false equivalences. Here is a quote from her fight with Urulan:

#+begin_quote
  I realized, dimly, that if this went through entirely I might actually die. I'd treated the Everdark like a training exercise, sometimes almost a game, but I'd been swimming in the shallows of this sea. There were monsters in the deeps that would make these look like imps. I close my eyes and let Winter loose. Frost formed all over my body, rapidly thickening and then shooting out. They had a globe of Night, I had a globe of ice. In a pissing contest of raw power, I'd bet on me every time. The Night ate into the ice but I kept pouring out Winter, its delighted laughter sounding softly in my ears. At first it devoured quicker than I made, but I dug in my heels and truly let loose. It became even, and I felt my blood turn cold as I dug even deeper.

By no means does that indicate that Cat is holding back (though i agree that information we know from the Skein fights may suggest so). After this fight against Urulan we have:

- Cat mentioning again how she almost died

- Akua talking to Cat about the fact she almost died and needs to use Winter more like a mage (not, 'fight like you did against Skein')

- Cat mentioning how she doesn't think she could take the high tier Mighty in (insert whatever name Drow city she was in)

- Cat mentioning again in this chapter how strong the Might are compared to herself and how she could beat them but would need to let Winter loose more

If interpretation A is that i am supposed to read this and go 'ah, Cat is making that same false equivalence and erroneous judgement again that she has five times in as many chapters' and interpretation B is 'inconsistent writing' then i'm sliding down Occam's razor and going with B.
