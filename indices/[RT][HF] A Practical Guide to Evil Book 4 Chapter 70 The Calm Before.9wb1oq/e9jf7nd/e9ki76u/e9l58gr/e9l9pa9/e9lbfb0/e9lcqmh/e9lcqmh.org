  She's talked multiple times about how Urulan nearly killed her.
#+end_quote

That doesn't mean that Cat wasn't fighting at a lower level than she should have been, or that she even went all out. She mentions that she nearly died because she didn't take him seriously, which implies that if she had taken him seriously from the start, she doesn't think it would have been as difficult. Furthermore, it still doesn't change that Cat never even had to use her biggest trump card, her domain.

#+begin_quote
  But her current power is enough to take on a Crusades worth of heroes head on. Hell, take out Pilgrim and Saint and she was winning.
#+end_quote

Cat's ability to defeat a half-assed band of low-tier heroes doesn't really have squat to do with how a Mighty and a fae noble would stack up against each other. What evidence we have says that Cat is really nothing special in terms of fae nobility right now, save for her powerful regenerative factor, and most nobles can still pull off a decent healing factor impression anyways. A full band of fae nobles would almost certainly be able to overpower pretty much any sort of Mighty.

#+begin_quote
  We know they gave up at different times, but we have very little information about what went down.

  f they split up, it wasn't something that was signalled beforehand.
#+end_quote

The text pretty clearly implies that they split up, with two just chilling in the decapitated tower and the others wandering off into the woods to find food. There's no real reason to assume they travelled in a group (actually, a big theme of this arc so far has been that the drow are really fucking themselves over by being consistently incapable of trusting one another long enough to fight off greater enemies), and the fact that Orelik was mentioned as disappearing without a trace pretty heavily implies that they were all flying solo.

#+begin_quote
  Every other character has had a much stronger grasp, to the point where you can easily say it's common knowledge.
#+end_quote

It's common knowledge /among Named,/ which, again, the drow just straight up don't have anymore. Any knowledge about manipulating narrative's has likely long since been split up, lost, or simply forgotten, because it is of no actual use to any of the Mighty in their native habitat.

#+begin_quote
  Besides, plenty of villains have stories about vengeance, and those don't end with them immediately giving up at the first obstacle.
#+end_quote

There's also a lot more stories about villains crushing their rivals mercilessly, and usually the survivors do give up quite easily in those. Clearly, the drow are the rivals in this scenario.

#+begin_quote
  If the story has arbitrarily decided that it's going to be a narrative that sets Cat up to win without her having done anything to deserve it, then I take issue with that.
#+end_quote

Except, Cat kinda does deserve it? She pulled off a genuinely clever trick that allowed her to bully her enemies into submission without needing to battle through them all individually, and she did it in a way that leans on her opponents natural weakness, that being their lack of unity in the face of a common threat. None of the drow had the will or the knowledge to kick themselves into another narrative, and so they lost.
