  I didnt say large and powerful either
#+end_quote

Right, well I assumed powerful, because we've been talking about what non-fae monsters could have been powerful enough to take on those seven Drow and break them down within a day. Yeah?

#+begin_quote
  , I just want it clear it is your assumptions we are discussing.
#+end_quote

Funny you should that, because I was responding directly to what you wrote:

#+begin_quote
  I do not find it tough to assume more exists in Winter than what she faced on her direct trip to the king in the center of his kingdom (i.e. the part of his realm most cleared of non-fae monsters).
#+end_quote

Ie about what big threats (or "large and powerful threats") exist in Arcadia that we are unaware of, specifically in the context of those seven Drow who signed themselves up for slavery.

#+begin_quote
  Ya, I am going to write off this conversation.
#+end_quote

Catch you later then, thanks for the talk.

(Not a huge fan of the snide "monologue" and "crusade" remarks though - the entire point of this thread is to discuss aPGtE and its latest chapter.)
