I am not a fan of people who put words in my mouth and then let me know why they disagree with their assumptions. As an example, dangerous could be an asphinx, a rot grub, a beholder, a mind worm. You decided to restrict yourself to only large creatures, which is an interesting bias in your thinking.

It isnt snide so much as you are clearly on a literal crusade to beat down all opposition to your point of view. Thats fine, I just do not feel like pretending you are being reasonable.
