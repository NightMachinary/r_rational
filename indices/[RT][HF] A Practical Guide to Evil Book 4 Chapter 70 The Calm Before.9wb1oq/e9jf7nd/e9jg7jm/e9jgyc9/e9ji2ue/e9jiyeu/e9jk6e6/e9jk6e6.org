  "Narrative time paradox"?
#+end_quote

In the sense that she would "have always had" the signet ring giving her a claim to the Duke's power, and the King's "promise" to empower her. It didn't actually give Catherine the title before she killed Auster, but it /did/ put her into situations where their powers could be matched (the duel without champions on the Duke's side vs. Urulan's rylleh blowing Cat up for half of the fight, the fae going into close quarters and allowing Cat to track him vs. the drow just spewing acid onto her general vicinity, generally gloating and temporizing vs. shutting down everything she was trying to set up). Duke of Violent Squalls had survived, if anything, more hits, but kept coming for the opponent fated to slay him, while Urulan made only one major mistake - approaching the "corpse" - but it killed it almost instantly.

If you want to see how fighting a fairy without a story actually looks like, go back to the Rider of the Host - who had been essentially wiping floor with Cat until she realized she has the narrative to turn the tables on him.

  Do you think all but ten or so Named would be weak enough that entering Arcadia would be so mentally scaring that they decide to sign away their free will in a day?
#+end_quote

No, because one of the core qualities to a Named is will, and that matters in Arcadia. Unlike those, the Mighty also have assets and followers left in Creation that matter almost as much as personal power (otherwise they would have been with the Longstride cabal) - assets they would lose even should they find a way out on their own.

  Like it or not, Cat's one of the bigger fish in Arcadia now, and Urulan, who was weak and alone when compared to these seven, was someone who could give her a run for his money.
#+end_quote

Cat also, you know, didn't fight him in Arcadia. The reason only the titled fae can cross into Creation on their own is that they lose much of their power in the process. Nor did Urulan fight alone: he lost almost as soon as he had noone to keep Cat away from him.

  And fae that are weaker than them would have (a) provided a meal that increased their power, and (b) offered a way out, assuming they could make gates.
#+end_quote

She dropped them in Winter. The Unseelie wouldn't have shown themselves without ensuring they had a drop on a lone Mighty. That said, I suspect you're right about Orelik being the grain of sand that will send the whole thing tumbling down.

#+begin_quote
  they really don't like cat's demands. And these demands are, I quote, "not their way".
#+end_quote

More their way than being harvested, I imagine. A cabal doesn't really work against the enemy who'll be gone with all of your posessions by the time you find and subdue a fae powerful enough to bring you back.

  "you will obey every one of my commands, follow all of my restrictive rules, or the magic I put in your brains will instantly kill you"

Not sure if the terms of command were extended past the time of war, actually:

  “It would make me warlord,” I said. “Until the war is over. An extraordinary measure for an extraordinary crisis.”
