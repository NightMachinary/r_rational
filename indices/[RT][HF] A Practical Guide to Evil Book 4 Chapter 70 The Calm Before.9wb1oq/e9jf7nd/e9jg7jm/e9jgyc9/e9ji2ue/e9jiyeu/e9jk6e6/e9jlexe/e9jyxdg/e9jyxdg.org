  According to Cat, it was a twist of the story that at most gave her a chance of winning
#+end_quote

Yeah, that was what I was saying. And, more importantly, Cat /knew/ she had a shot at victory, while the Duke only yelled in surprise when it turned out she can damage his armor.

  The Rider, however, did not land anything that would have been a death blow.
#+end_quote

But he was a non-titled knight that still made her armor a sieve, recognized how her powers work at a glance and didn't kill her only because he made an (otherwise correct) decision to exaust said powers. The fairies in this case also seemed to make a correct decision to not show up until they can isolate one of the intruders (though we don't actually know how that ended up, even if we know that drow don't have a good way to deal with glamour and flight).

  This is true, but being individually somewhat equivalent to the faerie queen who's one of the ten most dangerous people on Calernia is also important, in Arcadia and everywhere else.
#+end_quote

I wonder how accurate Cat's assessments actually are. Some of our low expectations of her come from her doing stuff like walking into a fight with an unknown opponent with only infinite regeneration to keep herself going, but then there's the fact that there seem to be either remote (horned lords, elves, giants, monsters in the Waning Woods and Brocelian forest, some god in Greywood that Akua couldn't manage to capture despite her entire dynasty living right next to it etc.) or subtle (the Wandering Bard, Grey Pilgrim, Tyrant of Helike) powerhouses spread all over the place. Catherine tends to take into account and prepare only for threats she saw deployed before. I fear this is going to end with an “and so Triumphant wept, for she ruled but a fraction of the world and knew it to be vast beyond her reckoning”.

  If your argument is that Urulan was actually unimpressive all along, then Cat disagreed with you in this very chapter.
#+end_quote

No, my argument is that martial power isn't some kind of absolute parameter independent of the circumstances, and that it can be made irrelevant with right preparations for specific circumstances.

#+begin_quote
  If keeping their possessions was the goal, signing themselves into slavery did not accomplish it.
#+end_quote

Again, is this actually slavery? Yes, the tightness of the bindings makes that uncomfortably close, but they kept their sigils and right of command over them. What Catherine dictates is the manner of military response - evacuation instead of harvest and (presumably) long and bloody guerilla warfare. She's not asking oaths from the drow she doesn't give weapons potentially dangerous to herself - which, while still a dick move, is understandable to sigil-holders in question, and preferrable to being harvested by the other ones stuck with them or being ruined by those who took the deal, respectively.
