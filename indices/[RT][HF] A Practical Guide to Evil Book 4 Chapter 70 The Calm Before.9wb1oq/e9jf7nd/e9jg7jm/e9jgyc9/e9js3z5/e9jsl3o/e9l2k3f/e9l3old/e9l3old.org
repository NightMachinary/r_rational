Where are you pulling these stories from?

Also worth noting, every time we've seen the Fae interact with Creation, it's involved the /Fae/ getting tangled up in their stories and losing because of it, and never the other way around. Stories represent a huge vulnerability to the Fae because, unlike everyone else, they are completely restricted by them.
