Wait, sorry, are you trying to suggest that nearly beating Cat isn't some accomplshemnt because there are about a dozen other Named stronger than her? A dozen (and that's being generous) across all the surface of Calernia?

Take a look at this segment again:

#+begin_quote
  I'd not forgotten my fight with Mighty Urulan, how what could only be considered a second-stringer by drow standards had batted me around and come close to killing me more than once. Me. I could, without too much arrogance, claim that among the Named of Calernia's surface I ranked in the ten most dangerous. If the likes of Urulan had been sent to rampage across Procer or Callow, it would have been bloody mayhem. If a cohort of Mighty that powerful had gone? Half the heroes on the continent would have needed to mobilize to end them, and there'd be casualties.

and then look at Akua and Cat's post Urulan conversation, and then look at the Urulan fight scene.

Do you really think we aren't supposed to be reading these Drow as some of the biggest and baddest threats we've ever meet in a Practical Guide to Evil?
