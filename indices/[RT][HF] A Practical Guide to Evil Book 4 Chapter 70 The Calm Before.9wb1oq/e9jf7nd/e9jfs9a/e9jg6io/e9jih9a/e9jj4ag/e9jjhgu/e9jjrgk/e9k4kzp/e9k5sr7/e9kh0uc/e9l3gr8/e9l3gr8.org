#+begin_quote
  Do they hate her though?
#+end_quote

They really do. Take a look:

From chapter 67:

#+begin_quote
  To obey your orders without fail? Madness. Arrogant madness
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  “Obedience is not our way,” Mighty Slaus said. “The terms must be changed.”
#+end_quote

with th reactio to being dropen in Arcadia being:

#+begin_quote
  Ambush,” Mighty Orelik said. “Your last mistake, human.”
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  You will not survive this,” Mighty Orelik screamed.
#+end_quote

So they really didn't consider Cat's demands of magically-enforced obedience to be "normal", and vowed to kill her for breaking the truce and dumping them in Arcadia. Yeah, they dont like her.

And that's enough, rally, but let's keep going just for fun.

In 68 Cat mentions how the Drow are only bound by oaths and fear, which certainly sounds like a recipe for hate to me.

#+begin_quote
  It was a confederation of tribes, if anything, bound to me by oaths and fear
#+end_quote

This is reinforced when in 70 Cat says:

#+begin_quote
  Sure, odds were good that every single member of my Peerage -- even Ivah -- would turn on me in a heartbeat if their oaths allowed for it
#+end_quote

Which really just reinforces that the Drow are not really huge fans of her. Particularly no those she forcible enslaved.
