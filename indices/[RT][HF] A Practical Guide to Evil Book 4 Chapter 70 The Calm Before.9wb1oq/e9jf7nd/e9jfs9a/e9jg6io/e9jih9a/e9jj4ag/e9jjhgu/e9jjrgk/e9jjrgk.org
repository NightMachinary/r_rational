  then it's likely that the Night urges the holders to remain in the Everdark

This is supported by absolutely nothing in the text.

  Which may be why defeating Sve Noc is required for Cat to actually get her army, and not just slaves who keep getting urges to go back into Everdark.
#+end_quote

Defeating Sve Noc is a requirement because of the Dwarves.

  Or perhaps they were concerned about what happens to their home when they weren't around? Who knows
#+end_quote

Yeah, not the vibes I got from them. Signing up into a life of slavery were they had approximately 0 autonomy wouldn't solve this problem anyway.

  but something about not being able to return to the Everdark had them throwing their pride away.
#+end_quote

Not just throwing their pride away, but deciding that their vow to kill cat for what she'd done, and their utter disdain for the idea of signing away their free will and living under the threat of death in a slave-army pointed at the heart of the Everdark, which will then be used to enforce the Liesse Accords in what's presumably a fight against anyone and everyone on the continent.

All this in under a day.

(Also, just for the record, if the Drow's goal was to get back to the Everdark and remain there, signing oaths that give up all of their free will and involve protecting Callow seems like a very inefficient way to go about it)
