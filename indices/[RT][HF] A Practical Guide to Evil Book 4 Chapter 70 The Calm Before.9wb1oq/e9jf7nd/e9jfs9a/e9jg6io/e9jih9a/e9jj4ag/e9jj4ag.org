  They need to eat bud. And they presumably were in the part of winter that bordered the new court, so the weather didn't really go well for the drow either.

Big assumption with nothing to back it.

Remember, the first time we met Drow was outside the Everdark, and they had no issue doing their Night tricks.

And then this chapter Cat is imaging what the Drow could do outside the Everdark, and she's very clearly imagining that they would have the power of the Night on their side. After months and months amonst the Drow, with Ivah to explain how Night works, you'd figure she would know.
