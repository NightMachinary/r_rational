  I think you might just be forgetting some of the more impressive feats we saw from the fae nobility in book 3.
#+end_quote

I appreciate you grabbing quotes, but these examples really don't hold up against the Mighty. Urulan alone and in two minutes pulled out a list of powers that went something like this:

Dissolving matter, shooting laser beams, preventing Cat's immortal construct body from healing, physically binding someone made of mist, shattering Winter-made ice with a gesture, transmuting mist into acid, flying, seeing through glamours, and causing matter to explode.

and fought a Faerie Queen to a standstill. Yeah, Cat's not at full Queenly strength, but she's a damn bit more impressive than those lesser nobles.

  Not to mention that fae travel in hunting parties of four or more, meaning that even if one of the Mighty might be a step or so above the average fae noble, he'd be facing down multiple peer-level opponents with abilities he's never seen before

Meanwhile the fae would be facing a group of seven being stronger than fae, who have abilities they've never sen before, and who grow stronger with every kill.

Limit the Drow to just stronger than the average Fae noble... and they still don' t have a huge reason to sell themsleves into slavery inside of 24 hours.

  especially since there's no indication that they have any idea how to manipulate the narrative in their favor, which is a pretty huge disadvantage against these opponents.

First off, I'm not sure why you're assuming that these Drow, who re full of Secrets, would be ignorant on the basic physics engine of the world. Stories are hardly obscure knowledge. Add to that that the drow actually know about the Fae and Arcadia, or the 'Splendid" and "the garden of the Splendid" as they call them.

Secondly, stories in Arcadia are the sort of thing you can fall into /accidentally/, and the Drow were given one hell of a set-up, after Cat went Classic Evil on them, with a monoluge about how inevitably they would become her minions, walking away from the trap she'd put them in, and them vowing that they would kill her for what they've done. Arcadia has to follow the script, and we've seen what follows when someone says "you'll never get away from this".
