  Cat fought the fae with stories,

Not very good one's though. Check out the impact of the story she used with the Duke of Violent Squalls:

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't handing me the victory in a handbasket -- the fake prophecy hadn't been well-crafted enough for that -- but I'd touched the story just enough I could twist it. That there was a /chance/ for me to win.

and compare it to what she said about Urulan and Will:

#+begin_quote
  Hells, unless the Lone Swordsman had a very good story at his back Urulan would have torn through the poor fucker in an hour's work and gone for a drink afterwards.

So Cat, back when she was still just the Squire with only two aspects to her name, beat a Winter Duke at the centre of his power using a shitty story. The Lone Swordsman, who was roughly comparable to Cat when she was this powerful, needed a very strong story to even stand a chance of winning against Urulan. It's pretty clear that Urulan is a more powerful figure than the Duke.

And the Duke was one of the biggest boys in town - a Duke is essentially the highest rank of nobility outside of royalty. This puts Urulan near the top of the Arcadia food-chain. There were seven Drow, all stronger than it. What was going to braek them in a day? Sure, the king/queen could have wiped the floor with it, assuming they were hanging out at the edge of winter and immediately jumped into a fight with them, but then the Mighty would have died, instead of signing themselves into slavery.

For added fun, Will survived running around Arcadia for six months while being hunted by the Wild Hunt. If we say that he was backed by a very good story (which makes sense, he had that pattern of three running in the background), that puts him as roughly comparable to Urulan (or, at least, at the point where Urulan doesn't "tear though him", but let's be generous), then any one of these Drow should by all rights have been fine. And there were seven of them. And they started accepting slavery in a day.
