what story does Urulan bring to the table against the Fae? Is it even possible for him to think story-wise, considering his life in a kill or be killed culture? Fae power is extremely high, but balanced by the fact that they have to conform to the story, no matter how much of a fickle connection it is. Would someone like Urulan even be capable of thinking from the perspective, considering how he got to where he is?

Also Will had a lot of support and had an external story running, which meant that the Wild Hunt had really no way of killing him there. It was functional immortality and he abused it to get some harsh training in.

Stories are very much a part of Fae balance, so what Cat is implying is that Urulan could have killed Will even with the powerful story backing him, because he's a mortal, and only confined to stories on a small to medium level. And so, a bunch of more powerful than average people are stuck in Arcadia with no food, harsh weather and Fae surrounding them. Fae that are definitely trivial for them to defeat *IF* they even have a sliver of story backing. Once again, consider whether the top dogs from a "kill or be killed" culture can /think/ in any terms other than martial might, and you will understand why they had to yield.
