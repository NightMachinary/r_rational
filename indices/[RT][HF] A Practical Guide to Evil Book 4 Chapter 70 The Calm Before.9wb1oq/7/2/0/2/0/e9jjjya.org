#+begin_quote
  what story does Urulan bring to the table against the Fae?
#+end_quote

Not Urulan - the seven drow who were locked in Arcadia.

How about the one where a villain monolouged at them about her nevitable victory, locked them in what was meant to be a death trap and walked away, told them how soon they would join her side, and then they viewed how they would kill her for this?

That's more of a hero's story? Doesn't really matter in Arcadia, Cat commented on that literally the first time she entered Arcadia.

  Is it even possible for him to think story-wise, considering his life in a kill or be killed culture?
#+end_quote

???

What does this have to do with stories?

#+begin_quote
  Fae power is extremely high
#+end_quote

Also on average it's way, waay below Cat, who is self-describedly one of the top ten most dangerous Named on the surface of calernia. And Urulan, who was a peer of these guys and explitly weaker than them, was able to give Cat a close fight.

#+begin_quote
  And so, a bunch of more powerful than average people
#+end_quote

Yeah. This is an understatement to the point where it's disingenuous. You just read the bit where Cat marvelled at the strength of Urulan, right?

#+begin_quote
  no food, harsh weather
#+end_quote

Not an issue: "Nodoi and Vasyl had held out for three and five days, respectively, finding no trouble living off the land" (Book 4, Chapter 69: Peerage)

#+begin_quote
  Fae that are definitely trivial for them to defeat IF they even have a sliver of story backing.
#+end_quote

Or without. Urulan's fight scene was more impressive than the Duke's by country mile, and Cat just got finished describing what a group of Urulan-equivalents would be capable of. Spoiler: It's more impressive than anything a fae who wasn't royalty did.

#+begin_quote
  Once again, consider whether the top dogs from a "kill or be killed" culture can think in any terms other than martial might, and you will understand why they had to yield.
#+end_quote

They weren't the top dogs. Not by a long shot. Cat in this chapter called one of their peers a "second-stringer by Drow standards". They ruled a city, but that city was a relative hole surrounded by much, much stronger Drow.
