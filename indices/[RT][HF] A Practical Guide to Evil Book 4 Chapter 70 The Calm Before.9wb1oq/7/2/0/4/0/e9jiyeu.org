  Cat also essentially had the King of Winter on her side (both by story and by intent), which gave her an opportunity to partially be empowered through a narrative time paradox.
#+end_quote

"Narrative time paradox"?

Anyway, we saw the sum total of the story manipulations - I quoted it up above.

#+begin_quote
  Also, keep in mind that the fae would have the number advantage and actual familiarity with their powers, both of which Cat lacks.
#+end_quote

I don't think saying that Cat is weaker than the fae really holds water, when even unfamiliar with her power she's happy to call herself one of the "ten most danerous Named on Calernia's surface". A point Cat herself raised when discussing how strong Urulan was, and how strong a group of Urulan's would be.

Do you think all but ten or so Named would be weak enough that entering Arcadia would be so mentally scaring that they decide to sign away their free will in a day?

Like it or not, Cat's one of the bigger fish in Arcadia now, and Urulan, who was weak and alone when compared to these seven, was someone who could give her a run for his money. There's not much that could have threatened him in Arcadia, let alone seven stronger versions of him. Let alone challenge seven stronger versions of him to the point where they decide to sign away their free will inside of a day.

And fae that are weaker than them would have (a) provided a meal that increased their power, and (b) offered a way out, assuming they could make gates.

  Top it off with stuff like drow's first instinct when in danger being to harvest each other

The chapter they got thrown into Arcadia was literally the same chapter we got introduced to cabals.

  Slaus risking most of all
#+end_quote

Do you remember what Slaus' last line was before being dropped in Arcadia? Because I do:

#+begin_quote
  “Obedience is not our way,” Mighty Slaus said. “The terms must be changed.”
#+end_quote

they really don't like cat's demands. And these demands are, I quote, "not their way".

#+begin_quote
  the terms of the victor (only somewhat more strict than usual)
#+end_quote

Umm... You realise that the terms are "you will obey every one of my commands, follow all of my restrictive rules, or the magic I put in your brains will instantly kill you", right?
