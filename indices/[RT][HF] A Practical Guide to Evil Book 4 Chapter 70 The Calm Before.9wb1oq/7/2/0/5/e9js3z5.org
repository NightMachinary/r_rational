Have you considered the story lost in Arcadia and eaten/enslaved vs lost in Arcadia and tricks thier way out? The drow's whole behavior set is high on arrogance and posturing, which is sorry fuel for getting smacked down. Cat's oaths are a milder version of small errors causing you to be enslaved for ages.
