Story explicitly only helps you so far, what with all the examples Black gave about Named overextending themselves and being shanked in the neck by a no-name(pun entirely intended) mortal. It makes you more lucky, slightly more powerful, slightly more durable, sure. Over long periods of time that luck can lead to pretty drastic benefits as it has more time to work. But it's a buff within your own power class, at most it can bring you slightly above your power class. It's not orders of magnitude buff. It isn't going to make a low-level nobody punch through a literal mountain, because that is just /too far/ outside that hypothetical Named powerlevel. Every example of story working within the book works like this.

What this all means is that if cat could fight that princess lady to that point then she was already close to her in power. Less "6y Goku before his first World Martial Arts Tournament vs SSB Vegeta" and more "Goku vs Vegeta in the DBZ fight".
