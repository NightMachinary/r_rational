  I didnt mention leviathan or leviathans.
#+end_quote

Read "leviathan" as "something that is extremely large and powerful". Which is the dictionary definition, actually. And you'd need something powerful to challenge those seven Drow, again:

#+begin_quote
  I'd not forgotten my fight with Mighty Urulan, how what could only be considered a second-stringer by drow standards had batted me around and come close to killing me more than once. Me. I could, without too much arrogance, claim that among the Named of Calernia's surface I ranked in the ten most dangerous. If the likes of Urulan had been sent to rampage across Procer or Callow, it would have been bloody mayhem. If a cohort of Mighty that powerful had gone? Half the heroes on the continent would have needed to mobilise to end them, and there'd be casualties.

  Neither it's wildlife, nor it's environment have been fully (or even partially) explored as the "book that was devoted to Arcadia" was focused on the fae, their works and their politics. Not the environment and it's flora/fauna.
#+end_quote

If you're going to talk about the environment and the flora/fauna then it's important to remember that we were explicitly told that the Drow had no problem living of the land. Add to that that it's never been a problem for anyone else in Arcdadia.

Also, the only clue we have as to what happened to the Drow is that it apparently involved the Fae. Again:

  Sooner or later, those treading the domain of the fae were found by them
#+end_quote

Which is weird, for reasons I've gone on about at some length now.
