I recall cat, upon meeting the king, realizing that he had led her to him with an intention of using her ability to break narratives.

Why does it seem far fetched for the king to have kept nastier parts of winter out of her way in order to see how she dealt with specifically fae threats? Now have the queen of winter, cat, feeling actively hostile towards the drow in her realm. I do not find it tough to assume more exists in Winter than what she faced on her direct trip to the king in the center of his kingdom (i.e. the part of his realm most cleared of non-fae monsters).
