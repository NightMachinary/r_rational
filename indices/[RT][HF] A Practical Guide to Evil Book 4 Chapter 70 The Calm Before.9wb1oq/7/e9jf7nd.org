I liked this chapter. Cat and Idrani sitting around, talking about the important issues, and advancing their character arcs. I'm a fan of this series mostly for the characters and the world building, and this was a good chapter for both. Acknowledging some of the inherent shittiness of what they're doing, talking about their place in the game of the Gods,speculating about Sve, discussing future plans (if somewhat opaquely) and of course their relationship. Good stuff.

There was also talk on what stories are in play, which I appreciate. I feel like too often the story, at least recently, is left as some vague, nebulous, and yet all-powerful force that you can't really guess at. If we don't know the shape of things in advance, then there are too many tropes and archetypes to really narrow down which ones are at play, and (at least for me) it can feel somewhat arbitrary when it's revealed in hindsight which ones were at play. So yeah, I enjoyed the story talk.

(Although I did find it kind of funny, how Cat apparently missed the narrative forming around them and then not even a minute later Archer talked about how strange it is that Cat pays so much attention to the story)

It did revisit the plot problems I had with the last chapter though - where the seven sigil-holders of Lotow completely gave up all of their resistance to being enslaved after a day (or up to a week, which is hardly any better). Again, Cat hyped up Urulan, comparing him both to her now (as one of the top ten most powerful beings on the continent), to Will (who Urulan would have put down without issue), and describing what sort of destruction he'd carve through the Procer/Callow. She even specifically said how a cohort of Drow that powerful would take half the heroes on the continent to put them down. But a cohort of Drow entered Arcadia and started rethinking selling themselves into slavery not even 24 hours later? This does not seem like the Arcadia we saw in Books 1 through 3. Whatever, I guess I'll write it up as first draft weirdness and try not to think about it too much.

But there was also (more) confirmation that Night can be harvested from those who do not already have Night, which I personally appreciated, as I've been arguing this point for something like a month now.
