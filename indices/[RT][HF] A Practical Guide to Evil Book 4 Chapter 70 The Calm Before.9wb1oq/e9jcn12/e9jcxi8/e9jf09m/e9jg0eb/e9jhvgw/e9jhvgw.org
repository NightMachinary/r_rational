It was made fairly clear in the fight against Urulan that Cat wasn't going full out. She hasn't used her domain nor did she link in with Akua to use greater workings. People (and Cat herself) use it to make a false equivalence between her power and what the drow can dish out, when in reality she did half of what we've seen her do against Skein, and even that would be sufficient is she fought smarter. She struggled because she was an overconfident idiot.
