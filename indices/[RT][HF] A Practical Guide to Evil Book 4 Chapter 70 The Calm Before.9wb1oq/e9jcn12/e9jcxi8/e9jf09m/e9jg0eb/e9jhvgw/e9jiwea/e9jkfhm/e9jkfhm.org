I think not using her domain is fairly indicative of holding back, or at least not going all out. We've seen her unleash it on all the significant opponents so far (Skein, Saint, etc.) and I would argue its use signifies the kid gloves are off. The fact she almost died is pointing to how overconfident and ineffective she was rather than making a statement on how powerful the drow are. That's how I interpret it anyway.

Don't get me wrong, I expect the drow in Holy Tvarigu to be more powerful than her. However, nothing I've seen from the sigil-holders in her cabal leads me to believe they could survive her domain or even match the level of destruction she's capable of.
