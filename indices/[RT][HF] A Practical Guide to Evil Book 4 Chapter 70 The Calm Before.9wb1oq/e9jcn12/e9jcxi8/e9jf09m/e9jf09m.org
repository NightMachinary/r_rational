Well that was a long time coming. Such a long time coming in fact that my prediction went full circle and i ended up thinking it never would.

This chapter gave a lot of much needed explanation for prior events and some even more needed sense of import and scale to this whole arc. It's starting to feel a bit more meaningful and less contrived now.

  It's wasn't impossible to throw around the kind of workings I'd seen fae royalty employ, it just wasn't possible without going fucking crazy.

Here's our explanations for both why a) Cat struggled against a lesser tier Mighty and b) why abandoning the Mighty in Arcadia was actually dangerous to them. An Insane Winter Cat could steamroll any Mighty and when the Mighty were left in Arcadia insane fae royalty were what they were exposed to.

My main question now, is..

  if I'd led the army I currently commanded against Diabolist at Second Liesse we would have ripped her to shreds. Hells, unless the Lone Swordsman had a very good story at his back Urulan would have torn through the poor fucker in an hour's work and gone for a drink afterwards.

..if this is true then why hasn't Cat gone back to Callow with her OP Drow army? Yes, she stands to gain more but she is also taking a gigantic risk by trying to topple Sve Noc. Her current army is a huge power boost and is, most importantly, far stronger than she would have hoped to find when she entered Drow territory in the first place. I mean she has 10+ Cat-equivalent-power Mighty alone and there is no way she was suspecting to gain that much when she arrived. The potential benefits from the dwarf deal surely aren't worth the risk.

Have i missed some prior reason given for why Cat isn't just cashing in her winnings and gating out? Has she constrained herself in some way with her Dwarf bargain or Drow oaths?
