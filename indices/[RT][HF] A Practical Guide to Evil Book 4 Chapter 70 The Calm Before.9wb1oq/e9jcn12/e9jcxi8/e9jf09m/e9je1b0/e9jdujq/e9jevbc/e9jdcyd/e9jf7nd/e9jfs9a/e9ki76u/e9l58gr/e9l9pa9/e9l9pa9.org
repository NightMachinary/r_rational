  and fought a Faerie Queen to a standstill. Yeah, Cat's not at full Queenly strength, but she's a damn bit more impressive than those lesser nobles.

Well, not really? In both cases- Urulan didn't fight Cat to a standstill, he lost without even driving Cat to use her domain, despite having multiple advantages (centuries of experience, time to observe her before battle, two powerful rylleh) and Cat fighting significantly under even her current potential.

And secondly, Cat hasn't really pulled out any feats that are more impressive than a middling-tier fae noble yet. In terms of raw power, by far her most impressive feat so far was picking up half a lake to throw at the crusaders, but that was only while Akua (who has significantly more skill with manipulating magic and a greater ability to control herself through the effects of principle alienation, effectively giving her access to more power) was in control, and even then that only makes her roughly the equal of a single fae Count.

Cat, despite her theoretical power ceiling being very high, doesn't actually have access to most of that power, and isn't terribly skilled at using the power she /does/ have. Things will change after she has access to a full court of nobles to shunt her principle alienation off to, but right now I wouldn't rank Cat as much more dangerous than a fae Count or Duke.

  Meanwhile the fae would be facing a group of seven being stronger than fae, who have abilities they've never sen before, and who grow stronger with every kill.

Except the chapter made it pretty clear that the drow /didn't/ stick together. The Mighty all split up into ones and twos and basically did their own thing- how could Mighty Orelik just disappear if he was literally standing alongside six other Mighty?

  First off, I'm not sure why you're assuming that these Drow, who re full of Secrets, would be ignorant on the basic physics engine of the world. Stories are hardly obscure knowledge.
#+end_quote

They actually kind of are. Cat had a pretty damn good education by the standards of most Calernians, and she had absolutely no idea that narrative force was an actual thing that Named had to deal with. Worse, the drow have been isolated for centuries in an environment were there are no Named. Any knowledge that remains after all this time will be broken up into pieces and mostly disregarded as useless even beyond that, because it actually /is/ useless to the drow.

  Secondly, stories in Arcadia are the sort of thing you can fall into accidentally, and the Drow were given one hell of a set-up, after Cat went Classic Evil on them, with a monoluge about how inevitably they would become her minions, walking away from the trap she'd put them in, and them vowing that they would kill her for what they've done. Arcadia has to follow the script, and we've seen what follows when someone says "you'll never get away from this".

Thing is, and I know I've already argued this with you, the Mighty are not heroes. The narrative doesn't automatically settle into one that's favorable to them because this is a villain versus villain fight, and you can be basically as nasty as you want in those. I'm pretty sure one of the recent chapters said almost literally that. In fact, it's more likely that the Mighty were /already/ in a narrative when they were dropped into Arcadia, that being 'arrogant nobles are humbled by a powerful outsider.' In which case, Arcadia would probably be just that much deadlier and more unpleasant for them, and the fae would be riding a strong narrative in any battles.
