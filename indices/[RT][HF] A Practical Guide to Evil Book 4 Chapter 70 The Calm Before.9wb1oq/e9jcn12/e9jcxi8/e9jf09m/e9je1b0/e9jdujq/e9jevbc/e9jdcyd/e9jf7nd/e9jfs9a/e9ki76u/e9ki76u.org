  But a cohort of Drow entered Arcadia and started rethinking selling themselves into slavery not even 24 hours later? This does not seem like the Arcadia we saw in Books 1 through 3.

I think you might just be forgetting some of the more impressive feats we saw from the fae nobility in book 3. Just off the top of my head, there was that one guy who lifted up most of a lake and turned it into levitating walls of water twenty feet high around the entirety of a port-

  There was a Count in there who had water sorcery, and the prick had been cautious enough so far we hadn't been able to reach him. When I'd gone to lead the charge he'd surrounded the entire port in a wall of water twenty feet high, and while I could have probably forced my way through that I was unwilling to exhaust myself on a second stringer.

  Hierophant's arms were held up and shaking as he dealt with what looked like a small lake of levitating water. That was a lot bigger than I'd thought it would be.

Or the Duchess of Restless Zephyr, who destroyed entire formations of soldiers and created localized earthquakes with a single blow, and had a cool desiccation power-

  I moved before the thought was finished, and that was the only reason I survived. The hem of my cloak was caught in the area where her power surged, and the cloth thinned and dried instantly. Considering the amount of water there was in my body, the thought of what would have happened to me if I hadn't moved was chilling.

  --------------

  I struck down with my sword and the ball of winds followed, smashing into her and detonating. Dry winds howled all around as the arm she brought up to shield herself was ground out of existence, her tall silhouette plummeting down like a gold of old had kicked her back down to Creation. My control over the winds was beginning to wane, and I hurriedly forced them down to follow the Duchess. She'd fallen in the back of the lines of golden fae, the ground heaving at the impact, and that was where the winds unleashed the fullness of their fury. Fae were scattered like insects, the hurricane my opponent had meant to destroy me with blooming life a flower in every direction.

Or the Lady of Cracking Ice, with literally the lowest rank of fae title, still being able to make a guy just shatter without any visible projectile or spell-

#+begin_quote
  “Who are you to-“ the soldier began, before a fracture line ran along the length of his body.

  His eyes widened, then he fell into a shower of shards.

  “I am bored with this interlude,” the Lady of Cracking Ice said. “Shall we proceed?”

Not to mention that fae travel in hunting parties of four or more, meaning that even if one of the Mighty might be a step or so above the average fae noble, he'd be facing down multiple peer-level opponents with abilities he's never seen before-

#+begin_quote
  About an hour in we ran into a hunting party. Not in the sense that they were hunting for us, but in the way that Callowan nobles hunted deer and rabbit. There were a dozen fae, all mounted on too-perfect white horses, but among those only four mattered. Two men and two women, colourfully dressed where the others were in drab blue-grey and armour. The nobles -- for I was relatively certain that was what they were -- immediately took the lead and diverted their party towards us.

Personally, I don't think it's at all ridiculous that the Mighty would have a hard time in Arcadia, especially since there's no indication that they have any idea how to manipulate the narrative in their favor, which is a pretty huge disadvantage against these opponents.
