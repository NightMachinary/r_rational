Arcadia is full of old monsters, and the reason Cat wasn't crushed by them last time is because she is uniquely suited for manipulating Arcadia's physics. Stories are the law, there, and Cat is constantly aware of the stories she's spinning. Coupled with her human Free Will (TM) and it's a wonder she had any difficulty at all.

Arcadia is the perfect place for Cat to conquer because the relative power differentials between her and her foes don't matter when she can make a story to beat them. Mighty of the Everdark don't have that advantage. The story foisted upon them was of the displaced generals, tricked into imprisonment on a faraway and hostile world and beset on all sides by incomprehensible fiends. It's no wonder they lost so fast, with a story like that, in a world where only stories matter.
