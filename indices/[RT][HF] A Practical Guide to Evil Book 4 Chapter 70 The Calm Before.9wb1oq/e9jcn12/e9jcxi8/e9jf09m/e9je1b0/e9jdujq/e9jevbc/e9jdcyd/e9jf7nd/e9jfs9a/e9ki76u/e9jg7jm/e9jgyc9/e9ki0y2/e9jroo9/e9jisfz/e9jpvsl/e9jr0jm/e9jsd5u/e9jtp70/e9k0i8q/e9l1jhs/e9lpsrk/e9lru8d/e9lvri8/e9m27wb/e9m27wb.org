  You decided to restrict yourself to only large creatures, which is an interesting bias in your thinking.

A /proverbial/ behemoth.

This is actually the way the word is more common used.(Eg a "grocery chain behemoth", which is the example pulled from the Cambridge Dictionary)

This is a lot of anger over a metaphor.

My apologies if I caused confusion.

  It isnt snide so much as you are clearly on a literal crusade to beat down all opposition to your point of view. Thats fine, I just do not feel like pretending you are being reasonable.

What part of this is a literal crusade?

For one, we're apparently not using metaphors and I'm not wearing my chain mail or shouting "Deus Vult" at the moment.

For another I'm not hunting down dissenting opinions. I said something. People made a response, I responded back. This is normally the way discussions go, no?
