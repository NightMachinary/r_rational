  She mentions that she nearly died because she didn't take him seriously, which implies that if she had taken him seriously from the start, she doesn't think it would have been as difficult.
#+end_quote

Did you miss the part his chapter where went on and on about how strong Urulan was? And how strong a group of Urulan's would be?

  Cat's ability to defeat a half-assed band of low-tier heroes
#+end_quote

It does when we know how that scales against Arcadia. Which is very well.

Yeah, those heroes, the Drow, and Cat herself would have issues if they had to fight the King/Queen, or go up against entire armies... but that's not what we're talking about?

None of these groups would within 24 hours face the kind of resistance that would lead to them immediately turning tail and running to sign up in a slave army to fight against even worse threats for the sake of someone they've vowed to kill. Which is exactly what happened.

#+begin_quote
  What evidence we have says that Cat is really nothing special in terms of fae nobility right now, save for her powerful regenerative factor, and most nobles can still pull off a decent healing factor impression anyways.
#+end_quote

Except for the bit where Cat tore through Fae nobles and beat Dukes and princesses, right? Way back when she was far weaker than she is now.

#+begin_quote
  The text pretty clearly implies that they split up, with two just chilling in the decapitated tower and the others wandering off into the woods to find food.
#+end_quote

Two of them decided immediately to enter slavery (because ????), the rest disagreed and then a few days later decided to join up.

Again, they were still together when the first of them decided that, actuay, giving up their free will is a great idea.

#+begin_quote
  actually, a big theme of this arc so far has been that the drow are really fucking themselves over by being consistently incapable of trusting one another long enough to fight off greater enemies
#+end_quote

True in the macro sense. But again, all seven of these guys were in the middle of hanging out under truce and discussing a team up right before they got thrown I Arcadia.

#+begin_quote
  It's common knowledge among Named, which, again, the drow just straight up don't have anymore. Any knowledge about manipulating narrative's has likely long since been split up, lost, or simply forgotten, because it is of no actual use to any of the Mighty in their native habitat.
#+end_quote

Yes, this is demonstrated when Ivah shows great confusion when Archer talks about the narrative, and how it has no familiarity with the Splendid. Oh wait

Also, it's common knowledge outside of the Named - there were laws created for the Legions of Terror telling them that they're not allowed to fight unwinnable battles. The main religious text of Calernia touches on Names and Roles. It's hardly some hidden knowledge.

And why would it matter if the knowledge was split up? These guys have an awful lot of Night.

#+begin_quote
  There's also a lot more stories about villains crushing their rivals mercilessly, and usually the survivors do give up quite easily in those. Clearly, the drow are the rivals in this scenario
#+end_quote

So there's stories which would benefit them, and stories which would hurt them. At this point the question of which story is in play is answered somewhat arbitrarily without more to go on. This is kind of my point.

#+begin_quote
  Except, Cat kinda does deserve it? She pulled off a genuinely clever trick that allowed her to bully her enemies into submission without needing to battle through them all individually, and she did it in a way that leans on her opponents natural weakness, that being their lack of unity in the face of a common threat. None of the drow had the will or the knowledge to kick themselves into another narrative, and so they lost.
#+end_quote

The cleverness of the trick is exactly what I'm disputing here.

If the trick only worked because the story willed it, and the story only willed it because it was a clever trick which work..... [ERROR].
