  Also on average it's way, waay below Cat, who is self-describedly one of the top ten most dangerous Named on the surface of calernia. And Urulan, who was a peer of these guys and explitly weaker than them, was able to give Cat a close fight.

Cat has the well of power but cannot use it like a top tier Fae would without going insane.

  ???

  What does this have to do with stories?

What story do they have that could possibly help them in fighting Fae? Cat had to actually cook one up to beat the Duke, and even in trying to get /into/ the heart of winter, she had to deceive the Fae and play on them being strictly tied to narrative, and often winning fights by forcing monologues while her backup arrived etc etc.

I'm asking whether anyone of the 7, considering the culture they grew up in, could have the mindset to actually do something like this?

  Or without. Urulan's fight scene was more impressive than the Duke's by country mile, and Cat just got finished describing what a group of Urulan-equivalents would be capable of. Spoiler: It's more impressive than anything a fae who wasn't royalty did.

The problem is, Cat can't really draw the full power of Winter without properly shunting it's influence on her mind. So it wasn't really as much Fae royal vs Mighty drow, than Fae royal able to use only a small amount of her power while underestimating her enemy.

"they'd only changed their minds after Mighty Orelik vanished without a trace. Sooner or later, those treading the domain of the fae were found by them"

It makes sense that the Fae are a whole new enemy for them, they haven't encountered their kind before, they don't know what Fae can do, they don't have their sigil with them, and they are in enemy territory without proper food shelter or backup, all of which were locked by Catherine. For a culture where survival and rising in power is prized above all, it would also be trivial to choose survival over the possibility of imminent death.
