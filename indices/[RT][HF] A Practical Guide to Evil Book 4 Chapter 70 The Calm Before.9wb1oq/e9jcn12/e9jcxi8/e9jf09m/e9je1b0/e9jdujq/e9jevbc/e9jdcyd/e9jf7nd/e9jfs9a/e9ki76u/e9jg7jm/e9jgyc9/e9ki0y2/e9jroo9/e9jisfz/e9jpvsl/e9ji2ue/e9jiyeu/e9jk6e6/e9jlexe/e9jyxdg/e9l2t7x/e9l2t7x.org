  Yeah, that was what I was saying. And, more importantly, Cat knew she had a shot at victory, while the Duke only yelled in surprise when it turned out she can damage his armor.
#+end_quote

At which point he proceeded to lose the fight, and the capabilities he showed in losing were far below what a single sigil-holder, who was weaker than the seven trapped, demonstrated in a minute or two.

  But he was a non-titled knight that still made her armor a sieve, recognized how her powers work at a glance and didn't kill her only because he made an (otherwise correct) decision to exaust said powers.
#+end_quote

And? You're pointing to that as an example of how fae should apparently auto-win against one of the strongest groups we've ever seen in this story, when the displayed capabilities were still leagues below what a single one of their lessors demonstrated.

  (though we don't actually know how that ended up, even if we know that drow don't have a good way to deal with glamour and flight).
#+end_quote

I'm going to disagree.. Urulan was momentarily inconvenienced by both of thse things, and then proceeded to continue kicking Cat's ass until he made one fatal mistake at the end.

It's also worth noting that the variety of powers Urulan alone showed off was far greater than just about any other character we've ever met. hell, in abot two minutes he pulled as many tricks or more than we've seen the fae collectivley use.

  I wonder how accurate Cat's assessments actually are. Some of our low expectations of her come from her doing stuff like walking into a fight with an unknown opponent with only infinite regeneration to keep herself going, but then there's the fact that there seem to be either remote (horned lords, elves, giants, monsters in the Waning Woods and Brocelian forest, some god in Greywood that Akua couldn't manage to capture despite her entire dynasty living right next to it etc.) or subtle (the Wandering Bard, Grey Pilgrim, Tyrant of Helike) powerhouses spread all over the place. Catherine tends to take into account and prepare only for threats she saw deployed before. I fear this is going to end with an “and so Triumphant wept, for she ruled but a fraction of the world and knew it to be vast beyond her reckoning”.
#+end_quote

I'm also worried about power creep.

But his doesn't really matter, because we're comparing groups of things that are known. We have the Mighty, the Fae, and whole lot of heroes and mortal armies to compare them both to.

And the underlying point is that the Mighty are certainly not so far below the fae that we shouldn't question why the Mighty sell themselves into slavery after 24 hours.

#+begin_quote
  No, my argument is that martial power isn't some kind of absolute parameter independent of the circumstances, and that it can be made irrelevant with right preparations for specific circumstances.
#+end_quote

If this happened, we didn't see it, and it was never mentioned.

#+begin_quote
  Again, is this actually slavery?
#+end_quote

That's a big yes. Hell, it's worse - I'd rather be a slave than be magically bound by 17 oaths which include, but are not limited to, terms like "do literally everything I say or instantly die".
