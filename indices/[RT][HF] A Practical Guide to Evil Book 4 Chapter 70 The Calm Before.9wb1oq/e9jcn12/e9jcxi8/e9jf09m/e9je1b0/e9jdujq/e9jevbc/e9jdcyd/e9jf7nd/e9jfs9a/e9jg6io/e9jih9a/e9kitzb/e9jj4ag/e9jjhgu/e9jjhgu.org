Hmm, in that case, then it's likely that the Night urges the holders to remain in the Everdark. Considering the Sve Noc didn't want/couldn't let any of her followers leave the Everdark, I assume that being in a different realm for them was stripping them of their purpose? Which may be why defeating Sve Noc is required for Cat to actually /get/ her army, and not just slaves who keep getting urges to go back into Everdark.

Or perhaps they were concerned about what happens to their home when they weren't around? Who knows. We don't have a POV from them, but something about not being able to return to the Everdark had them throwing their pride away. Combined with Cat's hypothesis that the bargain of duration is not a problem for the Drow, it builds a clearer picture, though still somewhat vague.
