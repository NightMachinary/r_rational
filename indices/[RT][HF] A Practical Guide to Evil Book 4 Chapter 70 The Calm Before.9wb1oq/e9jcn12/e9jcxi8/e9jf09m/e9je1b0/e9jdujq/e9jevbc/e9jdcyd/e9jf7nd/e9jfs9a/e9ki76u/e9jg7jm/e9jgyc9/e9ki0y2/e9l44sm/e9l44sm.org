This doesn't quite work when we're measuring the /results/ of the story tampering. If Will had had a boost that slight against Urulan, he would still have lost.

Also, even if we accept your argument as true it still puts each of the Migty at Duke level, which is about as close to the top of the food-chain as you can go. If they were seven of the meanest beings in Arcadia, what's making them tun tail and run into slavery within 24 hours?
