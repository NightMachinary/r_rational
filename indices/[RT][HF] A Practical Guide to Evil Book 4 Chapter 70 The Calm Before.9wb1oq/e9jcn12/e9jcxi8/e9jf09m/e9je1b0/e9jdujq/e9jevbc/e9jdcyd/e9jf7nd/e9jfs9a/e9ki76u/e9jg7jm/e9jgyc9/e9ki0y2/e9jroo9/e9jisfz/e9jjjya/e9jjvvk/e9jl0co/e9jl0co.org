Oh, I see you edited your post from paragraph to six after I responded.

  What story do they have that could possibly help them in fighting Fae? Cat had to actually cook one up to beat the Duke, and even in trying to get into the heart of winter, she had to deceive the Fae and play on them being strictly tied to narrative, and often winning fights by forcing monologues while her backup arrived etc etc.
#+end_quote

Cat was also orders of magnitude weaker than any one of these Drow individually.

And her narrative twisting against the Duke amounted to very little, not handing her victory but giving her a "chance" in a contest of skill and power, which she then won

  I'm asking whether anyone of the 7, considering the culture they grew up in, could have the mindset to actually do something like this?
#+end_quote

Why would their culture lock them out of creative thinking? If anything they'd be /more/ likely to prize thinking of creative ways to kill and gain the upper hand in fights.

#+begin_quote
  The problem is, Cat can't really draw the full power of Winter without properly shunting it's influence on her mind. So it wasn't really as much Fae royal vs Mighty drow, than Fae royal able to use only a small amount of her power while underestimating her enemy.

I said this in my first reply, but Cat with only a fraction of her power is still in the top ten Named on the surface of Calernia, able to take on a good half dozen heroes and win.

#+begin_quote
  It makes sense that the Fae are a whole new enemy for them, they haven't encountered their kind before, they don't know what Fae can do,
#+end_quote

Couple of things here.

1 - the Far also have no clue about the Drow or the Night, as far as we are aware.

2 - the Drow /do/ know about the Far and Arcadia. They call them the "Splendid" and "the Garden of the Splendid" respectively.

  enemy territory without proper food shelter
#+end_quote

This is the third time you've brought this up, and now the third time I've told you that food and shelter explicitly and implicitly were not an issue.

Do you want me to put the quotes up again?

#+begin_quote
  trivial to choose survival over the possibility of imminent death.
#+end_quote

Ah, yes. Escape from certain death.... By signing yourself into a slave army pointed at beings far, far stronger than you are, with a proverbial gun to your head at all times. Makes perfect sense.
