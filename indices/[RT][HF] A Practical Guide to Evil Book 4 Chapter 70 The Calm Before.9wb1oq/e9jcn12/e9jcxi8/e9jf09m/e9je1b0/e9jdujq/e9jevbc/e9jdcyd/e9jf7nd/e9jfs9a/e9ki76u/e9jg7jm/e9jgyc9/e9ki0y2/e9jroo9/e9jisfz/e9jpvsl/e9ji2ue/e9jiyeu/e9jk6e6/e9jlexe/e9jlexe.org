According to Cat, it was a twist of the story that at most gave her a chance of winning

#+begin_quote
  go back to the Rider of the Host - who had been essentially wiping floor with Cat until she realized she has the narrative to turn the tables on him
#+end_quote

This fight is still less impressive than Urulan's. If Cat had been literally anyone else, she would have been dead after the first exchange. And then dead several times more before the fight was over. The Rider, however, did not land anything that would have been a death blow.

  No, because one of the core qualities to a Named is will and that matters in Arcadia
#+end_quote

This is true, but being individually somewhat equivalent to the faerie queen who's one of the ten most dangerous people on Calernia is /also/ important, in Arcadia and everywhere else.

Especially when you can eat Fae you kill to gain even more power and knowledge.

#+begin_quote
  Nor did Urulan fight alone: he lost almost as soon as he had noone to keep Cat away from him.
#+end_quote

If your argument is that Urulan was actually unimpressive all along, then Cat disagreed with you in this very chapter.

  More their way than being harvested, I imagine. A cabal doesn't really work against the enemy who'll be gone with all of your posessions by the time you find and subdue a fae powerful enough to bring you back.
#+end_quote

If keeping their possessions was the goal, signing themselves into slavery did not accomplish it.

#+begin_quote
  Not sure if the terms of command were extended past the time of war, actually:

Thanks for pointing me towards this quote.

This was one of the problems I had with skipping past everything to do with Lotow, actually: there are important details we can only guess at.

But if this is a temporary thing, it certainly makes it more palatable.

Although it still involves the Drow deciding to head back to the Everdark, for reasons, to fight in a slave army heading towards Sve Noc, who's perhaps worse than the Faerie monarchs and certainly a bigger fixture in their minds.

EDIT: Actually, wait, the oaths involve (amongst other things) a term that says:

#+begin_quote
  you will follow the orders of the Sovereign of Moonless Nights without intent to subvert or pervert the spirit in which they were given,‚Äù
#+end_quote

which says to me that the oaths can be used to further force more oaths (or other bindings) with the simple task of ordering them to do it. So a short time frame (assuming that they got a small time frame which we don't really know) still sucks to about the same extent.
