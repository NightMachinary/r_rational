Maybe there are levitathans out there in the depths of Arcadia. But if so, they are levitathans that have never appeared on-screen, even in the book devoted to Arcadia, never been mentioned, and never been hinted at. Cat has never thought about them, nor has anyone else.

It'd be supremely weird if something like that showed up off-screen to solve a fairly major problem that had been built up for 15 chapters (Soon was first mentioned in chapter 53), but then was never actually mentioned. Wouldn't it?
