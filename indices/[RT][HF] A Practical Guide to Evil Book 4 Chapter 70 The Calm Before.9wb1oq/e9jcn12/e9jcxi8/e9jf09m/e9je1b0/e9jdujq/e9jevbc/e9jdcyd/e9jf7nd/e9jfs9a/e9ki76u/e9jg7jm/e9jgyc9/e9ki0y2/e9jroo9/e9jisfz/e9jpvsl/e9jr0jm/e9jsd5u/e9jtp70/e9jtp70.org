I didnt mention leviathan or leviathans.

I am pointing out she had a considerably easier time getting there and moving around than you or I would have. Further that we did NOT see all of the Winter side of Arcadia. Neither it's wildlife, nor it's environment have been fully (or even partially) explored as the "book that was devoted to arcadia" was focused on the fae, their works and their politics. Not the environment and it's flora/fauna.

I too would have enjoyed seeing more of the battle for that last drow city, as well as what exactly happened to convince such powerful immortal monsters to swear fealty so quickly. I just don't feel it is impossible for it to have happened. I agree that we seem to have skipped past some exciting and important events for reasons unknown.
