It gets you everything in Arcadia. In her first fight with a Fae in Arcadia she literally just asked the Winter Rider his evil plan and he was forced to answer.

She also did a heroic proclamation and it freaked out the Fae because he knew he was about to die after that. He ran away and he still got killed even though Cat had been fighting him pretty close.
