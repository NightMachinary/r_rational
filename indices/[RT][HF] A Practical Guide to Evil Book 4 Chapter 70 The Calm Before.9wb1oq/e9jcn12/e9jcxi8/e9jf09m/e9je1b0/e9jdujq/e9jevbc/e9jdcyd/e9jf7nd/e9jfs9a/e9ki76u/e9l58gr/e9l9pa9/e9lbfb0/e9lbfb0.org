  Well, not really? In both cases- Urulan didn't fight Cat to a standstill, he lost without even driving Cat to use her domain, despite having multiple advantages (centuries of experience, time to observe her before battle, two powerful rylleh) and Cat fighting significantly under even her current potential
#+end_quote

This is not how Cat looks at the fight. She's talked multiple times about how Urulan nearly killed her. The danger posed by him, and hence by the seven other sigil-holders of Lotow, is want prompted this whole plan to begin with.

  And secondly, Cat hasn't really pulled out any feats that are more impressive than a middling-tier fae noble yet. In terms of raw power, by far her most impressive feat so far was picking up half a lake to throw at the crusaders, but that was only while Akua (who has significantly more skill with manipulating magic and a greater ability to control herself through the effects of principle alienation, effectively giving her access to more power) was in control, and even then that only makes her roughly the equal of a single fae Count.

This is kind of meaningless, because Cat doesn't approach chat by pulling out magical moves.

But her current power is enough to take on a Crusades worth of heroes head on. Hell, take out Pilgrim and Saint and she was /winning/.

  Except the chapter made it pretty clear that the drow didn't stick together. The Mighty all split up into ones and twos and basically did their own thing- how could Mighty Orelik just disappear if he was literally standing alongside six other Mighty?
#+end_quote

We know they gave up at different times, but we have very little information about what went down.

f they split up, it wasn't something that was signalled beforehand. Notably, the seven of them were chilling in a room together under truce beforehand, talking about how they should maybe form a cabal, and tossed into another dimension by a common enemy.

  They actually kind of are. Cat had a pretty damn good education by the standards of most Calernians, and she had absolutely no idea that narrative force was an actual thing that Named had to deal with. Worse, the drow have been isolated for centuries in an environment were there are no Named. Any knowledge that remains after all this time will be broken up into pieces and mostly disregarded as useless even beyond that, because it actually is useless to the drow.
#+end_quote

It's worth noting that there are literal laws and sayings based on the narrative.

Cat didn't know about stories, sure, but her education syllabus was also written by Black to prevent heroes forming.

Every other character has had a much stronger grasp, to the point where you can easily say it's common knowledge.

  Thing is, and I know I've already argued this with you, the Mighty are not heroes. The narrative doesn't automatically settle into one that's favorable to them because this is a villain versus villain fight, and you can be basically as nasty as you want in those. I'm pretty sure one of the recent chapters said almost literally that. In fact, it's more likely that the Mighty were already in a narrative when they were dropped into Arcadia, that being 'arrogant nobles are humbled by a powerful outsider.' In which case, Arcadia would probably be just that much deadlier and more unpleasant for them, and the fae would be riding a strong narrative in any battles.

Half the point of Arcadia is that it doesn't matter if you're Named or not. Everything /else/ still has to follow the script. This is without mentioning how Cat swept them up in her story.

And they're not heroes, sure, but this also doesn't matter? This was one of the first things we saw when entering Arcadia. Besides, plenty of villains have stories about vengeance, and those don't end with them immediately giving up at the first obstacle.

If the story has arbitrarily decided that it's going to be a narrative that sets Cat up to win without her having done anything to deserve it, then I take issue with that. Especially as this wouldn't have bee something built beforehand, but instead something happening behind the scenes without build up or warning to solve a major problem off-screen.
