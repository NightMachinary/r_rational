  and compare it to what she said about Urulan and Will

That's because Will would have to fight Urulan in Creation, where the story can be undermined by the earthly practicalities (like the acid dissolving him faster than he can Rise). Cat also essentially had the King of Winter on her side (both by story and by intent), which gave her an opportunity to partially be empowered through a narrative time paradox.

Also, keep in mind that the fae would have the number advantage and actual familiarity with their powers, both of which Cat lacks. Top it off with stuff like drow's first instinct when in danger being to harvest each other, Slaus risking most of all and the pressure of having been separated from their sigils, and the terms of the victor (only somewhat more strict than usual) start looking reasonable for them.
