I can definitely see a Light-Night interaction happening. Hell, from a Watsonian perspective it's probably needed just to keep narrative tension and stop Cat from steamrolling the continent. (Assuming some pesky Hero doesn't develop an aspect that lets them 'Free' the Drow from their oaths or some such).

But I'm not sure the heroic story impacts Cat's analysis. I think we can count on Cat "I'm always thinking about the story and it weirds out my friends" Foundling to have thought about the story implications. Hell, she explicitly factored the story into her Urulan vs Lone Swordsman calculations.

I also don't think that any of this hugely impacts on my broader point in that paragraph, which is that it's weird that seven Drow (who Cat thinks could tear threw the continent and destroy one of the more effective heroes we've seen without effort) would spend an afternoon in Arcadia and then decide that they should sign up for that slavery thing. Arcadia doesn't have Heavenly Light. Maybe there was an interaction with whatever Summer is now? Although that's a bit of a stretch, as they were dropped on the edge of Winter.
