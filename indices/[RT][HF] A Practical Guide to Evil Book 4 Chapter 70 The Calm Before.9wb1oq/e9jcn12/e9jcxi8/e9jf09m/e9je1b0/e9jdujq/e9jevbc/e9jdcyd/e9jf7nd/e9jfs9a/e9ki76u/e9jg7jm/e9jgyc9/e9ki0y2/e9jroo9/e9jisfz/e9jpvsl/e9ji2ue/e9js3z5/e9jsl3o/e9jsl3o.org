  Have you considered the story lost in Arcadia and eaten/enslaved vs lost in Arcadia and tricks thier way out?
#+end_quote

Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean here.

You think the Drow's story was either them getting lost/eaten, or them tricking their way out?

  The drow's whole behavior set is high on arrogance and posturing, which is sorry fuel for getting smacked down.
#+end_quote

The Drow's behaviour set we've seen involved them smacking /other/ people around.

The whole reason Cat needed an alternate plan to deal with Lotow was because of how good the Drow were at killing.

  Cat's oaths are a milder version of small errors causing you to be enslaved for ages
#+end_quote

Again, this isn't quite parsing for me. Milder version of what?

But calling them mild doesn't seem very true. There are 19 oaths which are pretty all encompassing and ultimately boil down to "obey everything Cat says or instantantly die". What part of that is mild?
