Hmm I took the phrase "Just for tonight" they mentioned at the end as a death flag because if Archer dies in the battle, they'll technically only be sleeping with each other for that specific night and never again.

I also interpreted the sex scene as part of a trope in stories where protagonist & love interest beds each other the night before and on the next day the love interest gets unsuspectedly murdered, which becomes a pivot for the protagonist. Considering that they've mentioned this is a Below-backed story, this could potentially be a pivot point for Below to empower Cat.
