Wasn't there an interlude where a similar thing happened between Ranger and Black early on in their careers? So I think Archer is safe, especially if this was all planned by her, which it might be. I can easily see her doing this to tune Cat up for the coming fight and maybe lay the groundwork for Cat to get a sudden level up during the fight when Archer is in danger/injured.
