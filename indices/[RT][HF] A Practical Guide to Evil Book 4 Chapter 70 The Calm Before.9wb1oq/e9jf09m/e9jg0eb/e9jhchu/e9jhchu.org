Re-reading the Dwarven negotiations it appears you're correct (though the specifics are a little vague, frustratingly). I don't agree at all that the power gain is worth the risk considering that without protagonist armour Cat is 50/50 /at best/ up against Sve Noc, though ultimately it's irrelevant because she has made oath.
