Oh, this makes sense.

The dungeon master wanted the harem plot open as a possibility ("a key for seven locks"). Or at least, taunt Joon by danging it in front of him, but in a way that the DM knew he wouldn't actually enjoy.

So it designed Amaryllis to be attracted to women and to Joon, with conditions making it such that her sexuality would be initially awakened/unlocked by Joon.

  No, you're not,” I said. “Just ... asexual?”

  “Mostly,” said Amaryllis. She frowned at me. “Did you know before I did?”

  “After our long talk in the bottle, it seemed like one of the two likely options,” I said with a shrug. “The other being that you were lesbian.” I hadn't wanted to pry or make assumptions, but I'd really been hoping that her revulsion towards sex with me wasn't just because it was me.

  Amaryllis gave a nonchalant shrug. “A bit.”

and then

  “I've convinced myself that I probably like kissing,” said Amaryllis. “In my fantasy, that's as far as it goes, just the sensation of your hands on my body, and your lips on mine, as we share this bond together, temporarily forgetting that there are any barriers to separate us.” She frowned. “And sex, I imagined that you would be slow and patient, gentle and yielding, and somehow you would awaken something in me, and I would be fixed.”

  “That's not how it works,” I said. “That's ... a male fantasy.”

  “But it might be true for me, if I was meant for you,” said Amaryllis.

I bet if we dig it turns out Fenn is bisexual and attracted to Amaryllis too (and Grak is hermaphroditic anyway). In the alternate timeline Fenn's jealousy would either sublimate into attraction or dissolve if she realized sharing wasn't inherently bad. Amaryllis, for her part, has shown few signs of jealousy and is already well accustomed to the notion of political marriages not being sexually exclusive. The locus is less clear but clearly it /could've/ been a harem / polyamorous network with Joon somewhat at the center. But Joon's actions didn't go with that plot-line, so it never came to be.

Seen in that light, Amaryllis's self modification might almost be seen as a sort of reclaiming of agency from the dungeon master who shaped her for such a specific purpose. (Much as we, in real life, might modify ourselves away from the purposes which evolution shaped us towards, but with each modification we risk potentially losing purposes that were important to /us/ as well)
