Solution: temporarily revert personality once per X days?

I mean, the ability to change who you are sounds horrible but I think a large part of the distaste comes from permanency. Taking a pill that makes you feel really good for a few hours probably sounds great. Taking a pill with long-term side-effects immediately sounds bad, and even if the permanent effect is emotionally positive, pretty sure it's still not good (I wouldn't want to feel infinite bliss indefinitely, I mean, I would, but... you know). Plus, value drift, gradual changes in personality may accumulate. Each small change you make may seem reasonable, but the endpoint may differ enough from who you were at the beginning that you may regret who you became. This makes the whole thing way too Evil. So, commit to revert all changes once per X days, giving your old self the ability to judge your current personality. Then it's more like taking Ritalin, horrible but goes away and YOU decide that yes you still want the next pill.

So to summarize, since value drift is obviously bad for trivial reasons and may have led to the Second Empire, I expect the characters to at least worry about it (/cough/ /cthulhuraejepsen/ /cough/).

Great chapter. Write quality is much more important than word count (for me).
