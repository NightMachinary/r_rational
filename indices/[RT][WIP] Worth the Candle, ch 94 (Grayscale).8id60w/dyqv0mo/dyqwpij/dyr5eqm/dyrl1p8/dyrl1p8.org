I think that even though some adverse conditions do come with incidental benefits, it doesn't justify the detriments themselves. I usually try to reframe the question, so I'll do it for your case, even though we already agree on the conclusion: If you were given the choice to live without attention and focusing problems, and never develop the coping mechanisms that are more generally useful, or you could spend a decade of your life with limited ability to pay attention for any length of time, and gain the previously mentioned benefits, which would you choose?
