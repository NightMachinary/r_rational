  I think you make a good point about emotional maturity. If you can immediately remove or move past every negative feeling, won't that impact your emotional maturity?

I think this ties in quite well with the discussion about pharmaceuticals in this chapter. I remember when I was diagnosed with ADHD and first got on medication for it; my symptoms were never super detrimental to my life, but once they were addressed directly it was like moving out of a foggy mental haze I never knew existed... because that's all there had ever been. And even as that happened, it felt like I was "cheating" in a way, because I had spent years drilling myself into habits to deal with my inherent lack of focus and runaway thoughts. And then with a pill it was like "Oh. That was WAY too easy." I was torn between wondering how much smoother my life could have been if I had been medicated during my school days, and wondering if I would have been less developed as a person if I hadn't had to put in that extra effort.

For the record, I'm firmly on the side of "hells yes, medicate people who need it." I like who I am today, but I bet I would have liked who I was if medicated years earlier just as much.
