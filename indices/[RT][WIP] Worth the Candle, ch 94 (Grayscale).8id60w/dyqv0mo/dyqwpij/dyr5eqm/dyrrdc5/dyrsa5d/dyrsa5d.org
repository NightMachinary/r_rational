Yeah, see, that's a lot of the sentiment I hear from people opposed to using medicine to treat mental health. That mental conditions are only moral failings, signs of weakness, a scheme concocted by Big Pharma, etc. Oddly, none of them are doctors.

I liken it more to getting glasses. To someone with perfect vision, glasses would make things blurry, or not provide much benefit at all. But you wouldn't claim that imperfect vision exists, right?

That's the same way things changed when I got on medication. Yes, I got by by putting in a ton of extra effort when I was younger... just like how I got by by sitting in the front row of my classes every year until I was taken to an optometrist at 14 and given my first set of glasses. The feeling of amazement when I realized that most people can see individual leaves on a tree and not just a green blur was almost the exact same I felt when I realized most people don't constantly need to struggle to keep their thoughts in line and on topic.
