I mean... Every person reacts differently to meds. For me, getting on them was like clearing static from an AM radio (and somehow NOT finding kooky talking head politic drivel)! For a friend of mine it let him focus and calm down... But brought extreme self-loathing, questioning if he was really "him" while medicated. Lasted until he got a new doctor and a more mellow prescription.

Best I can offer is: everyone is different. If you visit a doctor and you end up feeling worse? Go for another opinion. Me, medication helps like the difference between night and day. But it's not a a panacea, so don't kick yourself if you need something different.

I never saw meds as a miracle cure, but as another, potentially potent, way to help ourselves. Hope that helps :-)
