His stated reasons make sense. Controlling blood outside his body is a normal skill for blood mages, so it makes sense for him to learn it when he has limited options for learning new skills in the room. It's shown on screen so that it doesn't come from nowhere when he uses the ability later.

Although it does also make sense for him to prepare for the loss of Anyblade. If they get to choose which entads to loose with Zona having some influence on which, Anyblade offers Zona an ability that she wants, and isn't so useful for the group that they should force the issue. Losing Sable, the teleportation key, or the backpack would be devastating, but Anyblade is merely very useful. It isn't hugely better than whatever ordinary blade it mimics. It's simply very versatile and stealthy. Joon wouldn't be hugely hampered in a fight if he had to use a normal sword, and if he can use his blood as a weapon he's only barely affected.

I do wonder if they'll be able to give Zona the entads that they got from Larkspur, the ones they can't use. That would be convenient.
