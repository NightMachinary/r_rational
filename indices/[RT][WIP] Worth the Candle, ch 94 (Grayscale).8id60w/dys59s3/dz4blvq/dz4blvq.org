Probably, but they have a lot more entads than we know. There was an odd scythe from the first haul that they could never identify, there is all the equipment that Mary's cousin had when they killed him that isn't invested in them, thus unuseable. Some of the equipment used by team Blackheart sounded like entads, and is (by current party level standards) easily aquired.

House agreed to take personal attachment into account, and the effect does not need to be strong in the entad for her to exploit it in the way she wants. The party could be better off here than we are expecting.
