I feel like Joon made a weaker-than-possible version of his argument at the end.

To me, the problem with what Amaryllis is doing, is that a kind self-reflects and builds new parts of itself out of existing parts. Most minds (other than, perhaps, people with psychoses) are /coherent/: a subset of the mind could be used to re-derive the rest of the mind. Lose your memories? Re-derive from your goal function + knowledge of physics (i.e. “guess what happened.”) Lose your goal function? Re-derive it by constraint-satisfying against your memories.

And, lose /part/ of your goal function? Re-derive your instrumental goals from your terminal goals, or vice-versa.

That's the reason the attraction preference keeps coming back: it's /coherent/ to the rest of Amaryllis's preferences for it to be there. Even removing the preference itself, all the surrounding preferences inevitably lead to its existence. To truly remove it permanently, you'd need to change a much larger part of Mary's mind than just that one node. You might need to change the whole thing, even. Otherwise, it would just come back.

(As it happens, this is also why Grak was under Fallatehr‘s geas, even without appearing to be: the direct preference node for wanting to help Fallatehr wasn't there, but everything /around/ it essentially implied that preference without it being reified anywhere. That was why it took Joon so much effort to set things right: Grak truly /had/ been made into an almost entirely different person, and Joon probably /did/ need to re-derive his preferences from his memories or somesuch, since he didn't have the handy backup power he got soon after.)
