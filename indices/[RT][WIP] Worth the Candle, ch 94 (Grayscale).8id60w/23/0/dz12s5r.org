  (As it happens, this is also why Grak was under Fallatehrâ€˜s geas, even without appearing to be: the direct preference node for wanting to help Fallatehr wasn't there, but everything around it essentially implied that preference without it being reified anywhere. That was why it took Joon so much effort to set things right: Grak truly had been made into an almost entirely different person, and Joon probably did need to re-derive his preferences from his memories or somesuch, since he didn't have the handy backup power he got soon after.)

Nope; Grak's mind-control was temporary. The reason Joon couldn't detect it or easily revert it was that they weren't soul-bonded yet.
