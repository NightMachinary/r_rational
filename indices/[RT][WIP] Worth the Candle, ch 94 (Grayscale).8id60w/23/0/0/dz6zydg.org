Ah, sorry, I was forgetting the situation in that chapter---replace "Grak" with "Amaryllis" in the above and it'll make sense. She was the one who was altered in a subtle way that Joon didn't cotton onto until too late. (Thus the comment in this chapter about Joon's deep knowledge of her soul having been unavoidable.)
