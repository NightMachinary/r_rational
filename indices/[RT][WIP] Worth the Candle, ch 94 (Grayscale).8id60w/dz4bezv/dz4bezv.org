So I get that Fenn is leary of soul magic because of how that went, but with soul magic she could easily step to the top of the party power-wise.

It's been demonstrated that Elf bones carry luck, that Half-elves also have magical Luck, that a bone mage can sap from their own bones, and that a soul mage can repair that use.

Fenn could be pulling luck out on command when ever she had need of it. Has Joon not tried to convince her of this? Or at least offered reparative soul magic if she were to resort to it?
