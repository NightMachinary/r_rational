I feel as if this chapter touches on one of the deeper issues with transhumanism.

With the power and willingness to self-modify, there's the need to accept that some changes will result in a death of self. The same death that everyone undergoes as they grow up. You as an adult aren't the same person as you from childhood. Self-modification like Amaryllis can do just speeds up the change of identity we go throughout life plus some possible unnatural alterations to her personality.

I'm in favor of using the ability to control one's feelings towards another person, because it allows the ability to be more logical and rational when dealing with others rather than being ruled by petty and ugly emotions. However, I worry that it would prevent emotional maturity that can only come from struggling with and overcoming the darker emotions. I'm not even sure that my thoughts here are even valid, rather than just pseudo-philosophy with minimal basis in reality.

This chapter feels as if its hinting towards the dark side of transhumanism. With the possibility of being more than human, there is the possibility of being /inhuman/.

TLDR - I'm undecided on whether Amaryllis should have self-modified her feelings or not. One side says it's better than ugly relationship drama and the other side says self-modification can easily lead to unintentional value drift and inhuman behavior patterns.
