  Tautologically though, a smarter and/or more emotionally mature version of oneself will make better decisions.

While this is true, you still need to make a first step that improves the self. How do you know you don't make a mistake with the first change? The fear is that after making a change, I have inadvertently replaced a personality flaw with an even worse one. One realistic example is replacing laziness with increased drive to complete goals. But instead of becoming a less lazy person, I have become someone who never compromises on changing my mind once it's set, I always have to complete my goals and hang the consequences!
