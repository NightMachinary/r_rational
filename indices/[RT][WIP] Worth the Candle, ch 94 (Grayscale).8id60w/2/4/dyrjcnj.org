I'm thinking that Amaryllis should decrease the feelings, but not entirely. Low enough to not be (too) distraction (so maybe a bit), but high enough that they can be dealt with to gain emotional maturity.

The problem is that the only true, permanent change that happens is the natural way, and that self-modification is more like a crutch in this scenario. Amaryllis acts as if it's a mood drug, but the point of the drugs is that we don't have a better method of permanently solving the problem. Even if the Essentialism work was permanent, it probably wouldn't solve the problem completed, Amaryllis would still be forget to change some small detail, or do it incorrectly.

Maybe that's why the soul drifts back, because there are other factors that don't get changed that make the system inconsistent, so it drifts back to a consistent state.
