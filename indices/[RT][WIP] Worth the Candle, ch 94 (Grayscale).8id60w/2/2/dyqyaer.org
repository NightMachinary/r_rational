  I'm not even sure that my thoughts here are even valid, rather than just pseudo-philosophy with minimal basis in reality.

I'd say the second one, no offense.

I feel this reasoning falls strongly in the "And this is why it's a great thing that we get hit on the head with a truncheon every month" category.

To elaborate, I agree transhumanism would have a negative effect some forms of emotional maturity, the same way having access to computers every moment of our lives probably has a negative effect on some forms of memory. But if we had access to actual (evil-free) emotional self-modification, we wouldn't trade it for some abstract sense of emotional maturity in a million years.
