It depends on the world you live in, really. If we're able to safely and thoroughly modify away all emotional obstacles such that emotional maturity is obsolete, then it does fall into the truncheon category. If we're only able to modify away the immediate and obvious emotional obstacles, we may be blindsided by the uncommon ones. It's the difference between being stabbed with a pathogenic needle and getting vaccinated.

I'm not sure which is the case in Aerb, and I think it's fair to say Joon and Mary aren't either. They've already had to deal with a tower which stealthily modifies intuitive ethics. Suppose they find another which modifies sexual/romantic attraction, and Mary's only countermeasure is "close my eyes and sit still for a few minutes"?

On the other hand, Mary is currently looking forward to long stretches of time in an enclosed space with Joon. It might be worth it in the short term, even if it's not in the long term.
