Well, this was a pretty brutal punch in the gut. Amaryllis' heartfelt rebuttal to June's qualms about a relationship hit the nail on the head. It's a shame the ship looks like it's been scuttled permanently, and I can't even mourn it properly without feeling selfish, because I'm a hundred percent on Amaryllis' side when it comes to self-determination. Her pragmatism and decisiveness are what make her such an appealing character in the first place.
