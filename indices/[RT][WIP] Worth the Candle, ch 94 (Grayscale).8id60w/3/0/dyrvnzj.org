If we're being optimistic, more like drydocked indefinitely?

Value-hacking is temporary, and all the underlying reasons for the value should still be there for the foreseeable future, so it's not going away permanently. Conversely, artificially suppressing the emotion seems like it would prevent her from getting over it in a conventional, permanent fashion. This creates an interesting situation where her feelings on the matter are essentially in stasis until she stops hacking herself.
