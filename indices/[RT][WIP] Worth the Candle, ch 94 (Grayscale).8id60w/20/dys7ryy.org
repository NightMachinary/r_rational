So, does anyone want to speculate what cthulhuraejepsen's tag "Case 70" refers too? It looks like it is one of the codewords Joon and Mary agreed upon to convey information about Joon's companion screen without any non-party members being clued in, but what does it mean?

Assuming it is not just a throwaway reference, I don't think that they actually thought of 70 different cases, but maybe they have a system of combining different cases. In which case 70 would be case 0, for not a new companion, and case 7, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Possibly something slightly weird since it would be one of the later numbers used, maybe "non-companion entry" or "lost a party member".
