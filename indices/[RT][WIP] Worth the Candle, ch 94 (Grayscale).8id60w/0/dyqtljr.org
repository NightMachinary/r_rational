ch 95 and 96 are (mostly) written, but they belong in what I think will be a fairly sizeable chunk of chapters, in a way that this chapter (mostly) doesn't. Ideally, the next time I post will be the conclusion of this arc, and /maybe/ of this book, but as fair warning, it might be a while (and as a consequence, will be a large amount of text).

Also, this officially means that /Worth the Candle/ has crossed the half million word mark! Hooray!
