Ah, but what if I nicely asked them to not do that?

More seriously ... so what? My /primary/ concern is in stifling discussion or segregating the audience, which I don't really think limited release a day early would do (though I might be wrong about that). If the worst /financial/ case happens, and a single person pledges enough to get their chapters early, then forwards it to everyone else who would have been willing to pay, then yes, the experiment will be a conclusive failure. I don't think that's likely though, even if just because of the coordination problems.

Either way, it /should/ cost me very little, and /should/ result in some unknown amount of extra income, even assuming that some number of people completely ignore me nicely asking them not to share too much or too widely.
