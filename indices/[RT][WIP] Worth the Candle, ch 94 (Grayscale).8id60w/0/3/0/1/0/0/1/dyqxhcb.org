I'm not sure what you mean by authorial intent here?

The issue is that you're trying to pressure an author to release content at a different pace than what they decided is best for their process. It is hard to believe you have better information than they do on both how to make sure the content is received the best way, and to make sure they stay happily productive.

If you read writers talk about their process, it's very obvious that having people clamoring "for more, now" doesn't actually help either side. Even if you think the way you're phrasing it is a compliment, the writer feels more pressure which is usually counterproductive. And in this particular case, I don't necessarily agree that your phrasing was complimentary.
