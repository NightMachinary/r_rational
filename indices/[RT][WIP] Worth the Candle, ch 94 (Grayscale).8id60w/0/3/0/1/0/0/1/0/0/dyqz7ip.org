  My poll was sarcastic(you can tell by my attempts at shaming "no" votes as being beyond inane and has a perfectly good reason to vote no), and I'm being downvoted to all hell for perceived rudeness
#+end_quote

Yeah, sarcasm is bad communication and you should avoid it whenever possible. Especially over text.

  While your all getting on my cass for disrespecting the authors vision
#+end_quote

No, we're getting on your case for being counterproductive and making a bad tradeoff. You make an unfunny joke, but mostly you signal impatience with the author.

  Citation needed Why are you guys treating him as a fragile flower?
#+end_quote

You don't have to be a 'fragile flower' to be bothered when people pester you. As such it's good to have a social rule that prevents excessive pestering. What you're observing is the enforcement of that rule.

I don't think I really need a citation that comments on work impact author mood, and that author mood impacts their writing?

But sure, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8fccpx/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dyfcivl/?st=jh0fzovv&sh=873eb71e][here's a citation]] for the author talking about how writing status updates that they think will not be well received is stressful/unpleasant and thus likely to impact writing.

  My ph(r)asing isn't the message
#+end_quote

Phrasing is definitely part of the message, and usually more important than the literal reading. More information is exchanged in subtext than directly.
