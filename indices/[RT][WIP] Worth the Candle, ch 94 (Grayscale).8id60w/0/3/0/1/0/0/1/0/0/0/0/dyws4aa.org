Right; so if you actually want to communicate literally rather than establish status and group membership, you should avoid sarcasm.

I'm not so much against sarcasm in-person, and of course myself am not perfect and sometimes fall to the temptation even online, but in general believe sarcasm doesn't belong in topical conversation online.
