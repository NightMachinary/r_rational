  I'm curious though, if that's the stereotypical male fantasy on what a woman feels, what's the typical female fantasy?

The /extremely/ stereotypical female fantasy is of a "bad boy" archetype with nigh uncontrollable lust who gets gradually transformed into a loving, caring, emotionally close partner. He's handsome, rich, probably has some kind of trauma in his past, and the sex fantasy is more about the emotional bond and overcoming obstacles than it strictly is about sex (though there's still lots of sex). To the extent the man is standoffish, it's because he's working so hard to restrain his incredible passion (see: /Twilight/, but also tons of other examples).

(There's a really helpful model of human sexuality that divides it into "responsive" and "spontaneous" sexuality, where some people because aroused in response to sufficient stimulus, and some people just become aroused for no real reason (and then seek out stimulus). For maybe sociocultural and maybe biological reasons, responsive sexuality is more common in women, and spontaneous sexuality is more common in men, and I think the stereotypical fantasies somewhat reflect that.)

But there are lots of different traditional female fantasies, just like there are lots of traditional male fantasies, and a lot of people don't respond to the stereotypes for their gender. As one somewhat common example, a fair number of women get off on "gay conversion" fantasies, i.e. stories where a woman seduces a gay man and makes him realize that actually, he really does desire a woman after all (note: probably don't actually try this).
