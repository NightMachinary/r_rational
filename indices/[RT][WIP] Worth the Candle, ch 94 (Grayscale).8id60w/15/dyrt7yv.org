I deeply empathize with Joon. My skin crawled. A punch to the gut. That something was lost that can't be regained. It feels like some kind of betrayal is going to happen soon.

Brilliant writing.

Interesting to know that by default she would fall in love with Joon.

Is the reverse true for Joon?

Amarylis is going to take steps to surpass Joon.

How long will it take Joon to get over Amarylis and will it affect him to her benefit?
