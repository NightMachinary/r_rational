You can read some of my thoughts on piracy [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3b6tkz/d_friday_offtopic_thread/csjkg7z/][here]], which haven't changed too much in the past few years.

Generally speaking, piracy is a case of rational self-interest. In the case of /sharing/ though, there's usually some moral or social impetus, like the belief that information and culture should be free and not gated behind whether or not you have enough money, or because you'll get cred with a group you care about. (Ignoring, for a moment, pirates who make money on piracy, or who engage in piracy as a method of getting into a community that gives them access to high-quality sources.)

Would posting a pastebin of a chapter to this subreddit a day early gain you the moral high ground? My /personal/ feeling is that it wouldn't, especially since I'll be doing what I can to make sure that there's no segregation of discussion, and the chapters will go out for a wide release the day after. Maybe someone will really feel like picking a fight, and also be willing to go through the effort needed to engage in that fight through posting a pastebin, rather than just complaining in the comments when the chapter comes out.

Would posting a pastebin of the chapter to this subreddit a day early represent a /social/ gain? I don't think it would. I think a fair number of people would read it, but generally speaking, people are on the author's side. Wildbow requests that people don't share e-books of /Worm/ or post such things to the subreddit, and generally speaking, people comply with that request.

I might be over-estimating this community, or just not in tune with community norms and modes of thought, but we'll see.
