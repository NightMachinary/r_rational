So, an incentive isn't an incentive if you can free-ride on it, so it's the same as having no incentive at all.

I would propose that what would happen is more likely that you'd end up with the text posted to a pastebin and linked to from [[/r/rational]]. (And then taken down, and then a thread started about why it was taken down, culminating in the creation of [[/r/rational_piracy]].)

I'd maybe suggest something more like /teases/ of new chapters, dribbled out, so that none of them individually are worth sharing. Or maybe the ability to watch you work in an Etherpad/Google Docs and chat with others doing the same (which I've done before, but which I understand can be stressful to people with different mindsets than me.) That is: valuable /ephemeral/ experiences, rather than valuable shareable artifacts.
