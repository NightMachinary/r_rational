Yeah, I will probably be adding a new reward tier in the next few days; my wife has stepped up as manager, and is getting things ready for me, mostly so I don't have to handle what I find to be the more stressful parts of the business side of things. It's sort of a "do work you want to do in exchange for money" type thing, where it definitely /is/ worth the effort by any objective measure ... but I still don't want to do the work.

I've talked a fair amount about how writing is my primary hobby and form of stress relief, the thing that I do at the end of the day after putting my son to bed in order to unwind, and how I kind of worry about compromising that by adding job-like aspects onto it.

Right now, the thinking is that I'll have chapters e-mailed a day early at a higher tier (which I'm not hugely a fan of), a discord set up where you can talk to me (other than the normal [[http://discord.gg/rational][/r/rational discord]], which I also frequent, mod, and technically own) and a special room/role there, plus maybe some supplemental stuff that's not important to the story proper, or which just fleshes out side stories or worldbuilding. But I mostly want to make sure that I'm making minimal compromises to the story, and to one of the best parts of my life.

Economically, I'm not really sure that a utility-minded first-time author would choose patronage. The average first novel is something like ~90,000 words, which for me is one "fast" month or three "slow" months. Pledges are, in some respects, a long, slow grind of building up readership over time, which means that someone like Wildbow goes through years of minimal income while putting in a lot of work.

/Worth the Candle/ is a little unconventionally structured (and to some extent, written), and the "book" lengths are hilariously inconsistent, but if you accept that it's roughly five books, then it's naive value a publisher would pay for it would be something like ~$25,000. Now granted, I don't think that it has the polish of a manuscript (though I've done slush-pile reading and lord knows it's better than most of that garbage), but it's kind of hard to look at the numbers as they stand and think that patronage is the rational way to go, especially since there are only a small handful of people making real money from the patronage system.

(I do like the complete freedom from anyone else's input; if someone doesn't like what I write, there's no actual recourse for them except to stop reading. If I had an editor/publisher/agent, there would be a contract, and someone might say "hey, you included this whole chapter where the protagonist is fucking a deer, rewrite this", with some actual consequences if I didn't comply. To me, that's the primary thing that's good about the patronage model, with the main bad thing (economics aside) being that I don't have an agent to handle networking and boring stuff for me, or a professional editor to handle (some of) the work of prose.)
