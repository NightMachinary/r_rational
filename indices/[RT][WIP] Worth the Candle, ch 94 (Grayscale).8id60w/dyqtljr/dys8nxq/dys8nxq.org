Love it. This last arc has been excellent. Probably your best. Your handling of interpersonal conflict has been wonderful. You have come a long way since Shadows of the Limelight from a 3/10 to an 8.5/10 on a consistent basis.

If I can add my two cents (which I get to, but am trying to make my request a little less offensive, as a random reader on the internet) I would ask that you put a $5 level on your Patreon. I cannot bring myself to donate $1 a month (unless you are sure about this), but I would be happy to do $5.

I get that you heavily imply that you have a fine income from your day job, but so do some of your readers.

If this new economy of web fiction is going to work in the long run, we need people like you (pioneering authors writing excellent work) to play by the rules (we pay you and you write as you will). Wildbow is at $4,702 (he writes well and frequently if a bit formulaically) Pirateaba is at $3,478 monthly (she is prolific and writes well) and PuDDleS4263 is at $4,801 monthly (he is prolific and is OK at writing). You write prolifically and very well. By getting your Patreon figures up (even if you donate it to charity) you inspire others to copy you and increase the quantity (and potentially quality [here's to hoping]) of work available in the ecosystem.

When you compare this to a first time advance for a beginning fantasy author ($5,000 for TOR - $1,000-$3,000 for smaller presses) it can appear attractive to many potential authors and the whole community of readers can benefit. For while you might not be motivated by money the next Dickens (whose was paid by the word an published serially on a weekly or monthly basis) might be.
