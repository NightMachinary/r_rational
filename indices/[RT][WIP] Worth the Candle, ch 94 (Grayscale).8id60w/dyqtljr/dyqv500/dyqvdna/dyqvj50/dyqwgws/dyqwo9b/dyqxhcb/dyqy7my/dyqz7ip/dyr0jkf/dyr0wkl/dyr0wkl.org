  Yet you have given me two walls-o-texts informing me that you find my jokes so unfunny that they become socially unacceptable?

Well, I was assuming you were interested in why you're getting the reaction you're getting, thus your continuous engagement in the conversation? If me explaining things is bothering you, why don't you just stop replying?

  1 comment and the only one at that? If I didn't love arguing for its own sake, I dare say, I could find that questionable. No screw it I do find the downvotes very questionable and your vaguely associated with them.

Well, the thing is there's a population asymmetry here, right? Even if it's one comment from any particular person to the author, but that doesn't mean the author doesn't get way too many of such comments. So you can't wait for someone to /repeatedly/ make those before you start telling them "hey maybe don't pressure the author". You do it every time you see it happening, most people just go "oh OK that makes sense", you prevent both their repeated posts and anyone else who maybe thought of it but saw the exchange.

Whereas I have no reason to believe that there is such an asymmetry in conversation between you and me.
