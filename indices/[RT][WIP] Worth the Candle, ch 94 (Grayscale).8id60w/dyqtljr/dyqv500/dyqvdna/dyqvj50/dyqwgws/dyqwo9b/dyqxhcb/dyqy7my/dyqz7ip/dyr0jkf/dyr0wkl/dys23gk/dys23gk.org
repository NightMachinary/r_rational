  Well, I was assuming you were interested in why you're getting the reaction you're getting, thus your continuous engagement in the conversation? If me explaining things is bothering you, why don't you just stop replying?

I'm criticizing your argument as being anginist to your own actions; not your actions. I love to argue as I stated and I implicitly don't think your social standards should apply.

I don't have an example that wouldn't be offencive, so imagine this wasn't offensive.... think gay preacher, the problem is the preachin', even if i say "are you going to stone yourself?".

There was not yet a joke to upvote or a karma train to cho cho on.

And by making a poll, I had in effect created a way to express impatience, without sending a new notification.
