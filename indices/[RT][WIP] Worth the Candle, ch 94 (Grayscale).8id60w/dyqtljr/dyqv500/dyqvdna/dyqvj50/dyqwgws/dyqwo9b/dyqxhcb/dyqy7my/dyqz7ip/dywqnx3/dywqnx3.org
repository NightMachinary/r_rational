Sarcasm is covert social-signalling tool. It nearly partitions people into “people in on the subtext of your words, or who think enough like you to derive the subtext” and “people who interpret the words literally and get mad at them.” Frequently, that's the whole point: to make these groups and see who's in them. Usually so the first group can avoid the second group.

When you see an attempt at sarcasm fall down, it's not “bad communication”; it's simply that there are fewer people on the speaker's “side” than they thought. What you're perceiving isn't a failure of communication; it's the speaker losing a social gamble.
