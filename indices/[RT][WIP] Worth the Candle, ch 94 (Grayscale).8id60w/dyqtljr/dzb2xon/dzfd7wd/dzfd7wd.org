Most of the "game rule" stuff takes inspiration from a number of CRPGs I played growing up, which themselves are based on tabletop games that I played growing up, but it's all "original", in the sense that it's not based on any particular system. I was playing a lot of Tyranny when this story was in the planning stages, so it probably takes a lot of meat from there -- but that is, itself, a throwback to the isometric CRPGs of my youth.

The rules I have written out aren't playtested at all, nor comprehensive enough to run an actual game, though individual pieces (especially magic systems) are lifted from homebrew stuff in games I've run.

I don't actually think that the full system would make for good gameplay in a tabletop setting, since they weren't created with that in mind. It's also not fleshed out enough around the edges (e.g. there's a rigid definition for what 'Romance' entails, plus some benchmarks for skill levels, but nothing written down about what's going on mechanically when a 'Romance' 'roll' is made).
