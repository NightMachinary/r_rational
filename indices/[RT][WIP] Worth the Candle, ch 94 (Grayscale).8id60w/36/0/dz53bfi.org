Joon got access to POW, SPD, END, and PHY at lvl 10 (ch 19), and then CUN, KNO, WIS, and MEN at lvl 20 (ch 48). Thus far, he hasn't had any luck in tapping other things that in theory are tappable, like LUK, the SOC stats, or soul-embedded magic (like unicorn magic, which is implied to eventually be possible).

Per Symbiosis, Fenn is at half his skill level, which means that she's behind him by a fair amount. I can't recall whether or not she's been explicitly stated to be burning her own bones, nor can I find a reference, but it should be assumed that she is, just like Juniper, and either replacing them herself, or getting his help.
