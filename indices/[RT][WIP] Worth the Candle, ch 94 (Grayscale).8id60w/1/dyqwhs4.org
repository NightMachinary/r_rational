  “So,” said Amaryllis toward the end of the meal, during a lull in conversation. “How long do you think it will take you to get over Tiff?” I stopped chewing and looked at her. A few things occurred to me at once: first, that she had waited until now to ask that question, when she'd have the easy out of moving to alone time, second, that she had probably been thinking about that question for awhile, and third, that her interest in the question wasn't really about me, it was about her. How long will it take me to get over you?
