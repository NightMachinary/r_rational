I thought that was really well done characterization wise, particularly the last few lines. Joon is basically a romantic, and thinks that love should /mean/ something. However he implied that Amaryllis being attracted to him was a core part of her being (whether this was entirely unmeant, or a bit of a freudian slip on his part is unclear). This is both really insulting and possibly true. So Amaryllis was understandably disgusted, but Joon didn't understand what he implied. Personally I think Amaryllis can do better than Joon, but it would have to be someone already introduced at this point. Grak seems like a no nonsense (ungendered) fellow...
