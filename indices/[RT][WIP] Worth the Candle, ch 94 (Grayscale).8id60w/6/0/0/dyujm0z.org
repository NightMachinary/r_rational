It's an interesting argument to say that the Level Up modifaction is the same as modifying one's feeling of attraction/infatuation with someone.

In some senses the Level Up was functioning similar to a drug. Giving him a sense of euphoria beyond that which he could ever hope to regularly experience, and it seemed to be getting stronger and stronger each time.

It's the game directly messing with his mind in a way that would not have occurred naturally. Honestly, putting a game mechanic like that in was a really messed up thing for the DM to do, which I can only assume was done to keep motivating Joon to reach new heights, instead of becoming complacent.

In contrast, Mary is modifying her feelings for Joon which is something that, if the DM is to be believed, are a natural result of the time they spent together and who she is as a person.

No one dumped endorphins into her head everytime she saw Joon so that she'd fall in love with him. It's no more a part of the game interface than any of the rest of Aerb is.

So I'd think that the modifications are definitely different. Though I don't know if I'd go so far as to say it's a case of Personality Death for Mary to modify herself in this way.

I think that in the same way that we wouldn't give someone drugs for depression if their problems were manageable in some other way, it doesn't make sense for Mary to modify her soul just because it's convenient. It sets a bad precedent for teaching yourself how to solve your social/emotional problems, IMO.

She took what should have been a last resort and made it her solution.
