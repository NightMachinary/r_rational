Interesting. I thought the level ups being addicting was pretty clearly meant to be a Pavlovian response. Especially since Joon makes comments about how he thinks his judgement may be clouded by the desire to level up, rather than doing the optimal thing. Also the way Joon describes his game sessions, makes me think that he's not a person who's overly concerned about game mechanics by nature. He uses the mechanics of the game to drive the setting/story, and only cares about keeping the mechanics from being easily abused or uninteresting. I get that he does care about Leveling up because it's very much tied up into his ability to gain power and thus stay alive. But I think without the Euphoric side effects of leveling up, Joon's values wouldn't even say "Level Up" They would say something like "Power" or "Safety" or "Agency"... though of course, that's just my personal reading of things.

You're right we do give people drugs a little bit easier than my comment made it out to seem. But what I meant is that we generally give drugs when things like behavioral therapy alone aren't likely to work. Though I'm aware that professionals have different opinions about what point giving someone drugs to treat a problem is better, so... probably not the best argument on my part. And also it was probably a dumb analogy to compare depression to unrequited love.

I think a better way to put it is that physically there's nothing wrong with Mary. Being in love is not a condition that any psychiatrist would treat. It's not a chemical imbalance making it so she can't love anyone else, or can't live her life more or less normally. It also doesn't seem to be an obsessive thing that's causing her to engage in unhealthy or immoral actions. It's just inconvenient and emotionally painful to a degree.

And it's probably made worse by the fact that Joon is one of her only friends and she spends virtually all of her time with him. Those are the extenuating circumstances that probably need to be solved. Ideally she should be encouraged to find more social outlets not related to him, rather than do something drastic like modify her soul... but I also understand that's not likely to happen either.

The problem with modifying your soul as an answer to a situation like this, is that it's something that can be done to "fix" all her social issues. Say she and Grak later get in a fight and it ruins the team dynamic... well then she can just modify her values so that she no longer cares about the outcome of that fight.

I guess, the question is where do you draw the line? At what point does making changes to yourself for your own convenience make you "not yourself". I personally think that for the sake of being safe, you should draw that line at the point where you're only willing to change unasked for outside influences. With the only exceptions being when not making a change to yourself would cause severe drops in quality of life that cannot be mitigated in a less drastic way.
