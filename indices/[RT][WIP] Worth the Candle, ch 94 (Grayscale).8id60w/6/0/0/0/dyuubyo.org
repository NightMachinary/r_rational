  In some senses the Level Up was functioning similar to a drug. Giving him a sense of euphoria beyond that which he could ever hope to regularly experience, and it seemed to be getting stronger and stronger each time.

Isn't that what love also does to brains?

  It's the game directly messing with his mind in a way that would not have occurred naturally. Honestly, putting a game mechanic like that in was a really messed up thing for the DM to do, which I can only assume was done to keep motivating Joon to reach new heights, instead of becoming complacent.

This is a different reading that I have, and I wonder if a closer reread could clarify. It was not my intention that the obsession with levelling up was artificially injected into Juniper; rather that he was the kind of person who, given a world with level ups, would purchase level ups with all his focus.

Perhaps you're right and it was the pavlovian kind of conditioning due to how good levelling up felt that made it important to him, but it was my impression that even very early on - before he could get addicted to the feeling of leveling up - Joon was close to obsessed with getting more powerful.

  I think that in the same way that we wouldn't give someone drugs for depression if their problems were manageable in some other way

Um, we totally would. We do! I personally was on antidepressants for ~6 months even though all my 'real' problems were 'manageable' - i.e. I didn't lose my job, or whatever. Taking antidepressants because it's convenient is totally a thing.
