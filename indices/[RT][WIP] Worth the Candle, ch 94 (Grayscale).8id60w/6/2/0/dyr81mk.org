  is that she referred to the change as "fixing herself"

Yeah, the repeated emphasis on "fixing" and being "broken" feels concerning; this is probably something the groups will have to address at some point, especially if Mary is going to be liberal with the self-modification.

(although I don't think she'd do anything really crazy without adequate preparation; she's usually pretty reasonable with this stuff)

#+begin_quote
  If someone referred to their attraction to me as something wrong about themselves, something that is a problem in and of itself rather than something that leads to other problems, I would be rather insulted.
#+end_quote

Oh yeah, I'm 100% team self-mod, but /ouch/. Mary was brutal in this chapter.

I think this is similar to the time Mary made herself more loyal to reach level 10, or when Joon told Fenn things while under unicorn blood and her loyalty increased. Superpowers aside, it can be very distressing to have people visibly and strongly change how they think about you, in a way you have no input over.

(or the time Mary kissed Joon under unicorn blood; or the time Mary made herself fall in love with Joon because she thought she wouldn't be able to stay with him once he got powerful unless he married her; she does have issues)
