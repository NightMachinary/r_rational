I'm not saying she was wrong, but at the very least she could have expressed herself better. Look at this quote:

#+begin_quote
  Amaryllis nodded. “I wanted you to want me too,” said Amaryllis. “I'm trying to keep that in mind, because right now it feels like idiocy or lunacy or both.”
#+end_quote

It doesn't say "I no longer feel attracted to you even though you do have attractive traits." or anything similar. She's saying that feeling attracted to June feels like idiocy or lunacy. That removing her attraction to him felt like fixing herself, at least in her present state of mind. She may not be expressing herself correctly, or maybe I'm missinterpreting, but what she is saying sounds deeply insulting.

I do actually think that what she did was the correct thing to do, although I haven't had time to give it a ton of thought at this point, but that's separate from the fact that she is either being unintentionally insulting or that she now has some clear negative thoughts about June that she is expressing in a rather hurtful way.
