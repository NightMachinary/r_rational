I get what you're saying, but she didn't remove ALL emotions toward Juniper. Her feeling things for him wasn't the problem - it was specifically the romantic feelings and sexual attraction that she reduced to nil. At the end of the chapter she still likes spending time with him, but now it's just as friends.

Anyone who's ever had a friendship with someone end because unrequited romantic love developed probably knows exactly how crappy that feels - no matter if they were the one who wanted to stay friends or the one who wanted to become more than friends.
