I completely agree with Mary here, to the point where I got pretty mad at Joon during the dinner scene. His ideas of what is and what isn't an inviolable part of one's self seem completely arbitrary - the amount of tinkering this boy has done with his own soul is far, far beyond what she did here. The fact that he had all day to think about this and his conclusion was some flimsy thing about how depression is chemicals and crushes are essential brain patterns is pretty infuriating. And making her go back to that painful infatuation while her dinner got cold just so she could respond emotionally to his emotional arguments seemed like a real dick move (even if she was the one who offered it). But, at the end of the day it really felt like he came through, and even if he doesn't entirely agree with her decision he's realizing it's her soul to do with as she pleases. Here's to a long, fruitful and 100% platonic friendship.

I think he kind of serves as a reader avatar here? I've been surprised at how many people ship Joon and Mary, and it makes sense that we get this chapter. Both a) having the tension fade away and b) keep dangling it over both their heads forever would feel kind of cheap, and you found a really interesting, in-universe logical way to do neither, and got a hell of a bottle episode out of it.

Also, I'm glad you put on Holy Grail at the end there. For a hot second I was worried you'd make them watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind lol
