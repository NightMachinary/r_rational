It looks like breakfast and lunch conversations switched meal order at some point.

- Joon makes sandwiches for lunch, Amaryllis asks about Joon getting over Tiff.
- time skip
- Amaryllis makes English breakfast, tells Joon she edited. Joon is eating bacon.
- Amaryllis says she is done with lunch.
- Joon doesn't eat the rest of his sandwich
- time skip
- dinner later that day
