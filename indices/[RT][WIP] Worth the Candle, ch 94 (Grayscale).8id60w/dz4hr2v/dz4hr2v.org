[[/u/cthulhuraejepsen][u/cthulhuraejepsen]], have you considered the salient points of [[/u/Amonwilde][u/Amonwilde]]'s comment [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8882ln/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_8687_headdown/dwjxz6l/][here]]? Here's the comment in full:

  I'm guessing [Laborbuch's] not a fundraiser, marketer, SAAS provider, or psychologist. If you prime a visitor with a low price, they might exceed it, but only slightly. You want to provide a lowest price that people can step over, a "reasonable" price that you push them toward, and an upsell price that primes people to think of the reasonable price as reasonable. This is basic stuff and you see it on almost any successful Kickstarter or Patreon. Check out Thinking Fast and Slow if you want the long version.

What I understood was with something like 1/3/9 USD, basically three tiers, there'd be a higher percentage of 3 USD pledges than a singular 1 USD pledge would incite. Partly because psychological reasons, but probably also because it'd be easier to show a higher monetary appreciation since a prospective patreon would need less clicks for the same action (if no tier would offer extra rewards).
