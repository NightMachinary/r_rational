I liked that chapter, and again even better if read from Amaryllis' PoV. The discussion they did not have yet, but which I'm looking forward to is: Defining a policy for self-modification. Amaryllis recklessly skipped that, and recklessly shut Joon down when he brought it up.

Clearly there is a strong argument for having safeguards and helpful oversight (trip-sitting) by party-members. Also, there is a strong argument for further (careful) experimentation in how self-reversing modifications actually are.

Fallatehr kinda implied that a "proper" modification does not "decay to base-line": It instead moves the individual into a new stable state, which perseveres even after the direct effects of soul-magic have worn off. This model makes more sense than "everything reverts", but magic does not need to make sense, and Fallatehr is known for lying.
