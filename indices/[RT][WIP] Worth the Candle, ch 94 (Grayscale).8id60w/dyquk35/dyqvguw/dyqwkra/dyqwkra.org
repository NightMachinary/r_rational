Meh, it reduces to the belief that there are parts of ourselves that one should not have conscious control of. There's a couple parts to it, but in particular it's about trustworthiness of your emotions.

Mutual risk of heartbreak should a relationship end is what aligns your incentives together; both parties are invested into the relationship because they would both suffer should it end, loss aversion handles the rest. If one party could at a moments notice choose to stop being in love, well then their love stops being a meaningful signal.
