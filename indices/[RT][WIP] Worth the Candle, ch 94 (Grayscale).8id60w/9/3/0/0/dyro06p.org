  a possible solution

An AU where the DM nudged Juniper towards Amaryllis more than towards Fenn? A divergence fanfiction where Fenn dies in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/28242540][Chapter 51]]? A crackfic where Valencia uses her eldritch demon powers to orchestrate a Fenn x Juniper x Amaryllis OT3?

Actually, I'm not sure the problem you want to solve is the problem I'm thinking of. For all I know you're sad because they decided to watch /Monty Python and the Holy Grail/ instead of /Pulp Fiction/. Or because Amaryllis' meal got cold while she was busy messing with the fundamental nature of her very soul. In which case... Hmm, I admittedly also struggle to come up with sufficiently entertaining ideas for fix-fics aimed at those issues.

  has anybody written fanfic for this yet?

Not as far as I know.
