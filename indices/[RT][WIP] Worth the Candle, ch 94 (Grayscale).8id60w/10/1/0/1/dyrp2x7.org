As the parent of a toddler, you realize pretty quickly that (1) crying is very, very effective at getting a response, and (2) the kid knows it and will abuse it.

Grandparents are great for reassuring that the kid is safe, fed, clean, comfortable, and loved, and that's everything they need - so it's OK to just let them cry sometimes.
