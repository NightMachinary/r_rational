Right, obviously my description is not complete. However, building that kind of trust takes time and requires a certain degree of bootstrapping. If you start from the position of being mutually in love, it's much easier to build emotional intimacy and the trust that someone has your back - you know they have some investment into your wellbeing straight away, because of the heartbreak that is on stake for them, so you can become more vulnerable earlier, so you can see they're not taking advantage of your vulnerability, so you have more trust, etc. etc.

You can totally become intimate and trust someone who doesn't love you, after all. But it seems easier if they do.
