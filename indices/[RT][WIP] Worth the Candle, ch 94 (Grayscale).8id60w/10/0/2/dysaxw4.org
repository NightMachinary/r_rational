I think part of it is explained in the thread above: the risks that come with transhumanism and the dread of witnessing such a sudden change ("death") of self.

Considering what exactly bothers me...speaking for myself, it's probably the /witnessing/ that causes the apprehension. For Amaryllis, she thought the decision through and it was simply the instant path to a change that she wanted. I suspect most of us, if we had the chance to rid ourselves of the negative emotions accompanying stressful experiences (break-ups, death of family), wouldn't bat an eye if it would get us over the anguish. But to an invested, outside observer (family/friends or readers), witnessing that sudden of a change is like whiplash to our internal models of that person's identity. The change might be seamless for the individual, but not everyone else.
