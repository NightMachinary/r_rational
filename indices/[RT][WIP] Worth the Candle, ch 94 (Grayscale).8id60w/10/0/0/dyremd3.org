  I feel very much like Joon about what Amaryliss did: deeply uncomfortable, but without being able to articulate a strong argument against it, which leads me to question how valid my viewpoint is.

There are a couple of sides to this disagreement. Firstly, at the end when Amaryllis looks disgusted at Juniper calling that modified part of her "essential", I don't think she was disgusted at his feelings. Rather this whole issue is a much more fundamental and deeply existential question for Amaryllis. As best she understands, she was literally designed and created as a being for the purpose of Juniper's benefit. I would imagine that such a thing feels rather dehumanizing. So a big part of her unstated reasoning is that she is trying to prove she is not a "fake" person - that she has valuable independent personality wholly apart from her association with Juniper.

Regarding Juniper's discomfort, there are several aspects to this. Aside from the emotional portions that he admits to, one question that should be raised is that of side effects. Do either of them have enough expertise or training in soul magic to know whether changing something hidden deep inside one area could have unknown linked effects elsewhere in the soul where they are not looking? Potentially even more so if this is something that Amaryllis intends to repeat every day. If some other peripherally related value is being unknowingly increased or decreased each time she edits her feelings about Juniper, but that other related value springs back at a different (slower!) rate than the main item she is editing, then she could accidentally cause severe changes to her personality. Since she is passing dilated time rapidly in relative isolation, this wouldn't even be easily noticed by anyone. She could step out of the time chamber at the end a fundamentally very different person without her having had the intention of this happening.

There is also a more insidious and likely more severe risk. Self-editing and transhumanism inevitably presents dangers of slippery slopes. To present just one possible example among multitudes, Amaryllis has set a precedent here where she found that editing what she cares about is a reasonable solution to solve certain problems and make their lives easier. Suppose that in the future after some major battle, she finds herself having nightmares about the violence. So she edits her soul to solve that problem, and in the process ends up slightly decreasing her general concern and care for strangers' lives. This is a potentially self-perpetuating cycle, where caring less about others' lives would make her less reluctant to do so again if it would seem beneficial to do so. In essence, these sorts of uses of soul magic run the risk of causing unexpected runaway changes in fundamental goals and values. It could result in monstrous morality changes like Fallatehr in the less extreme cases. In the more extreme cases, it could result in something so alien to other humans as to be closer to a rogue AI, especially given her thoughts on how to exploit various exclusion zones. I suspect that these sorts of dangers of soul magic are why there are now so many laws about it.
