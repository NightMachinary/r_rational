I'm willing to grant Amaryllis' claim that she has the right to do this to her own soul.

However, she named some pharmaceuticals as a comparison. Those drugs have, we hope, been thoroughly tested, their benefits and limitations and side effects explored and documented in a large number of cases. Whereas soul modification...well, they're learning as they go along. Kind of a different risk profile there.
