Yeah, I know all that stuff, it's just a matter of doing it. My wife actually works at an internet marketing company, so I have a fair amount of contact knowledge (plus I've done some work for them in the past, though it was code stuff, not actual marketing).

The current plan is $1 for digital downloads of the backcatalog, such as it is, $5 for one-day-early release, and then higher tiers for much more token stuff ... and then the other track that Patreon offers, which is incentives once the patronage total exceeds a certain amount, which will be things like side stories (which are actually partially written right now, so shouldn't impact the main project much), prettified worldbuilding/setting notes, and other stuff.

My wife is helping some, especially with the drudge work aspects, which she's more amenable to than I am. It's just slow going because of time/motivation constraints, and some of the inherent uncertainty involved (i.e. not knowing whether or how much it would actually increase income).

Edit: Added new tiers tonight, feedback would be appreciated.
