I think the problem is that Amaryllis was put together with no particular regard for psychological plausibility.

Single-target sexuality is a very weird trait for someone to have. Strict monogamy? Sure, finding staying faithful approximately as challenging as not floating into the sky is a common trait.

Asexuality is not particularly rare, either. But "This person, and only this person" without a romantic history to hang that on?

That was a poor match to the rest of the pattern of who Amaryllis /is/. And turning it off probably does feel like a fix, subjectively - it is obviously not the only valid fix, just giving herself a more normal libido would likely work just as well, but I do not think that would occur to her as an option on her own recognizance.
