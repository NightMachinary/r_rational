The problem was not "being attracted to June", it was "being attracted to June who expressed very clearly that he doesn't want to reciprocate"

" I think I love you\\
- oh, I'm sorry but that won't be possible...\\
- you're sure ? I mean we could-\\
- No. Really. No. Just no. Not an option.\\
- oh... well, I guess I'll try to stop loving you then...\\
- Well, no. You can't do that either.\\
- eh ? Why ?\\
- Because I would feel hurt.\\
- WHAT ?! "

I don't think June is that much messed up...
