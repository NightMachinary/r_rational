  I think this is similar to the time Mary made herself more loyal to reach level 10, or when Joon told Fenn things while under unicorn blood and her loyalty increased. Superpowers aside, it can be very distressing to have people visibly and strongly change how they think about you, in a way you have no input over.

Oh, speaking of that, this is fairly direct evidence that loyalty only ever goes up. Amaryllis decreases her attraction to June to nothing, when she had legitimate problems with sleeping due to her attraction to him and the lack of reciprocacy, and her loyalty doesn't change from the 20 it was already at. If it had gone down, she wouldn't be able to use symbiosis.

This isn't nearly as bad as June thought it would be, because her non-game-interface loyalty did go down. So the loyalty meter doesn't prevent decreases in actual loyalty.

Well, I guess you could say that romantic attraction isn't related to what the game considers loyalty, but that seems really implausible to me. From "I have problems sleeping because I'm thinking about you" to "The thought of attraction to you is lunacy" causes zero decrease in loyalty? It would be a horrible label if that was the case.
