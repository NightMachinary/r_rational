No, the dinner thing was definitely just me being mad at him and finding another reason to be more mad at him lol.

I found the skill-level-fudging that brought him to the DM truly terrifying, moreso than anything else he's done, but I guess that was different. What I really feared then was reality unrecoverably glitching out because that happens when you find loopholes in games that give you higher skill levels than should be possible. He used the same tool, but the risk was a completely different one. So you're right, he's done nothing worse than the level-up fix.
