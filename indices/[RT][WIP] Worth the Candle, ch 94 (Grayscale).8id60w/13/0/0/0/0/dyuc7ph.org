Right, but even temporary changes can cascade. All she has to do is lower a value that she thinks is okay to lower, which then might make her lower another value that her new, altered self believes is okay to lower, and on and on until she's changed herself beyond what her original self might have wanted.

Maybe there's a limit to what she can maintain if she's trying to keep too many values in their altered states at once, but she can still do some damage until the balls she juggles start to fall.
