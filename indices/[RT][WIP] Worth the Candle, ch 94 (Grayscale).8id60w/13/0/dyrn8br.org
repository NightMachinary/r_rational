I was thinking about the parallels with Rowan when I was writing this chapter, and hope that I don't repeat myself too much in terms of mechanics/themes/etc.

(Also, I weirdly couldn't remember Rowan's name for the better part of an hour. He's one of the three main characters in a novel I spent four months or so writing, and his name appears more than six hundred times, but I somehow managed to forget it.)
