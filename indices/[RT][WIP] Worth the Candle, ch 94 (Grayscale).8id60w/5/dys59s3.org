Well, looks like the main topic of this chapter is being thoroughly discussed.

Something I though was interesting is that Joon seems to be preparing to lose the Anyblade when he was practicing his blood magic. Joon can probably change the shape of a blood blade on the fly with enough practice and if he can become blade-bound to his own blood then he would have no need for the Anyblade.

The chances that the house is going to eat the Anyblade is increasing.
