In a world with superpowered individuals as either heroes or villains, with a great deal of governmental oversight of powered individuals, one man, Hector, maintains a clandestine existance as a normal IT guy alongside a secret existence as 'Delphic', an identity which claims to be a superhero who has uploaded himself to the internet and who provides mercenary services for the government via amazing surveillance and hacking capabilities. In actuality, Hector is just a powered human whose power is to be able to remotely view locations, including the past, and he is using the Delphic identity as a cover alongside talented hacking capabilities.

The story follows Hector's interactions with US and Canadian supers, many with their own agendas, the government's attempts to control 'Delphic', interactions with a potential mad scientist super-villain, and Hector's home life in something of a slice of life series, while he attempts to maintain his secret.
