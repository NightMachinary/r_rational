This is a superhero story, but very different from other superhero stories posted here such as Worm.

The main character is intelligent, relatable, and very human. He relies on the support of family and friends. He has blind spots, like any real person, but tries to overcome them. Unlike most protagonists, he has the need, ability, and inclination to cook and feed himself.

The world is a reasonable picture of modern life with supers, not some desolate wasteland full of starving wretches. There are no laughably evil villains, and the good guys are just as complex.

I'd say the best thing about this story is how each character seems like a real person, with real emotions. While you might not get the whole picture, you get the sense that they grew up somewhere, that they have a history that shaped who they are today.
