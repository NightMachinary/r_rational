One of the reasons that I keep a lot of notes is that I have trouble remembering things, and (IMO) keeping a lot of notes actually exacerbates that, because my brain says "okay, it's written down somewhere, no need to keep that in storage". My typical research habits are also such that I do a deep dive, and then fairly quickly forget a lot of what was learned. I've heard other people liken this to being a "temporary expert", and while I don't think that I'm /actually/ an expert, this is sometimes what it feels like, especially the "temporary" part, as details fade away and leave only an impression (and usually the pathways necessary to find/synthesize the information again).
