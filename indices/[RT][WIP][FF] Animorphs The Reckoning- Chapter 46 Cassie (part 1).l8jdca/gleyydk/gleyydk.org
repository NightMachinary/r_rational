Every once in a long while, a character just says what I'm thinking.

/‹Prince Jake, you speak as if you still intend to maintain control.  As if you believe control is a thing that is possible.  You know how the Ellimist works.  You know you cannot outmaneuver it.../

/‹An invalid question,› Ax countered.  ‹There are many things which seem possible which never were, in fact.../

/...The path you imagined us to be on is not real.  We were never on it.  We were on this path---always, from the beginning---and simply did not know it until now. ../

Thank you, Ax. Somebody had to say it, and you were the one allowing himself to see the obvious.
