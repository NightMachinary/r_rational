Agreed, but... you have to weight that by how likely you are to be able to achieve that. I feel like “Not if there's any other way---any other way at all” isn't doing that.

Though, I could be being too hard on Cassie here.

- I don't actually know that she doesn't have an idea for how to achieve it.
- I think if a philh said those words, it would be because he's making the mistake I'm complaining about. A Cassie might say those words for a different reason, so they mean a slightly different thing.
