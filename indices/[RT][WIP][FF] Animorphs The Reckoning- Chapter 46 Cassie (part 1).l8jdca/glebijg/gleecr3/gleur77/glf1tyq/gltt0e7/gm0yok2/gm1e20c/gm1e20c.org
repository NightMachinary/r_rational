We have Word of God from the author that the gods (speaking through the Avatar) are capable of "wizard's lies". I.e. they can say things in misleading or convoluted ways, but they can't deliberately say anything they know isn't true.

I think all moves that aren't equally wanted by both Players are "proposed by one and ratified by the other". I don't remember which conversation that was, but I think the Avatar said something that implied that pretty strongly, and it seems to fit the point of the game, which is to give the Gods a way to fight each Other without destroying the universe in a cosmic race-to-the-bottom
