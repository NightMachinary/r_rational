They don't exactly say that (what has been "ratified" are the initial conditions of the game). But by Occam's razor, you're probably right - otherwise, there'd be three categories of moves - unilaterally done, done by one and ratified by the other, and done jointly.

(It's also possible one of the E/C duo could've prevented the other from killing Cassie by making their own move in the game, and that might be what the Avatar means by the other "permitting" it. (Edit: But that doesn't sound really likely, even though who knows.))
