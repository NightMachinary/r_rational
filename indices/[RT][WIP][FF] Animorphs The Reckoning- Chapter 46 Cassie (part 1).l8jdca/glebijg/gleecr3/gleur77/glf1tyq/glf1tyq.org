It seems to me like this is the whole reason that Cassie is here, which is a good reason to suspect that it will work. But that sword has to cut two ways. From past chapters, it seems like something like this could only happen if the Ellimist *and* Crayak agreed upon it.

If I had to guess where the narrative is going, Cassie was brought back to keep them from exterminating the Howlers, because that will be the win condition (or will make the win condition inevitable). If they can stop the Howlers without killing them, the Ellimist wins. If the Howlers exterminate humanity, then Crayak wins. The quantum virus, on the other hand, doesn't further either of their goals.

The alternative is that Cassie's presence contributes to the Ellimist's victory, and the boy from the pool contributes to Crayak's (or vice versa).
