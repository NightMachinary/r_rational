  Lastly, a bit of a contest. I've always been dissatisfied with the last line of Chapter 14 (Esplin). If people are interested in submitting their own suggestions for what Esplin might think to himself, in that moment, I'm certainly interested in stealing them. =)

Contest thread /go/

Here is the last chunk of text from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12964264][chapter 14]]. The line in question is in bold:

  /So. You have a new enemy./

  Opening the refrigerated compartment, I withdrew one of the small, disclike packages and removed the foil wrapping. Breaking it into quarters, I set each piece at a different corner of the large rectangle painted on the floor. Stepping on top of them, I felt an anticipatory thrill as my hooves began to pulverize and absorb the stringy substance.

  <Yes,> I said thoughtfully, relinquishing my hold on Alloran so that he could speak freely once again.

  <And yet you intend to continue exactly as before.>

  I closed my eyes, feeling the Yeerk-flesh slide up my legs and into my stomach. <Not exactly,> I said, and I lowered the barrier still further, allowing Alloran a glimpse into my own thoughts.

  /1417 Bayview Drive./

  /88E South Church Street./

  /209 Aspen Avenue./

  /3555 Franklin Court./

  /The playground at Magnuson park./

  <They will know that you are coming,> Alloran said, and I laughed at the flicker of hope in his thoughts---so pale, so weak, so easily extinguished.

  <For all the good it will do them,> I said. <If they run, we shall simply spread unchallenged. And if they stay--->

  My meal complete, I turned toward the sanitation unit, forcing the Andalite warrior prince to look upon his own body---upon my body.

  *<Well. At least it will be interesting.>*
