She's back! For some reason I assumed that Cassie was intervening because she felt that trying to deal with Visser Three was inherently wrong. But her trying to save the Howlers makes more sense. Now I'm imagining a wholesome version of the Howlers who get their novelty by traveling the galaxy and playing different sports

I'm interested to see where this goes because I probably would take the deal with Visser. I simply don't see a way out, or a way to change the Howlers before humanity goes extinct

Edit: I loved this line too.

I love religious imagery and themes in works, and while they don't fit with this piece this line was perfect. Making a deal with this V3 really is like dealing with the devil, with consequences just as predictable. Even when they said they were going to take the deal they didn't think he would be true to his word, and that he would trick them somehow

Also interesting to see the implied back and forth with the gods and Cassie. One manipulated her into essentially committing suicide, the other intervened by preserving her in Z space and bringing her back, then the other potentially intervened by having Marco (who was in morph?) shoot her, only for Rachel who “wasn't supposed to be there” to stop him
