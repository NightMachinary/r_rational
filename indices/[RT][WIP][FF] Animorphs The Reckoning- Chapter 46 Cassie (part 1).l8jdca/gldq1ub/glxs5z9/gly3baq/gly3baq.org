Hey, I recognized the second, third, fifth, and sixth references! (As for the second one, as much as I dislike the film adaptation, changing the phrase /was/ one of the few good things it did.)

Care to share the origins of the first and the fourth ones? : )

Edit: The first one is a reference to something by Wildbow? I haven't read any of their works.
