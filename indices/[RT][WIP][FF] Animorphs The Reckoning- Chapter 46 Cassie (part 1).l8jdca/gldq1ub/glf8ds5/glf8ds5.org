<Well. We shall see how Elfangor's hand measures up against Alloran's tail.>

"/Esplin's/ tail" would be more in keeping with the previous sentence, but it doesn't have quite the same "student-vs-master" harmony as this version. I'd also like to call specific attention to the "We shall see" construction, because it's very gently evocative of the "we shall see what fate thinks of a human child's resolve" quote.
