Ahh, /finally/, I can stop pointing out to people that Cassie's death wasn't some cataclysmic blow to the Ellimist's plan, but was in fact part of it all along! Excellent!

For real though, Cassie being /shielded/ from the brutal forward march of the war is a really, really interesting angle. Hopefully her arrival is in time to pull Jake back from the pitch-dark brink he's standing on; preliminarily, things are looking hopeful on that front.

I wasn't prepared for how much that coldness from Jake was going to bite. Seeing it from Cassie's perspective, both because it was directed /at/ Cassie and because of the lens of her empathy, made it that much sharper. Then the breaking sense of relief from Helium's warmth was unexpected all over again.

CouteauBleu (not tagging you - I don't want to show up in your inbox with a picnic basket full of spoilers - but I know you're out there) neither one of us was /completely/ right about Marco's motivations for shooting Cassie, but I reserve the right to feel all full of myself 'cause I was a little closer. Uh... Is it cool if I say "nah-nah na-boo-boo?"

As for the Author's Note, funny that it mentions the end of Chapter 14. In that chapter, Esplin lists four street addresses plus "/The playground at Magnuson park/," which I had always taken to mean the Animorphs' home addresses and, like, the place where Tobias hangs out. But in this chapter, Chapter 46, Cassie lists her address as "/number 11, Apple Canyon Road/," which isn't among the addresses in Chapter 14. Another TKSU? Or am I wrong about what the addresses in 14 mean? Either way, I'll probably brainstorm a couple entries for the "contest" when I'm at my computer later.

That conversation in the barn with Marco that Cassie mentions - that's exactly the spot I keep getting distracted from as I annotate Chapter 4. Huh. (Might as well plug [[/r/Ranimorphs]] here - it's pretty empty right now, but it's where I've been posting annotated chapters as I make them, and it's open to all posts about the fic!)

Take your time on the back half, Author! Make a chapter you're proud of - in fact, let /all/ the remaining chapters be ones you're proud of. We've waited twelve years in Azkaban for this fic to wrap up; we can wait a few extra days for it to wrap up right. ;)
