I'm not so sure. We saw one player spending game resources to carefully maneuver Cassie into stasis before the war could change her. We saw with the field trip to the Hork-Bajir world that when They both want something, they can use basically unlimited game resources. Meanwhile the player they meet at the pool was carefully conserving [# of atoms x distance teleported] budget.
