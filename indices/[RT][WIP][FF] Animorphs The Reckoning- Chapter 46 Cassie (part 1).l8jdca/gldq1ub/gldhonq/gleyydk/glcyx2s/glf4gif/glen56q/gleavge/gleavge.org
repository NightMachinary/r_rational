I think I see where this is going. Cassie thinks killing the Howlers with a quantum virus would be wrong...but what about a memetic virus? I'm thinking how they were defeated in canon, by Jake kissing Cassie and the memory propagating into the shared mind. No one else on the team, who are all traumatized and exhausted, would be able to conceive of such an idea...except Cassie.
