I'm ready to make my guess as to the basic shape of the conclusion of the story. This is either wildly premature, or embarrassingly late to the party, depending, but why not, here goes.

The basic structure of what we have going on here is the Belgariad/Mallorean notion of choosing between good and evil, with the rat twist that the hard part of picking between good and evil is telling them apart. The Crayak/Elimist are ultimately betting on a single decision that the Animorphs will make in response to this absurd situation (Infinite babies are killing infinite babies and only the Devil can help you!).

Last time, I thought that would be about the Howler's likely having infected humanity with a lethal phage before their main attack. On further reflection, I don't think that's how it shakes out. The actual decision that the Gods care about is just the obvious one, give the cube to V3 or destroy it.

Their interventions are meant to prohibit V3 from simply stealing the cube, and also to eliminate humanity as an easy way to short circuit the decision. That is, to remove 'which is best for those like us' as a heuristic that dominates the choice they are supposed to be making.

In further updates, it will become blatantly obvious that humanity as they know it is already gone and not coming back. It has been purged by the Howlers or overwritten by V3, but either way the status quo antebellum is dead and gone.

It will also become obvious that V3's composure, the way it thinks it is playing with house money here, is wildly incorrect. It thinks it can make the virophage and annihilate the Howlers, or at the very least just put a few more minefields back to back. None of that will work without the cube. I dunno if its network has already been infected, or it is just wrong about the wider state of play, but V3 will be brought to the realization that its victory depends entirely on these kids and their choices.

V3 is recognizably a paperclipper/seeing-like-a-state/authoritarian analog. Choosing it is to choose Adult Supervision. It is, aside from a few fishtanks it is forced to maintain, to give all negentropy into the hands of a being which considers using those suns to light worlds to be wasteful. One universe, under Crayak, with liberty and justice for one, Aeat.

The Howlers are the other option, nature/market red in tooth and claw. They are a parody of the distributed nightmare of no control being remotely possible. They are anonymous shouting screeds, punching wildly in all directions while proclaiming that to fight back is to 'punch down'. Elimist as Bill Cipher, and the universe a howling void of anarchy and murder for all time. SSC's joke that the last post on the far future internet would be someone calling someone else a pedo made grimly literal.

At a further guess, since I'm so far out on this limb I can barely see the starting point, the Animorphs will ultimately choose V3. Their bargain with it will stand in for getting the Friendly AI's Utility Function correct, and the finale will be roughly the same as it was for the honest option in Three Worlds Collide. "They all lived happily ever after."
