  “It means that it's wrong to kill them,” I said softly. Softly, but not with any doubt. I wasn't sure why I was there, yet, but I was sure that I was there, and there was only one answer I could give to that question. “Not if there's any other way---any other way at all.”

Yes Cassie, but also no, it is wrong to kill them in an important sense but in another important sense they are doing a lot of killing and worse themselves and it is /less bad/ to kill them than not to.

The different approaches to godly manipulation are interesting.

- Helium's seems to be: you have no real control here, so "ride the wave". I guess that means roughly, try to survive, retain what resources you can, act sensibly in the short-term, but don't stay attached to your long-term plans. Taken to an extreme this might suggest never making long-term plans at all, but I don't feel like Helium would take it that far or suggest taking it that far.
- As Helium points out, Jake seems to be trying to fight for control, to keep moving forward with his plans.
- Cassie... seems to assume the Ellimist's plan is one she wants to go along with? I guess she's seen a lot less that would give her reason to think otherwise. Having assumed that, she works out what she's supposed to do based on what kind of person she is. Like, "what would I do here? I'd do X. Okay, let's do X". Which is...

In Greg Egan's /Diaspora/, there's an exchange where one character wants to convince another to do something. The other decides that the first is likely to convince ver, and goes along with the idea on that basis. Which sounds kind of weird, but also I've totally done that. ("I don't really feel like doing that." "What would it take to convince you?" "Good question. Hm. Not much, I guess. Okay, sure, let's do it.") Cassie's thought process here reminded me of that.

I feel like, if you're playing against someone who can predict your every move, the thing to do is /change what kind of pawn you are/. Your opponent isn't necessarily omnipotent - the Ellimist couldn't beat me at tic-tac-toe, and there's some number of stones handicap where he couldn't beat me at Go. (He could directly intervene to force a bad move from me, but that's fighting the metaphor and also not really beating /me/.) So you act in such a way that: given that your actions are completely predictable, in this situation and all hypotheticals; and given that your opponent is going to maximize their score; then your opponents best score is as good for you as possible.

(Oh, I guess this is basically (according to my limited understanding) functional decision theory?)

When you have no idea what the rules are or what most of the gameboard even looks like, Helium's approach feels like it's probably not optimal but a decent heuristic?
