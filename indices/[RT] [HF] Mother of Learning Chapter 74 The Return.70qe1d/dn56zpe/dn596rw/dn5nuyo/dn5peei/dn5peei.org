  he can't maintain simulacra outside while he's in a Black Room.

All the more reason to use that time to integrate the memories of what his simulacra were previously doing. Sure, he could also read books, etc, but memory-integration really does seems like a valuable use of time.

Besides the political advantages of simulacra knowing that they'll be more completely preserved, and the fact that they'll have a harder time pranking him, he might find that increased integration helps him to better absorb skills that have proved hard to transfer, [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/72/Mother-of-Learning][such as language learning]]. And he can better monitor & understand divergence, so he (and his copies) will be better prepared to avoid or adapt to it in future generations.
