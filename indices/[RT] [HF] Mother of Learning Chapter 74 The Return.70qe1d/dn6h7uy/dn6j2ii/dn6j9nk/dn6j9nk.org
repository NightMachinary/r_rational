They observe a thing, which they call a soul, which /isn't the same as the mind/ apparently, and which is clearly vulnerable to the whims of not-always-benevolent gods, I really dunno about this. The only thing we /really/ know about souls is that they are what generates mana, including a life force necessary to sustain a physical body, and that souls are only fully compatible to the bodies they grew up in. There haven't been any clear indications that there's consciousness there. It's possible that souls contain a "backup copy" of consciousness but we don't /know/ that.
