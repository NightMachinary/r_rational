That's entirely because their civilization sucks. They carefully hoard their secrets such that each mage has to do our equivalent of science from /scratch/. They don't /want/ to distribute skills and resources and power. It's vastly inefficient. I think it would be a stretch to imagine a scenario where a well put together society /couldn't/ mass produce immortality, if all it takes is a spider, a big salamander, and the skillset of a lone old witch.
