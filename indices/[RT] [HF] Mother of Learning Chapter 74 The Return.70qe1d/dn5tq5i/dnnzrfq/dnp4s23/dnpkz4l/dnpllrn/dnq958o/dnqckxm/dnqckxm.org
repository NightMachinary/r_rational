Assimilating ambient mana only takes 3 hours /max/ for someone skilled at assimilating mana. Gomulacrums take far less mana to create than normal simulacrum. I'd say the pay off is worth it.

Seeing as Zorian has smaller reserves to begin with it would bode well for him to brush up on assimilation skills.
