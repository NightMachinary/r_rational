Zorian's assimilation skills are pretty much maxed, actually. But if he spends even 30% of his time charging his simulacrum, then he only breaks even on time usage - before considering the greatly restricted range of activities available inside the black room.

Let's run some numbers on this.

If Zorian can recharge from ambient mana, zero to full, without special concentration, in [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/][about 3 hours]], and that can support 6 golacra, then each golacrum drains him at a rate that would empty him in 18 hours, without other interaction. However, souls generate enough mana ex nihilo to recharge in 9. So, on that basis, he could support two golacrums indefinitely in the black room, provided none of them used any magic. Might be worthwhile if he has a lot of reading to do, and didn't particularly need them stationed anywhere else. Also possibly worth bringing golacra inside the more efficient rooms, although that might require mind magic on the staff.

That's assuming that six golacra = passive regeneration including abundant ambient mana. If it's actually just his ex nihilo regeneration, sustainable even in dead zones, he could theoretically support 3 times more golacra under normal conditions. Seems unlikely that he would limit himselves that way though, so that's probably not accurate. On the other hand, if six golacra are only sustainable with periodic focused (ie meditating and doing nothing else) assimilation, then he might not be able to sustain any inside a black room without meditation.
