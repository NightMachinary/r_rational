Since the loops coming to a close, I think Zorian's feeling the pressure and doing everything he can to squeeze as much usefulness out of each restart as he can. The improved golems were a good idea but he still may not have taken it far enough yet considering how obscenely valuable they are. Think about it, every restart he'll now be getting like 7 or 8 months worth of activity and work done. The potency of this really can't be understated. The 3ish years left is now essentially worth 21-24 years worth of activity, this is huge. With a SINGLE innovation, he just doubled the time he has available to work with inside the loop, he just bought himself a whole DECADE, another improvement like that and it's 20 extra years worth of activity. I'm not sure Zorian understands just how significant that was since he just mentions it once and blows past it. As we draw closer to the end, further improvements will yield more diminishing returns, he really needs to focus on these golems now as a priority, the gains are monumental.

Also his research with those hired warders, diviners, alchemists, golem makers and the rest is making him an expert in half a dozen magical fields. And if he's integrating the memories of all the simulcra, it means it's not just magical expertise he's getting, it's general knowledge, experience and wisdom, with all the experts he's constantly interacting with, I expect Zorian to be less and less surprised by things and demonstrate a high degree of knowledge about basically everything more and more so from now on.
