The Bakora gates are primarily interesting because they can create stable dimensional portals /without the aid of a mage/. Golems, for example, aren't impressive due to their intelligence, but because they can act intelligently without a human puppetting their every move. So even if Zorian is able to cast the same spell the Bakora gates use, that's still a long way from making that spell into an item.

Also, it was mentioned last chapter that teleportation magic, and likely dimensionalism as a whole, is notoriously difficult to make into items. The text mentioned that the only teleportation spells that you see in items are only able to either teleport you to a pre-set location, or teleport you between two pads.
