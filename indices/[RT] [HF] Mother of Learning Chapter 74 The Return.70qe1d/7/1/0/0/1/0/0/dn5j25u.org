  Both Zorian and the Silent Doorway Adepts were ecstatic about this. For the aranea, this gate key represented access to a virgin territory awash with opportunities. For Zorian, it was a way to ensuring easy access to Koth without having to rely on Daimen. Plus, he suspected that having this key would make it much, much easier to convince the Silent Doorway Adepts to cooperate with him in future restarts.

Here Zorian says it himself.

Remember Zorian needs to find other keys too and one of them is in Blantyrre. He can reach Blantyrre in One month time but hardly so. He will have one or two day left after reaching Blantyrre and 2 days are not enough to find the key, hence he will search for Bakora Gate instead and acquire the Gate key, so that he can reach there at the start of the Timeloop.
