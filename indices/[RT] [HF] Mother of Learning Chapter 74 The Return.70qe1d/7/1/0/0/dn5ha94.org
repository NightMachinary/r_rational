Hmm. So you think that he connected to the Koth Bakora gate?

Interesting idea, but a) that would lead to some interesting conversations when Silverlake looked through it and saw what's on the other side, and b) Zorian hasn't been able to reverse-engineer the Bakora gates that thoroughly. As far as we've heard, he hasn't even been able to improve the activation ritual.
