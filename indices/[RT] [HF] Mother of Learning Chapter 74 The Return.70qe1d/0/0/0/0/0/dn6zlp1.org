Uh, I hate to break this to you, but old people have a LOT of sex. Your not wanting to think about it doesn't make it true. [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derrick-y-mcdaniel/sex-and-seniors-stds-a-ne_b_9619778.html][STD]] rates for the elderly (especially in retirement homes) are pretty damn high.

There are romantic relationships without sex, sure, but I don't see Silverlake or Quatach wanting one. And most of those relationships still have cuddling, kissing, etc, which a lich just can't do.

She's a hermit in the middle of the forest, in a pocket plane /by choice./ He's an animated pile of bones high up in his country's ruling class.

If they wanted a relationship, they'd have one.
