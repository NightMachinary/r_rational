I don't remember exactly, but it was in a context that I was reasonably sure it referred to Tengwar. (Maybe it was a note written on paper.) I'd forgotten about the Cirth at the time, though, so I suppose it might actually have meant those. Whoops!

It might be just a translation thing. Or I might be objecting over nothing. It's a somewhat pedantic distinction that only a language nerd would care about, but we all know Tolkien was the biggest of those.

As a native English speaker, and a language nerd, I understand "rune" primarily to mean a symbol that looks like it's from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark][Futhark]], and was probably invented to be carved with a chisel, not written with a pen. Their shape reflects this: Straight lines, sharp angles, few strokes. In Middle-Earth, that would include the Cirth and all later modifications like the Angerthas, but not the Tengwar. As far as I know, this is always what Tolkien meant by "rune".

"Rune" also has a common secondary sense, where it refers to any symbol that has an obscure meaning or is hard to identify, especially if it is associated with magic. This would include the Tengwar for most readers, though it wouldn't for the characters--the Tengwar are just ordinary letters for them. There's also a third, least common sense where "rune" can just mean any letter or symbol.

Of course, maybe the letters in question actually were [[http://www.dafont.com/tengwar-noldor.font][Tengwar runes]].
