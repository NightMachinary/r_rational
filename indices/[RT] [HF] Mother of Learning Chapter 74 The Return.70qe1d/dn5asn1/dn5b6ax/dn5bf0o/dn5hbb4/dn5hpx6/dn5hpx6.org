Yeah, but "potion of eternal youth" might - in fact, probably does - just refer to what Silverlake has. The phrase "halt their aging" was mentioned in the same paragraph, and "becoming unaging" was used later in the conversation. "Youth" is a relative term, after all; I can easily see "endless youth" simply meaning "you don't change as you get older".

I doubt that the original potion did two jobs, stopping aging /and/ restoring the body to a healthier, effectively younger state. Achieving one would be hard enough.
