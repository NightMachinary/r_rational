  I can't believe I overlooked the giant salamander all this time when looking into Silverlake.

Well, it makes sense that it's important to the story, but it would also have made sense if it were simply a mundanely valuable ingredient. Remember, the whole area around Silverlake's cottage was "suspiciously picked-clean". She might well have stepped out to retrieve it even if it were for regular potions.

So don't feel bad about missing it :)

  the fact that he's getting souls sight in addition to everything else is sending up a huge number of red flags

Really? I've expected it for ages. It's a perfect complement to his skill set.

  I have a feeling Silverlake might not exactly react well when they confront her with proof of the time loop
#+end_quote

I have a feeling she can be /fantastically useful/ if she believes the loop exists and is motivated to do something about it. She wants out? Great, she can help them retrieve Key pieces! She wants continuity across loops? OK, temporary markers are speculated to be governed by the crown; if she has ideas for taking down QI, they'll be happy to listen.

Whatever she wants to get from the loop, I'm pretty sure it will align with ZZ's goals and they'll be more than happy to cooperate.
