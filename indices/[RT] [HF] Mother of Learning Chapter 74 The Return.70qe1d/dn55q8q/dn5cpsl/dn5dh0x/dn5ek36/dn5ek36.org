  You only really need soul sight for tinkering with other souls, which is generally a red flag.

You can use it to /help/ other souls. That's how Kael and Alanic were able to inform Zorian about his marker.

  If she wants to survive, she might see them as an obstacle

I don't see that. They already want to find a way for multiple people to exit. If they find it, I expect they'd be happy to share. If they don't find it, or if they can't share - well, she doesn't even have a soul marker, she wouldn't be able to access the Gate. Rather than being an obstacle, they're her best shot.
