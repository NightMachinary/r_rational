Is there? Can you actually look at your own soul with your eyes? It's likely inside you, after all.

Also, I think soul sight is an additional sense, separate from eyes, much like mind-sense.

From what Alanic has told Zorian in the past, I doubt this will help his personal soul sight at all, save by perhaps letting him practice seeing other people's souls.

His personal soul sight is good enough to discern all the details of the marker, after all.
