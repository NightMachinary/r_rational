"it's a miracle you got this far with such an awful work ethic" I died at this line. He is pretty much defined by his work ethic, he has 6 versions of himself working on 5 different things at the same time. Also silverlake is actually a super mage, what a surprise. This chapter is actually incredibly significant, silverlake is leagues above basically every other mage they have encountered and having her is a teacher is great. Also did he mention kael this loop?
