Thanks for posting it! I just finished reading through it in English, and that post is how I discovered it. [[/u/jaghataikhan]], if you check it out, make sure to get the second translation; it's what I read, and various sources say it's a large improvement over the first.

I had a few minor issues with the text that I presume were translational. It was odd, for instance, to see Elvish "runes" (as opposed to "script" or "letters", or just "Tengwar") mentioned by someone with enough Tolkien lore to mention specific Valar by name. Overall, I found it to be quite readable. I will note though, that it felt very Russian, from the implied worldview all the way down through minor turns of phrase. I'm glad the translator preserved the story's Russian character, but it has a different flow than natively-written English work that I guess could be disorienting.

I quite liked it in the beginning, but like the commenter on the other thread, I found it much less interesting once it became a spy thriller. I enjoy spy thrillers in general; I think the issue here was partly that I wasn't expecting it, and partly that the spy thriller aspect depended on a lot of very minor details happening very far from the main plot. Agents and agencies are hard for me to keep straight when the geopolitical context is fantasy and the story I really care about is 3000 miles from the one I'm reading. Still, I enjoyed it a lot more than I didn't.
