I think I disagree on that one.

First of all it immortality separates them from nearly everyone else and allows a mindset of "we against the rest of the world".

The next thing is that in order to acquire immortality one needs to have a specific type of personality, because one needs to be dedicated enough to reach this goal in one lifetime.

Although ZxZ have the first property and I can imagine Zorian without the time loop could have reached immortality Zach does not have the right personality for it.
