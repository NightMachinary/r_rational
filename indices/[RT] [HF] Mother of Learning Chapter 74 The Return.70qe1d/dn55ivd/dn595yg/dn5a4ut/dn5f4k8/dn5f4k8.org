That being said, "we both are immortal" isn't a very good foundation for a romantic relationship. Basically all it means is that they have no other options. No one else is in their league, and everyone else will die anyway. Mere longevity isn't enough for romantic compatiblity, but in this case it rules out all the other options. Kinda sad actually.
