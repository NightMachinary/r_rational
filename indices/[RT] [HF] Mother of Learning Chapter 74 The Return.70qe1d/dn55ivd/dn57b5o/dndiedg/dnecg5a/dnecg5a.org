Depends on how it works. Enhancement rituals were mentioned, which tie magical abilities to your life force, a part of your soul. While I'm not too clear on the details, that should carry over between restarts. If the agelessness potion makes you ageless by affecting your life force or some other aspect of your soul, it should be permanent. Similarly, I kinda doubt that Zorian plans to barter for the soul sight potion every restart.

It could work as an epilogue thing, but I think it works better as one of his minor projects that he does to take a break from training. Similar to learning more about Taiven, taking care of Kirielle (sp?), letting Kael advance his medical alchemy, and plenty of other projects that have little or nothing to do with escaping the time loop or dealing with the invasion. It doesn't particularly benefit from the time loop compared to other projects, so it's hardly a priority, but I think it would add some nice world building and characterization.
