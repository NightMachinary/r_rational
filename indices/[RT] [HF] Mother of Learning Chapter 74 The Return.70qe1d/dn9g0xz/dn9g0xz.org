I know this is mostly unrelated, but I'm thinking of introducing a friend to this book. I know that the first four chapters are really important, but I'm thinking of making my friend skip them, just because the world building can be hard to push through if you aren't already invested in the story. What should I do? My friend's into fantasy/mystery sort of stuff, so MoL fits the bill pretty well. I just don't know how to go about getting her to try it. As a side note, one of her favourite series of all time is called 'Skullduggery Pleasants', if that helps with anything. She does also like Harry Potter, but I'm not quite sure how well HP translates into MoL since they are both incredibly different from each other. It's kinda stupid to ask the rational reddit about skipping the core worldbuilding chapters, but I'm genuinely asking about your own experiences. Do you think it's smarter to read the first four chapters after reading up to around chapter 20+? Or should one just read from the start?
