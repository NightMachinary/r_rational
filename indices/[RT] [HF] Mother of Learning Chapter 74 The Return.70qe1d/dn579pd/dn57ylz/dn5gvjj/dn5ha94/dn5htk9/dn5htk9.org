Remember Zorian teaches the Dimensional Gate spell to Damien because he couldn't always send a Simulacrum to Koth in time. He hated the idea of depending to Damien so much and that's why he traveled to Koth with Silent Doorway Spiders to get a Key from the Koth Gate, so ultimately he wouldn't need to depend on anybody and could open the gate himself.
