To be fair, immortality and beyond that eternal youthfulness seems like it requires immense resources and skills. Silverlake isn't exactly a slouch, and she has only achieved the first part of that over more than a hundred years.

It's possible that the reagents are nigh-unique, and that there's a degree of luck involved in the alchemy. I doubt that every one of the Immortal Eleven achieved their immortality through the exact same method.
