The author said in a comment (to me, on the wordpress blog, now that I think on it) that the immortality potion is not generic, it needs to be custom made for the individual(s) drinking it, and the implication is that incredibly talented and driven mages spend their lifetimes to come up with it (and, I extrapolate, sometimes fail). It sounds like it's not really trade secrets, it definitely doesn't sound like Silverlake's keeping her potion a secret to make more money off it.

I do, however, agree that the culture of secrecy that still prevails around magecraft in the world is immoral (the story even makes a point that the requirement of shared magical knowledge is a huge part of the success and advancement of the modern world); and also that if many people actively pooled knowledge and resources for it, readily available generic unaging-ness potions or rituals would be more possible though.
