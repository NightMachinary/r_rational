I don't disagree with any of this (though note that at the least, the average person at least strongly believes that the soul contains a record of their mind's history as well as their body's; plus, the simulacrum spell is described as making its copy mind and body from the soul, not direct from mind or body); but I don't think it necessarily takes away from thrawnca's defense of the average Altazian's blase attitude towards immortality existing but its method being a secret: whatever flaws in it, their evidence that they will experience continuity after death is still much stronger than, eg, that of a religious person on Earth.
