We also know that souls appear to be indestructible. Which affects the immortality calculations. And until a few centuries ago, the gods were definitely present. The world is still adapting to their absence.

It's all very well to say "The gods aren't always benevolent" (although it's a bit arrogant to suppose that we're smart enough and experienced enough to be reliable judges of that), but the fact remains, trying to resist their plans or fight against them would seem futile and foolish to most ordinary citizens.
