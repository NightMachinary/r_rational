Great chapter!

I'm not sure I quite get why Silverlake wants her youth restored as much as she does, though. She doesn't seem physically incapable, and she's basically a hermit. Who's even going to see her?

Plus, it's hard to imagine her personality carrying the same authority coming from a twenty-something.
