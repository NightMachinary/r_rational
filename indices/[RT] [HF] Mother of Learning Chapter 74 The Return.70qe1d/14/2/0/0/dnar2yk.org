  the government would probably hunt empaths for spies giving them ample employment opportunities.

I think you are overly optimistic - as an example CIA case officers admission requirements are pretty high. So I doubt that many of empaths could make a cut. And what do think would be done to those who don't?

But that's not even main issue with mind magic. The main issue with it is that the more people know and use it the less useful it becomes. If you alone in the world capable of mind magic - you are golden. If 1% people capable of using mind magic and 5% people can defend against it, its pretty useful. If 10% capable of it and 50% can defend against it, then it almost useless.

That's why I believe that there is no good way to make mind magic more widespread - the more people know about it, the less useful it becomes, the less people make effort to learn it.
