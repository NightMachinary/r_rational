  most mages know how to defend themselves against normal mind magic

No. The way to defend against mind magic is having sturdy enough mind defence to notice intrusion (think Xvim), and call law enforcement or use mind blank if you are in fight.

Considering that Silverlake knows how to make immortality potion, I doubt that age would become issue for Zorian.
