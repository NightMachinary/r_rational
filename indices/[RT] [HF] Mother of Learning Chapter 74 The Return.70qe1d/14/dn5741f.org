I really hope that Zorian begins recording some of the things that he learns, specifically the mind magic stuff. He mentioned a long time ago about wanting to write a book about human mind magic, and considering how far he has advanced it would be a good project for when he has downtime.

Think about how difficult it was to get an actual education from the aranea. He had to barter for actual years in order to get to the point he is at right now, and their mind magic knowledge is hardly centralized in a single convenient location. Any human mind mage is, right now, almost completely shit out of luck if they don't happen to either make friends with an aranean web, or are born into the right noble house. It's a huge branch of magic that their society just hasn't been able to explore because they can't get off the ground in exploring it.

Even if Zorian left out the more invasive branches of mind magic, which frankly it doesn't fare well in compared to other schools of magic, it would be incredibly useful. I mean, who wouldn't want to learn how to keep perfect memories, or be able to sense other life forms regardless of invisibility or intervening walls? Combined with those telepathic relays, it's an instant communication vector with near unlimited distance.

There's also the more mundane things that Zorian has learned that deserve to be recorded. That shielding spell seems super useful if you have the requisite shaping skills. And he's also commissioned various projects in the fields of alchemy and golem making that would be incredibly costly to develop outside of the time loop. What government wouldn't pay for a flashbang grenade that briefly incapacitates Grey Hunters? Not everyone is concerned with keeping parts of it intact.
