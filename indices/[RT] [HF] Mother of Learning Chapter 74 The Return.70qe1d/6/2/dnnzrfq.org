Interesting side effect of his golacrum breakthrough: it's now more efficient for him /not/ to use the weakest Black Room. Having seven Zorians for a day can likely achieve more than one Zorian for five days, plus it cuts down on travel. And a wider variety of activities are available. And he has less risk of going crazy.

Zach would still benefit from the Black Room though.
