Also, this isn't a typo, but something that didn't quite fit: If it took an hour to remove the egg sack, why didn't the crystal essence convert the entire spider and the eggs within that time?

Best explanation I can think of is that there's a limit on how much biological material a given quantity of crystal essence can convert? And the impact point was a good distance away from the eggs, so the conversion didn't reach that far.
