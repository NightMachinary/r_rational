most mages know how to defend themselves against normal mind magic, mind blank is the ultimate anti mind magic spell but it is suspected to have side effects if you keep it up all the time.

most people simply don't bother, do you put on a bulletproof vest everyday just because you might get shot?

but yes being the king of mind magic is probably better than writing a book about it, at least until he's so old it does not really matter any more.
