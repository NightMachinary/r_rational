  I really hope that Zorian begins recording some of the things that he learns, specifically the mind magic stuff. He mentioned a long time ago about wanting to write a book about human mind magic, and considering how far he has advanced it would be a good project for when he has downtime.

Personally I would try to avoid spending time on anything that wasn't skill advancing until: 1. you have all keys and have successfully left the time loop. 2. you've achieved /at least/ a potion of non-aging like Silverlake if not also the potion of eternal youth.

Once those two things are done you have all the time in the world to achieve whatever goals make you happy, but anything before that is potentially a waste of your chance to ever get them.
