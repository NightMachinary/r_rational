  A city isn't thinking big enough.

The disaster this story is about, which is what I was trying to allude to, goes well beyond the destruction of a single city that I used as an example. All-out nuclear war is about the right scale.

And preparing deliberately for that scenario is not something that I mentioned at all. It wouldn't even make sense for them to try, since the coming disaster is not one that most people are aware of. That doesn't change the fact that people who do develop those skills for other reasons will have an advantage, and those skills will proliferate more readily than more interdependent ones if society does collapse.

I'm also skeptical of how well your comparison to nuclear war works when we're talking about a pre-industrial civilization. We have cars, planes, telecommunications technology. If civilization survives to any degree anywhere in the world, then the remnants of our organizational infrastructure will be able to access and support any other part of the world in a timely manner. That isn't true here. Aside from a minuscule minority of individuals capable of teleportation, transportation takes place at a walking pace or by train or sailing ship. If there is a collapse of the government, and the accompanying inability to effectively police trade routes to keep them even sort of safe from both criminals and monsters, then isolated provinces staying isolated for years or for generations is a thing that could actually happen. Besides which, this world demonstrably has had more advanced civilizations in the past which have failed.
