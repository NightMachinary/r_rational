  I don't want to say much about the Immortal Eleven at this time, but they are a group of eleven mages (duh) that created and drank a potion of eternal youth. They're not really immortal, but they will never die from old age. (People who have found a way to halt their aging without becoming undead are called immortals in the setting.)

Author in his world building blog answered this in comments. Silverlake hasn't achieved Youth yet, so she isn't part of the Immortal Eleven.
