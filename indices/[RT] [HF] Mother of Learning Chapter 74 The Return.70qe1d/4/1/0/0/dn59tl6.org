Well, it's probably a useful field of research for Zorian anyway. Better, more responsive golems = good. It's just that the simulacrums /living/ in those golems put a higher priority on that direction of research than the original would.

At least he'll get unbeatably high-quality feedback on each attempted improvement :).
