Wait a second.

Each simulacrum has a running mana cost to maintain its magical brain, plus a cost to maintain its body - negated by putting it in a physical golem form - plus whatever mana it spends on spells.

But mind magic is really quite cheap. It just takes concentration.

And a single Zorian has shown the ability to smoothly control a squad of six mindless golems.

So, the army size is at least 1 original + /n/ simulacrum-golem (golacrum?) generals, plus 6 * (/n/ + 1) regular-golem infantry, where /n/ is the number of simulacra he can maintain. Currently 48 golems plus one human. Probably each Zorian can manage more than six subordinates if the commands are simple.
