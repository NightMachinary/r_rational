Imagine if your body suddenly became creaky, unresponsive and unreliable. That's essentially what the simulacrum experience when they're created; going from a perfectly normal human to a body that they're fully aware is artificial. Since their entire lives will be spent in these bodies, it makes perfect sense that they'd want them to be improved until they're superior to their old one.
