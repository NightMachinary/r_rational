Pretty good chapter! I see that Silverlake is actually yet another potential romance-able waifu path!

Some errors I found.

Their skills have grown, they have become intimately familiar with the grey hunter's capabilities and they have brought a number of surprises designed specifically to counter it.

All of those "have"s should be "had", because it should be past tense.

it shook of the stun effect 

Missing an f there.

The bullets were filled the distilled essence

Missing a "with"

before they can track down its corpse

"can" should be "could" because past tense

Then again, the grey hunter did mangle one of the simulacrums

"did mangle" should be "had mangled"; tense inconsistency

sought out to original

"to" should be "the"

He was the one that shot the grey hunter!

"shot" should be "had shot"

Well, he and number three, but number three ended up being killed by the grey hunter's last hurrah.

"ended" should be "had ended"

He totally earned this and was not taking no for an answer.

"totally earned" should be "had totally earned"

"We have come to trade!" Zach said in an equally cheery tome, undaunted by her wariness.

"tome" should be "tone"

Everything you gain will be done at the end of this month, 

I think that "done" should be "undone"?

"It not possible for me to absorb your pocket dimension creation skills in less than a month.

"It not" should be "It's not"

which is why Zorian couldn't find it

"is" should be "was"; tense inconsistency

It had been five days since then, and thus far Silverlake was keeping to her side of the deal. 

"was" should be "had been"

Zorian was afraid

"was" should be "had been"

Silverlake did basically rope him into helping her with her alchemy

"did basically rope" should be "had basically roped"

Seems to be a lot of tense inconsistencies, with a noticeable lack of past participle usage. Should probably work on that.
