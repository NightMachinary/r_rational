Just looked up Skulduggery Pleasant, and it sounds rather...violent. And dark.

Perhaps she should try reading Worm? Also gets dark and violent, and it's LONG, but very well written. I stopped about halfway, when the medical scenes got a bit much, but someone who liked Skulduggery would probably keep going.
