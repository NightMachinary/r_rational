Definitely from the start. MoL builds so much on the initial details; it basically revolves around the sense of progression and unfolding mysteries via time loop. I'd say just give a gushy recommendation tailored to what you already know about what she likes. or, uh, stretch the truth and mention a train ride to school...

I've recommended a lot of books to friends and it usually comes down how I sell it. Enthusiasm is contagious, but a healthy dose of pessimism is recommended. Sometimes they just don't like it or can't muster the initiative to start it. Pester them with how good it is, send them an e-book version, or make a tactical retreat to try later when they're complaining of boredom.
