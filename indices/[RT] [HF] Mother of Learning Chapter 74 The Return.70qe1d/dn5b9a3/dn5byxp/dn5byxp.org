It's not just a joke, either; it's a real danger.

Still, I'm not sure what the simulacra would demand. If Zorian /had/ a way to give them continuity across loops, he'd do it; it would save him a lot of time and expensive materials rebuilding their golem bodies.

They already get to package up whatever memories are most important to them and merge them back into the original. Zorian could maybe use Black Room time to integrate a bit /more/, but ultimately he won't be able to completely integrate them all. So there's room for some negotiation there, perhaps, if it's important to them, but not cause for a rebellion.

They can already influence research priorities to do things like making better golems for themselves.

Maybe there could be a conflict if simulacra demand the ability to overwrite (and thus effectively possess) living hosts, the original refuses, and they go to war to modify him so he'll let them? They would have to diverge significantly from his morals for that to arise, though, and they only get a month to do it - less, if the initial golem-crafting takes a while.
