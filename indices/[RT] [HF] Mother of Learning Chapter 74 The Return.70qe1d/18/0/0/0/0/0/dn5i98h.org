This reminds me of the Poem [[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45389/tithonus][Tithonus]]. The Mortal who asked for Immortality from his Goddess Lover but forgot to ask for Immortal Youth and lived his life strapped to bed because he was too weak and old to even stand up or raise his hand.

In a sense to be able to roam and be active is an example of youth itself. So maybe you are right. Youth is a relative term, let's see what the author has in store for us. I think sooner or later the Immortal Eleven will show up in the story and we will find out for sure.
