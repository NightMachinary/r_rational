  I wonder if Zach can drink a potion of soul sight

Considering it brings you to the brink of death...probably. He can't actually die without a reset, but he can probably get away with near-death.

Whether he'll want it - harder to say. It would help speed up his soul awareness, certainly, since he can't take Alanic's accelerated training option, and thus it would make him much more effective against QI. But he might be more persuaded by Alanic's warnings about the moral hazards.
