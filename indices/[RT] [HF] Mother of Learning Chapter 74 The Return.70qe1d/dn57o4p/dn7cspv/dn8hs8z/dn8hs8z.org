That is certainly an interesting idea. Silverlake probably focused on the salamander because they're plentiful, weak, and good enough for her purposes, but the hydra's regeneration is certainly much stronger. With a salamander-based potion, your body could undo wrinkles etc, but with a hydra-based potion, you could probably regrow severed limbs. With enough mana.
