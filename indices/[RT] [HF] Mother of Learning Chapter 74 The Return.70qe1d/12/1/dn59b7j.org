The position of animals change every restart, based on minute changes. In that one restart, Zorian had fairly heavily influenced the ecosystem by steadily hunting silver wolves and collecting alchemical ingredients throughout the forest. The changes to the flora from his gathering could have changed the locations of any number of small animals who rely on those ingredients, or his mere presence could have chased them away to other areas, and killing the wolves made several other areas safe because of a lack of predators.

The knowledge of the location of the salamander in that one restart is not reliable information. And besides, we don't have any confirmation that that salamander was the proper size and age; simply that it was desirable enough to Silverlake to have her show herself to a talented baby mage she knew was looking for her. We also know that she is interested in collecting smaller samples as well, after all. But we do know from Zorian's impression of her two samples that the one he previously encountered was a larger specimen.
