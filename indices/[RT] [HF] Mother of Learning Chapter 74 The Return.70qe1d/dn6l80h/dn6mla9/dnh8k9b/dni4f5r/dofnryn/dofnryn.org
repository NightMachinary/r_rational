If the salamanders' ability to form two complete entities through a perfect division extended to the soul with a similar "budding off", it would be interesting to see a mage/witch make a potion to replicate the effect potentially discovering a way to have a permanent simulacrum. If that person was also a mind mage they could then potentially form a permanent mental/soul link/fusion with the simulacrum. Repeat that enough times and you'd end up with a cranium rat-like hivemind, or, if the mind melding was done quickly and seamlessly enough by exploiting the properties of simulacra, something potentially even scarier.
