I still feel that there's more story behind those 6 months of incapacitation. As far as we know, the loop doesn't have a mechanism for simply not creating a physical body, at least with all the soulkilled arenea and mercenaries. They just show up dead at the beginning of the loop. Obviously, this doesn't work for Zach, since a dead Zach equals a restart. A coma seems the most likely explanation, but it's not entirely clear why his caretaker would cover up the fact, and his recovery in Zorian's 8th loop only took him about a day and a few good meals. I feel like if something took his soul entirely out of commission for 6 months then it should have had longer lasting side effects beyond that. Basically, I still suspect some sort of foul play from RR during that period.
