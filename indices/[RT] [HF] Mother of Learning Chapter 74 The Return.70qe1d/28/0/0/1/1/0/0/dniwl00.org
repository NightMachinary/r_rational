It's not a preferred method, but it's a very vicious and effective one. Simply damaging a soul can potentially be healed or recovered from in time, but if you splice multiple souls together the victim (or whoever decides to help them) will first have to find a way to untangle the mess before they can fully recover...

In all honesty, QI didn't need to go through all that trouble - at his level of skill, simply mutilating Zach's soul the old-fashioned way would have been irrecoverable - but he wanted to be thorough and make a point.
