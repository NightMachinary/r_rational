Based on his comments, QI thought that Zach had bound his soul to a phylactery, though he was still in his human body. I guess that would have made Zach kind of a pre-lich?

If that were correct, then mutilating his soul would indeed wreck Zach quite effectively. As it was, only the marker contingencies saved him, and he was incapacitated for over six months. QI is smart.
