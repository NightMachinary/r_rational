Maybe not essential, but it felt to me like he was placing more value in external soul perception this chapter than any time in the past. I'm just wondering if some time in the past 9 restarts they developed a plan or made a discovery that made it more important to spend their finite time and less finite resources on obtaining it. Being able to study Zach's marker sounds like a pretty good possibility. I know you're not a fan of my Zorian soul merging theory, which I think benefit from soul perception as well.

And it's odd that they're only trying to get a potion for Zorian at the moment, unless they're sure it cause a restart if Zach consumed it, since it's apparently a more extreme version of the ritual Alanic did. But the Marker has different activation thresholds for different things, e.g. unstructured vs structured mind magic, so I think it should still be worth a try.

In the past I thought that soul perception fell under the category of enhancements that consume mana reserves, but this chapter made me change my mind. This chapter phrased it as being a natural part of every soul that's just normally sealed in its lower level of efficacy. If there is a cost to reserves, I think it would be under 1 magnitude.
