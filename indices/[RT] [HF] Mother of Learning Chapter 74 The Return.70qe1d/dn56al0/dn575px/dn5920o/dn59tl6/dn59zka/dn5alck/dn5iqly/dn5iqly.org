While true, increasing numbers of golems only give any real benefit up to a point. Golems are basically melee fighters and that's it. They're useful for soaking up damage, and overpowering some types of strong magical creatures. They aren't mages, and rarely have any ranged attacks at all. For Zorian, he needs all the mana he can get, and sinking all of it into better golem control is a waste for a mage of his caliber. He is far more adaptable, deadly, and overall efficient using his mana for spells.

That said, I wonder how well he could cast spells if he had multiple copies of himself to work with? Ritual spells and general group casting are things he has never really focused on, at least partly because he's more concerned with personal power rather than group effectiveness, but he could get really good results if he had multiple mages with extremely good mana shaping skills focused on a single spell. Probably not terribly useful in combat, but an interesting avenue to explore.
