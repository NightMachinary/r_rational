  Golems are generally noted to be expensive, and I imagine making them with enough dexterity and intelligence to hit a target with a gun is even more so.

Fortunately expense is not a real issue for ZZ :). Yes, mercenaries are much easier and cheaper, and he'll probably still use them, but don't underestimate the knockout punch of nearly 50 soldiers working with perfect synchronisation and no fear.

Note that the golacrums could also go kamikaze by drawing on ambient mana without limit. Normally this is just a fancy (but almost unblockable) way to commit suicide, as the foreign energy rapidly destroys your vital organs, but with a durable golem body, they could probably accumulate rather spectacular amounts of energy before they finally break down.

Hey, I wonder whether Zorian could design golems that would allow simulacra to swap between them? So if one of the golacrums gets in trouble, it can jump to another body.
