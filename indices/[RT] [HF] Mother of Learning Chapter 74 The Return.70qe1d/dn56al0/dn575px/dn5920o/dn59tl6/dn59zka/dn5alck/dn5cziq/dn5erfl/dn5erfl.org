And then, with soul sight, Zorian will be able to [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/golems-and-undead/#comment-148][create a simulacrum of Zach]].

Of course, lacking mind magic, Zach should probably go for quality over quantity. He wouldn't be able to achieve the same benefits from a swarm, and splitting his mana reserves so many ways would actually work against him.

But you /know/ he'll want to upload himself to a [[http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Metal_Unit][giant battle robot]] :).

ETA Assuming, of course, that he can get past his fear of allowing Zorian to access his mind. Which I presume is necessary to create a simulacrum.
