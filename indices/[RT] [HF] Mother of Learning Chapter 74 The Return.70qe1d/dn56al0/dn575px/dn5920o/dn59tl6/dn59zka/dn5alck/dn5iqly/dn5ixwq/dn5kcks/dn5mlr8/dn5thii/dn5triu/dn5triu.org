The [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/][world building blog]] has discussed the effect of raw mana on undead, and simulacra are similar, especially the new tsuchi bunshin. Their bodies are likely tough enough to take it, but their minds are still vulnerable to poisoning, causing death with severe acute use or insanity with chronic use.

Given that all the simulacra are master mind mages, the risk of them going rogue would be unacceptable except in a dire emergency. And given that they inherit Zorian's strong sense of self-preservation, they won't be keen on anything so self-destructive.
