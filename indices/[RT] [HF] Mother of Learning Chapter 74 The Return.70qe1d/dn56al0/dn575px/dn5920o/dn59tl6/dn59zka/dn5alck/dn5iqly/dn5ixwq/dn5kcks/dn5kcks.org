Thanks for the link. It seems like they have mostly been used in melee roles aside from the infiltration on Sudomir's mansion. I'm primarily thinking of the various assaults on the Ibasan force below Cyoria. Maybe it's simply easier to hire mercenaries to throw grenades and fire guns than it is to build a golem accurate enough to trust to do so? Golems are generally noted to be expensive, and I imagine making them with enough dexterity and intelligence to hit a target with a gun is even more so. Although that's still useful if they need to do some covert stuff where hiring mercenaries or any outside parties is inadvisable.
