I don't think that [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] has ever mentioned what the effect of simulacrum using ambient mana would be, or why they don't use it more often. Even if they're copies and care about their lives, they should still recognize that they are temporary existences working to achieve a common goal, and that damage to their bodies and the slight mental damage they take would have little to no effect on the original while potentially allowing them to reach certain goals much more optimally.
