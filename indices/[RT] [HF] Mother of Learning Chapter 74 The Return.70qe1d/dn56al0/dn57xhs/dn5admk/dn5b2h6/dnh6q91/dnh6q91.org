One issue: I'm under the impression that mind packets take longer to read as their size increases. If the "patch" to get Non-Loop!Zorian up to speed is similar in that respect, it may be too slow a process.

Perhaps, though, a carefully abbreviated mind packet would be convincing enough. I like your theory.
