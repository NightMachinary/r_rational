I feel that might actually exacerbate the problem. If you have information that needs to be placed in packet, some portion of the mind packet is probably organizational information and other boilerplate data to just make it unravel smoothly for the packet reader. Splitting that up only smaller packets may just increase the redundant boilerplate data needed to make each lancet function correctly. This boilerplay data may indeed be negligible though . . .

Either way, I overlooked the fact that even if Zorian can send out data packets, non-loop Zorian would have no idea how to read them. He may not even realize he's received anything at all.
