It was explained by the snake spirit and in a few other moments of exposition.

The Gate didn't draw everyone's soul into it, only the one meant to be looping ("The Controller", presumably Zach). At that same moment, it made an exact copy of everything else in the world (and maybe beyond), including the souls. Each reset, everything is put back the way it was at the beginning, even resetting the souls of the non-loopers. The Aranea had been marked to not have their souls reset, so it looks like they turned into soulless husks.

This won't affect the original Aranea at all, though, so Zorian may be able to see them again.

This all boils down to Zorian being a duplicate soul created by the Gate, while Zach is an original.
