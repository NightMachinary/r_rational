Ha! I think you're right.

If this were a fanfiction (where things tend to be simpler), Zorian might replace or merge with his original soul, but that's /hard/, especially considering how he isn't even merging with his simulcrum instances. The difference is how the magic in this universe is defined as being really hard. It's one of the reasons why I love this story so much.
