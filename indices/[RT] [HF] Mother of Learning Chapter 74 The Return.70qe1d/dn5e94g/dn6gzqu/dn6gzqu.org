  After all, if some disaster were to strike which sabotaged the nation's infrastructure, say by blowing up a city, alchemy would be driven out and the surviving alchemists would be forced to revert to potion-making. I wonder if something similar would happen to mages in general without access to advanced spells and knowledge of the kind stored in the Academy Library.

A disaster big enough to destroy infrastructure on that scale would destroy society as a whole. A city isn't thinking big enough.

Most people would be dead in that case, so who cares to prepare for it? It's like seriously preparing for all-out nuclear war in real life. Yeah, you /can/ do that, but if you feasibly prepare enough to matter, you'll bankrupt yourself, have little time to learn skills actually relevant in modern society, and still likely won't survive if disaster strikes.
