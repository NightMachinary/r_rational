  He was a brand new type of simulacrum that the original had thought up recently -- instead of being embodied into an ectoplasmic shell like a regular simulacrum, he had been attached to a real matter golem body designed to mimic the original. This was a step up from the base spell in just about every regard, granting him vastly increased durability and halving his maintenance cost at the same time.

I haven't read anything else in this update yet, but I need to comment on this before continuing. Remember when Zorian was told that the Simulcrum spell is step 1 in becoming a lich? Attaching part of your soul to a physical object after you've separated it out from your mortal body really, really sounds like step 2.

I've had my suspicions about that particular plotbunny since it first showed up, and I still think it's going to be part of the solution to how Zorian will smuggle his soul out of the simulation, so it's interesting to see that thread progressed a bit right at the start of the chapter.

Further comments after actually reading the thing:

  "You're trying to stave off death from old age?" Zach asked, surprised. "Wow. That's an incredibly advanced skill. I heard from Zorian you were a master alchemist, but I didn't know you were that good."

  "Silly boy," Silverlake chuckled. "I'm not trying to stave off old age. I already have that."

Kinda figured she'd be older than naturally possible. But I will also point out that this means the odds of Zorian ever growing old are basically zero if he gets out of this mess intact. I figured he'd be set anyway, because I'm still betting on the lich thing, but now that he actually knows and has contact with someone who has already solved the problem with alchemy, it makes a nice backup plan.

  As for the contents of the inner layer, it consisted of three things: a nice, luxurious two-story house, an expansive herb garden full of rare magical plants and a heavily warded alchemical workshop where she did most of her work.

  Yes, a powerful witch that was clearly very proud of her traditions and made distinctions between alchemy and 'potion making' had a fully quipped alchemical workshop that would be familiar to any conventional alchemist out in the major cities. Zorian couldn't help but find that a little amusing.

I would pretend to be surprised, but I have met at least one amish person and/or native american before. The myth of the noble savage is a great way to con people, but it turns out most people are people with the same wants and needs as other people, and are perfectly happy to take advantage of ways to fulfill those needs easily. Guess we'll have to just be glad she doesn't have a casino in there.

  "Hmph. Shows what you know," Silverlake said. "I'm doing it this way because this is the superior option. It's good enough for the job. Doing this with a complicated alchemical setup wouldn't get stuff done any faster or give better results -- it would just inflict wear and tear on delicate equipment and be a nightmare to clean up afterwards."
#+end_quote

As an addendum to my earlier comment, while most people are just normal people, other people are /wise/ people, and these rare treasures tend to notice that even obsolete techniques occasionally do have advantages and that there are no time cops running around forcing you to choose between only traditional methods or only new technology.

Which is a shame, because it forces me to admit that maybe she wasn't just fucking with Zorian last time.

  "It's because alchemy, in its current form, requires an entire society built to enable it. Somebody has to build all the vials, containers, heaters, and other equipment. Somebody needs to grow, gather and track down the ingredients used in it. Somebody needs to transport and distribute it to those than need it... or have the right connections to use it. Somebody needs to guard the workshops full of valuable equipment from thieves and various miscreants. The old witches had access to none of that, so they had to make do with chucking things into a big iron cauldron and eyeballing things. It is, as you said, cheaper. Cheaper in terms of money and also cheaper in terms of social infrastructure needed to support it."

I'm sensing a pattern. Much the same could apply to magic in general. The whole idea of the Empire having risen to prominence principally because of an ordered and systematic approach to incorporating and disseminating all the magical lore that could be found hidden in a thousand tiny societies and forging it into an unstoppable force. No small tribal community could replicate that. You need an education system to spread literacy, you need a large and thriving empire to collect information from all over, both internally and by theft or trade from elsewhere.

It sounds like it indicates a general pattern of civilization growing and thriving through cooperation, but in light of the rest of her speech, it could also foreshadow the opposite. After all, if some disaster were to strike which sabotaged the nation's infrastructure, say by blowing up a city, alchemy would be driven out and the surviving alchemists would be forced to revert to potion-making. I wonder if something similar would happen to mages in general without access to advanced spells and knowledge of the kind stored in the Academy Library.
