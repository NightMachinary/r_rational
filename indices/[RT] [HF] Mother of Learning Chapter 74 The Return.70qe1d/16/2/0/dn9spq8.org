Alanic mentioned truth discernment involves watching for perturbations of the soul. People who have partial control of this can spoof telling the truth, which is why Alanic opted for asking Zach instead of Zorian due to Zorian's ability for soulself-reflection.

If you have soul sight, regardless if it is innate or acquired via dubious/innocuous means, I think it is safe to assume you can trick the priestess.
