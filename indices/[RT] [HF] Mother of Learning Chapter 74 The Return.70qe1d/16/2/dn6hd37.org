  Zorian is also getting sketchier and sketchier, while his morals are intact the fact that he's getting souls sight in addition to everything else is sending up a huge number of red flags.

I think it's actually pretty important that he's doing it without killing people. Not just for his morals, either.

There are a number of people who can discern truth from lies. One of those happens to be a priestess of the church most opposed to necromancy.

If Zorian can /honestly/ say he got his without killing anyone, he'll be a lot more likely to get their help.
