Brilliant! I can't believe I overlooked the giant salamander all this time when looking into Silverlake. Of course she wouldn't just open her door to some guy skulking around, she wanted half of her youth serum!

Zorian is also getting sketchier and sketchier, while his morals are intact the fact that he's getting souls sight in addition to everything else is sending up a huge number of red flags.

Also: I have a feeling Silverlake might not exactly react well when they confront her with proof of the time loop next reset. Just because she didn't believe them this time (and thus didn't have the existential crisis) doesn't mean she won't be..... troublesome with her master of soul and mind magics when unhinged.
