I don't think soul sight is a red flag at all, nor is it a /change in morals/. Remember Zorian was asking Kael about how to get soul sight clear back in the beginning. Even Alanic admitted that soul sight itself isn't immoral, and Zorian would be daft not to get it if it's possible to get ethically (as he's doing). Soul sight is only a red flag to people who don't know Zorian's story. It's something that is generally too difficult to be worth the time to get it normally, but for someone in a loop like Zorian it'd be ridiculous NOT to get it.
