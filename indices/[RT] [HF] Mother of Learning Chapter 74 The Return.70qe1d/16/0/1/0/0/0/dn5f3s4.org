She wouldn't be dumb enough to try that without learning everything she could about the marker first. If she tried, she would certainly trip the tampering switch on Zach and the loop would reset - or, if she targeted Zorian first, Zach would be free to pummel her. Assuming that she's even skilled enough in combat to take on both of them at once, so quickly that Zorian couldn't manually reset. And one thing she would quickly learn is that the marker is highly resistant to tampering and copying.

If there was actually any possibility of her duplicating the marker, her best shot at that would be to have the two of them willingly cooperate and provide her with a template. Which they would almost certainly be happy to do.

It's like when people talked about the possibility of Zorian attacking Xvim's mind once Xvim started tutoring him properly. It might be theoretically possible to do, but it's vastly less efficient than willing cooperation. And given how much ZZ could benefit from a looping Silverlake, they'd almost certainly cooperate if it were feasible.

Though I doubt it is.
