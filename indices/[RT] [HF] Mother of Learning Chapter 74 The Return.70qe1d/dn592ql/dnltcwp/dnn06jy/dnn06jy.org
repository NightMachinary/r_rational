Yes, there is a limit. After a while, the effect runs out and stops. That's why Zorian noted they managed to recover some of the spider's body for use at the end of it - only a portion of the spider's innards got converted into crystal.

Also, the eggs were separated from the main target of the crystallization's effect by a layer of carapace and the silken cocoon. They're the last thing that would be effected, and would only crystallize if the spider was pumped with enough essence to turn it completely into crystal and then some.
