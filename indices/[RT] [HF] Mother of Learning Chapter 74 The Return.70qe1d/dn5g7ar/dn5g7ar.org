That final grey hunter fight was so damn satisfying. It was a culmination of all sorts of different elements through previous chapters; the golems, the simulacrums, the hexagonal shield, the crystal ooze, and of course the magical rifles. A fantastic way to conclude a ~40 chapter long story thread.
