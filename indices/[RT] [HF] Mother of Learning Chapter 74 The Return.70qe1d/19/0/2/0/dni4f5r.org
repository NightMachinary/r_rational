Slightly spoiler-ish answer (in regards to beliefs of witches, not the plot itself), but I'll tell it anyway because I'm not sure whether I'll actually put this into the story...

The soul of the child sort of 'buds off' from the soul of the mother. At some point (quite a while before the actual birth of the child) the soul bud separates from the mother and becomes the property of the baby alone.

This is why witches believed only female children can truly continue their bloodlines. Although children clearly do inherit things from the father, to anyone observing the process with soul perception, the soul itself seems to originate from the mother alone.

The Ikosians (and most other groups) believe this only means some parts of the process are invisible to humans, even with soul perception. They cite the fact that children can inherit magical abilities from their father as their chief proof that there is more going on beneath the surface. Witches, on the other hand, placed tremendous importance to this fact. And since a person's 'soul lineage' originates solely from their female ancestors, sons are basically spiritual dead ends.

I'll stop here. I really need to turn this into a proper worldbuilding article...
