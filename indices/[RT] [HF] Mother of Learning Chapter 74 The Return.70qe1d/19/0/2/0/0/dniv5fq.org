Very interesting; and I agree that this would make for an interesting world-building post.

I'm guessing pregnancy initially boosts the mana capacity of a woman even if ever so slightly. I'm curious, though, if this means that the mana signature of one's parents is somewhat similar to one's own mana. Or might it be like blood types where there are a variety of differences and similarities, but due to the complexity of how blood works (antigens, DNA, etc.), eventually the blood of the fetus is usuallly not compatible with the mother's blood . . .

It would be interesting to conduct experiments with the mana of others to see what the makeup of personal mana is. What makes one's mana different from ambient mana? Can those differences be stripped or somewhat removed via some kind of magical filtering process? The research would not be easy to perform, I would expect, because it's morally shady. However, it would be cool if a group of friends wanted to run these experiments. Many applications would be morally shady, however I can see a group of rifle soldiers not only firing their weapons, but also acting as mana batteries for battle mages who use devices or a mage specialized in acting as a mana sieve.

Another result of your explanation is . . . the salamander situation is still unresolved, which is fine. A fetus' soul seems to grow from the mother's soul, but a body split in half? But then does the soul really reside in the body, or is the body really just a pointer to the soul? In that case, this is not an issue. This would be interesting because then both newly grown salamanders would both utilize the same soul, much like how two simulacra utilize the same soul.

Cool puzzle . . .
