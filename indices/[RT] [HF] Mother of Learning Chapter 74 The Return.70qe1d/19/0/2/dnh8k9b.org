The question of the salamander and its soul is perhaps not that different than the following related questions about birth:

When a baby is conceived in the womb, is that the point where a soul enters the cells? Does a soul come into existence upon exiting the womb? Does the soul sort of . . . pop into exist fully formed or does it develop from a tiny spark of soul into a bigger soul as the fetus develops?

The answer to these types of questions should be well-known, seeing as many a witch has obtained soul sight and has conceived a child as well as having provided pre- and post-natal care.
