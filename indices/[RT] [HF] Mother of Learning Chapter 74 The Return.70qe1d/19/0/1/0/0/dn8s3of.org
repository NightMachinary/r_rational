Souls record every experience the body has since its birth. Souls cannot be destroyed. This leaves us with 3 potential options:

If one of the bodies has the original salamander's soul, this would mean the other salamander would be considered a newborn by anyone reading its soul.

If splitting the body means that the original is dead, then both bodies would get new souls & the original soul will pass on.

If splitting a soul is possible, then both bodies get half of the original soul along with the soul record of the original salamander's experiences. Considering it is possible to splice souls together to make shifters, this seems the most likely option.
