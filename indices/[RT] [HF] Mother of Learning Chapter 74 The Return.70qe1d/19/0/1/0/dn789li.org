  Maybe Zorian can learn from them to develop more permanent bodies for his simulacrums.

There's more to consider than just that; if the soul really is duplicated by the process, then what happens with the marker? Two copies? Or a brand new, unmarked soul arrives from wherever new souls usually come from? Or the (already-damaged) marker tries to split/copy itself and breaks down?

Lots of unknowns. Observing the salamander with soul sight should be very instructive, though.
