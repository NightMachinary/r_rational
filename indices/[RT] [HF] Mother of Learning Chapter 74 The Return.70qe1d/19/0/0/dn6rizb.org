Hmm.

Well, Zorian is about to get soul sight, and probably hunt down a giant salamander, so I guess he may have the opportunity to find out. It shouldn't be hard for him to dominate it with mind magic, and Silverlake would probably be happy to have him bring her a live specimen; she can carve it up, grow two of them, and thus have more to experiment on!
