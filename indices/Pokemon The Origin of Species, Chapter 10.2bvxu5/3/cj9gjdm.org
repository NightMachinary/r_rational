Mean Look?

It's not exactly a psychic attack, but sudden disorientation and paralysing fear that takes several minutes to completely shake off would fit with "enemy pok√©mon cannot leave battle".

EDIT: Spinarak doesn't learn Mean Look. Scary Face also fits, though, and Spinarak /can/ learn Scary Face.
