Hey all, welcome back!

This chapter was a lot of fun to write, so I hope you enjoy it. I'm very glad the recent Pokemon games changed the whole "poison hurts pokemon in their pokeballs" thing, because while it created many tense moments of gameplay, it never really made any sense. If they could die to poison while in a pokeball, why wouldn't they be able to die to burns? Or bleed out? That would have been a headache to try to rationalize.

Thanks for reading, and all feedback appreciated!
