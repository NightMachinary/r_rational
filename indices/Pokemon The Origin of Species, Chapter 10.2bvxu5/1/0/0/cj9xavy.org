Well, if you want to go all the way with it:

Pokemon: A game where very young children go into dangerous wilderness with no adult supervision or protection. There, they capture wild animals and keep them trapped in tiny ball-shaped cages until the animals develop Stockholm Syndrome and come to love their captors...at which point, the kids put them in the equivalent of dogfights.

And yet, despite my snark above, I am really enjoying this story and have been waiting eagerly for the next update. I love the rational spin you put on something that (by my understanding anyway) is organized more around Rule of Cool than Rule of Logic.
