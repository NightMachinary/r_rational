I just checked Spinarak's level up movesets, and noticed that it learned Night Shade relatively early, whereas Psychic is a move only learned at level 40, at which it should be far, far too strong for Red to battle, even taking into consideration the way levels don't seem to be an actual thing in this story. Psybeam is learned through breeding, so it's possible Spinarak had that, but it's not likely as Psybeam would likely involve a beam of some sort. Additionally, the description for Night Shade matches the effects shown in the story, so it seems logical that Spinarak used Night Shade there.

Night Shade is a Ghost type move, although in the games it is a 'fixed damage' move, and thus type doesn't come into play. However, I'm assuming that you're assuming that that effect is illogical, and thus gave it a different effect, either regular Ghost type damage or Ghost type frightening with no damage.

So Red was hit by a Ghost attack. From the way you talked about it, I'd put a 65-75% chance that Red is going to develop Psychic powers during the course of the story, with the substantial chance otherwise being due to how Red took the tests (although from a story flow stance, the fact that it said the tests weren't 100% only makes it more likely) and how the main character developing Psychic powers during the story seems a bit cheap (Psychic abilities being part of the character prior to introduction would be part of the setting, as it were, but to develop them during the course of the plot with no inclination towards this path from before the plot feels like a watered-down version of the type of plot where an average ordinary person gets dragged into an extraordinary conflict due to sheer dumb luck). I'd say there's about a 5% chance it's the option that Red is extraordinarily susceptible to mental attacks, and a 20-30% chance it's just him not knowing what mental attacks feel like.

I also see that there's a wide variety of diversity in the forest. Up until now we've mainly focused on Kanto natives like Ratata and Pidgey, but now we have Spinarak and Shroomish in the forest too. It's possible this was intentional from the people in the story, to introduce new species as Red mentioned was done with Butterfree, but it's also possible that you're just making Kanto more varied than it normally is due to the fact that other regions like Johto and Sinnoh get that diversity from their games, whereas Kanto didn't.

And then there's the scene you left us on. A dozen Beedrill (VERY unlikely they can fight them off, even if Charmander fully lets loose his fire abilities), with incentive to stay in the area (the flowers), and a natural instinct to attack trespassers and possible predators. I'd say that there's three ways the plot can go from here. 1. They decide not to interfere due to the danger, and help out when the rangers arive. 2. They make a distraction for the Beedrill, giving them the risky opportunity to rescue the body. 3. They attempt to sneak past the attention of the Beedrill and get the body. I see 3 being next to impossible to pull off, and 1 seems to be not as likely either, or else Leaf wouldn't have insisted Red and Blue come meet her so quickly. It's decently likely Blue will want to engage in combat, but it's just as possible Blue will not wish to fight such odds. I think that option 2, that they distract the Beedrill, is most likely, with the other options coming close behind (something like 40%:30%:20%), and I'll leave some room for an option I never thought of and/or plot twists.
