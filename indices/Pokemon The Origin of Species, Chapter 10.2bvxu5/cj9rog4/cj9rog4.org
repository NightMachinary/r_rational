That bit with the branch was funny. The "however I fall, this will hurt" reaction :) Also loved the interactions between Red's pokemon and him. I find it heartwarming how sweet and caring they are to their trainer, despite one having only been caught recently (the rattatta). Also, after this chapter, I'm now of the opinion all wild pokemon are dangerous, and not just the bigger ones. The scenes with Rattatta really showed how much damage the little guy/girl* could do.

*Can't recall the rattatta's gender.
