Not wanting to spoil anything, I won't respond to most of this, but as for the pokemon diversity, I'm basing the nativity of pokemon mostly off FireRed/LeafGreen, as they contain the most recent incarnation of Kanto. I may mess with it further, but definitely don't plan on sticking primarily to the original Kanto 150 for the various locations :)
