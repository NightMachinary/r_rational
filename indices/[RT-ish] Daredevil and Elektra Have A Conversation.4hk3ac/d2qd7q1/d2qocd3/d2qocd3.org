I'm one of those people who asks, "Why didn't they call the Avengers?" but I'm not one of those people who asks, "Why aren't they calling this Avengers 2.0?"

I'd be happy with some sort of quick excuse for why the Avengers don't appear in a given film, though. And that's not always necessary, either. In Winter Soldier, the lack of Tony Stark and Co. wasn't a problem for me (we can always assume that Thor is "out," Hulk would make things worse, and it doesn't seem like contacting Tony Stark or Hawkeye would have been easy or even possible given the circumstances).
