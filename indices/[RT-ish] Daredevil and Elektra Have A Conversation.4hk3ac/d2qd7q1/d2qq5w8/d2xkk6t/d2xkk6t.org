It really depends... How much would an Elizabeth Olsen cameo cost?

Because you could actually have a very short scene that would establish why they'd avoid mentioning them again.

Same conversation at the edge of the pit:

Scarlet Witch walks in: "We don't have a phone line, actually. It'd be redundant. Nice hole." Scarlet Witch walks over the edge and drops out of sight. Elektra: "I like her." DD. "Uhm. She smells really weird."

Scarlet Witch walks back into the scene. From the same direction. she's carrying a very large heart in her left hand. "Hellgate. One of the chinese hells. Didn't recognize the doorman. Not going to be using this gate again for the next thirty years. If you'll exuse me, going to collapse this shaft before the nuke detonates."

She hold up the heart. It catches fire. Scene shakes. Hole collapses. Then the scene shakes again.

"When you find the person opening hell gates, speak my name thrice"

Exit left.

Elektra: "I have never been more turned on".

DD: "Let's never speak of this again."

Elektra: "KK".
