While this is entertaining, I really don't think that the absence of the Avengers can be taken as a meaningful critique of the storytelling in /Daredevil/. I mean, it's obvious that the writers didn't have access to the Avengers characters, so they wrote around that gap. If I had to choose between "universe where Daredevil doesn't call the Avengers for no reason" and "universe where Daredevil does call the Avengers, then the show gets cancelled because they can't afford to call the Avengers" ...

For what it's worth, I think the writers did a great job telling a story with gray morality and well-written, complex characters. And at least when people are repeatedly invulnerable to ridiculously dangerous stuff, they're consistently so. I'm not saying the show is [[/r/rational]] rational, but the writers clearly /tried/ to hit the four characteristics, and I give them credit for that.
