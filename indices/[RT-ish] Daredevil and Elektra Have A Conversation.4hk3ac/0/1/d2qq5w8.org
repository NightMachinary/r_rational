Re: Avengers 2.5 - why does it have to be all or nothing? If CW only had an extra Avenger or 2, it would still be Captain America and nobody would be calling it an Avengers movie. CA2: Winter Soldier had Falcon and Black Widow. Ant-man had Falcon too.

If Daredevil did encounter a major problem, bringing in a single Avenger or Shield/government agent to check it out is eminently rational.
