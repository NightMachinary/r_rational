I guess you mean "shouldn't"? I'm pretty sure any significant crimefighting scenario is about right for the Avengers: the Punisher; Fisk; the ninjas; where do we draw the line? Although I'm pretty sure Stick would be bothered if anyone besides his secret training crew got involved in his secret war. I think trust in the Avengers is generally pretty low -- see Ant-Man and the upcoming Sokovia Accords storyline.

In any case, I don't think the absence of the Avengers is enough to make /Daredevil/ a "crappy show." I generally prefer to enjoy things over not enjoying things. But maybe my standards are lower than mean for this sub.
