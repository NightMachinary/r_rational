Whoops typo!

I don't watch Daredevil, so I assumed that the scenario in /Daredevil and Elektra Have a Conversation/ was pulled from the show, and that /does/ seem like something that the Avengers or at least SHIELD would be interested in.

Alternately, "We aren't going to talk to the Avengers because [lack of trust]" would also be good. If anything like that was mentioned in the show (even once, because I don't think there's anything wrong with saying "We're not talking to the Avengers about [thing] because we don't trust them" just once, and then expecting the viewers to remember that the next time that the Avengers might be relevant), then it looks like /D&E Have a Conversation/ is a terrible strawman.
