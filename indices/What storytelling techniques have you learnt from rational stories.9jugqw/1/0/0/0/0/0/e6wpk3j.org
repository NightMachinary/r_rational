Your perspective makes more sense as a writer who tries to emulate success but I am not sure if that's how we should judge works of fiction. I assume that by identifying "good" stories you meant searching for stuff that is popular and well liked in the niche you are writing, otherwise your logic is circular.

Fairy tail is terrible, still insanely popular and well liked. I don't think anyone should try to study it unless they only care about popularity and making money. The same can be said for 90% of paranormal romance.

I do think there are some parameter that are essential for a good story writing regardless of what the masses want. Grammar or spelling mistakes, unless intentional (as in Flowers of Algernon), are bad. Writing characters without distinct voices, is bad. Unless you are literally writing about emotionless robots. 6th grade level prose, intended for adult audience, is bad.

150 pages of exposition by your definition? I agree that most people probably won't like this. But if it makes sense for the characters to have these long conversations and info dump in the context of the story (basically the author doesn't break the 'realistic characters' rule) then I just don't think anyone can judge it as bad, just not for them.
