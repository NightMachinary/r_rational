I think I've learned this more from fan fiction in general than rational fiction specifically, but it continues to apply to works recommended here. There are at least /five/ different skills that I might classify as "writing" when it comes to story quality. These seem completely distinct: success or failure in any one does not necessarily guarantees the same for any other.

1. Basic composition - Spelling, grammar, a consistent tone and style.
2. Engaging prose - Use of vocabulary, quality of description, efficiency with words, clarity of action.
3. Engaging characters - Dialogue, expression, consistency of personality, believable behavior.
4. Engaging plot - Timing of story beats, well-placed exposition, clever twists and resolutions.
5. Theme and Meaning - Does the story make me think? Is it worth reflection?

These are essentially in order. At the top of the list are qualities which, if they're missing, will make me drop a story fast. When a work has an excellent grasp of four and five with major flaws in the first three, people who recommend it have to ask that we "Don't give up on this one."

At the bottom are qualities which, if they're still missing many chapters in, leave me feeling empty and disappointed. Sometimes I'll start a story with excellent skill in the first three and immediately say, "How have I never heard of this author?" Usually it's because there's weakness in four and five.

In both cases, that seems to imply that /tolerance/ for fiction and /first-impressions/ of authors is based on narrow technical aspects, but /love/ for fiction and /loyalty/ to authors is based on the strength of their storytelling.
