How a story reveals unknowns is also subjective. If Zorian had learned everything there is to know about the time loop and the invasion on the first loop, by a huge info dump from Zach, and the rest of the story focused more on character interactions and slice of life scenes It would be a different story, attracting a different audience. but would it be 'worse'? I am not sure if objectively good stories should necessarily have big reveals or plot twists.
