Plot is, in my formulation, how a writer manages and reveals unknowns. Doing so at the right speed that avoids feeling rushed or dull, and doing so in a way that makes every surprise feel shocking but ultimately the obvious and inevitable result of everything established before. This is as much a skill as any of the others, and one which some otherwise excellent writers lack.

The last feature is point of finesse, but one for which I've seen two-line jokes outstrip entire series of novels. Any story carries an implicit and often unspoken promise: "I am telling you this for a reason." Sometimes that's just "because I thought it was cool," and that's fine I guess, but the ones that really stick with me tend to also have some deeper point. Yes, I agree that point is something discovered between the author and the audience rather than wholly invented by either, but it is also something which I find reliably in the works of some authors and entirely absent in the works of others.

I've also seen it honed and improved.

Also, your point about dialogue is why I placed it right in the middle. It is definitely further along the scale towards love and loyalty than grammar and word choice.
