I agree that using power of friendship is not a good thing to copy. For the sake of argument though, there's no reason why the power of friendship is irrational: In-universe, it is clearly a powerful force and we see it being treated exactly like that. Is it brokenly OP? Absolutely. Is it irrational? Not really. On the other hand, Fairy Tail is irrational is many other details, which makes it plenty irrational in the end.
