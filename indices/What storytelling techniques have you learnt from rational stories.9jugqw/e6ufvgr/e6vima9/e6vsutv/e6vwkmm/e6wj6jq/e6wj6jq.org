  As I see it, if the prose is great, and the characters feel like real people (have distinct voices, react to situations realistically, consistent, engaging, etcetera) it wouldn't inherently be bad to have 150 pages of exposition follows by 150 pages of action (personally, I would actually prefer that).

I think this is another case of "disagreement" that's really just a different understanding of terms and definitions. If I had to guess, it sounds like you're coming at this from an angle like, "I love exposition! My favorite part of a show is the part where the characters are just talking to each other, instead of doing things like punching bad guys in the face!" If that's the case, you should be aware that you're talking just about dialog, and not all dialog is exposition. You can have witty banter without exposition, and in fact if the banter consists 100% of exposition it often becomes a lot more exhausting and a lot less "witty."

You say that you like stories where characters "react to situations realistically." Think about how you realistically react to situations: is every sentence that leaves your mouth expository? When you stub your toe, do you say, "Ouch! This hurts worse than the time at the beach when I stepped on a bee!" Or do you just say "Ouch"?

You can have /some/ of those moments. When we see Indiana Jones discover the snake in his hap and say, "I hate snakes!" it's a comedic moment. But if you do this /all the time/, it starts to get exhausting.

If you're coming at this from the angle of, "Well, I like learning things about the characters, so therefore I like exposition," I'd argue that exposition is one of the /weakest/ ways for us to learn about the characters, and the most interesting scenes that teach us about characters are those that consist of action. If a character says, "You know, Joe really has a hair-trigger temper, he's always going off and getting mad about the most trivial things," that's exposition. But you could just have Joe storm into the room and say, "Who the HELL thought it was a good idea to orient the paper towel dispenser horizontally?" That conveys the fact that Joe has a hair-trigger temper who tends to get irrationally upset about minor things, without having to have a character come out and explain that fact to us. (This is often phrased as "show, don't tell.")

To further explore what it would actually mean for a story to be 50% exposition, let's take the first Avengers movie as a case study:

The first half of the Avengers is "Avengers assemble," and the second half is "Avengers save the day." First, the Avengers assemble and work out their disagreements and learn to work together as a team. They learn about their incompatibilities and personality quirks and their limitations as characters. Then, once they've all learned to work together as a team, they go to confront the final battle. I presume that's the sort of thing you're gesturing at when you say you'd like a story that was "150 pages of exposition followed by 150 pages of action."

But let's consider what The Avengers would /actually/ look like if it literally followed a structure where it was all exposition for the first half, and all of the action happened in the second half: for the first half of the film, we learn about the backstory of each of the characters. Perhaps this takes the form of Maria Hill walking up to Nick Fury and saying, "Hey, this Captain America guy, what's his deal? What are his powers and why do you want to recruit him?" Follow that with Nick Fury talking about Captain America for 10 minutes. Repeat for each member of the cast. Then, 60 minutes into the film, Fury's diatribe on Asgardian politics is abruptly interrupted when Loki attacks and steals the macguffin! Oh no! Now we have 60 minutes to call the Avengers to assemble, have them learn to cooperate, sort out all of their differences, and finally go into the battle to defeat Loki and save New York City.

Of course, that's not how it happens at all. Loki doesn't attack at the 50% mark; he shows up during the opening scene. And pretty much everything that happens from that point forward is a reaction to what Loki did at the beginning. When Black Widow interrupts her interrogation to take a phone call from Nick Fury inviting her to help assemble the Avengers, that's moving the plot forward. When Cap and Tony have an argument over the best way to handle the situation, that's moving the plot forward (and developing their relationship). When Thor says, "Loki is an Asgardian and my plan is to take him back to Asgard where he will face justice and these goals that I've just described are are different from Iron Man's goals and that's why Tony and I don't get along very well and now we're going to fight," that's an example of exposition, but we don't mind that it's exposition because this information is delivered to us between one-liners written by Joss Whedon and within a few seconds we get to the part where we get to watch Thor and Iron Man fight. And then, when the fight ends and Thor reluctantly agrees to join the Avengers, we feel like we've gotten one step closer to our goal. These scenes provide exposition /and/ move the plot forward.

Note that in pretty much every case, the exposition is a necessary evil. The interesting part of the scene between Thor and Iron Man isn't the part where Thor says, "Hello, Iron Man, let me tell you a bit about my motivations and how it is that my goals conflict with yours," it's the part where the two of them fight. It's why exposition is so often squeezed in between moments of fun and action. Exposition is a /necessary evil./ You have to take your medicine, but it's seldom enjoyable in and of itself. Some storytellers will try to add especially entertaining bits to serve as a bit of sugar to help the medicine go down, which might be why you seem to have this Pavlovian response that says "Actually, I love exposition!" If you like jokes and banter that are used to deliver, it probably just means that you like jokes and banter enough for them to make the exposition palatable.

If it actually /is/ the case that you'd like to read a 150-page lore-dump prologue before getting to the part of the story where things actually start to happen, then perhaps I'm misguided in trying to persuade you that "even though you claim you want a story that starts with 150 pages of exposition, you don't actually think that and your claim arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of what is meant by exposition." However, realize that even if that is the case for you, you are an extreme outlier. If you are indeed that extreme outlier who prefers reading lore bibles to what most people typically envision when they hear the word "story," might I refer you to the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP Foundation]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia][another foundation that maintains a Wiki full of articles for you to learn about the detailed lore of a deep and complex world]]?

  Can you define a few clear parameters that can objectively be associated with a good plot?

As a writer who spends a lot of time talking with other writers about writing, when we talk about what makes "good writing," most of what we do is descriptive, not prescriptive. We don't really say, "here are the rules for what makes a good story, and we're going to judge the story based on how many of the rules it followed and how well it matches up against our criteria for what makes a good story." That would be prescriptive. (Taking a "prescriptive" approach to storytelling can often result in stories that are formulaic or follow "rules" that aren't really rules at all. For example, in The Phantom Menace, we find out that Anakin has no father; he was the product of a virgin birth. Why? Because George Lucas was a student of Joseph Campbell, and Campbell observed that "virgin birth" is a heroic archetype, and George Lucas tried to use this as a prescriptive guide to what makes a "heroic" character, and so Anakain is the product of a virgin birth for no real apparent reason.)

The descriptive approach consists of looking out into the world of media, and identifying that some stories are "good," and other stories are "bad," and analyzing them and trying to reverse engineer the techniques that the creators of good stories used so we can steal those techniques and use them for ourselves. For example, we might look at stories and observe that most stories have something called a "protagonist," a principal character who often serves as the hero of the story. There's no "universal law of storytelling" that says a story must have a protagonist in order to be good, but the vast majority of stories that I enjoy have a protagonist, so I've adopted as a general principal that pretty much any story I tell is going to feature a protagonist.

Taking this fundamentally descriptive approach, when we say "This makes a good story / this makes a bad story," what we really mean is, "Look, these are characteristics that are common to stories that are generally regarded as good, and these are the characteristics common to stories that are generally regarded as bad, so maybe try to use the techniques that seem to work for producing good stories and avoid the techniques that commonly lead to bad stories." All of that is predicated on the idea that there are "good" stories and "bad" stories, "good" plots that we'd like to imitate and "bad" plots whose foibles we want to avoid replicating. But all of this is predicated on the idea that there exist "good" plots and "bad" plots, and if you're still attached to the idea that, "Well, can we /really/ say that some plots are bad and some are good? I mean, it's all subjective, right? Who's to say that the plot of A New Hope is really better than the plot of The Phantom Menace?" then I'm not sure what I can tell you that would be productive.
