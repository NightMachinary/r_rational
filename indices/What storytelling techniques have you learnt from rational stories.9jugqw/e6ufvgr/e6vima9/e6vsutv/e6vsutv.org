  Aren't four and five purely subjective, especially plot? some people would be interested in the transformation of a high school teacher into a drug lord, while others would prefer reading about a farm boy toppling an empire.

To begin with, what you've described are not strictly examples of plot; you're describing premises that also imply a certain milieu, which goes beyond the realm of plot. "Two people fall in love after some interference from a competing love interest" is a standard romance story that could be told about people in a medieval setting, a Victorian setting, a contemporary setting, or a futuristic sci-fi setting. The minute you describe a story by saying "She's an investment banker from Scarsdale and he's a blue-collar worker who dropped out of high school, how will they ever get together?" you're now describing a story not just in terms of its romantic /plot/, but in terms of its /setting/. The same is true about stories about people being corrupted by the allure of power: the fact that Walter White is a high school teacher tells you more about the setting of the story than the type of plot he's experiencing.

Incidentally, I'd argue that when it comes to things like subjective taste, setting tends to have a stronger pull plot. Plot-wise, Rogue One arguably has more in common with Ocean's Eleven than it does with Return of the Jedi, but when people think about Rogue One, they think more about the setting and lore (the force, storm troopers, AT-ATs) and less about what type of plot it is (a motley crew of people with different roles conspire in an elaborate scheme to steal a macguffin). Most people think about Rogue One as a science fantasy story before they think about it as a heist movie (to the extent that they even think of it as a heist movie at all).

In the realm of plot, subjective tastes are certainly part of it; there are some people who want a romance story with a "happily ever after" end, and some people who want a plot that is full of dark twists and shocking revelations. The things that make some readers giddy with excitement will cause others to put the book down. However, that hardly means that plot is "strictly subjective." Even if my subjective preference is for stories about farm boys who overthrow an evil empire (as opposed to stories whose plot focuses on two people falling in love), surely we can agree that there are some stories that execute this plot-type well, and stories that do it poorly. All of the Indiana Jones have the same basic plot structure, but there's pretty uniform agreement that some of them are good and some are bad. You could make an argument that this is still a subjective judgment, as I'm sure you could find /someone/ who enjoyed Crystal Skull more than Raiders of the Lost Ark, but at a certain point I think you're sort of descending into a semantic argument where points about subjectivity cease to be useful in a world where "technically, /everything/ is subjective." Yes, tastes are subjective, but when I say I like heist movies, everyone knows what I mean, and when I say I like /good/ heist movies, a lot of people tend to have pretty similar ideas of what that means, and will probably be more likely to recommend Heat than, say, Hurricane Heist.

When people say, "This is a good plot," their claim is usually less, "This is story's plot type is my favorite," and more, "This plot is a really well-executed version of what it's trying to be." (When people say, "I love Goodfellas," I assume their statement is probably closer to "I think this movie was a well-done gangster movie," than "I like gangster movies, and this was one of those.") When people say something has a "good plot," they're talking about things like how good the author is at calibrating expectations, so that when the surprise revelation comes, the audience smacks their forehead and says, "Of course! Now it all makes sense!" rather than, "Wait, huh? That totally came out of nowhere." They're talking about things like pacing, where instead of having 150 pages of exposition where nothing happens, followed by 150 pages of action, the author is instead able to have a plot that is constantly moving forward even as it slowly doles out the information that the reader will need in order for the ending to work.
