I guess I confused plot with premise, point taken!

Though to me it still seems like the arguments you made about the differences between a good and a bad plot- mainly pacing and expectations, are harder to judge objectively than things like characterization or prose or basic grammar and spelling. As I see it, if the prose is great, and the characters feel like real people (have distinct voices, react to situations realistically, consistent, engaging, etcetera) it wouldn't inherently be bad to have 150 pages of exposition follows by 150 pages of action (personally, I would actually prefer that). Can you define a few clear parameters that can objectively be associated with a good plot? pacing and calibrating expectation are too broad and subjective IMO.
