I haven't read most of the thread, but I just want to discuss this one point.

  Fairy tail is terrible, still insanely popular and well liked.

Can you really say Fairy Tail is terrible? Specifically I noticed that many anime of this genre are good at building anticipation and paying off (of course there are exceptions), something which I've found to greatly improve my enjoyment of a work.

Of course there are many many things that could improve it, but perhaps there are things to learn from it?
