Aren't four and five purely subjective, especially plot? some people would be interested in the transformation of a high school teacher into a drug lord, while others would prefer reading about a farm boy toppling an empire. If the author is capable of the first three, any plot he chooses would be objectively well executed. If the characters are distinct, flashed out individuals who, in the hands of the author, could react realistically to any situation, it doesn't matter what situations they get into.

Themes and meaning also can't be judged objectively IMO. Simple stories could hold great meaning to some people and appear shallow to others. Attack on titan made me think a lot about the amazing difference between humans and other animals. Or about how lucky we are to be at the top of the food chain. Sure, these are not profound or ground breaking ideas. Nonetheless they touched me deeply on some level and made me think beyond what would be considered a basic story.

It seems to me like the first three are the must have building blocks of every good storyteller, while four and five are the style or flavor that can't really be criticized objectively. Any guilty pleasure would be a story that fails spectacularly at the first three, but the reader still reads because four and five match exactly his tastes.

On a side note - I have noticed that dialogue is the most efficient tool when looking for good stories hidden between all the the mediocre ones. Especially when searching for fanfiction or webnovels. You could be a great writer (nailing down the first and the second) and a terrible storyteller- failing at the third point. Dialogue is the fastest way to spot the difference.
