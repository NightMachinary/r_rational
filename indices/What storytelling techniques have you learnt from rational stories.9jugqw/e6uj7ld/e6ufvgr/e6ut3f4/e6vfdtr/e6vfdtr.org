For me it had been a difference that has become more concrete in my own mind after reading a lot of rational fiction.

The idea that you have to provide the same tools that are available to the protagonist to your audience. This, to me, is one of the tenets of rational fiction, and it can also be a very powerful tool for creating tension in stories that are not necessarily rational but are just trying to be either unique or "good".

Weirdly, or maybe appropriately, it is very much like a good mystery novel or show. And by becoming more aware of this; I've also found myself seeing flaws in other stories where I didn't before.

I think an example (at least to me) is the Sherlock show on BBC. It does a very poor job of being rational, and, for me, good because it fails to equip its audience with the same tools as the protagonist.

Sherlock, especially in later seasons, tends to "figure out" plots and plans by theoretically real applications of his senses and science, but those applications and those abilities are not previously revealed to the audience nor is the evidence that is being collected by those abilities.

Therefore no one who is watching Sherlock can "solve" the mystery before the show reveals it.

Properly setting up and allowing the reader to experience those tools and is something I've been trying to do in my own stories so that 1. they can feel more rational (although I don't know if I would categorize my stories as rational fiction) and 2. so that increases in skill and power are grounded in whatever reality that the world I'm telling the story is in.
