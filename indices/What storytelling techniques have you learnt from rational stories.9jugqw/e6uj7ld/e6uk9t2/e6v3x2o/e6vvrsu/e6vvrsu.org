I think this is an issue that becomes most apparent when looking at anime that are adapted from visual novels.

In a visual novel, the player is given a choice of romantic interests, and the game is designed so that the player chooses a single love interest to (monogamously) pursue. After they've reached the end of the arc and successfully "romanced" a love interest, they restart the game and can make a different choice. The /protagonist/ gets to pledge eternal fidelity to a single person, but the /player/ is a serial monogamist who gets to romance everyone (assuming they choose to play the game more than once). (There have been several games that play with this meta-level contradiction between protagonist and player, most prominently Doki Doki Literature Club, which shares a lot of similarities with Kimi to Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi.)

Trying to adapt this kind of visual novel into an anime is often how you end up with the "love polygon held in equilibrium by the protagonist's indecision," existing solely on romantic tension with no actual payoff.

There is another (rarer) way some anime handle this, which is the "omnibus format," pioneered by Amagami SS. The way that people typically play visual novels is to play the game multiple times, pursuing a different romantic interest each time. You can do this in the form of an anime: have a 4-episode arc where the protagonist chooses a single romantic interest to pursue. The arc ends with the two declaring their love for each other. And, with that "route" concluded, we hit the reset button and warp back to the beginning to tell a /different/ 4-episode arc where the protagonist chooses a /different/ romantic interest, the two fall in love and declare their love, before we wipe the slate clean /again/ with yet another romantic prospect. Repeat for the duration of your 24-episode broadcast. This follows a similar structure to a "time loop," except the whole "wipe the slate and start over again" isn't actually part of the fiction; it's part of the meta-structure of the show. A 24-episode broadcast gives you room for 6 discrete romance arcs, all of which begin from the same starting point but which are mutually exclusive and share no continuity.

Clannad sort of splits the difference; it remains romantically ambiguous for as long as possible before finally allowing protag-kun to pick a canonical heroine, but there are several OVAs titled "Another World" which explore alternate stories in which he ended up with one of the other girls.
