An addendum that was too long to fit into the body of the above post due to reddit's character limit:

All of the above discussion (focused on how to continue dwelling in a fun possibility space) kind of skips past a more significant topic, which is how to create a fun possibility space in the first place. The main reason I've skipped past this is that an interesting possibility space is usually defined by the characters, setting, and plot that make it up, and advice like "write a story that has compelling characters, setting, and plot" falls squarely into the realm of advice that is so obvious as to be completely useless. But I think we can break it down a little bit more by looking at the symptoms of the most successful possibility spaces. You know that you have an interesting possibility space that fans enjoy spending time in when they go online to discuss the story and post theories about what will happen next. Arguably, the entire point of fanfiction is to play around in the possibility space that the author left unexplored, allowing fans to realize all of the adventures that could have taken place at Hogwarts, or all of the romances that could have sprung up between the characters of their favorite story.

Using "fan engagement" as a reasonable proxy for "how fun the possibility space is to explore," one thing becomes immediately obvious: almost all of it is speculative fiction. The top categories on FF.net are Harry Potter, Twilight, Percy Jackson, Lord of the Rings, and Hunger Games. Note that this isn't just a "popular books" category: lots of people read The Da Vinci Code and The Fault in Our Stars, but these books have proportionally less fanfiction. Dan Brown is more popular than Brandon Sanderson, but [[/r/brandonsanderson]] has 18,000 readers while [[/r/danbrown]] is in the triple digits. Based on this, it seems like stories that are focused on a /setting/ (most speculative fiction, particularly stories with rich worldbuilding like Harry Potter and Mistborn) get a lot of mileage out of their possibility space, whereas it's much less a focus for stories that are centered on plot (page-turners by Dan Brown and Clive Cussler). Plot-centered stories are more in the business of posing a question and then immediately answering it several pages later, rather than asking open-ended questions that the reader carries with them. When people read a Dirk Pitt novel, they care about Dirk Pitt for about as long as they're reading the book, and then promptly forget about him until they pick up the next book. But when it comes to Harry Potter, people don't just want to read about Hogwarts; they want to fantasize about it. They spend time dwelling on the work even when they're not actively reading it.
