Little late on this, but I think that from rational fiction in specific, I've learned that people have a /much/ higher toleration for exposition than most give them credit for. I know MoL isn't for everyone, but even then, even if you only inserted a quarter of the exposition MoL is belting out constantly, you'd still have a story with four times as much exposition as the average. I think the difference between MoL and other stories isn't that it's desensitized us to it, it's that the author has mastered the quality of delivering information in an entertaining and /plain/ way. Having read it, I feel like the hate against exposition dumps in stories is a little unfounded. At the very least, it could serve as a moderator for constant, non-stop action.
