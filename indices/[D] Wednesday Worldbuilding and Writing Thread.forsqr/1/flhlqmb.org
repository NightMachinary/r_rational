So I've recently read Ultimate Rock, Paper, Scissors ([[https://mangadex.org/chapter/582800/1]]) for the first time and it makes me want to write a similar narrative but with a bunch of supernatural characters playing poker.

So far I have 8 player characters more or less roughed out, their motivations and their basic methodology of how they plan to win. (They aren't named yet so I'll just label them based on their inspiration).

| Character   | Basic Methodology        | Motivation                                       |
|-------------+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| Leprechaun  | Luck                     | Wants to find the rest of his gold               |
| Vampire     | Mental Control (Thralls) | Wants to be at peace with her dead lover         |
| Oracle      | Future Sight             | Wants to heal her injuries                       |
| Alien       | Statistical Analysis     | Wants to return home                             |
| Satori      | Mind Reading             | Wants to restore his status as a mountain god    |
| Dragon      | Bribery/ Intimidation    | Wants to have the most coveted treasure hoard    |
| Witch       | Limited Magic            | Wants to find her lost mentor                    |
| Scam Artist | Cheating                 | Wants to elevate his family's standard of living |

The setting of the world I think will end up being vaguely modern day. We'll only be seeing these characters interacting in a single location while playing their game so I might just allude to things rather that flesh out unimportant factors.

One thing I'm mulling over however is how to incorporate chips into the game properly. The prize for winning is a pseudo-wish and not a set monetary value. My gut reaction is to just make it so the chips are worth one each and players start out with only 10 each or something like that.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
