  One thing I'm mulling over however is how to incorporate chips into the game properly. The prize for winning is a pseudo-wish and not a set monetary value. My gut reaction is to just make it so the chips are worth one each and players start out with only 10 each or something like that.

Maybe they have to pay a price in order to get in, and the value of that price is equivalent to 10 (or however many) tokens.

Importantly, /the price to be paid is proportional to the value of the wish desired/, which helps to equalize things since some people's wishes seem to be more valuable than other people's (and it explains why nobody has come here with the intent to conquer the world or end death or whatever--besides something of that scale probably being beyond the power of the game to provide, if I've understood you correctly, nobody who wants those things is in a position to pay a sufficient price for it).

What this means, in practice, is that if you feel like you aren't going to win, then you can withdraw and, so long as you have at least 10 (or however many) tokens left, you don't have to actually pay the price. This can give an additional wrinkle for some characters, as they begin to weigh the odds of success and wonder whether they should try to leave the table while they're still ahead.
