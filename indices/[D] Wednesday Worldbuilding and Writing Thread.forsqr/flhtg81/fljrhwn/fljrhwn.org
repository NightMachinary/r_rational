The Night's Dawn Trilogy by Peter F. Hamilton is kinda interesting in that it contains a lot of the patterns of fighting an epidemic, the growing realisation of how big the threat is, the question of when to act and to close borders etc. without being about a normal epidemic. It takes quite some time until it gets to the epidemics-like parts though.
