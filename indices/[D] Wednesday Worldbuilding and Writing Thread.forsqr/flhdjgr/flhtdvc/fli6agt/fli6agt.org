From Vernor Vinge's "Taja Grimm's World", they had aliens remove all the easily accessible metal deposits. The people living on that world tried to make do with fiberglass, but it is hard to bootstrap an industrial base without iron, copper, etc. This was written in the 1970's, and it isn't clear that actually removing all the easy to access metals on a planetary surface would result in a viable ecosystem (need iron for hemoglobin, for example).
