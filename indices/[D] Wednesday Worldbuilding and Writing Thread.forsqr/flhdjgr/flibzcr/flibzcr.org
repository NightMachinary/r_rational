Much of LOTR doesn't make sense, starting with the part where most of the bloody map is empty. But I'd like to point out that the middle ages themselves were very far from stagnant. The culture, technology, and worldview of any given country would be very different in 1300 than it was in 700 or even 1000. I realize the OP didn't claim otherwise, but this is something a lot of people don't appreciate enough--plenty of growth and development happened in the middle ages.

With that said, consider Pournelle's Janissaries (I'm probably spelling it wrong). It's not super-plausible--in fact, it's ridiculous in many ways--but aliens periodically seed Tran with human settlers, who are kept from developing technologically by the aliens betraying and bombing them as soon as they stop being useful. Admittedly, an extreme and contrived solution, but the series was fun in a watch-an-author-play-Civilization way. A pity he died before he could complete it.
