I think the "easiest" way to have static technology levels make sense is through interventionist higher powers.

If the Deity of Farming doesn't get Godpoints^{TM} from the use of animal-pulled plows they may withhold magical benefits from anyone who uses one, or even from any community that has someone who uses one. The Deity of Fire may get a significant portion of their Faith income from the use of candles and torches, so anyone trying to make a basic lightbulb is a threat and gets the Inquisition brought down on them.

If Deities raise the bar for how useful a new technology has to be high enough (through generous use of blessing, accessible rituals, boons, etc.) and actively punish innovation a society could plausibly maintain the same tech level for long periods of time. Basically, the easiest way to keep society stagnant is to introduce sufficiently powerful actors who have a vested interest in stagnation.
