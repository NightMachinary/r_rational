Maybe! My understanding is that steam really depended on coal, because (1) charcoal isn't an effective enough fuel source for widespread steam power and, more importantly, (2) good steam engines require a quality of steel which cannot be produced without coal-fueled fires (which is why we couldn't have gotten Greek steam engines--they didn't have the metallurgy to create steam engines which wouldn't burst).
