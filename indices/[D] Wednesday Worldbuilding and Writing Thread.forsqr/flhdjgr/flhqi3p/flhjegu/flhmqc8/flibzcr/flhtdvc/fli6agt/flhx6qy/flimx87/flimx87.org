That's true enough. Was just thinking on the fly when I wrote that.

As for magic examples, there can be many. For example:

- It's a parallel to modern physical research - mages need years of high-quality education, then come up with theories, work in teams and expend many resources in advancing magical knowledge.

- A rare resource is necessary for magic, which can only be obtained in limited amounts.

- Magic is based on saying the correct sequence of sounds, so discovering magic is just trying different sequences until it works.

- Magical knowledge is beyond the scope of man, and people must petition to the gods or the elves or whoever for it, doing various tasks over extended periods of time.

- Magic is discovered, not created, and people must delve into old ruins in order to find the ancient scrolls that contain new spells.

- Mages are extremely rare, and entire countries are built around a support structure in order to cater to them.

- Advancing magic is based on blind luck, so people just wait around for the next meteor containing magical knowledge to strike.

- Magic is fading, and all the effort is put into trying to stop that from happening.

- Advancing magic requires international cooperation, and politics and diplomacy drastically slows everything down.

Et cetera.
