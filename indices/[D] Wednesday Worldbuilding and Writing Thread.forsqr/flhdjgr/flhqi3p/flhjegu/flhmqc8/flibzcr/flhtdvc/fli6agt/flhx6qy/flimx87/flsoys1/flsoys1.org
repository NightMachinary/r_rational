I think the most obvious hindering effect of magic is that it has too few limitations, not too many. Limitations drive progress by creating a problem that motivates people to find solutions, each one of which is an incremental advance.

If magic allows you to meet all of your needs then there is no need for progress, and no need for curiosity. Indeed, since there's no material benefit to society from such curiosity under these circumstances, but a risk of harm from something that might be uncovered, the rational response is to actively stifle it. Stagnation means survival. Discovery means destruction, or at the very least a plague of lost eyebrows.
