As an addendum to this: what might we expect to stay the same?

It's my personal belief that geography, resources, crops, and domestic animals drive something like 90% of cultures. Given a thousand years, there's a decent chance that some of that stuff will have stayed the same. On Earth, latitude won't have changed, meaning that you'll have roughly the same growing seasons (minus the difference in the plants and planting technologies), your drainage basins will only have shifted a little bit, and unless resources get depleted or ruined somehow, those will probably be the same too.

Crops and animals will have changed, whether through selective breeding, new species from different latitudes, or new farming techniques making different domestications viable, but not by /that/ much, since latitude stays the same, weather is probably /mostly/ the same, and the plants are within very similar confines.

That being the case, it's not too wild to think that things might to be /that/ different a thousand years down the line. If the animals and plants are mostly the same, perhaps with different breeds, then you'll have the same or similar textiles, which will lend themselves the same or similar techniques, which will lend themselves to a few common elements of fashion.

If the wood, metals, stone, clay, etc. haven't changed much, with no significant new stores opened up through advances in technique, then a lot of the buildings will probably look similar, because there are limits to what you can done if one of your starting conditions is "your buildings are all made of pine" or "you don't have trees available to you" or something like that.

The underlying realities of these things that /might/ stay static can allow for /some/ amount of apparent stasis, or if not stasis, then commonality between two time periods. You just need to be careful to account for how these things have not changed, minus the drift, erosion, and errors. They would be different, but some very large things stay the same, which might make some smaller things stay the same, which might allow not /too/ much difference, if you're squinting.
