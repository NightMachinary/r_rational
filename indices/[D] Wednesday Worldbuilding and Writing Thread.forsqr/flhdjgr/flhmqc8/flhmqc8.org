I can't say much re institutions and culture, but /technological/ stasis is pretty easy to achieve if you arbitrarily remove given elements or just deposit them in a hard-to-use form. For example, one of my worlds has no fossil fuels, and another of my worlds is missing not only fossil fuels but iron ore (it exists as a trace element, because many organisms need it to live, but it's incredibly difficult to convert that into a usable amount of iron).
