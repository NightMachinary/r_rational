If it's thousands of years, then I think it's essentially impossible. There are a few things at play:

- Transcription errors. Given a generation cycle of approximately twenty years, a thousand years will require fifty successive copies. That's fifty instances of parents teaching their children things. Even if everyone was trying to, it's unlikely that you would get the same message out the end through this intergenerational game of telephone.
- Drift. Even if things aren't copied wrong, you'll still have to deal with things changing in one form or another. Linguistic drift is probably one of the easiest and most well-studied examples, meaning that on the other end of your thousand years, people will no longer be mutually intelligible to their ancestors. Institutional drift is another big example: people will be trying to push things one way or another, or forces will be acting on institutions, and they'll slowly become different from what they were. This will happen with cultural values and stories as well. And on top of that, farmers will probably be engaging in selective breeding, whether intentionally or not, meaning that your domesticated plants and animals will be different.
- Erosion. Lingual, cultural, and institutional erosion are all a given. Less obviously, there will be changes to geography over the course of a thousand years, with changes to landscapes and soil quality, buildings and cities will have to undergo periodic repairs or replacements, especially if they're not building with sustainability or durability in mind. Some of this "erosion" will be in the form of warfare.
- Unexpected events and system fragility. Wars, diseases, famines, natural disasters, and black swans will come at any civilization like a freight train, and unless the civilization/culture/institutions are far more robust than any historical ones, they'll be changed by either the impacts the outside event has, or the ways in which these systems respond. Some of these don't even need to be that "big": a new species of insect evolving that wipes out a monoculture could have huge ramifications on textiles or food, for example.

Now, at the end of all this, you might get a civilization that looks more or less like it did at the start, if you squint, but "the past is a foreign country" really applies, and on the scale of a thousand years, even without much 'progress' I would expect that the past would be sufficiently foreign that it only makes sense to call it the same entity if you're taking a broad view of continuity.
