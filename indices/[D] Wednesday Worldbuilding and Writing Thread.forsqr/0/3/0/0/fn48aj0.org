Maybe because we don't live very long. Institutions are made up of people, so they change by definition when enough of the people in it die off. If you have institutions of immortals, they might not change very much for thousands of years. Even if they are purely human institutions they might have advisors or individuals in the perifery which are immortal and somewhat keep them pointed in the same direction. Depends on the setting of course. For instance, I think they had records of 8000 years or something in ASoIaF. That seems ridiculous.
