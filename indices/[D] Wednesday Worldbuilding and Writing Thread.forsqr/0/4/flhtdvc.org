There are many ways of forcing a medieval stasis. To name a few:

- A higher power with some incentive to keep the stasis going.

- The current technology level, combined with magic, is just adequate enough for people to not spend much effort improving on it.

- Magic is more useful than technology, but takes far longer to advance, resulting in a slow rate of progress.

- The resources available in our world does not have the same availability in yours.

- The laws of physics / chemistry / sciences are different in your universe.

- There is some inherent danger in some key technological development not present in our world that hinders the development.

- There is some constant outside threat that forces people to focus on a specific area rather than to improve things generally.

- There is some prevalent belief that technological progress is bad, and that belief is strong enough to last centuries.

- Your humans are different from ours, and have inherently different psychological wants and needs.
