I think that biologically accessible metals are going to be placed in a different category than mineral deposits by any aliens with such a plan. You need to do a lot of chemical work to turn a chunk of iron ore into something non-toxic and usable by the body (or rather, a great many bodies, again: you want non-toxic), and you're not going to be smithing many horseshoes by getting your peasants to donate buckets of blood.
