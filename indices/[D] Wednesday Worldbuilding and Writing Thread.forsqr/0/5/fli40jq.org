Perhaps they tap into the elemental plane of fire, create a pinprick that just keeps expanding. Perhaps they make magic grey goo. Perhaps they figure out a way to get recursively more powerful and accidentally kill the world. There have to be all kinds of ways to kill the world with magic, especially the sort of organized and well-resourced magic that an industrialising civilization can muster. It's Bostrom's Fragile World hypothesis taken to its logical conclusion.

Those who have really deep bunkers and can survive the surface being erased and loaded again from backup get very unhappy about this sort of thing. The survivors are those who inherently distrust any unsafe innovation: innovative cultures get erased.
