Well its definitely not rational, but holy hell the humor is on point so fucking hard. All of the little details, like the onesie and characters talking holy shit man. I am on chapter 36.

Amusing story, batman out of ten.

EDIT: Just finished chapter 73. Oh my universe, the story is consistently funny and I am enjoying how you're twisting all the fantasy tropes into somethign new and awesome, screaming fish HAH!
