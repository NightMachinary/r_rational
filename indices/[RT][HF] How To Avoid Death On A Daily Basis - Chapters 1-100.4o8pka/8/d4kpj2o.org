One thing I found very satisfying is how the protagonist keeps forcing people to "bet", to put their lives where their mouths are, instead of giving orders or caving in.

"If you /actually/ think it's a good idea, if you're not just signaling, then do it. I'm okay with being left behind, but I won't try to save you either." It's a very LessWrong sort of attitude (though in the real world, things are often too entangled for anyone to be able to do it).
