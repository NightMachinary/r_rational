Actually I'd rather you didn't. I've only just put up my own ebooks on Amazon and plan to sell epubs too (currently I offer epubs/pdfs to donators).

I'm fine with you compiling ebooks of the the freely available chapters for your personal use but I'd prefer to keep control of how and where my stories are released in book form, if possible.
