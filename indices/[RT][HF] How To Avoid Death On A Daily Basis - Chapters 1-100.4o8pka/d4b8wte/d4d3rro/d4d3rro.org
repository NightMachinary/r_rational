Firstly, your comment ignores things like the ineffective briefing, supplying, and training of the newcomers and for some reason focuses almost entirely on the absence of rape-facilities instead. Your comment also ignores that the girls could've been offered positions like medical assistants, technical \ informational advisors, etc.

Regarding the rape-factory suggestion itself: 1. much of the relevant and important information is still concealed from the readers for them to be able to determine whether the host governemts' approach to visitors is effective or not. We don't know why people get summoned into this world and by whom, what purposes are planned for them by their summoners and their welcoming parties (if these are two different agents), what's so special about them in the first place, and so on. And without knowing all this, we can't also tell how effective the hosts' current approach is in advancing /their/ perceived interests.

  your scruples should not rebel at the idea of basically forcibly turning these girls into breeding machines --- plenty of these girls would readily prefer this arrangement to almost certain death.

1. That's a false dichotomy. 2. Plenty of people would also agree to be raped if you put a knife to their throats, which should not be the point. 3. I doubt the moral and value systems of modern-day women would allow most of them to agree to something like this. 4. Even if “plenty of them” agreed to such conditions it wouldn't mean /all/ of them would. And I can easily imagine a person shoehorned into the position of a sex slave deciding to kill whoever they perceived as their primary abuser and\or killing themselves with a stolen and concealed knife.
