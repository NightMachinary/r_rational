First of all, you're sounding a good bit more pointlessly confrontational then necessary mate. Secondly, you're misrepresenting the issue. These people aren't being summoned to 'fill out the number' so the question of whether the women should be relegated to expanding/maintaining the population is answered right there by people who are more aware of their issues then the reader. Additionally, your question is, if you'll pardon me saying, fucking idiotic. 'What percentage of women do you expect to survive?' really? You've not only already provided the correct answer, you've also managed to misrepresent it into misogynist-sounding pointlessness. 1% of women are going to survive, if that, because when you you summon up random schmucks to be armed with primitive weaponry and thrown against monsters, 1% of anyone surviving is about the best you're going to fucking get. If that's not already the case then you're vastly overestimating the actual danger in which case the women's physical ability, which is by the way only slightly inferior to that of the average man on average and there are certainly exceptions to the rule, matters a fuckload less. Mainly though, try to stop coming off as so condescending about your opinions vis a vis women. You're not gonna make many friends that way.
