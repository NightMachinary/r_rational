Here we go again; another person conveniently addressing one part of my argument while neglecting the other.

Firstly, these women are not fighting untrained men. They'd be fighting horrible monsters that will kill even trained men. How about you answer my question: what percentage of these girls do you expect to survive if they follow the path laid out for them? Can you honestly say it'd be any more than 1% on average?

/Why/ would they, or the natives accept those odds when actual humans throughout our long history would generally not even when facing less horrific environmental pressures?

Female warriors don't make sense. They can never make sense unless you take reproduction out of the equation at the very least---never mind physical and psychological aptitude.
