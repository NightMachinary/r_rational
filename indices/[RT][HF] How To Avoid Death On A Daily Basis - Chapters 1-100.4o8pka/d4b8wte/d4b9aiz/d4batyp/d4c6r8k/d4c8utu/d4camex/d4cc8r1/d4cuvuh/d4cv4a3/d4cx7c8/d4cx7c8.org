Interesting discussion. I think from a purely nuts and bolts perspective, the survival rate of female warriors would be quite low, possibly even hampering the males and getting everyone killed, but as the writer there are specific reasons I positioned the female members of the visitors the way I did (whether to good effect or not, I can't say).

Firstly, the visitors aren't straightforwardly comparable to the natives, that includes the females. If they were just extra fighters why bring them over in the first place? There are plenty of soldiers etc already here, and they're far better at fighting the monsters than the kids. They must have some other purpose, although it isn't clear yet (I have started to allude to it in recent chapters).

I also wanted to mess around with the conventions in these sorts of stories where the attractive female in leather miniskirt fights alongside the hero. The way the women react and how they deal with the issue in my story is a mixture of me addressing how things would really be, and how they generally are in fantasy stories. So I'll often play up the cliched approach (arriving and being handed a weapon) and then subvert it (weapon is a useless stick).

Perhaps that makes it feel a bit muddled, I'm not sure.

I think I do take a lot of the points being made here into account (not necessarily well, but I try). I make it clear the majority of those summoned die and die early (I think I said two-thirds). The women are constantly under threat of harm from their own side, natives, and monsters. Some check out, some use their sexuality, some try to fight.

The question of why they aren't married off etc. goes to my first point. Why would they be summoned if they were going to be just used for breeding (unless there's a shortage of fertile women here)? Something more must be expected of them, it just isn't known yet what that is.

The reason I gave Colin a party of girls and ineffectual boys was to specifically raise these sorts of questions. Although finding suitably satisfying and entertaining answers is quite hard (you may have noticed).

I would also point out that every shortcoming women have in this context could probably also be applied to the MC.
