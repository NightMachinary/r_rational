Is this some kind of geeky roleplaying thing?

  also lethal is kind of a 1 or 0 thing. a sharp sword through vital point kills everything. If a woman can't kill a monster by putting a sharp object through it's vital point, neither can a man. (assuming the sword is very sharp)

Is a toddler with a rifle as lethal as a trained sniper? I've already established, I think, that women are not men's equal physically even beyond mere strength.

But as I already noted, you can say that women have the potential to be on average as lethal as men, minus their physical shortcomings, but our reality does not bear this out. For a myriad of reasons, women are simply not half as lethal as men, not even a quarter as lethal or even and eighth.

Do you challenge my prediction that under such circumstances 99% to 100% of these girld would be slaughtered?
