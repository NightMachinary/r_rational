Were I a local governor, I would take strides to ensure that the Visitors are protected initially. I would explain their circumstances as honestly and fully as possible, while attempting to extract whatever useful knowledge they might have from their own world. Then I'd ask them what they want to do and attempt to facilitate any non-ridiculous demands if possible, however staying with the aim of eventually having them take care of themselves.

A trained female with a sword is definitely going to defeat any untrained man with a sword, every time. Same with any other weapon, and especially things like guns. The average untrained man using a melee weapon has good odds of defeating the average untrained woman, but the difference is not as stark as you portray. In many cases, such as when using swords or spears, the first good hit is going to be what counts and with untrained combatants luck plays a large part. If both combatants are trained, then their relative skill is way more important than physical characteristics - those only come to play when they are essentially equally skilled.

The key difference is definitely not strength, but reach - the whole point of weapons is that you don't need to be strong in order to be lethal, because weapons amplify and focus your strikes.

As for cultural issues, obviously these depend on the culture. In this case, pretty much everyone appears to have a weapon and at least some measure of self-defense training, even if they are civilians. Makes sense in a fantasy world where you can be jumped by a monster the instant you leave your home.
