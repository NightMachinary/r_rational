Yes actually, I do. Let's go through your comments to demonstrate.

1) Asking why the natives act like video game characters, when they don't, and then veering off into a lecture about why all the women should have immediately been forced into sexual slavery... nothing misogynistic there, no sir!

2) Once again asking why the locals didn't immediately start raping the women, pointing out the incredibly obvious as demonstrated repeatedly over the course of the story when we see visitors dropping like flies, and then voicing expectations for all the women to immediately give up any hope of returning home or bettering their position in order to take up baking in the nearest village with an inexplicable shortage of pastry chefs.

3) More extrapolation on the inherent inferiority of women, idiotic dismissal of a womans ability to be dangerous with a deadly weapon, dismissal of every reply you've received, and another bout of advocating for the rape factory.

4) Outright dismissal of someone's explanation for why the locals aren't carrying out your rape-factory plan with enthusiasm, they've got a fucking centuries old treaty dictating how they handle the visitors, an assertion that women are to men what elite soldiers are to toddlers, and then a statement of the obvious with a misogynistic slant because of course the vast majority of the visitors are dead folk walking.

5) Dismissal of yet another answer to your question, continued creepy focus on the fact that the girls are unlikely to survive even as you skip over your own admittance that the men are just as if not more screwed for lack of other options, questioning as to why people with literally no other option or choice in the matter would do what they're being forced to, and another assertion that women are inferior and these ones should have been shipped off to the rape camps.

I think I'm done talking to you.
