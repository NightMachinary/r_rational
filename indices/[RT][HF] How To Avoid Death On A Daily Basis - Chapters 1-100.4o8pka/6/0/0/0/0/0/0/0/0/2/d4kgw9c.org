Well, the issue with your argument isn't claiming that at most 1% of the women would survive. That number, while not very well-founded, still sounds good enough for all the data we have. The issue is that the amount of men that would survive in such circumstances is the same, and the significance of these numbers is, for the purposes of the discussion, only in relation to each other.

You appear to be arguing that there is some sort of difference between men and women that makes men better warriors, and not just 'slightly better on average' but 'significantly better in almost every case', which is what is being addressed as false.

Reproduction is entirely beside the point, given that it is clear there is no population deficit involved.
