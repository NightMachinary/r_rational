Assuming raw physical strength is the only thing that would make men better warriors than women; but there's more to it than that, such as greater lung capacity, greater pain tolerance, longer limbs, differing hormonal loads---without even mentioning fussy inherent psychological differences and the like.

  Even exaggerating the gender differences, say a woman with a sharp blade is only half as lethal as a man with a sharp blade. That is still very lethal. Weapons do a lot to make up differences in strength.

But we know very well that women are nowhere near as half as lethal as men, in practise---even under similarly stressful circumstances and when subjected to the same pressures. And "very lethal" is relative; how much does that amount to in a world with literal monsters out of fairy tales walking around? I predict the overwhelming majority of these boys would not live very long and neither would virtually all of the girls.

My original comment put forth two main point and the replies I've received keep going back and forth ignoring one of the two as convenient. Women's potential as warriors was one and their immensely greater value anywhere but in a battlefield. Also noted where the environmental factors of the land and the projected cultural outlook of the natives.

Lets make it simple though: say you're the local governor. Do you give these girls weapons and tell them go to out and fight dragons or escort them safely to the nearest settlement, marry them off and tell them to shut up and multiply?
