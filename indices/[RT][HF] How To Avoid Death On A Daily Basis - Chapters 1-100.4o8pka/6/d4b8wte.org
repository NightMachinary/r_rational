Interesting so far.

Something stood out to me right away however. If this world is not a video game why are there natives acting like video game characters?

But why would they give the girls weapons at all? They're at a physical disadvantage as fighters of any kind (I won't even speculate on psychological differences) and any weapom they get would provide a greater relative benefit to a boy. Specially when they can be used instead to create new monster hunters and hunter creators in turn. Even if your scruples rebel at the idea of basically forcibly turning these girls into breeding machines---which given the technological level, environmental pressures and comparable historical context the natives would be living in, they should not---plenty of these girls would readily prefer this arrangement to almost certain death.

In video games, male and female characters have equal stats and are equally valuable; in real life we have nearly universal division of labour for a very good reason.

Will continue reading tomorrow, see if the issue is addressed at all.
