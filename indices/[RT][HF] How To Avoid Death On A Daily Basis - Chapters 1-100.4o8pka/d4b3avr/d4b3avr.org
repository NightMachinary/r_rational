Hi there! I was one of the people posting about it in the recommendation thread.

Despite the flaws and criticism, please don't be disheartened. My criticism was mostly about the character because he's suuuuuuch an immature ass sometimes. But the writing is enjoyable overalland I've found myself literally LOLing many times while reading. If some of the jokes fall short, well, it happens. I very much enjoyed most of what I read. Good job!

All that said, I wouldn't identify it as purely "rationalist." Still, it does have a lot of characteristics of rationalist writing - plus it is an original story, which frankly I find a lot more interesting than most fan fiction. It's a decent recommendation even if it doesn't really come across as rationalist.
