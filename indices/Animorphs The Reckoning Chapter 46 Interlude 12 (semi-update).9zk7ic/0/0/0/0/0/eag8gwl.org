TK17 never mentioned a deadline, I'm just suggesting one.

I don't think it's necessarily true that N chapters always take the same amount of time to write, because of planning around updates / psychology / batching etc.

My position is that if there are going to be more 6 month gaps in this fic, then I'd just prefer to lump them into one big final gap. If TK17 can publish a chapter every two weeks for the next 10 chapters, then I would switch to option A. But he's a busy person, so I doubt that's possible.
