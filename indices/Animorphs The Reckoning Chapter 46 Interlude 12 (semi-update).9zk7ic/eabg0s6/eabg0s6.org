I pick option B. The difference between a six month gap and a year gap for updates is not nearly as bad as the difference between a two week gap and a six month gap, because after 6 months I've mostly forgotten that r!Animorphs exists, and can just continue living in that ignorance.

I would be willing to wait a whole year for TK17 to finish the entire rest of r!Animorphs, to then be published in the span of a few very fun weeks. This may be more efficient from an authorial standpoint too, since chapters can be batch-written and batch-polished.
