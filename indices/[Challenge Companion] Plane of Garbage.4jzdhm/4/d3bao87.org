A friend of mine frequents a roleplaying site called Mizahar. The plane of garbage is called the Void, and there's a school of magic called Voiding built around putting things there (sometimes unwillingly), storing things there (convenient but risky), and even travelling there (neat loot, but the convenience of magic that lets you drop powerful occasionally undead enemies into an endless void of discarded magical waste means that it has a high incidence of /powerful undead enemies floating though an endless void of discarded magical waste/. And that portal you just opened is a good way back to the land of the living.
