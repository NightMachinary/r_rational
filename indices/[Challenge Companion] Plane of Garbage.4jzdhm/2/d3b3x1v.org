I like the idea of stranding a civilization or a colony on a junkyard plane, in which you are practically buried in technological and magical detritus from across realities.

Consequently, it's also a death world as mechas and killerbots are buried right next to giant starships, ready to be activated.

So yeah, scavenging is an awesome cool job, but you're never know what you're going to find.
