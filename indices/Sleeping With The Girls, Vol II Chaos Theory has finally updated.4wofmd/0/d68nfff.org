After almost two years, there's finally an update!

This is an amazingly well-written story of a self-insert and there are plenty of moments of cleverness, hilarity, and rationality as the SI reasons through the underlying laws of slap-stick comedy/tropes dictating the worlds he falls into.

The first part of the story begins [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality][here]]. Reading the first chapter should be enough to determine if you like the story or not.
