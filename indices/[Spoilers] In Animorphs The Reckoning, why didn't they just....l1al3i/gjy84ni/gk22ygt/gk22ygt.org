In the chapter where Jake first resurrects, they ask Elfangor about it, and he seems to suggest that he doesn't want to be resurrected, and that Crayak and Ellimist might even be strongly discouraging him from supporting that option

Cassie, though, I don't know. Jake consulted MORPH!Cassie post Asteroid, and they had already discussed resurrections back when Jake first cheated death.
