By the time they had figured out resurrection, I believe Cassie's morph had been lost.

As for Elfangor...remember he was sent to earth to destroy it. An autonomous Elfangor wouldn't necessarily be on their side, and on top of that Aximili going crazy with solitude shows that it would have been risking an /insane/ Elfangor.

Plus, by the time Marco started his Marclone thing they had lost both morphs anyway.
