Good points! To respond to them individually:

• Alcidia is intentionally different, partially because I couldn't remember who the actual Director was and partially because I've found it implausible in the story that there aren't at least a few pseudo-immortals running major political positions. There are, what, twenty thousand renacim? It's bizarre that they don't have a stronger grip on the politics of Aerb (although, to be fair, Vitrics are described as ‘long-lived').

• Radio was discovered on Aerb in 413 FE--- quite a while ago. On earth, there was about a gap of 30-40 years between the invention of radio and television; progress on Aerb is considerably slower, but I don't think it's unreasonable for Uniquities to have access to a prototype or an entad that performs a similar function.

• They know that the Dream Skewered are fabrications because they've talked to Speculator Masters in between the timing of the story and Juniper's own visit. For the same reason, they know most of the details of Earth, as Masters understood them, and have confirmation that Joon is dream-skewered.

• Worth the Candle is really long and frankly I'm surprised I was able to maintain any internal consistency in this oneshot at all. I'm a pretty new writer so I'm still getting a handle on these things. How A.W. does it, I may never know ¯_(ツ)_/¯
