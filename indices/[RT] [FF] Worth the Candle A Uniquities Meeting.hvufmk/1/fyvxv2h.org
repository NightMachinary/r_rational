I do like this, but there are a number of factual errors. Alcidia is the head of Uniquities, for one, though that could be an intentional change on your part. Aerb doesn't have video cameras, only crappy still cameras. Then there's various things that the characters probably shouldn't know at this point: That the Dream Skewered are almost entirely fabricated, that Joon is Dream Skewered, that Earth has better technology than Aerb, and that the Plane of Dreams isn't actually excluded. I think you could move the timetable of this meeting up to be after Anglecynn, which would let them know that Joon is dream skewered, and maybe they could read his testimony and infer that Earth is doing alright relative to Aerb even if they don't know about the technology. They might plausibly know the other two, but it's a little odd that they mention offhand knowledge that should be really rare.
