Say you have manton-limited (other than the user) telekinesis able to lift a few hundred lbs and let you fly around. The crucial mechanic to exploit however is that you have [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/semvkn56ZFcXBNc2d/superintelligence-5-forms-of-superintelligence][speed superintelligence]] and are thus able take subjective months carefully applying an application of telekinesis within a fraction of a second. One can also generate complex algorithms for controlling ones actions including telekinesis automatically, and while you don't have the know-how to improve your qualitative intelligence you can still reprogram your mind quite a lot.

- The telekinesis grants you a precise tactile sense of the resistance exerted by matter when telekinetic force is applied to it up to a resolution a fraction the width of a human hair. This is also what limits your precision (without using microscopes) because without seeing what you're doing you can't say manipulate individual microscopic molecules.
- The range on the telekinesis is a few miles.
- The telekinesis can lift say 400 lbs, but without limits on speed you could also in principle lift something [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/21/][/by firing small supersonic objects at it/]].

*What are some unconventional ways to exploit telekinesis with that kind of precision?*

I have a few physics based ideas, but I don't have the know-how to really explore them:

- Compressing a microscopic bubble of telekinetic force could likely be used to to create tiny amounts of fusion, with many applications depending on the specifics of how the math works out. One could also shield oneself from radiation with telekinetic barrier (though not massless radiation).

- Applying essentially a relativistic slap to a /minuscule/ mass of air ought to allow the generation of considerable radiation.

- Obviously against entities not resistant to absurdly fast projectile and radiation this power-set could be absurdly lethal.

- This could be used to image ones surroundings by applying minuscule amounts of telekinetic force to a massive area.
