Assuming you could apply all of that force onto a square with sides the width of a hair, 400 lb/(100 um)^{2} = 1.8 * 10^{11} Pa, /barely/ enough to rip graphene (UTS = 1.3 * 10^{11} Pa with perfect construction), and /easily/ enough to rip through structural steel (5 * 10^{8} Pa).

That's if the force is applied proportional to area (or volume). What if it's distributed based on mass?

The obvious munchkinry is to divide by zero: apply some force to a location in near-perfect vacuum, and channel all 1818 N of force into a single 1.6 * 10^{-27} kg hydrogen atom, for an acceleration of 1.1 * 10^{30} m/s^{2} (1.1 * 10^{29} g). I'm not quite sure what you could do with that, but it's /something/.
