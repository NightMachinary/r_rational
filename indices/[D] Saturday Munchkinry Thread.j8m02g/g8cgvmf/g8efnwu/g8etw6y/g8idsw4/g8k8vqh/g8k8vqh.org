The issue is you need to spend millions of years (if not orders of magnitude more) subjectively isolated from the world and working on this tech, with any "breaks" necessarily being a minuscule blip compared to time spent on research. Also I wouldn't exactly completely trust any AGI safety proposal developed entirely by one person, no matter how long they spend on it. People have their blind spots and time can only make up for that to a limited extent. Similarly breakthroughs are somewhat discontinuous so you might just /never/ make the breakthroughs needed on your own regardless of how long you spent working in total isolation.
