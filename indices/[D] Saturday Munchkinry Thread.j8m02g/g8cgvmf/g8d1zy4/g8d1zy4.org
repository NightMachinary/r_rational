Carry a bunch of microscopes around.

On a sunny day, your superspeed intelligence will let you calculate refraction angles such that you can telekinetically position your microscopes to focus the sunlight onto a single point, setting it on fire. With enough speed, you could rotate your microscopes quickly enough to keep that point on a moving/dodging enemy.

Not as effective as a real laser weapon, but very cheap. Especially if you have the power to pull out glass windows and reshape the glass into a lens.
