In principle you could create AGI much easier by just running algorithms inside your own mind, but the hard part is making the breakthroughs necessary for AGI (even if you have lots of subjective time and processing power). However there's a limit to how much subjective time somebody is going to want to spend in isolation doing AI research. Plus unless you were an AI researcher to begin with it would take absurd amounts of subjective time to make progress, if you could at all.
