Microscopic black holes of the mass this power could create will dissipate due to Hawking radiation in a fraction of a second. That being said this is still really good thinking because it gives you a way of turning (microscopic) amounts of matter directly into energy. Essentially by creating microscopic black holes you could make explosions of energy similar to creating an equivalent microscopic mass of antimatter.

Notably because of the tremendous pressure required I don't know whether black holes would be able to output as much energy as compressing a much larger (microscopic) mass to induce nuclear fusion (because of the massive difference in how much mass you could compress this much). Fusion doesn't get you very much of the fuel's mass-energy, but it requires orders of magnitude less pressure than compressing that fuel into a black hole.
