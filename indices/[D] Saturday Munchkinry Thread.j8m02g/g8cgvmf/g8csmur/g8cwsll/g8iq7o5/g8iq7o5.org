From some rough calculations, you can also do some neat stuff with more macroscopic objects. You can throw baseballs at around mach 4.5 or example (with 400 lbs of force).

If you scale it down enough you can in theory make a rough rpg esque weapon. By crushing down on metals you can make a stream of hypersonic molten metal, which can go through pretty much anything.

Keep scaling it down and you can squeeze materials into plasma (and maybe shoot it out?). It'll be a working plasma weapon.

Keep scaling it down and it becomes hotter plasma. There's some neat physics stuff happening but not sure it's gonna make much of a difference in terms of destructive potential.

I'm not sure you can scale it down much more from now, since even the best microscopes can't see inside atoms, so forming really small black holes probably isn't possible. If it were though, it'd be a nearly perfect way to convert a really tiny mass into pure energy, giving off a bunch of radiation.

Some more thoughts:

Since you have speed superintelligence you can probably manipulate air currents into tornadoes or hurricanes. It'll be a slow process with the amount of telekinesis potential but it'll definitely be possible.

You can probably form massive air lenses, or at least large ones. Might be able to burn people and buildings like ants with a magnifying glass.
