  If you scale it down enough you can in theory make a rough rpg esque weapon. By crushing down on metals you can make a stream of hypersonic molten metal, which can go through pretty much anything.

Wouldn't a solid projectile have much more penetrating power? It seems like molten metal ought to tend to splatter on impact imparting only a fraction of its energy to the target, instead of penetrating much. Weaponized plasma seems like it would have this problem even worse because of how rapidly it would expand once you weren't crushing it with telekinetic force.

As for mini-black holes the idea is that you'd create a microscopic bubble of telekinetic force and then crush that down. The feedback from the power wouldn't give you precise feedback at that scale, but you don't need to trap a /specific/ bunch of air molecules for shrinking the bubble until you can't anymore to work.

  Since you have speed superintelligence you can probably manipulate air currents into tornadoes or hurricanes. It'll be a slow process with the amount of telekinesis potential but it'll definitely be possible.

I'm not sure how this would work; 400 lbs is obviously not in the right ballpark to compare to the direct power of any tornado. All this power is going to be able to do is provide a small "nudge", but given weather is the definition of a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp8wGQW-Y48][chaotic system]] having lots of processing power doesn't /seem/ like it would let you control the weather any more effectively than existing tech which is pretty lackluster.
