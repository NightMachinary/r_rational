  The obvious munchkinry is to divide by zero: apply some force to a location in near-perfect vacuum, and channel all 1818 N of force into a single 1.6 * 10-27 kg hydrogen atom, for an acceleration of 1.1 * 1030 m/s2 (1.1 * 1029 g). I'm not quite sure what you could do with that, but it's something.

Physicists have detected cosmic rays with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh-My-God_particle][the individual energy of baseballs]]. Not sure what good that would do beyond creating a cone of radiation though (which would be highly penetrating and thus a very inefficient weapon). A near perfect vacuum is also probably unnecessary as you could create a microscopic tube of force that would accelerate individual gas molecules when they happened to fly into it. The real limit for most application like this is your telekinetic feedback precision. Since you can apply the force to a very specific point but would need expensive bulky equipment to ensure the microscopic thing you want to manipulate is in that exact spot.
