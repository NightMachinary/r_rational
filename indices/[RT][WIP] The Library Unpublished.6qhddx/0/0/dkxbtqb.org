Thanks :)

Chapter 0... well... You might have noticed that the last work on that list is The Library Unpublished. There's also the somewhat puzzling Editor's note on Chapter 1. Rest assured that we'll be learning more about what both of those mean, and while parts of Chapter 0 serve only to illustrate cio_cielle's character, other parts might be more relevant later.
