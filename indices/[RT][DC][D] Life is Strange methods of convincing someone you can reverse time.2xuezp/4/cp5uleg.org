How far can you rewind? Can you pick up a MacBookPro and full documentation on how to build it and rewind 10 years? It would need a LOT of documentation, but that would easily fit on a harddrive.

If you can do this, then you have just caused the Singularity. You go back 10 years to t=0, give a tech boost. Wait 10 years, then return to t=0 with the /new/ hottest tech. Repeat.

Actually, this would be the solution to Friendly AI. You create an AI and keep a copy of its source code. If it's Friendly, stop. If not, go back 10 years with the source code and tell them "try again."

Even if your limit is a few minutes, you could ensure the success of any parameterized operation -- note the parameters, watch the results, then go back to just before the test and tell them "don't use these parameters." Just make sure you always bring a list of all the failed parameters.
