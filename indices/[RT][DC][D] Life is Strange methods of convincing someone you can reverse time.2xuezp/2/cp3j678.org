  The game-breaker:

  1. Get them to lend you a unique object (signed photo, original artwork, etc.)
  2. Rewind. Now there's two of them.
  3. Profit. Literally, if you repeat the procedure with money.

Don't do this with cash, do it with something valuable for its own sake. Making more money doesn't actually help the world, it just redistributes the existing wealth a bit more in your favor.

Instead, start a store where you have one of everything in the back room. You could trade away anything from bags of diamonds (that started out as one diamond, before you doubled it a few times) to graphics cards and CPUs, to rare earth metals.

You have the potential to replace a lot of mining and manufacturing at trivially low costs. It would be a shame to waste that.
