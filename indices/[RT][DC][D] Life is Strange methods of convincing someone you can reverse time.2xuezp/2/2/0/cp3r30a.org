I can't make heads or tails of your reasoning, but I'm sure your conclusion is wrong. Let's break it down:

1. At t=0, there is an item on the table.
2. At t=1, you pick it up. Now it's in your hand.
3. Rewind to t=0. The item in your hand stays, but as t passes 1 going backwards, you see your past self's hand placing another copy of the item on the table (picking it up in reverse).
4. When you stop rewinding, there will be an item on the table and one in your hand. So if you stopped right here, there would permanently be two of them.
5. Put the one in your hand on the table.
6. Repeat the whole procedure as many times as you want. Infinite everything. And yes, as [[/u/MadScientist14159]] pointed out, goodbye 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.
