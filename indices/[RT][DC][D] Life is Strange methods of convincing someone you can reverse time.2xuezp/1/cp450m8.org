I have no additional solutions, I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the game so far, despite the fact that the main character is really weak-willed (I assume to give her room to grow in the next four chapters) and the science fiction aspect of it is almost completely unexplored. It's just really novel for a point-and-click game to give you the ability to rewind time, and they do a few of the clever things that the game Braid did with the mechanic.

I do, however, want to see what the story would look like with an actually competent protagonist instead of one that just wanders around the high school campus and uses this godly, broken power for conversational gambits. (If only the movie /Next/ were better, I would rewatch it to scratch my itch.)
