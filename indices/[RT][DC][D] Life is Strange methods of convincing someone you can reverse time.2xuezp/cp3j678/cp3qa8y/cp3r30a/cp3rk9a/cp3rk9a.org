If by "stopped right there", you mean permanently paused the flow of time, then yes, that works. But if you want to go to the store and buy things, then you're going to have to let time start flowing forwards again, and at some point you pass t=1 again going forwards, and you see yourself pick the item back up.

edit: unless you can /change/ the past, but I got the impression that we're working with a single-consistent-timeline model in this thread.
