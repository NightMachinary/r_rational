Oh, so there's your misunderstanding. In step 4, by "stop rewinding," I meant, "allow time to start flowing normally again." And by "stop right here," I meant, "discontinue further time-travel antics," or "break out of this algorithm." The game mechanics are more like those found in /Back to the Future/ than those in /Harry Potter/, so when you rewind to a certain point in time, all effects you had on the world after that point in time are effectively erased and you get a do-over, with your mind, body, and objects you have on your person persisting through the rewind.
