You don't get infinite everything. Assume you are invisible when traveling backwards to minimize confusion. From an outsider's perspective, this is what happens:

- At t = -3, there is an item(1) on the table
- At t = -2, another copy of you 'beams in'.
- At t = -1, the just-arrived you put another item(2) on the table.
- At t = 0, there are two identical items on the table, (1) and (2). (and two of you)
- At t = 1, the original you takes item(1).
- At t = 2, tHe original you 'beams out'.
- At t = 3, there is one item on the table(2).
