That's an interesting possibility. What do you think of, instead of trying to squeeze some computational power out of Time (or maybe after you tried, and got a distressingly coherent demand to stop), you decide to start putting letters down on the page, and promise that if, say, a letter isn't underlined, you'll change it to the next one in the alphabet, and if it is, then you'll leave it be and move on to the next. Maybe cycle through ASCII to give Time some symbols to right or draw with. Might be an interesting way of introducing Time as an actual character on some level.
