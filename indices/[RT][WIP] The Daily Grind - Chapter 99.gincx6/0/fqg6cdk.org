I'm betting that book is less worthless than it seems. Maybe not incredible, but it's not going to just be the paperback novel equivalent of a weird candy bar from Officium Mundi. At the very least it will probably reveal more about the nature of that dungeon's rewards. Hopefully next chapter James tries reading it.
