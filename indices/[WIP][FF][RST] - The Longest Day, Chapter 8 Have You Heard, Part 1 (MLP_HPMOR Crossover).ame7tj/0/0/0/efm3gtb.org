Most of the chapters I had planned out originally were meant to be roughly 10-15k words each, including this one. But I've broken a lot of them into two chapters just so I can release content a bit more consistently. The remainder of the defense final (and its initial explanation) will be found in Have You Heard, Part 2. The short version though is that an enchantment has been cast for the duration of the battle so that Rainbow Dash and Applejack can't understand Harry's army, and vice versa.
