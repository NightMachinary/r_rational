I enjoyed the conversation between Dash and Applejack, though I was extremely confused by... whatever the hell was going on with the Defense final. If confusion was the goal, then yeah. Well done.

I have a three-year-old kid who occasionally watches Friendship is Magic, but I haven't paid enough attention to the episodes to really appreciate any in-jokes or references. I'm guessing Fluttershy being unintentionally creepifying is one of them?
