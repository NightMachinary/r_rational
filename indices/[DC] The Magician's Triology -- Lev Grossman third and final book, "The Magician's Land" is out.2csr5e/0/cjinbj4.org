My copy of the third book just came in the mail yesterday, and I heartily second the recommendation with a single caveat - the main character does not start out terribly likable. I personally had no problem with it, since it reminded me a lot of how I was as a nerdy intellectual teenager, but it's the single thing that's most likely to reduce your enjoyment of the book if that kind of thing bothers you. On more positive notes, these books are one of the few in my long career as a fantasy reader to actually make magic feel /magical/. I love "magic as engineering", but /The Magicians/ at several points made me go "Holy crap, they're doing magic!"
