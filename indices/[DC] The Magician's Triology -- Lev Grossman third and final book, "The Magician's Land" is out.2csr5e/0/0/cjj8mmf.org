/The Magicians/ came out just as I was entering high school, prime time for the unlikeable nerdy intellectual teenager, and I just ate it up. It captured something remarkably human; that even with wonder and adventure and opportunity, people are still themselves, and a situation cannot make you happy forever if you're not that kind of person. Plus, the multiversebuilding was great, and I would like to learn more about the makers and magic.

I'm saving up for the third book, and hope to be able to read it soon (not like the library's going to get it!).
