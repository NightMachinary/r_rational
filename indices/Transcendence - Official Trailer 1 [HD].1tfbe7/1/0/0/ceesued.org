Well first of all there's a bit of a difference between wanting to make sure that it's safe and being "anti-tech" and shooting lead scientists. Besides, I'm at the point where if researchers were being targeted and research was being lost I would gamble on getting a great scientist uploaded as it is preferable to the singularity never happening during my lifetime.
