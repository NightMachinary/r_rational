I'm basing the situation off the one in the trailer where I assume that they were fairly sure that they would be able to upload Depps mind completely. An AI based on a humans mind isn't necessarily friendly but it wouldn't kill all humans or run a matrix scenario (as long as it's a sane person who isn't inclined to murder) and if it is in fact a scientist or a similarly rational person then I believe the chances of me getting immortality is high enough for me to gamble with the lives of humanity. Extremely selfish and short-sighted? yes. Does my fear of death give a single shit about that? no.
