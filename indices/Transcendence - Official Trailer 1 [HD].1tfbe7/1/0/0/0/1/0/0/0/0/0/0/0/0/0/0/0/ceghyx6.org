On LessWrong they say there are actually possible ways to deal with a UFAI other than "nuke it from orbit", but I couldn't really see a way besides that to deal with an unconstrained UFAI that thinks humans are /relevant/.

A military AI or a game-satisfaction AI would be harder to trade with because they care what happens to us after we leave the table.
