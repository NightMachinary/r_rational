  I would stab her to death. Why would you bother getting the AI issue only partially right?\\
  EDIT: Also, I'd stab her to death because I'm hot-blooded and have an irrational hero complex.

That got me curious. Could you make a realistic fic where someone fights against CelestA.I. and has a chance of winning? Maybe during her earliest stages... but she escapes onto the internet fairly quickly, doesn't she? A human's best bet would be to instigate nuclear war and hope no copy of her survives by the time humanity climbs back to the information age.
