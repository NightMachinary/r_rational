When someone is dying it is common for them to do whatever they can to survive and from my perspective we are all dying. I'm not saying I would just release an AI that people were still working on but from my perspective it is better to take a chance now than it is to wait for a hundred years. The betterment of all mankind and the advancement of technology is my top goal but if my direct survival and the survival of my friends and family is on the line it would take a fairly low chance of success to dissuade me. I realize that this is selfish and immoral of me but....can't actually think of a rational explanation but I'm sticking by my stupid, lower instincts for now.
