Ahh, I see the distinction. The second article says there has been gene transfer between organisms throughout history, which I took to mean that it was there as the result of common ancestors, since I'm not sure how else arachnid or fungal DNA would show up in our genome. If that's the case, do we not yet have evidence in the genome of having evolved from ever simpler organisms along with other mammals, down to shared types of bacteria?
