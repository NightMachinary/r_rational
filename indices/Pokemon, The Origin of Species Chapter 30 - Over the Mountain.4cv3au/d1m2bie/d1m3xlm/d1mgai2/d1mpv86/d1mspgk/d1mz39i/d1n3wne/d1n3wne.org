Personally, I avoid spending as much time on ffnet as I can because otherwise I'll suffer the same issue people do from tvtropes. I'll look at an author's favorites that I like, find three that I might find interesting, and there I go for a month (and I never want to close that window, so it makes my computer lag a bit), haha...

It's part of the reason I'm grateful for this subreddit as a happy medium between me and ffnet.
