Thanks, glad you liked it!

I spend quite a bit of time researching, which is part of why each chapter takes so long. Sometimes I'll spend hours trying to figure something out, just to have it turn out that it doesn't work how I want or need it to to use in the story. That can be frustrating, but at least I'm always learning :) Glad to see it's appreciated!
