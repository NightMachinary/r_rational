Did you mean viral? mtDNA is theorized to have a bacterial origin. However, it's retroviruses that integrate their DNA into the host genome, which may end up getting stuck there. Other than that, prokaryote vs eukaryotes actually don't share much similarities in their cellular machinery, for example [[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/rna-transcription-by-rna-polymerase-prokaryotes-vs-961]]
