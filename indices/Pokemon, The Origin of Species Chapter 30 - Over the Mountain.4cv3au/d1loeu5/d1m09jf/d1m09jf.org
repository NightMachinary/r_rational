  Not clear as to who 'he' refers to in both cases. I'm about 80% sure it's Blue, but perhaps this could be rephrased slightly.

Red the first time, Blue the second :) Fixed!

  Did you mean viral?

I was referring to the research mentioned in [[http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/36108/title/Bacterial-DNA-in-Human-Genomes/][these]] [[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/03/humans-may-harbor-more-100-genes-other-organisms][articles]]. Viruses apply too, but apparently so do bacteria. Has this research been debunked since?
