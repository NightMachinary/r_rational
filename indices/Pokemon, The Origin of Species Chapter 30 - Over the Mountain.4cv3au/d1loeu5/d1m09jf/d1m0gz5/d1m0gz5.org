First off, thank you for the article, that was a fascinating read. I've taken a look at it myself, and I'd like to point out this blurb from it:

#+begin_quote
  Rather than looking for bacterial genes that had become permanent parts of the human genome, Dunning Hotopp's team searched for traces of microbial DNA in somatic cells---the cells of the body that do not form gametes.

In this chapter, you pointed out the presence of bacterial DNA in the genome as an evolutionary artifact. In the article linked, they describe how different somatic cells (ex stomach) contain more species-specific bacterial sequences than others. If this were present as an evolutionary artifact, the bacterial sequences would be present throughout all somatic cells and the gametes.
