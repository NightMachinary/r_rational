Two articles. Oh. Each word was a link. Oh.

Okay so first one's in 2013, second's 2015. Let's take a look.

Alright, so, this blurb:

  The paper doesn't give any hints as to how the genes---which now play established roles in metabolism, immune responses, and basic biochemistry---may have been transferred or the exact timeline of the jumps, he says. That will take more work.

Fungal DNA is pretty straightforward, actually, we do get quite a bit of fungal infections so I don't find that completely out of the question for a horizontal gene transfer. Arachnid? More likely to be an artifact.

So what I think needs to be clarified here is the idea of conservation in the genome. A highly conserved gene is a gene that does its function so well, or has such an important function, that even changing it a little will result in a serious hit to fitness. In short, 'it ain't broke, don't even think about tweaking it'. The concept that this chapter seems to be trying communicate is that the human (and Pokemon) genome somehow has highly-conserved genes that are shared with bacteria, which point to us having evolved so long ago from bacterial ancestors. I'm making a point to say highly-conserved genes here, because if they weren't, they'd be lost very quickly to evolutionary time. A gene which isn't very important tends to get changed very quickly, much like a tool you use only once a year being lost easily. From my knowledge, eukaryotes don't share a whole lot of genes with prokaryotes. HOWEVER...

This brings me back to the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) topic. You may have heard of this before: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis]] In short, it's a theory that mitochondria and plastids in plants were originally bacteria that didn't get successfully digested by our eukaryotic ancestors and instead became permanent tenants in our cells. Mitochondria and plastids share a LOT of similarities with prokaryotes. Additionally, mtDNA is very slow to change and mtDNA analysis is used as a method to differentiate very similar-looking species. Some reading for you here: [[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cells/organelles/]]

"Do new species of pokemon that get discovered still have the same markers in their genome?" Genome and mtDNA sequencing will tell you a lot about the history of a species. You'd look at the genome sequence first, then mtDNA if the genome is too similar. Here's a paper where they take a look at the mtDNA of sponges to see their evolutionary history: [[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-003-1178-5#/page-1]]

Edit: Ok, I'm good for now.

Another edit: No, I'm not. Here's some research that theorizes that our eukaryotic ancestors actually came from archaea instead! [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/05/06/newly-discovered-missing-link-called-loki-ties-us-to-our-single-celled-ancestors/]]
