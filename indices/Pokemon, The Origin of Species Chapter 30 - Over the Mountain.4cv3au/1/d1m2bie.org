Yay, another chapter from my current favourite fanfiction! Thank you very much. (And on my cake-day!)

Though I love listening to the group and their dynamics, I am looking forward to exploring the more overreaching plot. The traditional "journey fic" provides a good plot skeleton, but I can't wait until things get more serious and the characters are tested more extremely. It's nice to see you world build and establish the identities of the characters, but if it keeps going without a more serious plot to supplement it, it runs the risk of becoming boring.

I have a question about your release schedule. Is there any particular reason you chose once-a-month, rather than, say, in batches like HPMOR? Writing-wise, are you far ahead of the release schedule, or are you releasing just about as fast as you write them? Also, is there an email list? I sometimes forget to check at the beginning of every month.
