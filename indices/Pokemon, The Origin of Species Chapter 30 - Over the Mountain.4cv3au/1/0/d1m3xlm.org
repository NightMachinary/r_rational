I can definitely understand that frustration, as I sometimes feel impatient to get to some of the plot points I have in mind. A lot of what seems like random adventures or unrelated info will become relevant later in the story, and I'm probably not doing a perfect job of striking the right balance between the two. That said, now that a lot of the world building and characters have been established and begun developing, the distance between "important" events should be shorter :)

I write one chapter a month and release everything as I write it, not counting outlines or worldbuilding stuff. I decided against batches like HPMOR because I've found having a deadline really helps me focus on getting writing done rather than endlessly editing, which is a trap I've fallen into in the past.

There's currently no email list, but if you make a fanfiction account you can Follow the story and get email notifications whenever a new chapter goes up. I'm working on my website currently, and when it's up I'll be sure to include things like an email list or RSS feed.
