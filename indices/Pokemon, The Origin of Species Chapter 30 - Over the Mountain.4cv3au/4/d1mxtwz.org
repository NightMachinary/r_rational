Loved the youngster Joey jokes! Gold was the first game I had and I've never forgot about him.

How much research do you do for this fic when it comes to the science bits? Because it is seriously impressive to read that kind of science in a fan fiction about Pokemon, where normally everything just gets explained as 'it's Pokemon, accept it' by other authors.

Again great chapter and keep it up!
