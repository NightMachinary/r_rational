  Regardless, the common tropes about heterosexual marriage today are crud. They also tend to be to women's detriment. Wives are referred to as a ball and chain (yeah, and I'm the handle; together we're a morning star, so don't mock us). Special wedding shoes exist -- for women, they often have "I" written on one sole and "do" on the other; for men, it's "save" and "me". Cake toppers feature women dragging men who are trying desperately to crawl away. That's not healthy.

  Marriage is helpful for a man's career. It indicates to a boss that a man is at a relatively stable point of life, which means he's less likely to leave the company. For a woman's career, it's a detriment: it's a risk factor for pregnancy, and bosses expect women to take extra time in parental leave. They expect women to spend more time on childcare and be less available and have less energy for their job. That means married women are less likely to be hired or promoted, which means married men get paid more on average, which means if anyone in a heterosexual marriage needs to take unpaid leave or quit their job, it's the wife rather than the husband. (And this is on top of wage discrimination.) Vicious cycle.
