  If 20% of people litter, a law against littering is a bad one?

Queen Bunny: "The law is a blunt instrument, a last resort for using the violence of the state. Attempting to modify large-scale behavioural patterns isn't what a criminal code is best at - there are other avenues a government can pursue for such social policies, to tweak the incentives people face. Turning twenty percent of the population into criminals has all sorts of downsides."

  marriage exists because marriage as an institution is good for society. Mostly this has to do with children if you want to say "two brothers deserved the same tax breaks you would give a married couple" I think you need some data to justify that in some way.

Quoth the Queen: "Given that my goal with this proposal is to reduce blackmailable corruption among certain high-power groups, then as long as treating households as the fundamental unit of taxation instead of individuals doesn't cause significant harm, does it really matter if it doesn't create much economic benefit?"

  Of course, governments go about this inefficiently

Queenly quotation: "The aspect that I'm spending the most time on right now is figuring out what the initial set of default assumptions would be. They could be modified in the light of experience after the policy is put in place, but I'm talking about things like when someone who moves in with someone else is considered to be part of the household, and so on. A lot of such details can be fudged by making it easy for the citizenry to file a notice with the government that they're joining or leaving a particular household, but the less such paperwork is required, the easier it will be to make it a popular policy that will help win votes for the legislators involved."
