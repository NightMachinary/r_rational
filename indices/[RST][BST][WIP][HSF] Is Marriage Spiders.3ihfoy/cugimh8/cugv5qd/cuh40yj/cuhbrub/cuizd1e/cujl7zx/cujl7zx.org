Not so much. Government departments tend to be created by acts of whichever party is in office, sometimes with cross-factional backing. They're dissolved the same way. The decision about whether to keep them going tends to be made at the top levels without much reference to whether they're justifying themselves economically.

As long as their actions are justifying them /politically/, or at least they're not so terrible that they're a significant and major concern for national-level politicians, they're not in much danger of being decommissioned or significantly altered. Their budget might be tinkered with, but that's not usually related to their past performance, but how much money is in the government kitty overall (and, to a degree, any political lobbying for/against them, but that's also not generally based on their performance).
