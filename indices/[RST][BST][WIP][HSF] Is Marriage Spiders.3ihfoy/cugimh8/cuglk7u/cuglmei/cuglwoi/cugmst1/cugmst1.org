So your argument is:

- A law against something some significant minority of people do (such as littering) would be impossible to enforce consistently.
- Because it is impossible to enforce consistently, it would be enforced selectively.
- Selective enforcement gives too much power to the enforcer.
- An enforcer with too much power would abuse it in ways detrimental to society.

I personally think selective enforcement is just /how policing works/ and that not only is this inevitable, it's also beneficial in the face of limited resources and individual circumstances. If you have a problem with police officers using selective enforcement in a biased way, the problem isn't with selective enforcement, it's with the bias; removing selective enforcement (if such a thing were even possible) without removing the biases is just going to leave you with the same problem you had before.
