  If there is some law that, say, twenty percent of people routinely violate, then it's a bad law.

First off, completely disagree with this. If 20% of people litter, a law against littering is a bad one? If 20% of people use their cellphone while driving, having a law against it is bad? If 20% of people routinely violate a law, that says something about what incentives are in place; poor enforcement of the law is the primary culprit, whether that's because of apathy on the part of those who enforce the laws or an inability to enforce the law effectively (due to time or budget). "Everybody does it" is not a good argument and it becomes even less good of an argument when you pare it down to a smaller set than "everybody".

Second, there are a few reasons that marriage exists, but I think we can (for the moment) ignore the cultural/inertial/religious ones. If we're just talking about what the government's role /should be/ then marriage exists because marriage as an institution is good for society. Mostly this has to do with children; a child raised by a single parent has worse outcomes, even when correcting for socioeconomic background, so it's good for society if we do /something/ to ensure that children have more than one parent (research is sparse on plural parentage). So if you want to say "two brothers deserved the same tax breaks you would give a married couple" I think you need some data to justify that in some way. Is it better for society that those two are living together? I don't know the answer to that question; it's a question that you would want to solve with research rather than just making a guess or trying to use your imagination.

Of course, governments go about this inefficiently, because they're governments. Also because in most places in the world, governments are more responsive to people than actual outcomes. Plus institutional inertia.
