  Wouldn't this State Confessor have to reveal whether or not a secret had been confessed to them, in order for this insurance to pay out?

If someone threatens to disclose a politician's secret, the politicians can just disclose it himself and collect lots of money as a consolation prize, but only if the secret was disclosed to the Confessor before.

If the politician does something illegal to appease his blackmailers and the government finds out, the Confessor is going to reveal the secret anyway. That means it's usually safer for the politician to just ignore the blackmailers, and if the blackmailers then release the secret, at least the insurance money will be a consolation prize.

  Is there a way to avoid the obvious perverse incentives involved in leaking one's own secrets?

If politicians start disclosing their own secrets before someone else threatens to do it for them, all I can say is MISSION FUCKING ACCOMPLISHED.
