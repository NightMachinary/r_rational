I'd say that selective enforcement is inevitable, but fair selective enforcement, while a hard problem, is one we already need to solve. As someone who lives in the United States, I'd rather get away from police as an enforcement mechanism and decommission the police altogether.

Portland, Oregon based group Rose City Copwatch assembled [[https://rosecitycopwatch.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/alternatives-to-police-draft.pdf][a collection of alternatives to having a police force]]. Most of them only partially address the relevant problems, but taken together, they would greatly reduce the need for a police force.

That's getting a little off topic, but it's still relevant.
