It seems to me that you and most other people in this thread approach the problem of selective enforcement qualitatively. Either enforcement is selective, or it is not.

This is exactly the wrong approach. There is always some degree of selective enforcement, no matter the implementation. It doesn't mean all implementations are equal.

Some laws are much more prone to selective enforcement, like littering law. Others are less prone.

I agree that selective enforcement of any laws has bad consequences, as outlined by other posters. I think that reducing potential for selective enforcement by implementing policies that are less vulnerable to it is a good thing. Biases and problems that cannot be removed can often be reduced, and should be reduced.
