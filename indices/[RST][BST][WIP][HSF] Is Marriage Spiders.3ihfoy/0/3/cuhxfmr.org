Uh I'm pretty sure you don't actually believe that the government's role is to maximise societal goodness, nor do I think you actually belive that the institution of marriage was implemented because or maintained because or even has any evidence supporting that it is good for society.

Your logic is pretty irrelevant since you can do it from the other direction as well, in particular how the current incarnation of marriage limits polygamy which is probably social good maximising, I say probably due to evolution but I could be wrong .

Also I am surprised you support marriage considering the mental construct I have for you.
