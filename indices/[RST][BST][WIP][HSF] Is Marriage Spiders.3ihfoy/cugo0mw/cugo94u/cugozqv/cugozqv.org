Mine. One of our Presidents was a former Catholic priest who got into a sex "scandal" for having had sex with underage girls in the past. At least one of them got pregnant and had a son.

I put "scandal" in quotes because very few people cared. He was later impeached over an entirely different matter.

Then again, in my country politicians can get away with almost anything, which is obviously problematic and probably not something any society should aspire to imitate.
