The core idea behind a modern, healthy marriage is the buddy system. It's easy to flounder alone, and having a second person means you have help recovering. People get bored alone, so you add another person to make things more fun. People get lonely, so we bring in other people for company.

There are good arguments to be made toward making such relationships more flexible and encouraging explicit negotiation rather than a single option conflating a bunch of aspects of a relationship. On the other hand, people tend to follow well-advertised routes, so it's good to have a limited number of prototypes for this relationship.

Regardless, the common tropes about heterosexual marriage today are crud. They also tend to be to women's detriment. Wives are referred to as a ball and chain (yeah, and I'm the handle; together we're a morning star, so don't mock us). Special wedding shoes exist -- for women, they often have "I" written on one sole and "do" on the other; for men, it's "save" and "me". Cake toppers feature women dragging men who are trying desperately to crawl away. That's not healthy.

Marriage is helpful for a man's career. It indicates to a boss that a man is at a relatively stable point of life, which means he's less likely to leave the company. For a woman's career, it's a detriment: it's a risk factor for pregnancy, and bosses expect women to take extra time in parental leave. They expect women to spend more time on childcare and be less available and have less energy for their job. That means married women are less likely to be hired or promoted, which means married men get paid more on average, which means if anyone in a heterosexual marriage needs to take unpaid leave or quit their job, it's the wife rather than the husband. (And this is on top of wage discrimination.) Vicious cycle.

Fidelity is assumed, but more so for women than for men. This is changing slowly -- the media I have consumed suggests that it was pretty much expected and accepted for reasonably wealthy men to have a mistress in the 1700s, but today less so.

There's a lot more that's problematic in marriage, but if I bring it up, I'm in for quite a bit of argument, and it'll be my facts and figures which I must laboriously hunt down versus insinuations and cultural stereotypes that take no effort to spew forth. That's exhausting, and I'm ill today.
