  Trying to change legal definitions isn't going to do much, if what you're worried about is blackmail.

QB: "Blackmail /and/ corruption. One of the classic ploys to neutralize a rip-roaring newcomer to a political scene is to get them involved in the smallest corrupting thing imaginable - maybe go to a party where there's someone under the drinking age with a glass of champagne. And then, step by step, integrate them into the existing political class. I'm hoping that removing 'infidelity' from the class of what can be considered 'just slightly worse than what the politician has done so far', it will at least take slightly longer to turn an honest statesman into a corrupt politician... and maybe even keep an otherwise-honest elected official with a taste for multiple partners from being dragged onto that road in the first place."
