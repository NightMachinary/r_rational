  It's the fact that mistresses - or, more rarely, the opposite-sex equivalent - are both still so widespread but now so disparaged that leads to the whole blackmail issue. Decriminalizing the breaking of monogamous marriage oaths plus tweaking the tax system, by setting the base unit as 'households', to tweak the incentives faced by men who would otherwise cheat on their legal spouse is the closest I've been able to think of to a minimal-downside social policy.

Breaking the monogamous marriage oaths isn't criminal in most jurisdictions. It's a criminal act in 40% of the United States, most Muslim countries, and large swaths of Africa, but not other places. In the United States, those states in which it's illegal don't usually enforce it (but it stays on the books anyway, because no politician is going to go to bat for removing it - prosecution is dubiously legal following a series of Supreme Court cases anyway).

People still hate cheaters though; that's the real reason that blackmail is going to work. So long as a woman would divorce her wife over having an extramarital affair, there's going to be potential for blackmail. So long as a democratic society would refuse to vote for someone who had an extramarital affair, there's going to be blackmail.

And even if you have the government define "household" instead of "marriage", people are still going to get married, it's just that they'll do it on their own. There are a multitude of places where the government now just grants "civil partnership" but people in those places refer to their "husband" or "wife" instead of "civil partner".

Trying to change legal definitions isn't going to do much, if what you're worried about is blackmail.
