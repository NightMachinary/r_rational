Hey. Thanks for the tip, but I still haven't managed to figure it out. Where should I add that line of code exactly? In reddit when creating a new post? Or on my website? I have tried adding it to the title of my posts and the website itself, but that isn't working. Are you saying I should edit the site's code itself somehow?

As you might be able to tell, I'm a bit of a newb at this :P
