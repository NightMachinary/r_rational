Ok so far so good.

i am enjoying the behavior you've shown of Sakura and Naruto in this chapter, making his crush seem natural, rather than PRETTY GIRL MUST HAVE! the canon had.

The refusal to learn by his body goodly describes acrasia people expirience IRL. I am wondering from a AU perspective if there is hidden reason for this, like say, someone lowering his mental faculties to keep him in check.

Speaking of hidden reasons, You have used RST tag in posting this fanfic, so my question is: In what way is this fanfic different to canon? Because so far the changes seem small and Naruto behaves sort of like his OG self, only well written.
