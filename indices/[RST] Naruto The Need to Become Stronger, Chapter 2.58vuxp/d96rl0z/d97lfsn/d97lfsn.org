  You have used RST tag in posting this fanfic, so my question is: In what way is this fanfic different to canon?

You just read a segment about a precocious boy and a studious girl researching the nature of magic using pure logic - that could have been a scene straight from HPMOR. Before that there was a scene with an evil cynical teacher explaining that the , and before that a scene which introduced a villain who actually uses his brain instead of confronting Minato head-on (like the masked man did in canon did, despite being able to TELEPORT, and then not using that teleportation to do anything meaningful for the rest of the story). Idem Dito.

The difference is that HPMOR is pure wish-fulfillment fantasy, while NTBS tries to be more realistic. HJPEV knows everything about science at age 11 and everything he does is awesome and every challenge he encounters is perfectly set up to be solvable with the tools he has which he was given for free. He seems super rational because the story is stacked in his favour in a way that would never happen in real life.

Naruto in NTBS on the other hand is much smarter than in canon, but he is still clearly /Naruto/ - and even if he is the main character who is supposed to save the world, the rest of the world doesn't necessarily know that. So he may seem less rational, but I don't think that makes NTBS any weaker as a rationalist story, not at all.
