  If humans have starships, NOW how do you explain the Fermi Paradox?
#+end_quote

Technology continues to increase. Interstellar travel isn't feasible without FTL. You run into the biodome problem with generation ships and your ecosystem becomes non-salvagable. You run into maintenance issues with sleeper ships, and never wake up.

So exploring other star systems can't work without FTL. And once you have FTL, the same principles immediately unlock an entirely new kind of universe you can access, a new way of existing, that is so much better in all ways that even the most backward religious conservative from any sentient species - perhaps them first if they have a concept of heaven - emmigrates.

After discovering FTL, your world goes dead overnight by mass mutual consent. None can resist the allure of what's on the other side, and they don't want to.
