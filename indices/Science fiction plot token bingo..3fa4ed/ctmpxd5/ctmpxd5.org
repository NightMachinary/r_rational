Seeds! The universe filled up 10 billion years ago. We're currently residing within a certain alien's territory as a long-term experiment that race is performing. They just need to stay out of our way.

Simulation! We're just a simulation running in some alien supercomputer (explaining why our universe apparently has a minimum resolution). They wouldn't need to simulate the (possibly infinite) universe either, just our light-cone.

Transcendence! We're on the verge of reaching a new plane of existence, where many aliens have gone before.
