  "You have a universal assembler that can build more universal assemblers... and you have versatile robots that can put together a railgun to launch your landing party back to space, and you're talking about splitting up your starship instead of building a new one?"

Anything that can't be built by the universal assemblers from planetside materials will still be a problem. Most likely the fuel - antimatter's a bitch to make, but even if you're using uranium, that's not exactly common. Or it could be something annoyingly mundane: if your universal assemblers can't transmute elements, lead shielding will be hard to make.

Whatever the limiting factor is, it'll mean building a second ship is only possible if it takes something important away from the first one.
