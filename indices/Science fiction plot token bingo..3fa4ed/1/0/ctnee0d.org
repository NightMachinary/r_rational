I think a more narratively satisfying reason is that the Goa'uld just aren't very smart or creative, are unable to harness human and most of their technology is parasitized from more advanced cultures, so they didn't actually know how any of it works and end up with very rigid, regimented uses.

A "Chimpanzees using guns" sort of scenario. One more plot token bingo idea. }

In the Goa'uld's case it's pretty easy to imagine. I mean, what with the genetic memory, the Goa'uld are basically one person copied over many times, and if they're not /complete/ idiots it might be the benefit of millions of years.
