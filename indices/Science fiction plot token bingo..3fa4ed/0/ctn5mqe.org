Humans /are/ the ancient elders. The Fermi paradox fails to account for the fact that we're pretty early on in the universe's lifetime, and we really need heavier elements that come from the death of the first wave of stars in order to get complex chemistry, and there simply haven't been that many novas to enable planets with heavy elements to form. Earth is actually one of the earliest planets to have life and the earliest in our arm of the galaxy to gain intelligent life.

(We'll send out a fleet of probes at very fast sublight speeds. They'll reproduce, find terraformable planets, and seed the galaxy with our descendants.)
