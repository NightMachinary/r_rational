Hard to test the abstract, universal-range ones; a caesura is after all a short pause, so you can't tell if it has more than local range.

Death is tricky to test, but I think you could probably do a caesura on suffering in your immediate vicinity, or on a specific person; it's only a couple seconds, though. What can you get done with that?

Can't caesura stupidity, stupidity isn't defined/concrete enough. Could caesura a particular fallacy or mental block on a particular subject.
