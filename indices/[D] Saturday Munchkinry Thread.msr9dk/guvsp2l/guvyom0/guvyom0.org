Okay, so here's a wall of text of things to test. Some of them might seem silly, but they could also be critical if they work.

Well, we've established that you can arrest the momentum of things relative to your frame. What counts as a thing? Is an organ a thing? Can I stop someone's heart but not the rest of them? What about their skin, which I can see, but not the rest of them? Could I run a short distance forward and stop something so that it drifts in the direction I was running? Can I do this to things people are wearing and carrying? Can I stop things relative to part of my body's inertial reference frame (such as to my hand)? What is the smallest thing I can stop? The largest thing? What happens when I stop a stopped thing after I change my reference frame's movement? Can anything disrupt a stopped object? What if stop a piece of paper, and then try to cut something like wood on the edge? Can I stop liquids and gases? Can I stop something I can't perceive but know exists close by?

I can stop time for myself. How am I perceiving things? How can I displace the air if it is stopped? If it isn't stopped, could the continued movement of air be used to disrupt events? Does the continued movement of the things I need to function mean that every use of this time stop power noticed by everyone who knows what to look out for? Of course, with time stopped there is a bunch of things you can do if you can move like I recall being possible with Time Stop from D&D. Want to end someone's life? Pretty simple. Even if them being frozen means you can't displace their flesh, you can still put poison, liquids, or ball bearings in their mouth. Take your pick. I'll not dwell too much on other uses, and I can't think of much else to test.

You can cause others to have an emotional time out. What counts as an emotion? Am I stopping it hormonally, mentally, or both? If I can stop the emotion hormonally, can I stop other hormonal responses? Similarly, other mental processes? Does the timeout stop them having an intrinsic value to what they were emotional about (such as stopping an angry reaction to a person also stopping them caring about the person in a negative manner)?

I admit that the only power I had many good tests for was the inertial stopping power, but I hope this helped!
