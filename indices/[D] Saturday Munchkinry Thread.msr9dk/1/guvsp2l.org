Reposting mine from last week, since I posted it a bit late:

You are a world traveler, picking up small powerups with each trip. Previously, your powerups have been both relatively minor (social stuff and wilderness survival, mostly) and well-defined. For example, disease resistance is explicit about both what it targets (all pathogens, but not cancer) and how it targets it (your immune system's standard mechanisms and pathways).

Your recent powerup is the capstone of your 15 journeys thus far, and it has no description; only the title, caesura. In your testing, you realize that it is extremely broad. (For example: you can stop time for yourself for a short duration, a-la the D&D Time Stop spell. You can stop perceptual time for someone else. You can cause yourself or another person to have an emotional time-out. You can arrest the momentum of an object relative to your inertial reference frame. You can cause any people playing music with you to have a perfect caesura.)

What are some of the things you do to try to test just how broad it is? What are some of the ways you exploit it? You do not generally have access to any other forms of magic, but you do have the ability to recruit allies / make friends who might have magic in various forms (but not ones you can make specific predictions or assumptions about; "spells that do damage", sure, "the Starlance from Blue Core", definitely not).

(One of the funnier things you could do with this power is get on a train and caesura an object or person not on the train. This would result in them instantly (or at least, faster than human perception, so about 10 milliseconds) accelerating to your velocity relative to the planet you're on.)
