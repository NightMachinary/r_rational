If I flip a coin, guess what it is, then look at it, presumably I guess correctly 60% of the time.

Suppose I prepare two urns, one with two white balls and three black, one with three white balls and two black. My assistant flips a coin to decide which to hand me. I predict what color of ball I will draw. I draw a ball, put it back, then look in the urn. What % of the time does my prediction match the majority color?

The most straightforward way to model this would be to erase a random third of the rounds where my intuition was wrong from time. In that case, my prediction would match the majority color 52% of the time. I'll run with that model.

Have my assistant write the result of a coin throw on each card of a 52-card deck. Have him draw a card (not telling me which), ask my guess about the coin result, then write it on the card as well. (Presumably about 60% of my predictions match the result, and whenever he asked me twice for the same card I made the same prediction.) Have him ask my guess about what prediction is written on a card, and presumably I will perform as well as in the previous sentence.

Suppose I guess the next 100 bits my assistant will write down, then tell my assistant to copy that sequence, flipping a random 40% of bits. My power might find that it can predict whatever it pleases; the predictions may well spell out "bewareparadox".

A bitcoin nonce is a 256-bit binary number, of which about one in 2^{76} mine a bitcoin. I could guess each bit of the next bitcoin block's nonce, but I dare not risk paradox. Roll a random binary string foo of length 170. Call a nonce that starts with foo a foo-nonce. Call the first winning nonce in some pseudorandom order of all foo-nonces the cool nonce. Guess each bit of the cool nonce. Have a mining program try all foo-nonces in increasing order of edit distance from my guess. Presumably I find the cool nonce within about 2^{86*0.4} tries, so at a trillion-fold speedup over your usual miner. Be careful with that, people might ask how you managed to mine with no real hardware.

Throw 101 coins. For each coin but the first, guess whether it shows the same result as the first. Look at all but the first. If ~60% of the 100 guesses are right, I can deduce what the first coin shows. What now?
