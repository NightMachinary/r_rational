That works out. Heck, throw in some torture and you can get it up to the death energy to raise 4 people. Note that raise dead has some side effects in its text description:

#+begin_quote
  Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 Hit Die) when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level or a Hit Die to an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be raised). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.
#+end_quote

So the first time this happens, a person is permanently weakened by around 1/5th to 1/7th of their total health/resilience, repeating until they are at around 1/5th-1/7th their original healthiness and each subsequent sacrifice further reduces their stamina by around 1 standard deviation relative to a baseline human. (I might added in the description on relative HD of baseline humans while you were posting, but if anything this is generous compared to if Earth humans were 1 HD commoners)

So I don't consider this an exploit so much as a trade off: someone can temporarily sacrifice themselves and be permanently weakened by the process to save someone else's life.

Also note the decay rate in holding onto death energy so you can't stock up too much this way.
