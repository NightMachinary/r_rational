Gather enough animal for a Disguise Self and Greater Teleport.

Teleport into the right room some far away hospital and start flaying newborn babies to death. Every few minutes, before anyone can react in any meaningful way, you Greater Teleport to a different hospital in a different part of the world. This gives you effectively unlimited death energy, for a few hours. You probably want to cast Shapechange early on to make the killing quick, cheap, reliable, and untraceable. Putting up Foresight and Time Stop might also be a good idea for the fort things to do.

Mostly, you'll be spamming wish, but also useful is Polymorph Any Object, and it's worth experimenting with Trap the Soul, creating undead, Simulacrum, Awaken, etc. The goal here is basically to cheese your way into soul-powered AI. If nothing else, you can resurrect a bunch of dead scientists and give them and the most important alive ones +5 to Int and Wis using Wishes.
