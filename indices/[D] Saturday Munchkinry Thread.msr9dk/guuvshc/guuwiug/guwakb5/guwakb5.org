The most convenient way to cast would be to just live within a block of a major hospital or other source of death. Even with the distance and no-direct-involvement penalties it still works out to ~250 worm-equivalents per person, so the lower level spells should be within your reach just by being nearby for a few hours. For the higher level stuff, you'd probably want to earn money from casting lesser restoration to cure paralyzed/blind/deaf/diseased people (especially if you can get rich clients that would be willing to pay a significant amount to have their incurable ailments cured. Alternately, just use Fabricate to make diamonds from coal or something.

After getting some money together that way, you would want to set up a way to cast higher level spells. The two main routes would be 1) a wormarium, as with a couple hundred thousand dollars you could easily setup a constant stream of maggots or other small creatures that would be constantly living and dying (giving a decent passive income) or which could be killed on demand (for casting big spells), or 2) generously pay an assistant, who you will give a mask of 100% nitrogen to breathe, causing their painless death. Right after they die, cast revivify on them, the use the remaining energy to cast whatever it was you wanted to cast. If more worm-deaths are needed, just leave the mask on until they die again to save up until you have enough. Assuming a rate of 1 death per minute, this gets you everything short of 9th level healing spells (which run afoul of the 1 hour period of holding deaths in store). If you're willing to get messy, you could actively kill them (say with a knife) and cast revivify immediately to shorten the cycle as much as possible. You should be able to do a combo kill-revivify within 7 seconds (revivify only gives them 1 hp after all), bringing even 9th level healing spells (especially True Resurrection) within your reach.
