I'll take the role of the villain.

The goal is to take over the world (because why not?). Making eye contact and giving verbal commands to every single human is impossible with 8 billion humans as even if every human lined up to be controlled, you'd die of old age before even getting close to your goal (didn't do the math but it's quite obvious). So what does it mean to take over the world? It means to control all the influential people in the world and have them do your bidding. Presidents, parliamentarians, high court judges, the obscenely wealthy, etc. So, goal defined.

Your adversaries are obviously everyone else in the world. If they knew of you and your powers, they'd resist and try to take you down. So your greatest strength is anonymity.

And what does it mean to control someone? Currently the power is to give an order that cannot be refused. Just make a persistent broad slavery/loyalty order. Something like, "I command you to be absolutely loyal to me."

At this point, I don't really see how world conquest is hard to accomplish. Control someone to meet someone to control them and meet someone... to meet the leader/rich person/whoever. Once you have one influential person under your control, you're able to meet all the rich and influential people. e.g. You could control people on the street to accumulate money to set up a meet-and-greet with any rich person (rich people do public speaking for fees, which you can pay) and then you're in. Once you control a rich person you can meet and control every other rich person plus political leaders who meet-and-greet their top donors.

Rich people do have body guards and security teams, but they'll trust each other enough that a private meet-and-greet at a controlled individual's personal home would be possible. All you need to do is to be careful of listening devices which could pick up your commands which would unmask your anonymity. So, have the controlled rich person do sweeps for listening devices and only go for the control when it's secure.
