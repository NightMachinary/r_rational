You are a rationalist, and you are calibrating your predictions. You notice something odd. You are consistently underconfident on 50% predictions.

That is, if you give something a 50% chance, it actually happens 60% of the time. Saying 'this coin flip will be heads' or 'this coin flip will be tails', you are mysteriously right 60% of the time.

It doesn't work on things you are more confident about (90% doesn't go to 95%, for example, when trying to predict a number that won't come up on a ten-sided die).

If you try to reverse your own predictions at random, it doesn't make the effect go away--you end up reversing more predictions that would have been wrong, keeping the total accuracy at 60%.

However, if you flip a coin to decide which predictions to reverse, the predictions go back to 50%. This leads you to think you have mild clairvoyance, rather than the ability to directly influence outcomes.

How can you use this? (Bonus points if you think of a way that doesn't involve the stock market.) (Extra bonus points if you can think of a way to generate winning lottery numbers.)
