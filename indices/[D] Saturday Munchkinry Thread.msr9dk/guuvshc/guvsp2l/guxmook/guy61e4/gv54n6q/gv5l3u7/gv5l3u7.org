These sort of experiments are exactly what I wanted.

I like the multiverse reasoning. I got 50% for the majority matching your prediction, however. Do you mind explaining how you get 52%?

  Suppose I guess the next 100 bits my assistant will write down, then tell my assistant to copy that sequence, flipping a random 40% of bits

Even without powers you are 60% correct. I like the opportunity for the power to step in and communicate. However, I should add that I imagined that if you make a prediction and then deliberately affect the result, your power doesn't work. You'll get the result you constructed, not the result you predicted.

Brilliant. Limited improvement, immediate gains.

  Look at all but the first. If ~60% of the 100 guesses are right, I can deduce what the first coin shows

I think you should try hard mode: What if you can only use the power once per day, on something that will happen that day? Unfortunately, hard mode weakens the power significantly.
