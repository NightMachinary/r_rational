  For stuff that can fluctuate a lot or have weird price discrimination, like say diamonds, you can buy the quantity required at its most expensive for the least expensive price you can find to minimize cost

How far can we push this? I found 25 carat bags of industrial diamond powder for under $15. A single carat diamond with good quality and cut can easily run in the thousands of dollars. Can this be substituted freely?
