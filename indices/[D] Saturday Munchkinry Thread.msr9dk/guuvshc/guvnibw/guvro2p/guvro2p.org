Oh the meta magic feat thing was a mistake, fixed now.

Giant worms should count like cows... but even if the counted like pigs the cost of enlarging the worm isn't worth the cost of the spell I think? It is a 4th level non-necromancy spell so it costs 4^{4*16=4096,} which if you kill yourself with a knife and get around the value of a pig out of it (its bigger than a pig but dumber than a pig) is below break even. If you find a splatbook or invent a spell with a necromancy themed version of enlarge vermin (maybe enlarge a carrion-eating vermin) then it is cleanly above break even by a factor of 4-8 (depending on exactly how smart giant worms are, it costs 256 and you can make between 512 and 2048 depending on how smart and big the worms are).

I am not sure wall of iron breaks even...a wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels (with an 11th level caster... lets round that to 2.4 inches, 1/5 ft). 11th level caster/5ft/5ft/1/5ft=55 cubic ft. Google tells me Iron costs $.04 per pound and 55cubic ft will be around 27,000 pounds ([[https://www.aqua-calc.com/calculate/volume-to-weight]]) to get us $1,080 per casting. Maybe if you make the iron on site in a specialty applications that needs in a shape you can make you can get a much better price for the iron? Wall of iron is a 6th level non-necromancy spell 4^{6}/16=65,536. Maybe with spell invention you could get pitted, rusty necromancy themed iron (with a casting cost of 4096) but then people would pay less for it? Even so I don't think it actually pays for itself in livestock or worms? Composting worms are surprisingly expensive on Amazon... 100-250 runs around $20 and $40. Mealworms/wax worms for pet food are cheaper, around $16 for 250. Maybe if you breed your own you could do cheaper? So let's say so using the cheapest kinds of worms and inventing some non-SRD necromancy variant wall of iron you could make around 4 times your money back... with standard wall of iron and more expensive worms you are actually losing money by a factor of 2-4.
