From the perspective of a government-type institution, the power is well within the realm of being counterable. You can have all sensitive personnel wear goggles that show a camera feed rather than a direct view of the world, preventing eye contact. Then, just send a military team (or a drone strike) to kill the villain. If you are aware of their existence but not who they are then it just becomes a waiting game. Because they can only use their power in-person, they should become noticeable long before they become beyond the level of power that can be disposed of by a military team / drone strike / nuke.
