This power isn't actually all that good...

First, the eye contact issue. Human vision isn't good enough to maintain eye contact at more than ten meters and since the villain can only maintain eye contact with one person at a time, they become unable to command entire crowds. As I interpret it, the villain would need to give orders while maintaining eye contact, meaning that this would only realistically work in a one-on-one scenario.

Second, the information-density issue. Complex orders can take a long time to speak aloud. Even if the villain is speed-talking auctioneer style, this puts a hard cap on the amount of people they can affect per day. Alternatives, such as ordering people to read prepared instructions and obey them can still backfire and involves a lot of prep work.

Third, uncooperative victims. This power does not change people's ethics, morals, psyche, or etc. It simply imposes orders, and while they could order someone to kill their family, the villain can't order people to enjoy it (or they could, but people would be unable to comply because people who don't have superhuman zen self-mastery and can't simply force themselves to like or dislike something). This means that controlling people would be akin to classical demon-summoning where the villain would need to read long legal contracts to his victims.

For example, say the villain corners a clever police officer and orders them to "shoot your partner" whereupon the officer simply shoots the villain until they're dead. Maybe the compulsion fades after death, but even if it doesn't, the order is so wildly ambiguous that it's basically completely ineffectual. Some off-the-top-of-my-head examples:

- Since the order never included a "when", the victim simply makes concrete plans to shoot them later instead of now
- Since the order never specifies exactly who, the victim could interpret "partner" as their spouse at home, buying them time
- Since the order never specifies with what, the victim could simply shoot their partner with a rubber band and fulfill the order

Now, to counter this, the villain could give a more complex order like, "Immediately shoot your partner, John Doe, with your 9mm sidearm." Even this still has loopholes though. For example, shoot doesn't mean lethal, and the victim could shoot his partner in the foot and then gun down the villain. This loop-hole hunt can go on ad-infinitum, and would make ordering people who have at least a little cleverness basically useless without extensive legal-document like compulsions. Essentially, to fully convert someone, they'd need to sit down with them and read some beefy legal contracts to them to minimize loopholes which would take a long time. EVEN IF the villain simply orders someone to read this contract and follow all the orders inside, this doesn't mean that they can't forget what they read because those orders aren't magically enforced.
