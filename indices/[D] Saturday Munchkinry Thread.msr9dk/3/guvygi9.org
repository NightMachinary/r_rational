Let's go against rules again and try something broken.

*/absolute control over every living human./*

So, lets say, that one person in the world, let's call him villain, (you don't know who, but preferrably someone slightly evil or greedy) gains an absolute control over every living human defined as ability *to give undeniable orders* (but only with *eye contact,* so not cameras) *to every person without any other limits*. Every person under orders starts to feel very strong urge to fullfil the wishes of villain, its basically the strongest urge they have, so they can do everything for villain, including killing their own family, etc. Of course, it does not affect their intelligence level, strenght, etc, so villain can't order them to create super nuclear reactor, etc...

(of course, language barrier etc still stands)

Your mission is to somehow find and stop the villain, because in the long term he will obiously become a threat to humanity and freedom. You can try using any means for that, cooperating with other people, etc, but *all must be done within the rational bounds of our current Earth universe*. So you have to do all the convincing that something bad is happening, etc.

Villain is not aware of your actions.

Reverse scenario: you are the Villain/protagonist with this power, how can you use it?
