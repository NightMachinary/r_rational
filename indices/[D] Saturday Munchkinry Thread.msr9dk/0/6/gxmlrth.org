This is towards the goal of utilising this power in religion; Start a charity with the goal of feeding or hydrating civilians of a poor country who are dying of thirst or starvation and lace that food or water with aphrodisiacs to increase the population and death rate. Use healing spells to heal adults who are fatally injured or dying to develop a cult-like following.

It's not specific about the spells used, just a general strategy to go towards the religion goal. A very brutal strategy but it's a munchkin about being a necromancer so I guess brutality can't be avoided.
