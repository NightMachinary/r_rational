*Death Magic*

For the sake of simplicity, I'll reference the d20srd spells ([[https://www.d20srd.org/indexes/spellLists.htm]]) as a general category, with the labels of spells (i.e. necromancy or healing) used to indicate how much death energy they cost. You can also use pathfinder spells and spells from other source books as long as they aren't too OP.

Additional material costs of spells that cost over 10 GP you have to make/find and use the actual materials required, you can ignore material costs smaller than this at a rate of 4 worm deaths per GP of material cost. Since materials are indicated by cost and not by quantity, approximate material value as $12 dollars in cost per GP. For stuff that can fluctuate a lot or have weird price discrimination, like say diamonds, you can buy the quantity required at its most expensive for the least expensive price you can find to minimize cost.

You can cast death themed spells fueled by the deaths of animals. A necromancy Cantrip (level 0 spell) costs about the death of a single worm to fuel. A necromancy level 1 spell takes the deaths of 4 worms to fuel. Each level of spell up from that takes 4 times more death. So a level 3 necromancy spell takes 64 worms deaths, a level 5 spell takes 1024 worm deaths, a level 7 spell takes 16,384 worm deaths and a level 9 spell takes 262,144 worm deaths.

Spells with the "healing" label cost 256 times to cast. I.e. cure light wounds costs 1024 worm deaths. Non-healing Non-necromancy spells have a casting cost of only 16 times more death, i.e. a non-necromancy level 1 spell costs 64 worm deaths. So casting the 5th level Cleric Spell raise dead costs 262,144 worm deaths, and a diamond value of around $60,000 worth of diamonds (but you can save on this by getting synthetic diamonds that are cheaper but would be worth $60,000 if they could be sold/priced as natural diamonds). Note that you can achieve the effects of raise dead using limited wish but limited wish is level 7, so the death costs come out about even.

You can apply [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#metamagicFeats][Meta-Magic Feats]] to your spells, with each feat applied raising the spell level as indicated by the feat text. You are allowed to raise spells levels past 9th level. For caster level... you can treat it as though you had the minimum required caster level to cast the spell if you were a druid/cleric or wizard (whatever caster level is lowest). Alternatively, you can pay 2^(.75*Caster Level) in additional worm death costs to cast as if your Caster level was that level (so 10th caster level costs 181 worm deaths, 20th caster level costs 32768 worm deaths). For Hit Dice and saves... the average person has around 5-7 HD worth of hit points and saves as if they were somewhere between 5-7th level. So a cure light wounds cures a person about 1/6 worth of their total capacity for injuries.

The deaths of dumb small animals, like chickens, are worth around 64 worms deaths (mice would be worth 32 worms deaths). Thee death of large dumb animals like a cow is worth around 256 worm deaths. The deaths of smarter animals like dogs or pigs is worth around 1024 worm deaths (rates would be worth around 128 worm deaths). The death of a person is worth around around 262144 worm deaths. *Animals and magical things temporarily summoned by spells are not worth any deaths when "killed", because they don't properly die but are rather sent back to the plane there were drawn from!*

You don't have to directly cause the deaths for them to count, but having a close causal relationship counts for more. Deaths directly caused by you (i.e. you cut the worm or the throat yourself) are worth 2 times as much. Deaths indirectly caused by you (i.e. you pushed the button on a machine or had an assistant stab the knife) are worth the baseline amount. Death you were near and indirectly contributed to are worth 1/16 (i.e. euthanizing someone on the brink of death from disease, a pig dying of sickness because you didn't take care of it properly, a worm dying of overcrowding in your wormarimum, an animal being slaughtered in a factory farm you own). Deaths you are merely near are only worth 1/256 (i.e. sneaking around a hospital and standing by dying people). Drawn out, especially painful deaths are worth 2x. Especially peaceful/painless deaths (a person passing away in their sleep, a mouse dying instantly of breathing a poisonous gases designed for euthanasia, a chicken kill cleanly with a single chop) are only worth around 1/2-1/4 (depending on how painless it is). Being within line of sight is the baseline collection rate, within a city block but not line of sight is worth only 1/4, within a mile is worth only 1/64. You can transfer energy to other necromancers at about an efficiency of 1/2 with direct touch contact and 1/4 for line-of-sight.

After absorbing the death energy, there is a non-linear decay rate depending on how much you are holding. You can hold onto 256 worm deaths worth of energy basically indefinitely, 257-512 worm deaths "decays" to 256 worm deaths in about a month, 513-1024 decays to 512 in about a week, 1023-4096 decays to 1024 in about a day, 4097-65,552 decays to 4096 in about an hour, above 65,552 always decays to 65,552 in about 6 minutes unless you are actively in the process of casting a spell or actively collecting energy in which case you can hold onto it for about an hour before it starts to decay.

So... Munchkinry in the case were:

- Only you have this ability
- You can pass on this ability with the cost of a level 5 spell and other people can in turn pass on this ability
- Everyone gets this ability

Death energy is divided between people that would claim it at time of death, no double counting death energy.

Munchkinry optimization:

- Any major exploits/loopholes I didn't close?
- Best way to leverage this into a religion in the case were you are the only one with this ability?
- Best animal/collection method in terms of cost efficiency? (Maybe necromancers will pay factory slaughterhouses to let them press the button for example)
- What spells are most worth it in terms death costs? What spells are barely break even?
- Best way to "game" material costs (for instance buying stuff that is super expensive at one time of year and cheap another or that has very extreme price discrimination)?
