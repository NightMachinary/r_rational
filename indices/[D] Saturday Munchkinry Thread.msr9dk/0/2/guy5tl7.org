You can be the world's most /incredible/ doctor.

No-one /ever/ dies on your operating table (or, at least, not for long). You do keep a pet python, in a suitably secured terrarium, and you do feed it mice yourself - perhaps a little eccentric, but not really worth commenting on. It's really little more than a conversation piece. And - well, it is a hospital. People do die in it (though less so than in other hospitals, because you're there). Other people, and surprisingly many of them, recover from injuries or diseases that are... /surprisingly/ severe. (One fellow, who had been in a car accident, actually woke up with all the fingers on his left hand, which certainly surprised the /patient/ because he'd been missing one of those fingers before the accident...)
