Personally I feel Wonder Woman is a better fit character-wise then Batman for a third character between Lex and GL, but I guess she does demand more extensive explanation and/or the addition of magic.\\
For Part 5...how about the primary goals of the Corps is to prevent the rise of Galaxy-spanning threats like strong A.I., and were actively working to contain Brainiac? Brainiac meanwhile works to propagate itself, or even to help the Kryptonians as originally intended.\\
To match up with the re-imagining of kryptonite as FTL-enabling fuel, the Green Lanterns use it as the primary component of their equipment, explaining their FTL capability, high-density energy storage and bright green colour-scheme. Brainiac could have reverse-engineered it's FTL applications from observation of the Corps, then surreptitiously passed that knowledge along, allowing speeds the Lanterns couldn't simply outrun and blow up.\\
Brainiac would edit in various flaws after the fact in the belief that the discovery of the Lanterns would somehow cripple it's plans, whatever those plans are decided to be.\\
Most of this is kind of irrelevant to the actual story, but I think kryptonite-as-Lantern-material would be a good fit, tying the world together and giving Lex additional reasons to be paranoid.
