Would it be safe to assume that you've already read the DCU fanfic "Inviolate", at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate]] (podcast version at [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2658290?show_comments=true]] ), and the version of the Green Lantern Corps presented therein? (Non-spoiler: I believe it predates DC's expounding upon the full emotional spectrum, which may affect how useful it would be to you.)
