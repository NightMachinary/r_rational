That's actually a pretty good idea. The "willpower" thing is basically religious propaganda. The Guardians actually get all the energy from the lanterns themselves. When the ring says it's low on power, it's actually filled up off of solar power, thermal energy, and dozens of other sources. It deposits half of what it has to the central battery on Oa and keeps the rest.
