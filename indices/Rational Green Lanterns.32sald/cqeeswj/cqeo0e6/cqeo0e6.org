I'm familiar with Blackest Night. I haven't read it, but I've read numerous summaries. The question is how rationally "willpower", a transcendental concept of mind that can only physically be mapped to certain electrical configurations in the brain that would differ vastly from person to person, let alone species to species, can relate so directly to this one huge energy battery in this one place in all the universe. The easiest explanation involves the existence of a "soul" that every sentient species managed to evolve to harness. But that brings up its own separate issues to handle.
