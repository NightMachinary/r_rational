I think Superman says that his powers work on a similar principle to kryptonite radiation, so it interferes with his biotech?

It would provide an alternative explanation for the sudden failures all their colony ships experienced. The GL Corps have been blowing them up then broadcasting back a warning about the dangerous A.I. Brainiac, which gets filtered out by Brainiac. Heh, for all the Kryptonians knew, Brainiac was engaged in full-scale war with the Corps. Krypton and Brainiac could even be blown up BY the Corps when they realize the quarantine is no longer viable.\\
Containment and restriction of self-propagating threats is also in line with the canon Corps, i.e. the Agent Orange situation.

Then you have Brainiac going into panic mode when it realizes there's a GL on the same planet as it who knows about Superman, and that the Corps could at any moment put two and two together regarding Superman's origins as the one that got away.\\
Its self-interested warnings to Lex (the truth that going after a GL could attract the Corps' attention or some convincing lie) would be a good reason for Luthor not to simply crush GL, like the last threatening alien agent he encountered.
