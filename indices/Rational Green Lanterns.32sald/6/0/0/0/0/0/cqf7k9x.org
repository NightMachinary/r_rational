I considered WW too. If I can work her in in a way that makes sense, I'll do it. But she's tertiary priority. I like Batman because he's a foil for Lex, as a fellow super-rich-super-antihero type character. Really Green Lantern is secondary too. The primary priorities to work in for me are Bruce and Brainiac.

I read a Justice League vs Avengers fic at one point where Hulk radiation was revealed to be an almost identical frequency to Kryptonite radiation, thus functionally taking Superman out of the fight for the whole first round and most of the second. GLs using K is similar in that it helps level the playing field. Maybe Kryptonite doesn't have anything to do with Krypton at all. It's just the fuel for GLs, that just so happens to be harmful to Kryptonian biotech. That's how the GLs were able to hold off Brainiac for so long. Comes with some Nightmare-in-Hindsight for Clark's ship containing a Brainiac fragment, which presumably was the first breach of lantern-enforced AI quarantine of Krypton and surrounding systems.
