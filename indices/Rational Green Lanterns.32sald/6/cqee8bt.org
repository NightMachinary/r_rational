Part 0: I'm guessing the plan is to use Alan Scott and set the story in 1940?

Part 1:\\
There's a series of artificial satellites located close to the sun that serve as primary data storage, FTL communications relay, civilization monitor, battery pack, super-computer and fabricator. These replicate themselves in order to seed to other star systems not yet part of the GL FTL network and also feed a continuous stream of energy back to the Central Power Battery.\\
Individual Power Batteries serve as power and data relays between these and any Rings in the Battery's immediate vicinity. The FTL connections between the satellites are what allow GLs to travel between the stars, while their primary power source is the local sun, it's energy converted and stored by the satellites.\\
This entire system is overseen by the AI "Ion" (Entity-seeking-stability-through-direct-bond or some such "closest match" translation for it's name) which is extremely limited in it's ability to take direct action (the Guardians have a well-justified fear of proactive AI and have taken steps to ensure the system is only used by "real" lifeforms). It has a tiny selection of actions it is allowed to undertake of it's own volition, including but not limited to: Establishing contact with a potential recruit, expanding the Corps' reach, deciding on and implementing sanctions against rogue Corpsmen and presenting the Guardians in the best light. For all other actions it requires the conscious direction and instruction of an authorized Green Lantern, hence the Willpower aspect. edit: Basically the system AlexanderWales describes.\\
While new Rings come pre-installed with basic combat uses and Ion itself can provide self-augmentation when in the vicinity of a Power Battery, new projections and implementations of the Ring have to be designed and specified by a given GL, then transmitted to their local satellites to design and implement the capability in the same GL's Ring. There is a database storing all such GL designs, but access requires both visiting Oa and having the Guardians judge you trustworthy. Even then "dangerous" designs are restricted or outright banned.\\
The rings themselves are actually tightly-wrapped masses of filaments that extend and shape themselves when in active use. They also extend into their hosts body in order to provide maximum protection, repair and reinforcement. Along with many of the Ring's features, this requires a fully self-aware host to specifically consent to before it can be implemented.

Part 2:\\
I honestly don't know what form the Oan civilization will take. But I do believe that knowledge of them in story should be mostly limited to the quirks and biases of the Lantern system, and Ion's perceived eccentricities. As it was in Metropolitan Man, I feel the canon beyond the essentials needed to match up with the original works aren't too important and are fair game for reimagining.\\
I have some ideas for the other parts that I'll look into writing up later.

Martians:\\
Why can't they be from Mars?\\
Lex is experimenting with space travel, which seems the perfect opportunity to bring the Martians in earlier then they otherwise would have appeared in canon, and right in time for WWII (I think the Green martians would have some interesting reactions to the Aryan philosophy). Couple that with the Green Lantern database likely coming with dire warnings from the last time the Martians had to be dealt with...
