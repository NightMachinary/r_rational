hardlight constructs are a common sci-fi staple. Halo, Portal, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. I figured it was close enough to the science we know that it would be mostly acceptable for Sufficiently Advanced Aliens.

But yes, I definitely think the different "frequencies" of the spectrum would have different attributes. The examples you gave actually match the given emotional spectrum very well, with green being near the center, and red and violet being on opposite ends from each other. Perhaps the redscale frequencies generate radiation easier, while the bluescale is more solid and controlled.

As far as Part 3 is concerned, I think if they were alerted they would probably attempt to prevent any internal affairs that may result in planetary destruction. WW2 wouldn't have gotten a second glance from them, but there likely would have been a lantern on Krypton trying to save their entire culture from being wiped out.
