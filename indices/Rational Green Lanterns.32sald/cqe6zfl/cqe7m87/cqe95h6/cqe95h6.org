You should really read With This Ring, it addresses a lot of your points. The protagonist deals with the rational implications of magic, souls, actual fully evident Gods etc. How does one act when they know the afterlife is a real tangible place?

I don't know how to use spoilers on a phone so I'll refrain from say I g anything but your point about souls is especially relevant in the story.

I think you should keep as much of the DC mythos as much as possible. Otherwise why not just write an original fic instead of fanfiction. Half the fun with the story is having the rational protagonist deal with the crazy philosophical of the world he's in haha.
