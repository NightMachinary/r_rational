Nobody's forcing you to explain it if you don't want to. HPMoR never explained where magic came from or how it worked. ("Atlanteans did it" doesn't count, that's just explaining magic by reference to magic.) Accept it and move on.

Of course, you could explain it by reference to souls, but there have been entire books dedicated to unravelling the full implications of that one. And it still smacks of using magic to explain magic.
