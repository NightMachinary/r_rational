Remember that the universe you write about does not have to follow anything like the rules that our universe does.

I think a good example of this is the Discworld, particularly the witches sub-series. Their world has "narrativium" and so runs on the rules of storybook tropes: belief makes gods stronger, old ladies who live alone in the forest start thinking about eating young children and if you have a "million-to-one chance" it's practically guaranteed to happen. Within this world, following Bayes' theorem would clearly be a mistake and non-rational. On the other hand trying to twist the narrative to suit you would be rational (so long as you don't try too hard, so that it can't ironically backfire).

In the Green Lantern/DC universe dualism is literally true, some manner of gods exist and world-breaking invention is much easier than it is on our Earth. Depending on how far you want to push the boundaries you can: just accept these things as true and try not to exploit them too hard (don't go outside the known, /With This Ring/ mostly does this), come up with your own "outside context" explanation which you may or may not reveal (characters are in a sim, meta-gods exist and punish those who question too much, etc.), you can make discovering more about the universe just as hard as our world (HPMOR sorta did this), or you could go for the "world runs on superhero tropes" as a literal truth.

Just because you are making a "Rational" or "Rationalist" story does not mean that *Science* from our world works in the story world.
