We're not really /assuming/ souls, they /explicitly exist/ in DC. You can measure the strength of someone's soul with a device, and get a number of units, in the same way you would measure someone's height. I'm not trying to tell you how to write your fic, I'm telling you aspects of the source material you might use. With these being the laws of physics, how does your protagonist investigate, discover, and use them?
