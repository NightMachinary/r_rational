True, but I'll have to invent new explanations regardless since very little explanation is ever given in depth with the comic canon. That's what I'm trying to do, is better explain things. If that requires explaining what's there or changing it to something more easily explainable, I haven't determined yet, but I'd prefer the first if at all possible.
