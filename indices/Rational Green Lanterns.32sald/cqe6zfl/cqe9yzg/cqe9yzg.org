I strongly agree with both the recommendation and the prescription to not abandon emotional energy. Rationalism and the scientific method can flourish in any universe where there is causality and repeatability - and exploring the DC comics universe from a scientific min-maxxer perspective is perfectly valid; the more interesting to read result in noting that dualism isn't a thing in our universe but it is in DC comics, is not to have DC comics become purely materialistic and then spend forever exploring the resulting setting which only barely resembles DC comics, but instead to have the protagonist learn to apply their rationality to a universe different from what they imagined it was - to recalibrate themselves appropriately.

By the time you scrap enough of the DC universe that you are purely materialistic, you've scrapped enough of the good parts of the setting that you might as well just make a new setting to write fiction in if that's what you want to do.

I recommend reading With This Ring. Note the author updates daily (around 12 midnight to 4 in the morning if you live in the US) and has done so very reliably for a long time now.

Instead of removing a lot of the most interesting parts of Green Lantern cosmology... *you can just totally write Lensman fanfic*. There's no point in taking the Green Lantern world and spending oodles of time rewriting it by scrapping things into the Lensman world, when the Lensmen already do everything you want and you can just write in their world instead.
