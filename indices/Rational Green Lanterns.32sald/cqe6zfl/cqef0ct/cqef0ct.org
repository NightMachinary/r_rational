Heh. Been reading that one for a while. Very nice fic. Superman does seem to be portrayed as a bit distant compared to the other Leaguers, though; I'm wondering if it's purely so the author can justify Kon's drama - and if so, why? Just so Paul can be pushed away from Kal as much as he's drawn to Luthor's desire to change the world?
