You can keep a lot of the psychic/emotional aspects of the rings if you assume that the ring has some sort of mind-reading capability. This "only" requires that the ring be some form of weak AI that can read emotional states. That in turn would imply that the ring has been deliberately hampered by some entity for some purpose - likely political or philosophical - which you can work into your imagining of the society of Oa. If you thought that willpower was the most important defining feature of an entity, you might think that it was smart to restrict their ability to control this superweapon based on their willpower, much in the same way that a Christian might think it was smart to make the use of nuclear weapons dependent on the Christianity of the user. (This might also imply that if things got really dire, the gloves would come off and the rings would unlock their full power.)

/Edit:/ Imagine a race of people that really cares about *flangum*. Flangum is the most important personal attribute that a person can have. In the old days, it wasn't possible to directly measure a person's flangum, you had to judge it by how they acted and what they said. Flagnum was the underlying factor in pretty much all of the decisions that these people made. If you had success in life, this was taken as proof of flangum. If you suffered losses, this was proof of a lack of flangum. Just as soon as it was possible, flangum sensors were built, to give an objective measure to this previously nebulous concept. It caused a revolution in their society - the old system of government was replaced by the Flangumnate. The economy was reorganized so that those with more flangum had better access to resources (since it was quietly acknowledged that life did not always perfectly reward those with flangum). Flangum had always been an underpinning of their society, and as their technology grew better, higher levels of power were restricted to those people who were more flangumnic than their peers. It had sometimes been said by sufficiently cynical people that "might makes flangum", but now it was the other way around - "flangum makes might". The Flangumnate's lawmen were all highly flangumnic, because to have power be unrelated to flangum would have been unconscionable.

And for any other society in the galaxy, this would have been a death knell. Stronger, more powerful civilizations would have muscled in without these ridiculous restrictions in place. But this race of people happened to be the first civilization that didn't implode or wither on the vine, and they grew in power enough to outpace the rivals that eventually cropped up, even with all the limitations that a flangum based approach implies. This race was particularly welcoming to sufficiently flangumnic individuals, no matter what their race was. Flangum was the important thing.
