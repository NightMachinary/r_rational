That's why your ring needs to have some beefy AI inside it to make that determination. Canonically, the Green Lantern Corps has a bunch of members that don't even /have/ brains. All the ring needs to do is have an advanced system inside it that can concretely model what "willpower" or some other emotion/attribute is, and then give it the ability to make new ad hoc mappings for any given sentient organism. This is a challenge, but it's far from insurmountable.
