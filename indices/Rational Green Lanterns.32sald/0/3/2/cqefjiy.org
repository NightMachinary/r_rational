  It seemingly brings energy into being from nothing, which violates a lot of scientific principles.

It /actually/ brings energy into being from nothing, which violates no /scientific/ principles, and simply /happens to not be/ how things work in /our/ universe because our /physical laws/ are different from theirs, and their universe /isn't closed/ so the laws of thermodynamics can go screw themselves quietly in the corner. If you did science in /their/ universe, you would find that exotic forms of energy and exotic particles /exist/ rather than don't, and when you further experiment on them you'll find them /generating exotic energy from nothing/.
