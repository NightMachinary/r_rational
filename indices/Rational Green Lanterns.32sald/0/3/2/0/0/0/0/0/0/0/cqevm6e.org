Well we can't keep everything from the source and maintain rationality. The question is what we decide to prioritize. I was trying to maintain sci-fi status, since Metropolitan Man did pretty well in that regard. And while souls can fit a sci-fi premise, it's a lot more difficult to make work. But I suppose it might be worth it, to maintain the emotional spectrum mythos.
