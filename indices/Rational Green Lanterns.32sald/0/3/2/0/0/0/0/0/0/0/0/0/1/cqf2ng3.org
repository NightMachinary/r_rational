If it helps, AlexanderWales never spells out how Superman's powers works, besides giving a believable reason for why kryptonite is bad for him.\\
He also maintains the canon of the core story (Lex is rich and adversarial, Superman has all his powers, showed up as a baby in a spaceship, grew up a human) but changes the parts that aren't important/rational (Lex is actually intelligent, Superman is an artificial lifeform with kryptonians being starfish aliens, kryptonite arrived on Earth in his spaceship not by supernova-propelled scattering.)\\
I'd suggest maintaining Metropolitan Man's approach rather then focusing on keeping with DC canon.\\
Willpower-as-energy-source can go with almost no changes from canon.\\
There's decades of material to work with already without ever bringing the rest of the emotional spectrum into the story.
