But the special thing about perpetual motion is that it would generate energy from nothing, which the brain doesn't do. We get energy from food, and air. Aliens may get their energy from the sun or from Oobleck but the principle remains the same. You can program a computer to read its own programming. That won't give it the metaphysical quality of willpower. And besides, in this universe we're discussing energy from nothing is commonplace, at the quantum level if no higher. So perpetual motion wouldn't even be that special either.
