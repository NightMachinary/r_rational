There are a few problems with the emotional spectrum. It seemingly brings energy into being from nothing, which violates a lot of scientific principles. It also implies some special metaphysical quality that the mind of every single intelligent species would somehow have in common. The easiest word I can find to describe the concept is "soul". I agree that it would be better to keep as much mythos as possible. But confirming the existence of the soul comes with a lot of philosophical issues that would have to be addressed in detail. That's why I opted to remove the psychic aspect of lantern culture. But maybe you're right, and the universe is already different enough.
