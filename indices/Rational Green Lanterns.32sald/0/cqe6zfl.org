Firstly, see [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][With This Ring]], a self-insert fic involving an orange lantern. Mostly rational; the main character is particularly rational, and gets a lot of stuff done as a result, but the rest of the universe is basically the canon DC-verse.

Secondly, I'd be inclined to suggest assuming that as many of the comic's conceits are in fact true as is possible. For instance, the emotional spectrum; sure, it's /weird/, but it's also a core part of the existence of lanterns, so if you get rid of it, you're not really telling a Rationalist Green Lantern story, you're telling a story about Sufficiently Advanced Aliens from Oa. This is the DC-verse, it includes beings like Kryptonians, the laws of physics are different. Assume the emotional spectrum is some kind of psionic energy, and that that's actually a valid way to generate Real Ultimate Power, and move forward from that, instead of trying to handwave it away.
