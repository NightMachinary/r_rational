  In comics, the lanterns run on the collective willpower of every living being in the universe. Rationally all that power has to come from somewhere.

In the comics, physics are different, and the collective willpower of every living being in the universe is actually a form of energy. Motile beings - and especially cognitive beings, generate the green "light" (it's not really light, but emotional energy, which is an actual thing in their physics) of will by strongly committing to a course of action, especially in the face of adversity. The first ever being to exhibit will was some amoebaish fish thing that moved actively rather than passively.

  In comics, the rings can generate hardlight constructs, project harmful radiation, and even have built-in FTL capability. Rationally you can probably only fit so much tech around one finger.
#+end_quote

The comics have different rules and technologies. Many of the races that were first in the universe have the advantage of knowing the complete physics, including things humans would call psionics, magic, supertech, and how they all unify. A sufficiently advanced anything is indistinguishable from each other.

  How do the other colors of energy differ?

They derive from different not-necessarily-competing sources in the emotional spectrum.

If you're going to be serious about this, you need to read the Blackest Night saga at least. :)
