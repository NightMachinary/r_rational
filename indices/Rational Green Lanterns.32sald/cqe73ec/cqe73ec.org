Oa might not make entire buildings out of energy, but there are a lot of areas that could be made to only materialise as needed. The main one I can think of is skybridges and lifts between buildings. Plus the general benefits of having what is basically a GL ring keyed to the house's owner.

Sure, you'd expect the cosmic police to have gear that's better than the housewives of Oa. But the houses can be connected directly to the power grid (or Oan equivalent), while the rings have to run on batteries.
