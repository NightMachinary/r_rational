It has to be limited to the Galaxy, for sanity sake. 100 billion star systems is enough, without expanding to the whole frakking edgeless universe. Firstly, I think the GLs should only watch over about a tenth of this space. The rest would either be neutral territory or belong to some other faction, like Krypton or the Red Lanterns. If we say a tenth of those are inhabited, and only a tenth of those are intelligent, that leaves 100 million societies for the Guardians to watch over. Reasonably, a single lantern can only watch over a hundred or so planets. So instead of limiting ourselves to a single lantern per sector, let's say each sector of space has ten lanterns from there, assigned there. That means they could handle probably ten thousand cultures, if working practically as a team. That means you would need about ten thousand sectors as well, and a total of a hundred thousand GLs, not counting Frontier, Homeworld Security, Special Forces, or any other specialized units.

I would think the spectrum would simply be easily mapped to the frequencies of light. Which I guess would make the Black Lanterns technically Ultra-Violet lanterns, though that doesn't roll off the tongue as well.
