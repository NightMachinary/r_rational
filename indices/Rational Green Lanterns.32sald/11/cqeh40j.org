I'll put in another vote for leaving the DCU physics in place. Dualism is perfectly compatible with rationality -- it's just not how /this/ universe works (probably).

Bigger issue: the scale. First, decide whether it's the galaxy or the universe that's divided into 3600 sectors (I strongly endorse the former) and stick with it. Then calculate how many stars that is, pick a fraction of them to have intelligent life, and stick with that. If each lantern winds up with a thousand inhabited planets, then they can visit each of them once a year for 8 hours. That's not enough to take on minor or complex problems. It also doesn't allow any real leisure or friendship. Either take those things seriously or tweak the numbers.

Smaller issue: the colors. Is the mapping of colors to emotions a fundamental principle? Do a lot of species see the same spectrum? If so, why? Alternatively, would a sentient pit viper see a green lantern ring as the shade of near-IR that corresponds to willpower in /their/ subconscious?
