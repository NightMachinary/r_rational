For the colors: it makes sense to do away with the idea that they run on emotions, but if there's 'hard light' clearly you are harnessing some sort of exotic energy or physics unknown to us.

Working with this idea, each color could be using some variant of this exotic energy. Some could be more suited for hard light projection, others can project hard light but it's more fragile/costlier in terms of energy, but have other benefits like better radiation emission or other properties.

For instance, Red constructs can be less solid but abrasive, which more or less coincides with the comics. Sapphire would be much more solid and unable to project radiation (going with the imagery in the comics that their constructs are crystal-like). Green and yellow can be more flexible and versatile.

On Part 3: The restriction of only policing for interactions tha involve more than one planet is very elegant, I think: it goes well with the idea of 'space police', like a world police in a planet wouldn't get into the affairs of each individual country. It's also elegant because the relative amount of GL officers is low compared to the number of inhabited planets, so their field of action needs to be limited. For this same reason, I'd say they don't even act on extinction-level events unless requested.
