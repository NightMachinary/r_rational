Correct me if I'm wrong, but last time I checked WoG had it that Mr LessWrong knew quite a bit more about the truth of how hpmor magic worked than Harry did. I seem to remember something about how magic wasn't actually technological in origin, as HJPEV presumed. So if we're using MoR as a model, as the writer we need to understand at least a bit more about the rings and how they work than any of the characters, which is a good idea anyway in general. If I ever actually do write anything using this, I'm trying my best to steal that "insufficient willpower" quip, though. Because that actually made me laugh out loud.
