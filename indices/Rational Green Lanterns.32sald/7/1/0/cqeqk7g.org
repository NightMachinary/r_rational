Again, we can look to HPMOR for inspiration.

Either A) make something up to fill the gaps in canon (You have to know at least a little bit about what a spell does to cast it / Green rings are more or less interchangeable because they are heavily standardized across the Corps, but Red Corpsmen are encouraged to program their rings with highly personalized violence macros)

or B) give a fake technobabble answer and have the POV character complain about it extensively ("It's magic." "That's not an answer!" / "Insufficient willpower detected" "But what does that /mean/?")
