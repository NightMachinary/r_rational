How I always assumed the rings worked is that most of their actual processing power or mechanisms were stored in subspace and linked to the ring itself.

Of course you can't store every tool even around one finger, but the thing can do FTL and a bunch of other impossible things, taking advantage of nonlocality and pocket dimensions to store most of its mechanisms isn't really that different.

An uncharged ring might only have the ability to hold a small capacitor charge and generate the gateway or connection to its subspace pocket capable of accessing the rest of the mechanism.
