Like many others I like "With This Ring". I think in writing this you would be needlessly trying to reinvent the same wheel. The DC universe is so irrational and unoptimized that writing a Green Lantern Corps rational fic seems too easy by far because Power Rings are so powerful. If you stuck with canon powers and rules, you'd have to work pretty hard not to be unbeatable in fairly short order.

Heck, even a completely normal, powerless individual would soon dominate the DC universe simply by telling all of the heroes and villains that they are using their powers wrong. That's what makes "The Metropolitan Man" so great in my opinion. It would be like the Worm fanfic "Security" except that you don't need future knowledge. You just need to be smart about how powers work, how they interact with one another and how you can munchkin the shit out of them.
