I realized reading this chapter that the Wandering Bard is basically the Grey Witch from Lodoss War Records: an immortal entity, switching bodies as convenient, and busy keeping the world in perpetual turmoil and conflict since the dawn of time, intervening here and there to steer stories of the great heroes and villains so neither really 'win' in the end.
